others\nDo we just started a great bear enterprises that that's what I Want her\nTo a seven stars of the great there it's very exciting state of the art very beautiful\nWhich one do you prefer that we use\nA grape or enterprises my daughter has just been on the Web master Web designer it with very very beautiful and all kinds of new things on their\nSuper what do you run up to lately well then [laughter] that's what we've got a full time right well pretty\nMuch um and getting into the world of pod cast beginning thing was with the e books and other kinds of things that we've sort of been wanting to move into and suddenly now with the state of the art website we're really getting going with that\nYou were with me years ago and when you were first on with me ah our executive producer Lisa line who thinks the world of you says I'm going to give you a special guest teasing mundane astrologer\nRight and I went what what what are you giving me somebody who's mundane for\nIt if it's actually uh I I guess\nIn the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology it'd be a strategy of nations of world leaders thing with like eclipse is new moon is full of major planetary alignment\nIn other words that's kinda the opposite to doing personal horoscope readings although I've I've been doing that\nJust as long um for the word again now people think of mundane kind of just ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results the same mundane astrology and personal horoscope type readings\n[noise] no I mean well you're dealing with the same plan a\nFine line there there's a fine line isn't there\nAgain kind of it's the make or caused them rather than microcosm and so\nPeople who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things are they prefer to look at the big picture of national events current events the way the world is and when I was growing up it's just kind of where I was I read the ... the world book\nUm you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year would come out back in the fifties and sixties still going after a hundred and fifty years actually mostly for sport like baseball growing\nBaseball football and so on so I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course a President Kennedy came into office with the\nWith the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there and I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation and the world probably because of that particular event\nMark tell us exactly what is ... is\nWell what we said before as above so below this goes back to\nAncient Egypt the idea of a a a being called ... or the the thrice great harmonies which is the actual Egyptian Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly that was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and\nMathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know\nI'm of the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy who was also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so\nMuch and I also studied all kinds of things we regarding Atlantis\nOr when I first got in the whole field I got into reincarnation meditation metaphysics lived at the pinpoint community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about retro grade planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just if we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective he Leo\nNothing the planets just keep going the ordinary cycles mercury has an eighty eight day\nForward moving a orbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away\nAnd the astrology we use is what we were called geo centric every so often all the plot of snow this is not the center moon George but all the planets will tend to appear to go in reverse from our vantage point oh it's kind of like\nA this is the perfect metaphor you're at a train station and you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours is going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you end up kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like\nYou know they're kind of ... in your direction but there are like going the other way and it's confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion\nSo what most people have tuned into all over the decades is mercury going in reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth perspective for about three weeks\nAt a time and what's amazing now into that as an Eighteen if you if I went to Google or safari one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde year and then you click on images\nIt's fill George with all kinds of things like stop signs and road signs saying mercury Richard ... don't go here don't go there because people\nAre actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going reverse\nIf you had five different ... would you had five different kinds of reading at any given time\nUm well let me answer it one way if people who really have studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades\nVery intensively if you had say a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same chart of somebody or the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics\nI'd of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and other things over the years because I've been on during the election times and\nOften you know people want to hear a prediction where it's going to go\nHowever astrology really works best in terms of ... as you said and he's studied it or not just psychology and UFOs and ... dollars and everything else but he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I\nUse is called before whatever is born at a moment of time has the qualities of that moment of time it's because time\nShould not be thought of as like I'll meet you at ten o'clock in the morning at such and such a place so that people think of time has kind of a convenient system it's really a power and so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts\nAnd at their first moments that they take their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around in a great circle and they're in different signs of ... and the stroller ... puts it altogether and reads it as a kind of I'm\nAlmost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but ... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\nSolar energy lunar energy and climate or energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above and below so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most ...\nKinda who've been around the horn a long time will come up with a similar result\nArgue psychic too or just in Charlotte I'm Glad you asked that question I okay if I say out to the public my\nMy son is in Pisces which tends to be at least as I understand that sign rather reticent to to be a for instance do walk on the planet earth for Twenty years I'm not somebody who likes\nMarketing and advertising and commercial stuff I'm much more focus that's why the Monday in astrology virtual things and so I'm\nFundamentally um I it is interesting you ask me that because I have been very psychic\nAnd intuitive but I don't broadcast it but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most\nAnd scientifically in in sports or astrological psychic like okay stay with us mark where the break we're going to come back and talk about world events how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the astrologer this website great beer enterprises dot com Martin Lorna\nUm and then October Nineteen Nineteen eighty seven to one day crash I'm not anticipating anything like that at least I'm\nNot at the moment I'm the one thing that is interesting though um is that\nThe the people call this planet or in this era of your your brain is depending on their pronunciation but that plan at the first of the outer planets um which is so powerful when America was born because when a Seventeen eighty one\nWhen the American revolution was one is is the same year that Iran is was cited by sir William Herschel and ironically in bath England\nUm but at any rate that planet has just gone into tourists okay and tourists as the main sign of money in ... New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen\nOf Seventeen Ninety two and so not yet but in the o five years or Iran and spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of\nExtreme change revolution the unconventional soda things coming out of left field shock some surprises Iran us will cross over the sun the solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back\nWhich takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six he get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three and that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers of my field people look at these kind of thing with like a a nation to chart\nA nations are born like people if you can locate the birth time of country cities have charts states of the union have charts but America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it\nNow what am I correct zones\nNow crypto does this this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology it's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred and Ninety four years\nThe ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest planet even actually looked at by people going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were charting believe it or not because they didn't have\nThey looked at by people going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were charting believe it or not because they didn't have a all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just\nAstrologers they were ... they just didn't have the scientific kind of things that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ... but basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water\nTo make a what's happening is since Eighteen forty one every Twenty years\nJupiter and Saturn have been in earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know\nWhat's gonna happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn merged together at the beginning of Aquarius and then for the next like a hundred and eighty years\nAll the Jupiter Saturn are going to be an air sides and the point here is that crypto currency is are more connected to the air element of things that are more a serial that are more online that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with some the Eighteen forties of the banking world\nThe corporate world and all that so that we were ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes yeah I guess you could say that's a\nVery stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new and my daughter has created it really beautifully it's cold astro flash it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit so I've got a couple of things on great burnt prizes in our or a earth Aquarius news zones so now earth of course news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius news segment and grape or enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening\nWith a Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this will you can you predict if I mean today one of his color Joe ... says I Can't call them friends but said that he was a drunk\nWill you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother died from alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum or the president have certainly speaks his mind sometimes to some people too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not\nUm he could withdraw I mean you know it it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday I don't think it's I think it's going to be hard to prove anything\nThrough um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and what I did is I looked at the charts for the moment of Thursday when the session began you see that's part of Monday and astrology\nAlways a little bit of a person although you can do that and I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an international thing what the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a charge just like a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart\nIs very descriptive of that whole time all last Thursday\nGonna put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed astrological speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus in the science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the\nHey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it I don't think it'll happen but well\nYeah well the thing is is that ... there's too much unknown but if I opened a hazard a guess you know I Would just say there are certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal is if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative with somebody else is going to be nominated\nIn in his in his place so it's not as if suddenly would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there that is squeaky clean well\nI think that would be because they've been saying that uh a\nLot but my question Mr lure you think you'll get confirmed Yvonne\nI'm logically speaking\nWell Esther logically we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control\nThem used to hazard a guess that that side of the equation\nYou still didn't answer me though I think it will get confirmed do you do okay All right that that that that might be one I I I I'll be wrong on but er well they'll say no you at least you took the stand\nRight because when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um were so many of the predictors and you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably went on she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan Wisconsin a Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million\nAnd that turned the election to the electoral college and Trump won\nSo amazing work now ... let's talk about Kim Jong on and his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think is happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this'll this'll be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation\nI think it's a done deal that they are going to have nuclear weapons when and they're never going to get rid of them\nBut what's gonna happen is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing um in other words it'll be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false whether or not a kind of you do these kinds of things that no other president would have ever done\nAnd you try and just sort of like make things nights and then eventually you know right now they just said the other day or the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize\nBy the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you've caught that did you see that and I sure did it\nIt was like where we we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they dragging their feet and then during so I don't know if it was a late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next few years we're fine what you know and so I just I've seen this all the way through the danger I think I'm In all of this\nThis personal diplomacy we don't know if Kim Jong un is going to be the leaders of tomorrow the next day in this country at least we have a succession of ...\nAnd you also don't know what are you doing this trend\nSo you got the tricky thing we the other thing is\nUh in astrology and this is very important Donald Trump's chart President Trump's choice is known we've known as exact birth time for decades and it's not a mystery Hillary Clinton's birth time could have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talked about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it\nSo she was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay we didn't know whether she was morning or evening we don't know the year of Kim Jong on their\nReports he was born in Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five is definitely a Capricorn son we know that we just don't know the year and I think that\nRush got an email and called the ... a Russian getting

George hours what I'm doing now in in minutes or an\nAgent and you'd better be minutes on this show right did you measure the taking our\nOkay or you have a it's interesting just like the previous caller another moon in areas okay we're which means like from the past ... recent lifetime\nYou've developed leadership skills that you need to bring through their kind of instinctual like being in charge being assertive without being aggressive\nSo there was a kind of forceful part but your son sign Aquarius aquariums need to learn through groups through friendships through team kind of activities or global kind of things\nAre where you're you you ... that are sort of close to your philosophy of life and what's in your heart and you're also born with Pisces rising which adds if it's positive a compassionate empathic kind of energy and also a psych equality interestingly you like the previous caller had an enormous amount of Capricorn the previous caller had sun a Capricorn\nYou have one two three you have five left devising ... record more than even where you have an Aquarius and Capricorn\nUm is worth Saturn is moving and so you also if you want to do this you're you're moving into a strong career cycle [noise]\nAnd I mentioned earlier you asked me George you know something really for two of those are good happening and I said Jupiter going into its own kind of ... well here's somebody Donna\nYou're born with Jupiter and Saturn ... so it's going to be home coming few over the next year a lot of Jupiter and Saturn so do something in the world or something you know where you're making\n'em expressing yourself in society and kind of a mover in shaker ... even in your community or neighborhood or your state you know to do something that you feel a significant and and worthwhile\nAlright Don good luck to you hope everything works out so amazing mark how you're able to pinpoint individuals with a strong as well\nBecause it's kind of like if if\nI were a doctor okay and what I'm doing if you just if you said okay this person needs advice about their chest area and you put an x-ray in\nFront of me I just start talking you know the doctor thing whatever it is nice right then you'd say okay uh looked serious enough that you know going to have to put you on antibiotics and then go back and forth a little bit well for how long you know and then come back\nTo me it could be a pneumonia it might be bronchitis will will have to take you know\nHave have you do some you know see what happens so it's kind of like a Rorschach test the chart is\nIs so magical but it's like again if this were a beginner and they they'd be looking around and saying what do I do you know I see that there's the symbol for Aquarius there's ... there's some Capricorn book it would be like novelty to\nThe but when you have done it for forty six years you know is there like on the website I have what's called the cosmic calendar which used to be and walk on the planet earth and now it's independent and that's where people can\nSee what's in the sky every day and they can they can subscribe you know for a year or two and we even have a new thing where they can try it for one week for less ... less than a dollar or among through less than ten dollars it's it's kind of part of the new great there\nBut for one week for less ... less than a dollar or among through less than ten dollars if it's kind of part of the new gray fare\nWell that's fantastic that's you've been doing this for so long and you know I I think it's important for people to chart themselves right into the sea the direction they're going for advice\nMy whole goal has always been George again this part of by Pisces what I when I Do a consultation for somebody I hate to say is I mean I'd love to have them come back hey I'd like to do a deeper thing and you know I can do charts of compatibility with a loved one or a parent and child\nBut my goal is to get them so excited that ... years later they would come back and say you know you did my reading and studying I'm doing it on my own if I can do that that is the greatest thing that I could do\nCouples ever come to you mark to say are we compatible but well\nI Will say this first of all I don't do this anymore but I used to do a lot of marriage charting really yeah ... ...\nBut the thing is it's a very fine tuned I'm there we have we have reports that we sell coal friends and lovers and there's something called ... so I I Would tell people to go to our strategy you poor thing and they can\nPut in their birth data and get that relatively quickly for me to do things is ... you know it's more expensive you have to do to charge you gotta get background information both people but basically astrologers have been doing this for a long time\nAnd it's and it's like you look at Venus and Mars for pilots of love and or the sun and moons matching up and all the different planets but it's quite complex but you can do it\nAre you like a human to roll card [laughter] well I've created to erode\nDecks one with my ex wife each uh uh we did inner child cards which have sold well over a hundred thousand copies for the last like almost Thirty years so many different languages and she has done an enormous amount of promotion of that and then I did baseball tomorrow and I just ran into the gal were filled with\nThe other day I hadn't seen her a while and that has not sold all that well because the public is sort of will doing calendars but they had never done a terrific project so I've done to row longer than I've done astrology\nI'm going to give you our next the special callers birth date first of all November\nNineteen Nineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight we're going to Bradley in Illinois Radley do you know where you were born\nThough Illinois\nIn Delano well and how about a time any idea\nI'm I'm not sure the exact time okay do you have a question from mark who just want him to get going here\nI like this all spiritual aspect to it you know like our nation also another thing like that but you know make a difference you know ... or anything like well\nI don't study Chinese now I just want to make it you know I Am aware of the five different elements and those kind of things and the you know the twelve ... the birthdays that kind of [noise] but um what I Need to know is was it Nineteen eighty eight\nNineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight okay hold on one\nSecond okay while you're doing that we've done a couple of minutes before the break Morgan will take some more calls when we come back later on denied by the way we are going to be talking about science Austin's from beyond the earth would Gordon Moore go ahead mark\nOkay so November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight I'm just putting in like close to sunrise this person is a sun science Scorpio but you're not going to believe is the third time in a row we looked like we have another mood in areas that that is really talked\nAbout not so unusual that yeah I mean there are twelve times three callers all within areas man that's my that's my audience\nSo again we have somebody and this is interesting traditionally Mars which I mentioned earlier is going to hit its own zero point of areas\nAnd we have somebody and this is interesting traditionally Mars which I mentioned earlier is going to hit its own zero point of areas on December thirty one and New Years which is what I said you know it's it's traditionally a planet of war but it can also be a planet of energy a planet of passion\nFor a sports exercise and this person who just called um has the moon and areas conducting Mars and he's the son signed Scorpio and traditionally Scorpio was also ruled by Mars it was considered to the ancient Mars is night fine\nBecause it ruled the water side to this person has a lot of Mars a lot of intensity\nUm a lot of difference energy that comes through the Scorpio world and currently Jupiter is making a ... a a crossing just finished three times on\nThis individual is mercury so he the fact that he made it through on this is probably part of Jupiter offering a kind of blessing just that he's on here and again I Would say to him he also has Capricorn strong\nTo do some kind of a study in metaphysics philosophy of people have his science Scorpio need to really get into the things\nI'm sort of at a hot and heavy way and stay with it\nDo you pick lottery numbers Mark I'm I I I often enter you know the different lotteries Powerball so on a five years ago I had four out of the five numbers of horrible didn't show up wow closest\nI've come that would've been a almost two million dollars right as whatever the feds would it take it but it didn't

media ride shooting star affect anybody's astrological chart\n[laughter] um [noise]\nI don't know that that would actually do something although my favorite magazine is astronomy young out of Wisconsin I don't know if you get it it's beautiful and the credible gotten it for a long time and they just had and the previous issue where there's a a free program I I don't remember exactly where it is I have in order to get\nWhich I think is really unique with that people can see\n'em they can plot like\nAround America around the world when the moon would a cult of planet or star and even an asteroid two it's sort of comes close to what you're asking about and that's actually a software program so in the software world these are amazing things but meteor you know we have the you know the different kind of meteor storms that happen every so often like this one\nIn August you know the Perseids and different ones um there there may be some effect with some people I think more psychic Lee the people who like are prone to\nYou know respond to earth changes you know some people tune into earthquakes and\nAnimals and you you know things like that so I'm anything's possible but it wouldn't really change the charts so much\nAll right let's go back to the final coal series they line up for you or your ... birthday is October Twenty one Nineteen fifty coming up pretty soon a birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we'd go west to Albert in Tucson, Arizona hey Tucson how are you Albert\nHey good evening George good evening mark happy upcoming birthday to you my friend oh well thank you hey another year oh there you know\nThey keep clicking by do you have a question for mark or just want him to do reading for you\nOh he can do or reading my question would have been kind of in a financial limbo for the last year so I was wondering if that was going to change and the other question is about you know love and money\nLaundering money go ahead Mr learner okay uh\nHe's three people in a row because there's something called the part a fortune in Arabic astrology which was developed a thousand years ago they were all mathematically oriented that's where we get algebra and there was what's called parts like the part of the birth part of marriage and saw something called the part of fortune\nAnd throughout the entire a segment there the part of fortune\nFor Los Angeles and out on the west coast was in the areas the sign that the moon was showing up in the part of fortunes very connected to the moon and the moon was also in the ... sign cancer and is rising\nIn the first house of self expression which is the kind of archetype all areas area so there was a reason that happened while this fellow now has a Pisces ... and ... is\nFrom from the past from another life or other existence is in the past this person has developed in this could be why the financial thing\nI'm more of sort of a need for compassion may be working in religion and philosophy behind the scenes and it's not ... not very much of a mover and shake her in the world\nSo as an individual people who've Pisces moon come in and they're more impact and paths okay for good or for ill okay and some people with strong Pisces moon can get sort of pulled into they can become vulnerable you know to other people and lose their way but\nThe sun sign of this individual is the sign of a partnership Libra and he also has Neptune mercury and Venus\nThere in that science so as far as relationship is concerned the keynote esoteric leaf reliever is I Choose the way that leads ... between the two great lines of force and my mentor\nI'm dating Roger talked about lever as the great pyramid following the mystery of the things which is really Leo in Virgo the body of a lie on the head of a every a woman\nAnd so the whole Egyptian mystery kind of tradition it goes back to the summertime is of cancer Leo Virgo and lever and so so basically spiritually\nThis person should study everything about the great pyramid and that would be very good because there's a lot of more about mysteries even Jesus going and being a potentially initiated you know two thousand years ago during those last years from you know from age twelve or Thirteen to thirty three\nGoing all around the world to India possibly to Egypt going to a lasting very and in England I mean these are kind of more but may very well have happened so study the great pyramid study Egypt a and get into things like reincarnation metaphysics that might help\nAlright anything else they're Albert no\nJust uh how is my upcoming year looking well Jupiter you have for planets celestial bodies inside the terrorists are Jupiter is going to tick off what are called conjunctions to palace which has to do with solving problems\nTo get into a kind of study about how to solve your problems in developing strategic thinking and you'll also have Jupiter contact your Mars what's called tire on and series\nSo those are all unusual planets but they ... their gifts from the heavens to Jupiter the king of the gods which has a lot to do with you know success power positive thinking faith Providence benevolence is really trying to give you some gifts here so hopefully you can use them\nNext up we're going to the Rockies November twenty of Nineteen fifty five let's go to Jane in Florida and she was born to forty in the morning a mark\nBoy you're going fast November twenty of\nNineteen fifty five what time\nTo forty in the morning ... am to forty AM let's go to Jane in Florida she was on her mind Hi Jane\n... how's everything oh I'm going to help me any questions from our\nIt's on her mind tied Jane ... how's everything oh I'm going okay hey any questions from work or just reading\n... um or how about general meeting\nAll right mark general reading again November twenty Nineteen fifty five to forty\nA L okay well uh her mom away [laughter]\nWell now we've got the beginning of Aquarius um where you have some strong energy is George and I do as well ... at the beginning of aquarium yeah and\nThis woman who is called a has the moon with higher on which was discovered Nineteen Seventy seven and Cairo on is kind of a ... and the mentors so this brings up the idea of getting involved with a group or some kind of group process would be really good for the soul spiritual standpoint\nWe're kind of building rainbow bridges between your spiritual life and higher destiny and your personality world but definitely\nTeam or group were community work global kind of connections you've done this before in the past and it's still important to keep doing it just like the other a color you you're going to get the fortunate oh Jupiter energy you have\nAn asteroid called Juno the planet Venus which represents represents love relationship\nA creative artistry in what's called the north no to the moon which is the moon's orbit they're all inside the terrorists are Jupiter is going to help you with all this editor in energy that the the big issue probably in your life or being a sun science Scorpio and you have sun close to Saturn\nIs either a you need to be the warrior the esoteric keynote for Scorpio is warrior I Am in from the battle I emerged triumphant in every sense science Scorpio comes into life\nHaving to be daring and courageous\nBut also off and having a lot of um challenges just kind of like the need to die to the old and then be reborn but we're Jupiter is moving\nUm is very helpful for you over the next uh you know next year next Thirteen months it starts of November eighth and continues into the rest of the fall and into the new year so there are are suspicious vibes coming up\nOkay any questions Jane um how about a year going into a house\nOf um yeah I see that yeah oh is that going to get any thinking well if you don't okay using to forty\nIn the morning what's happening is that that planet is making what we call a square or right angle\nTo where the moon is and it's also you're at an age where you're honest is making a square or right angle to its own position\nSo what you want to avoid as nervousness and anxiety because in medical astrology or on that planet Iran is has a lot to do with the nervous system\nSo when people are able to sort of meditate or study particularly a cult or metaphysical subjects or things like astrology encountered subjects than you're using your energy is on a higher level your intuition is developing than good things are happening but if you sort of\n... drawn in ... raising the standard of living doesn't matter and Rush Limbaugh

about his latest work flying saucers from beyond the earth is website is his name and it's linked up at ... dot com some of these cases in your book or just bring back just amazing memories\nI used to remember how excited I was every time I read a brand new UFO story and just looking at them and flying saucers from beyond the urine to recollect all these all these stories all over again are amazing\nYeah yeah well I I kept some good files which I I took with three through the years and I've been a lot I've been wanting for at least the last ten years to do this book and finally got around to it and uh hopefully it's my uh\nIt may be my swan song but I think I look at me and maybe even about the subject and why\nDo you think the government really has not disclosed what's going on why don't they tell us\nWell I think they're coming close with this latest program out with the Pentagon and I think it's the closest I've ever come but um I have a theory and it it it it may sound kind of\nA court case but uh I think that we ever known all along where these uh uh saucers come from and that we've been actually exchanging perhaps technologies with I mean\nIt it sounds like a far out thing is that something kill would approve of it as hey day\nA matter of fact Campbell was reluctant put out any of the occupation or reports until I wrote the votes strange effect from UFOs in Nineteen sixty nine which was really a night cap publication\nBut for the first time we got into the the uh occupied in cases and uh and and and things like that but of course the main focus was to get to ... to do it twice and it's like Nineteen sixty six Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd he has the great hopes for the University of Colorado\nA UFO project\nIn fact I call my chapter on that liar liar pants on fire the University of Colorado UFO\nPride project because the way a symptom of disarray aims of our um out of some of our best cases and um\nJust symptom or just reams of our um out of some of our best cases and I'm In the long run they just almost completely ignored them\nI remember when the ... report chemo did you lose\nThat was January of Nineteen sixty nine wreck and from that time on\nAll the funding for a night cap a went out and then a a a there was a knockout staff member who was also had the CIA connections and\nI think to say I had been trying to take it over a for some time of course Roscoe Helen quarter who was the first chairman of the night cap board after kill took over a was the first director of the CIA\n[laughter] yeah yeah what do you think that she wanted to do just wash it\nWell I think that's part of it but at the same time I think they wanted to keep it going as long as they had control over it\nAnd um but ... didn't believe that even they call of didn't believe that I tried to persuade him that there was a a staff member named Stuart Nixon\nWho had a who had a practically admitted to me that he was a CIA plant and but the date for some reason didn't want to believe it\nUm which which struck me kind of\nI'm off balance because ah actually that was the one that\nBefore I ever came on board I think it was sixty four maybe sixty three were to CIA agents came into the office and they went through the night kept files of thoroughly over a period of several hours and\nUm\nSo I think they knew all along that uh you know but they have a certain amount of control over it but uh and and kill\nA\nI don't know I I just don't know how much K O really new I really believe that it was a CIA took I think he believed the CIA was willing to lead and I kept continue\nUm as long as they can monitor\nIt as long as they could ... right and I I think he was shocked to as I was when he and I were suddenly fired at the end of Nineteen sixty nine fired\nOr is that um I think it was a joke of Brian he was a ... a CIA contact the did you like El Nino eight seed\nCIA member and the ... and and uh and and Colonel Brian um and also do it for an a and a a heart transplant and see a connection store next to the news of the the a plant in the office had CIA connections\nAnd uh I think they were just trying to see how they could eventually take it over and not make it look like it was a CIA takeover\nI mean was it like the independent private organization\nIt was supposed to be yeah exactly\nWho who who had the authority to let you go to you too you said\nThat's correct he who's the founder\nYeah I Know but but the thing is that see we had a board of governors\nAnd I'm In early sixty nine they appointed a keen how the president or not he was the director first they appointed him the president and they appointed me the vice president because they call that time had left and taken a more lucrative position\nUm but and by the end of last year it took less than a year for them to a closed down me a organization but I think they had been a a a a really monitoring us all along matter we even since we've been caught\nThe Airforce and one or the camera and I were on the phone and I can't live ... hundred miles south of Washington DC he wasn't in the office and all that often maybe once every two months or so [noise] uh and we were talking about a UFO case\nAnd with all of a sudden we got to click on the phone and we heard a voice has said well major Quintanilla this is Don ... of course accurate quite mellow was the air force spokesman at the time\nAnd then we had another cat a situation where he wanted a to ask me if I were joined with him and creating a totally false case\nHave nothing happened to be a ... and so we created a case where UFO had landed but there were occupancy and there were special effects ... electromagnetic or affects aliens walking around and actually showed up uh in one of the project boo book reports\nAnd of course back in sixty eight sixty nine I think it was we published the project grudge and Blue Book before so it was the first time we were able to get those reports shaken loose from uh the Airforce or through the freedom of Information Act\nDid you ever know I'm In the late Apollo fourteen astronaut gr Mitchell\nSo now I didn't know I'm a ...

you just lose track you can't even fathom a million dollars let alone fattening what one trillion\nCensors would be in every city and every ... fate and every ... every place and his diet is we um as we designed smart cities\nAround the data we want instead of the wiring we have now the dialogue gets even more complex\nMass data aggregation will establish some troops about how our cities run it will lead us just or actually score cities on different quality of life metrics\nYou imagine that you you teach you think we're talking about the credit social credit okay well social credit will be we tattle on everybody else\nSocial credit will be hey you do me wrong I'll put stars down I'll bring your stars debris I'll bring your your numbers down right you screwing the overall bring your numbers on say what they were drivers you you you I I write you you write me we rate everyone else okay so can you imagine\nWe're writing everybody else was this whole credit system drag and fly we talked about it\nAnd I and I had a discussion\nOn the ground zero lines I'm bringing in some political to tell Google just shove it and say\nHey we don't want you just sit there and it and pretend like you're you're you're you're not playing with a big player in the Internet of things\nIs easy money there is that you get assigned your life away to the devil their alphabet soup you know you do that Google is there a wonder why fourteen hundred people to sign a petition to get you to stop at your own company five of quit\nBut it's not enough dealing with a country that has a bad I mean that's that's even understood rotten rotten and human rights\n\nThen of course when we designed a smart city yes because it gives you is going to be there taking ... China China China China yeah that works\nBut we'll find out how our city's truly run and they will give a rating we will score cities that are based on different quality life matrix severe city that has decided that what the hell no one's going to want to come to your stupid city\nThat was that again because of crime because of the way you keep up the city that the way you keep the homeless cleaned up or I mean all these things will mount to your social credit score city how you feel about that you you think that just that people are going to be scored you're going to be an score to\n\nProduce the eyes great well keep na [laughter] you you think you didn't get anybody will care although care about us well this is going to cost you more money you want to bring up the score pay more money\nThat's how we design\nData aggregation so that we know how cities score and the quality of life department\nAll that brings us to the toughest question of all what do we value\nIn human habitat what I mean that\nThat raises another problem we can create a dystopia just as easily as we could create a utopia the dividing line is deceiving Lee thin\nIt's kind of gray right it's a little little or blurry I guess\nSee we assume that by tapping into the collective intelligence to both of devices in people we can create\nA better living environment because they said over the weekend I

future\nIn the future of our children and our grandchildren\nAnd it was so great it was great to be able to talk to everybody about this and that kind of you know get the feel of what people are feeling\nAnymore I'm beginning to realize and this is the honest truth I'm beginning to realize something about social media and Twitter and all that you don't have the people that say bad things on Twitter said bad things on Facebook they're not my listeners they're not my supporters\nSupport means just that he means support\nOkay\nSo I mean you're going to be critical of something I say you can

...\nAnd you'll still support the show you understand that you know sometimes topics are very difficult to try and swallow it very difficult to understand at first because they're new and and and the most certainly or something that the challenges and thinking of most people\nBut to basically look at my my my social media and see people just attack attack attack attack Twitter attack and Jack and Jack and Jack and they say I've been listening to you for years no you haven't been listening to me for years\nOr I'm a listener but no you're not a list or or a supporter okay if you're a listener\nYou know how things go you follow the show and you know all of the patterns you know what to\nDo and many of you many of you who go back in research some of the old shows understand what's going on here he is not a game sure I tried to make it was entertaining as possible I Want to make it as entertaining as possible\nBut this is not your little political party you could all cry and wind over somebody on your side get screwed over or somebody on the other side get screwed over this is not CNN this is Don MSNBC this is not Fox this is ground zero this is one of the big boys play right this is where the grownups play\n\nAnd it really really makes it just brings my hair straight up\nWhen I meet people and it was January and that was genuine wonderful people ever made I ever had the chance to meet friendly interesting kind loving tremendous supporters of my program\nAnd then you have the guys out there that are just the trolls and you know that's exactly what they are both Ron and I've decided that\nWith all the wonderful people we've met all over the country from Virginia to California who've been all over speaking engagements Idaho Nevada of all these people we we been into their cities and towns\nWe do not see anybody who doesn't want to openly talk about things and talk about in the civil way the social media is a big lie\nIts ally\nAnd all but some of the people that are having these conversations are negativity that are putting out this racist content that's hateful content\nThey're all boss\nThey're all box and they're sent out there they're basically hijack people sites that have been oh I don't know doormen for years and just out of the blue oh what did he start oh he was he got on and what twenty twenty seventeenth how many things as

robots and and ... and computers and algorithms they're here just screw with your head\n\nAnd so yes there is intellectual and critical concern about our future more so than I see on Facebook and more so that I see the ... on on the mainstream and what they talk about every night\nYou know this is beyond Kanye getting boot on Saturday Night live I mean come on I mean I knew about this too but you

[noise]\nA lot of ... a few weeks ago talked about nano particles smart dust talked about how\nThese in her particles aren't everything close you washed or close you wear clothes you wash actually 'cause they want to know what the gloves are doing it and everything you do okay I saw that it didn't paper could be painted into the walls to put these into walls people could listen to what you're saying okay\nAnd the reason why is because they got one trillion sensors they have to deliver to all the parts of the of the country they want five gee they want to have this nano check for the city as smart city tomorrow right and all this is for Generation Z\nAnd I told you that we need to pay attention to a generation Z is up to ... the generation that is younger than the millennials let's stop button millennials there's damaging themselves now we don't have to ... most of us are either\nA on the cusp of being a baby boomer a Gen x or\nI'm between her because I was born in sixty four no one markets to me I mean\nThe only the only thing that trainers are excited about if they even cares the kiss a\nFarewell tour and it's the second one so uh that's the only big we care about right out and whether or not Star Wars is going to be a you know save demand\nAnyway but see that's the thing is that you know every generation has its values Generation Z right now wants the smart city they want the five gee they want the power they want it all but it it takes a lot of work to do that a lot of power\nTo do this\nA lot of time and then how you got to take one trillion sensors\nAnd put them in communities in cities across the country and do they seen what two years he had just people with the\n... you drop ... it's like magic fairy dust it smart Dutch that's the stuff that Julian Assange talked about here is again talking about it this was his last broadcast\nIn terms of ants have things that is a race that's part of the pipes now which I assume about being ... by a intelligent people are very small electronic second uh that you can just ... and ... on the walls\nAre set up ... powered by that chance\nAnd ... on the walls a\n... a ... a powered by the gas station and they say All right as the chance I'm reading your wife officer and all that gives them a ... small amount of time to do anything the owners say that tendency is going to continue that they like the Internet and things and it's a it's like\n\nA intelligent evil dust ah scattered everywhere like like confessing everything\nI think it's\nIncreasingly hard to ... to work out how to deal with that\nForms reported today apart from Julian Assange that the devices that he's talking about the Julian did this apart from the Forbes documents forged put out this document today put out this uh this uh noticed today saying the devices are smaller than a grain of salt\nThey're micro electro mechanical systems called means or M EMS andme EMS men's or means they're often called ... they are officially real their official and and they very well could be coming to a neighborhood near you\nForms reports that they are miniaturized devices they are censors they have sensors cameras and communication mechanisms in them\nAnd they are there to transfer the data they collect back to base in order to process furthermore forms reports the potential smart does to collect information about any environment incredible detail could impact plenty of things in a variety of industries from safety to compliance productivity\nIt's like multiplying the Internet if things technology millions or billions of times over in the city's up tomorrow\nAnd that's not very far away\nSmart dust is now mainstream although it has failed to reach the cable news networks it's mainstream in magazines like Forbes and science Julian Assange said this before he was cut off and now he doesn't do broadcasts anymore it's important to note\nThat all those who believe in staying away from the Internet is going to keep you off the grid this is the chief reason why it's going to be used and that is for full spectrum control everyone has has been or will be exposed\nTo smart dust that's the only way they're going to be able to put those trillions sensors in by twenty twenty it's the only way that they're going to meet the FCC's requirement\nFor the infrastructure and surveillance tape pen opt to come they want to install in the smart cities moving everybody into the cities because of agenda Twenty one and because of some it twenty thirty\nThis he's the future for Generation Z and partly the future for you\nAnd for me\nSound like The Lorax speaking for the trees ... six seven three thirty seven hundred\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred\nBy the way if you want to know more about this I have a book about trends humanism I just put it out on Amazon and it's got good reviews seriously just\nGo to Amazon dot com [noise] typing quite Louis [noise] and you'll see all my books geo engineering that's a good partner when for this because how are they going to drop all these particular now by how are they doing it now they're doing it with the campaign trail they're doing with Arab allies in inoculation [noise]\nAnd I think we're in a transformation eh I don't believe in evolution from a man but in a machine that evolution demand\nWell it said some sort of a it's some sort of a way like I said this is not\nFor you and it's not for me as for Generation Z and uh it's generations either they're putting this altogether for and so they want to find out what the future is look at your kids will get your grandkids you know the ones who were born after Nineteen Ninety five they're the ones that are going to shape the future and they're the ones are going to be more\nApt to basically be open to this sort of a new technology for the future and the thing is we have to compete with China so the FCC says hey don't drag your feet we want to push says we need to have\nEverything in place by twenty twenty it's going to be a big task and I'm sure they're not going to him and I'm sure not going to make the date but it's certainly going to make it a a different uh attempt to do so\n[noise] it's just amazing and it's an avid above that just that they're now down a little bit more\nBlake thank you for the call I really appreciate calling ended I go down to a easy it is a Gary and Gary and into Mexico you're on ground zero\n[noise] this is Jerry Lewis earlier and I thought are you talking about how the Internet\n[noise] hello this is Jerry Lewis and earlier and I thought are you talking about how the Internet was he's an Arab mentality that against you know\nWhether it's the it's been it's been like this you know for a while now but it just seems to me that\nYou know ... you know the the the fight is on actually 'cause they go round they asked people should we ban Clyde Louis for what he says would you uh would you like this demand his material take it out of the news read you know they're they're the they're they're just asking people what they think to me\nAnd in in the process that there are others that they get through the try to post on other uh you know by my Facebook groups have been uh been\nOrganized for me to make it look as though the people who participate on my website or the same people that are or what the media calls the alt right or or the white supremacists or whomever and the thing is you know I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that have differing views and opinions and listen to my program\nWithin to sit there and the blatantly do this to my site I don't have any patients I go in I look at them and by the they're causing trouble they're gone\nBecause I Know they're either box or they're being employed by these groups that are going in and and want to harass beat and harassed my listeners\n[noise] yeah I I just call in here because I have ... or ... years or however you open the insult us so anybody and just like your show\nWell thank you man I really appreciate your support thank you so much for that\nCindy\nHere buddy of mine who was going to Jamie in Alabama Hi Jamie your own ground zero\nLewis lack in some excited [laughter] monitor here in Alabama [noise] hey how you doing man\nOh it's been another day oh about every day all listen to radio show and and I got a social media thing there and I said you know those people don't matter we're the ones that matter whether you know the working steps that's going back and forth every day and you know we we listen to your show ones\nThat know are the ones that mattered and swift field\nYeah the other side of that technology has come a long way I mean I'm forty one years old and when we were kids I had a a a pony you had to pick it up and see if the neighbor up the road was you know was on it and then you also\nYeah we had that to a boat that was early on I Can't remember how old I was we had the party line where you hear someone else dialing or you know we were going to hear somebody on the other end and you know I I don't go far back as you know having to call fare on the phone and saying a hit me film Lulu I mean that was way before my time there but but\n... and I do go back to that I remember my grandma had one but yeah ... regardless just to put someone in your sales you know out of it one person on there that says whatever yeah you you probably got a thousand less work and steps out here that are listening\nI Know I Do I Know I have a lot of people that listen I just I just wanted to make it clear though that when we do our shows when we produce these shows we spend\nNearly seven hours preparing the show we check our we we check our sources we we make sure that everything you get is the honest are reporting that we can do our best to do\nAnd we give it to you and even when we do the supernatural stories where you the stories that are paranormal because they're fun to oh we certainly are getting people who have had credible experiences\nAnd and uh we we and that's where people say well I like it we didn't paranormal shows yeah so do I will find some credible people to give us paranormal shows I'm not going to have anybody come on and say they've had some paranormal experience and not have any verification so I mean it's it's difficult sometimes to find the best paranormal shows but we do that as well because that's what we like to do I mean\nIt's uh not have any verification so I mean it's it's difficult sometimes to find the best paranormal shows that we do that as well because that's what we like to do\nI mean and I'd like to say you know one of my biggest inspiration lung John Mabel a guard belle her jumped go uh Howard Stern Rush Limbaugh I could go down the list of only doctored them into I Can't forget him\nUh but you know I've had a lot of people that I've grown up listening to or some wells a Colombian radio theater the shadow war of the world I mean I can just go down the list of all the things I was raised on\nIt is certainly something that I like to do I want to bring that kind of oldfield new show\nAnd ah we do it and we tried to make it new and interesting an old at the same time so it feels right\nThat that educating and form in a way you stay on as to you just stay in the middle there doesn't matter what Saturday you know the red side or the Bush doesn't matter right in the middle of it\nA conspiracy theory has no side and even though it may look it may make somebody look bad that doesn't mean they're all bad it just brings and they may be getting near somebody they really shouldn't be getting near that's only going to say\nVery appreciative of what you do though like I said longtime listener first time caller\nJamie thank you so much for calling thank you for taking my bye Let's go down to Chris in Oregon Hi Chris you're on ground zero\nWas our\nPlanet in just a telling people are getting dusted\nAlright so uh you're right on this on steel right where he got cut off the lights on sides with I mean you look up in the sky was falling down on to us but at the same time I know you know that you live in northwest so now he look up the night\nPretty blue sky and you got five or six little line you know he just did with all these ... and you know what happens when you ingest all this stuff what happens when you turn on my way\nWhen you put metal and\nWell it'd been fired his in burns\nRight okay so let's go back to you or you're in the end to sixteen [noise] you know when they talked about bringing flash yeah so it's like a repeat of the past\nWell what we're doing what we see and you're right about the microwaves and things of that nature\nBut we'll see we'll see these uh these particles there's nothing more than conductors and at least for now ah and they need them so they can do that they have sensors everywhere so they can pretty much tell you know what is happening in if they have a you know these nano by to these nano tech particles on bridges in on\nOn some roads and stuff they can pretty much tell what needs to be salted what needs to be a you know sanded for for snow I mean all this stuff is he's just like\nYou know ... there are some good points to it or they'll be able to work harder to make sure\nThat there are these things are taken care of but we're also doing all enable wireless or or driverless cars\nWhich by the way I I was witnessing if you go to my Facebook page I have a video it was taken in Las Vegas I guess now they have dominos pizza driverless car delivery a really cool car pulls up and all you gotta do to push the buttons to the hand you the pizza through the window and there's no driver\nLas Vegas are my thoughts go out to everyone that was a change in that space you\nKnow that that happened there I'm Still trying to see if I can find anyone that will come on and talk about the aftermath but at the moment of course that it's such a great job at getting the whole story that we'll never know the truth\nWas detrimental and to affect our Second Amendment I'm a side of that uh you know the burning of flash [noise] you know maybe a sign of that but it's also a smell of life is what\nUh you know the burning of [noise] you know maybe but it's also like what they say\nWell you're more tuition [laughter] I don't I don't go again I mean you can't you can get from out Chris and you know what I my God you're you are the epitome [laughter]\nIt'd be more efficient I'll tell you right now [laughter] I live on your guide long enough to know [laughter] I\nThink the show and you know we just you know particle whether it is a flu that was\nTheir plan all along and I think we've all been affected from it and we already\nHad an infant now but you can imagine what it's going to do later and of course they may have to put out new particles in order for this new infrastructure they would like to construct would

they're using particles to to get massive data on everybody was and it goes beyond the you know you think you're on the Internet and they're not getting data and they're getting data on something that you have\nAnd or even your money that had the little particles on it and the little metal wiring in it and so they can track you and figure out what's going on with it so they can track their money as well\nAbsolutely you know as as a you're physically track through the ether and the wife I fields that are generated or was reading off these things ah there was an article that come out here about a year ago or it might have been a little bit longer ago about how they can actually tell who the person is fight their gate of them are walking oh younger the\nYeah the gate a also once again I think it was a few days ago we were talking about what is it to ...\nYeah the gate a also once again I think it was a few days ago we were talking about what\nIs it two million a closed circuit TV cameras having to be installed in the United states for most of the smart grid cities and again for the surveillance apparatus of their wishing to\nPut in play a so not only do they have the cameras to see you they'll have a the data to have on you if they need to access that data through a ... you know I could call nanoparticle smart just evil dust like a massage called it but these are called ... is what the costs\nBut we'd be on the truth uh here in the small towns that are residing maybe about five thousand people they put up a three security cameras on the post office has three security cameras at the local park right\nAnd it's because we all want a safe utopia smart city and it won't be our police either in the future will not be a he will not be the police were used to it will be forces that will be actually under the control and the police chiefs will answer to an autonomous robots that will make determinations as to who are threats and we weren't threats\nAs part of what is your home was about jade home was a a rate the on project it I mean a lot of other people said differently but we report it was a rape you on project to basically do a test run\nOn the grid system they weren't planning on putting in play with the ... system that they that everybody will soon be carrying with them if they're not carrying with them now\nAbsolutely it makes me think are very much about ... and the well a USSL ridge although if you're familiar with this story\nOf going to be like a long time ago yeah awesome yeah well I you know I appreciate all your thoughts on this thank you so much for calling John thank you\nBye bye bye speaking of John John Brennan talks about how interested he is for the future and how to deliver certain things by a stratospheric air assault injections here we go\nAnother example is the rate of technologies often referred to collectively as geo engineering that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change one that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric air assault injection or as a high\nA method of seeing the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat it much the same way that will connect the Russians do\n[noise] so that's a John Brennan and that's not out of context he was talking with the council on Foreign Relations and other body think tank that actually runs this country from the sidelines talking about the future for a strategic air assault inoculations injections it's certainly a a brave new world\nThat's for sure I was going to Sam in Kansas Hi Sam you're on ground zero\nCould even glide hey I'm Glad to hear your lady soon find hope you are as well\nYes and when you see here you have a big hug and kiss for me I Will definitely\nOkay [noise] um [noise] maybe you can answer this question and [noise] I don't know how knowledgeable about it and if if my question is\nUh [noise] get down to layman's terms basically you have these tiny microphones mhm and they broadcast a signal I mean it it's not necessarily a voice communication\nState of communication is all data has nothing to do with voice they don't listen to you but the data is kept on you so then there'll be a data marking it'd probably be indefinite data but it certainly will be data on what the the the sensors are picking up all over the world\nOkay my question is also is it a receiver and transmitter or is it just a a transmitter\nReceiver but of course it's going\nThere's also is it a receiver and transmitter or is it just a a transmitter\nMostly receiver but of course it's going to help with the Internet of things so yes it will eventually be a trans hundreds away to integrate us into the machines and machine learning and throw it and if it isn't it\nIf it isn't now it will be\nIt can be yeah but at the moment they just wanted per day and it's it's basically data collection on everything including inner inner inanimate objects like bridges and whether or not a road needs to be paved or whether or not there is a charcoal and the road that can detect that or whether or not you know that sort of thing\nIf they can do that to inanimate objects they can do to people as well\nWell that's the whole point I mean they were able to ingest it and we get it through\nA you know vaccines Kim trails GMO food things of that nature it's all there anyway and that's why people are saying what can I Do to get rid of it was nothing it's just like you know when you inhale or when you inhale particularly from a smokestack he goes into your body your liver has to process it\nAnd you're still alive and you're still breathing unless of course they say that living next to a smokestack is giving you black lung and then you can say well I can blame that company for giving me black lung everybody has been in them and now we're no reason to panic to speed by that this is how they're going to be able to put sensors all over the world in two years\nSo then it it's safe to assume that eventually they'll be able to manipulate you\nSaw maybe yeah but see that's the thing is I was talking with Ron during the break and he was a kind of blood but he was he was very serious it's like we say we know we could be kidding but we're very serious about what we're getting about\nHe said quite he says the new investment is into memory setters he said if you invested in memory centers you will be a billionaire because memory centers of the new things to invest in\nSo they can control your metabolism they can control your thoughts and they can even convince you that you're sick\nWell that would be ideal be be behind quelled McCall program that's what the ... program was about the classified instilled conspiracy theory 'cause there's no way we can prove it otherwise it's all\nCircumstantial evidence or you know a bat you speculative evidence when you're looking at a piece of paper that could've been forged are made up but still it was out long before this ever became an issue and people were worried that are in fact they tried to dismiss it saying it's all a hoax but most of the people that were involved\nIn bringing it to the public or either killed or died or committed suicide it's just amazing everybody there was a you know attached to do this project or at least declassify or bring it to the public\nOr either killed or suicide it or what have you\nWell here's my thoughts yeah if it's broadcast [noise] it's possible to blow up the signal it may take a continuous electromagnetic pulse\nOregon you know but that the thing is that it is possible but then all they'd have to do is just dusted again and ah and so you constantly would be struggling or having a a trouble to avoid it you know that one thing it it said it said data system\nThat is that collects data on everything so that they want data on you or or the the fire hydrant next to the house or how many times the the lamp turns on to the delight of the neighborhood they have that information\nAnd if you didn't manage the signal their equipment would tell them the signals being blocked care\nVery they catch thrown or a fairly cage maybe I don't know ... work a thug with a criminal ballot that people are drilling Turpin\nTime and again it's half I don't know why they would do that but uh yeah I was reading the other day people are drinking\nYou know gum turbans I'm I just to get rid of them are good for you for like it up well then they may not do this at home because they know\nI guess the kids that have some good for you for like it up well then they may not do this at home because they know I was watching that no one I cannot believe anybody would drink serpentine I just don't know if they could\nWell you're yeah could affect your kidneys livers\nCharcoal water baby I don't know not terribly well ...\nThere's there's vinegar baking powder and baking soda\nBaking soda and vinegar of white wine vinegar red side or or apple cider vinegar I mean there are a lot of things I'm sure that will cleanse your body over and over again but every time they die every time they laid a trail", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018",
