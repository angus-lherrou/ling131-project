to win this election using two things cabin on the caravan and how some of Trump's supporters know exactly what this caravan is and who is behind it says one Trump supporter and an angry Facebook posting the caravan as a political operation\nIt has to do with what's happening in the middle east we have to special guest for you let me introduce them first Fred Burton front as the vice president of intelligence and counterterrorism at the Stratford leading geo political intelligence for him and he's one of the world's foremost experts on security\nTerrorists in terrorist organizations easy former State Department counterterrorism deputy chief DSS agent and the author of a best selling more ghost confessions of a counter terrorism agent didn't chasing shadows here's Fred first of all Fred welcome to the program looking forward\nTo Des thank you for having me on again George and or was it was spent about seven years since you were last on with us but I'm Glad you're back Samuel Katz\nIs a New York times best selling author and an internationally recognized terrorism law enforcement and military special operations expert is written more than twenty blocks in hundreds of articles in the Arab Israeli conflict international counterterrorism military and law enforcement special ops\nAnd Palestinian and Islamic fundamentalists tour as well Samuel welcome to to the program\nThank you so much for having me and their book is called Beirut rules the murder of a CIA station chief in his bowl as war against America a friend and Sam ... of the Lebanese a heritage and I'm very familiar with that\nTore blown country now be used to be the jewel of the middle East that isn't anymore Fred isn't\n[noise] no I'm afraid not a George ah we've watched it deteriorate for several years now and of course a Hezbollah has become a very strong in country and a operates as an Iranian proxy\nAnd how long Samuel has this been going on with Iran backing Hezbollah and who are the are these Lebanese people or the Iranians who are they\nWell Hezbollah the Lebanese party of God is a Shiite religious militia [noise]\nI'm a\nUnderground Iranian proxy group that was of formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in Nineteen eighty two\nUm Lebanon is a you know of all we split between the Sunni the Christian and the Shiite population for domination of the country and the Shiite were always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy eight or one of the Shiite spiritual leader of 'em was murdered in Libya and left the vacuum in the country and and that coincided with the onset of Ayatollah Khomeini and Iran\nAnd the Iranian Revolution and they ... the uranium for a possible fertile ground to spread the revolution in Lebanon and they sent the salaries they send 'em intelligence specialist somebody said revolutionary guards and\nTo live and on with Syria's blessing and they set of faith in Lebanon and they establish among the many state within in many states that was very obvious to many inside the country for them I interviewed a few people\nWho are journalists at the time in Lebanon and they said that the Iranian influence with everywhere um sadly the the two people of the two groups that neglected this\nIs that the Iranian influence was everywhere I'm fairly the the two people of the two groups that neglected this this arrival and the amount of money the amount of influence with uranium through spreading a little bit on\nWhere the Israelis and the Americans to people that have a vested interest in keeping 'em the Iranians way out of Lebanon\nFred is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as el ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative or statement uh before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than\nThan any other group I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on\nThe u._s. embassies and the hijackings and the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which\nUh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a counter to some history\nOr does it never been done this was an organization that had\nA literally a snatch to the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild\nA all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing uh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um it it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred\nUh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because uh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley\nUh we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us exactly where he was so\nUm [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are certainly a um I'll never forget and um but I Know that there was a ... a heck of a lot of us that that certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nReally get into that story I wanted to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty is Wilfrid heard what what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question uh you can only look back on the events of ah nine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and\nOn the plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon or as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region or why we need a footprint or in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy\nA and a a take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil and\nUh that's the the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nOr we're gonna talk about William Buckley you're just a moment we're with red Burton Samuel Katz their book is going to be rude rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them\nOn what truly is a very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized in hopefully Fred than Samuel would you be rules you get more and more exposure\nTo what's happening over there in the if you can say I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break give us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nSpeaking of Hezbollah um the Hezbollah forces have been fighting from the onset\nToday well speaking of Hezbollah um\nThe the Hezbollah forces have been fighting from the onset alongside Iranian special forces to help keep 'em president off of um regime in power has ... has been transformed from an underground fourth\nI'm In the Nineteen eighties um the period we're ... and I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of um the fundamentalists suicide Shiite brands of terrorism and it has emerged into probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm it is for the United states in Iraq\nIt was um it was absolutely in a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq to fill up there um I ... I'm strategies and tactics that killed so many American servicemen\nI'm In two thousand ... launched a I'm a horrific war against Israel where I'm laid siege to a movie of indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities um it does involve the narco terrorism it as one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm\nI'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with\nThat we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has its sleeper cells and operatives in this country\nHas for many years and it is an arm and extension of Iran was um a desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important in the U.S national interest\nAll countries of course work through straw parties we worked with the Selma bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets on they're\nGiving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah but why are we getting top with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions\nWhy don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stopped supplying them we're gonna win ... why don't we do that Sam\nI I think that this country has been very apprehensive about engaging Iran militarily since\nOur hostages were the is that the U.S embassy in Tehran I'm a many many years ago I think there were um numerous um declarations of war by Iran and Hezbollah against the United states the bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and to see the bombing of marine barracks which\nWas um uh on the thirty five years ago to this day out on\nHold on for a second ... will come back to this point and we'll talk with you and Fred as well about your book Babe Ruth rules next on the coast to coast that you\nNever missed a detail of the show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nPan welcome back to coast to coast red Burton with us Samuel Katz their book is called be rude rules\nSam you were mentioning of course that the Hezbollah may have sleeper cells in the United states is that possibly one reason we haven't gone after Iran militarily and attack them because we're afraid that those cells could be activated no I don't\nThink so I think um we haven't gone after Iran militarily because we're not really sure what a direct military conflict with Iran might bring I think the Iranian you of groups like Hezbollah to export terrorism throughout the middle east\nAnd the rest of the world is daunting enough for 'em policy planners in this country for generations it was um directly responsible for a lack of response to suicide truck bombing of the few the Marines\nAnd the kidnapping of a CIA station chief\nFrom things that was unheard of in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only station she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of the age of ...\nFred Burton tell us about William Buckley\nA bill was a a a true patriot Georgia he grew up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening this is not the journalists were talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny side stored it to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA I and our William F Buckley actually received a few of us paychecks over the years wrote them and uh our bill thought it was very funny and a thought about\nWell he actually received a few of his paychecks over the years not wrote them\nAnd uh our bill thought it was pretty funny and a thought about a cashing them but I'm a bill grew up in the Boston area a seminar we're lucky enough to uh get the cooperation of bills or family has a elderly companion or that he's lived with for many many years and a sister\nWho just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up uh [noise]\nUm and he went off after high school into the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea\nAs a young kid\nAnd um where he was a silver star recipient and ah [noise]\nAlso a Purple Heart um and which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into now than it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates gets hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties it was very murky\nA as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that can tell us specifically what he was up to a but regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things\nWhen you know didn't surprise me because of of the nature of it as a curiosity and his languages and you know ability to\nTo just I'm a study history and specially military history [noise] uh so uh in Nineteen sixty he uh he joins or the U.S army again or an goes under special forces\nAre and I'm also a associated with the CIA and that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter in recruiter and I'm logos off or\nTo Vietnam and where he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire\nA so this was a man George that was always running towards danger and uh he he reminds me of the NYPD a cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers I don't\nKnow you know you're known for years they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um\nAnd and off the bill uh was uh uh the only guy to raise his hand to volunteer to go to the root uh at the CIA uh after this devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station is wiped out so [noise]\nUm that was who Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Bay roots clandestine war was a pretty well known by people\nWell ah the station chief or um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the or the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other ... intelligence liaison services know that too I mean it's such as the Jordanians the French the Israel was and so forth so I'm Bill is not a in a undercover position during that time period\nSomebody read it on him no doubt\nWell uh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um ... you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources needs snitches uh and so forth and so um you know bill was that kind of person\nAnd I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day a in Nineteen eighty four\nIs overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles are and Hezbollah grab them and um they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't he have security around\n[noise] it's a good question or I can tell you a first\nHand from that time period a it was an unusual for station chiefs and not to have security uh salmon I did our last book on been godly or where you had a whole Qadri a professional\nUh security personnel to specifically watch a CIA officers backs are in that time period are they really didn't exist you could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but\nUh you can't really do your job is a is a secret agent to use that phrase it with an entourage so ah the nature of the job and not in that time period was a you're a single time you were kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\nHe was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and um I was part of the hostage de briefing team where uh we were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out to who was a wonderful man I spoke to him and ... and these button Germany after he had been held in captivity\nAnd and he told his bill had died and that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because um we had devoted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so [noise]\nUh then it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWill must have been like looking for a needle in a haystack rental\nOh my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was not time period [noise] um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then\nUm we we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but um it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a a person in a building or in a very barracks\nUm and we literally that could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating [noise] ah I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran a and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut\nWhile I'm which I'm not you\nCertainly a smoking gun or as to who was directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam wouldn't let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time jak ambition wrote an article about ... William Buckley simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think your jak Anderson's column accurate or not\nI think if I'm fairly safe to assume that under torture I'm Bill Buckley are revealed information [noise] I'm a very clever\nFairly safe to assume that under torture I'm Bill Buckley um

I got to tell you the dentist is not just having property it's where it is a in this course the Palestinians and the Israelis are truly one where they are because it's the holy land it's it's where\nJesus and everything else began for them and they don't want to move to Kansas City or Iowa or Nebraska or anything like that we've got the land available there's no doubt about that but it's not just about land yeah part of the issue is fighting over the holy land itself\nSham I Want you to take that question\nUm there's land but it's not their land and um [noise] um\nI I think trying to federal um where people go at this point\nIs a ... that's not going to happen or if it's way way too late or if I'm Wondering if\nYou should ever had um you know the the second burrito I'm forty years after you've hit the fifteenth slice of pizza I I I think what's important to understand that the Arab Israeli conflict is that the experts the state department diplomats and everyone has been using a formula\nVast um they've of it'll that the Israelis and the Palestinians\nBe an end to go she ate a case like everyone else and they're missing what I Believe is a critical point and that is that the mathematical equation that they're working on is flawed\nThey're missing I Believe is a critical point and that is that the mathematical equation if they're working on is flawed as the state of Israel was um was created the Israeli DNA Victor the Jews never again be forced to um to\nDo anything at the point of a gun I'm through force and the Palestinians DNA because of the establishment of the state of Israel in Nineteen forty eight warrants demands that there'll be some sort of military victory some sort of um he would Jima moments over raising\nThe flag where they can say that their ... their\nOpinion very equals if they've achieved they've achieved Harry\nAnd both both sides um in in how they approach the world and how they approach the very very small neighborhood\nUm our our ... ... Haitians are doomed to fail so perhaps what might be the wiser course of action is or is the change of the mathematical equation and to try something different to try something where I'm different\nSorts of ... of landmarks and milestones can be reached in order to get to a place of coexistence and to this day that really hasn't been attempt to\nBrian in Indianapolis Brian go ahead sir hey George good morning hay bright hey listen a\nMan what a what a mess over there in the middle east and ... than it used to ride all the war is wrong or no good over there I Am not a busy rail and look at all the American blood been spilled over there over the decades and it just seems like nothing has changed but my my question is\nUh which William Buckley this is the forgotten the history that nobody you know really remembers\nBut if he gave up secrets and I don't know if you know begin or not was there any trickle down collateral damage to the field office of the of the CIA that were out in the field or from the information that he might have given\nUp and keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off the air you got to give you that question\n[noise] sure a good question Brian uh the answer your question is uh uh at the time or the agency the CIA um could not take any more chances meaning ah in essence they they removed all of this personnel assigned to the station or got them out of a country ...\nUh they had to shut down or their source network a and\nAn anticipate the entire ... chain that that had been compromise there\nOr they had to shut down safe houses are where are you meet with informants are in anticipation that perhaps bill or had disclosed that\nUh so uh you have that trickle down effect and there's also a damage assessment that comes into play here to\nWhere you start thinking about um you know the intelligence services exist to steal secrets and so here you have a uh the CIA the CIA point man and Lebanon\nThat have access to everything or what value is that to another intelligence service so if you're the ... intelligence service for example a Kenyan horse trader swap with a let's say of the Russian KGB at the time [noise] so those are the kinds of things that you have to anticipate and you look at it from a worst case scenario\nAnd you shut down everything so ah was ah operations compromise or a operations were are certainly shutdown stopped a until a complete damage assessment is done to see how bad things are\nAnd then you have to restart\nDown stopped or until a complete damage assessment is done to see how bad things are and then you have to restart a your entire um human collection network a which is never easy\nSam what's happening delivered on today what's the situation there\nUh well I'm a Hezbollah is perhaps the most powerful political party in the country while I'm Hezbollah has um stockpiled hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles that aims that Israel has below fighters are getting on\nOn short on characteristic Lee I'm I'm a crucial combat experience and counter insurgency um capabilities fighting in Syria I'm\nIn the uh the\nLebanese fighters in in in Syria have played a significant\nRole in in Athens being able to the Assad regime being able to remain in power um Hezbollah remains I'm One of the world's largest narcotics traffickers a money laundering of 'em you name it we've outpost sub throughout the world including South America\nAnd um has remained a clear and present danger to the United states Israel in western interests throughout the middle east\nDrug why do they deal with the cartels are that are in a you know South America\nUm yes there is a very large Shiite population in South America in Argentina\nIn Colombia in Venezuela I'm In a previous work that I did um [noise] um [noise] we learned that um the the government of president manure and Venezuela\nUm had a um a a a shuttle service on the Venezuelan UM Airlines traveling to Damascus and I'm bringing in narcotics to Lebanon of course everybody along the way kind of cut and then from Lebanon be were dispersed throughout\nUm points throughout the um Europe in the middle east um ... the money from\nThose cells were laundered I'm In West Africa um some of the money was smuggled as a result of stolen car rings in the United states [noise] um it is a global criminal enterprise\nUnbelievable I I've always felt we should just legalize all drugs shut up to somebody you know ... clinics to help people not legalized drugs don't put people in jail stop people from robbing people because the prices will plummet\nAnd it's one way you're getting these people who are making all these your drugs and distributed um what do you think\nWell a large ... a large portion of his ... budget comes from um illegal activities and I I think that's um you know when we think about that we have to remember the more important than the religious elements in more important even sometimes\nIn the state sponsorship of terrorist organizations are criminal\nAnd they\nThey survive they thrive and they operate too is um with criminal criminal gangs um residents\nWe do George we're going to make a special

linked up the coast to coast am dot com Freda want to get your take on these ... situation of course and uh\nOf course the Saudi royals lied about the case or in the beginning a truly he was killed at the consulate butchered uh yeah I guess because of what his uh his writings were about the royal family and about Saudi Arabia or but she's my gosh what's your take on that\nMy goodness Georgia I can never remember another incident like that on a\nDiplomatic a facility in the history of time uh now I'm sure the Russians live possibly ah ah disposed of somebody's via similar methods so we're just not aware of just knowing how the KGB operates\nAnd this arena but uh I just ah I cannot imagine how a this operation was put put together a to actually do this or inside a diplomatic facility uh with all\nMedic facility in the world are you certainly could could have thought of a a a much better operation and and so ah either it was done with the purposeful intent to resonate\nUh although it or how it appears that this just was a a a tremendous fiasco and uh I I certainly don't think we've seen the last of this now the curious part to George with this is a based on some of the research we've done here at strapped for\nA there appears to then a few other a Saudi prince lives that have disappeared too so I'm\n... since the royal prince basically took over\nA correct a and before a this incident uh and ... so\nUh this just might be part and parcel to ah Saudi a outreach and covert action a to a target and eliminate a dissidents or any enemies of a of the royal family but uh uh it's certainly an unprecedented a mess\nYou because when he came in with his daughter ... when his father basically said hey you're going to be in charge here uh didn't he put a lot of boils away at the rich Carlton a in Riyadh and basically held them as hostage\nOr yes he did and you know you get back to a you know the the CIA director uh is in route or or just arrived there for meetings or\nA which is always very interesting because uh those meetings never happened in a vacuum or I Would not be surprised to see a some sort of a\nA effort behind the scenes to to try to make sense of what took place and and to move forward or you know that's the other interesting thing and these kinds of cases George you know behind the scenes or you know the intelligence services just go about their business\nAnd um because you know the the world doesn't shut down with threats with liaison work and\nAnd the curious part there is you know the Saudis ah for all their dysfunction and chaos ah there's still a an intelligence provider ... that that gets funneled into the to the big intelligence community so uh it it certainly is a a fiasco though\nIt's like a partnership with a double isn't it\n[noise] well most relationships with governments are a few times a I'm a I'm sad to say and it's just the nature of the business uh you know\nSome of rock along steadily without uh any hiccups like with our five eyes relationships\nUm but you know those stone at times working smoothly as a as most people think ah because remember a you know there are no friendly intelligence services that's the one mantra that you learn and and basic age in school\nIs a there are no friendly intelligence services and in each nation state is going to operate and what they feel is in the best interests of their country\nAnd then you're more cars Yogi apparently when the nephew of the late Saudi arms dealer or non could show a there was so ... you know there's been this power group within the royal family for years what what did he right that was so devastating that they want to kill him over\nWell that's the fascinating part I was talking to a couple of our ah Saudi analysts this morning here in the office and uh one of the analysts actually had a went in and watched him at a at a local speaking event uh this is an individual that are really wasn't that high profile\nAh and you probably could have lifted you know a dozen others that are more vocal\nThe I mean he's more well known now dead and then he was alive well exactly\nIt says where are you know you look at what the Russian what putting in the KGB did going into the u._k. and and taking out scribe Paul when ... you know the poisoning or you know so uh you know do\nDo these intelligence services see these a nation state moves like this and say well heck why can't we do this too I I mean it might boiled down to being something as simple as that\nYeah it's crazy and Fifteen people and apparently they're going to war ... most of them which is interesting because of the big are they going to rat on the person who said get this done for me and I think we all know words leading a or are they going to keep quiet and the hope that they get leniency and get out of prison in a year or two\n[noise] well and you don't want to be in a Turkish president that's that's the one given\nYeah that's true too that's true to Tom in the Bronx slow it's going to start a Tom go ahead\nYes I like to say that\nThe lane is a horrendous caper is Yemen\nI mean it gives the United states at very ugly face and name and how can you uh how can it be said that they want peace between Israel and the Palestinians\nWhen they have this ... when they have these terrible stories going on one\nFor another if I were in charge I Would say well maybe you can take as a and make it a temporary a pot when the over the was not for oil and that would go nuts for silver but for the sake of humanity to stop\nThe gas and from a\nSending missiles into Israel and Israel bombing get to\nDo at least stabilize it that way and then there's another aspect to this story they ... they took I they they took Libya and they made a mess to Libya\nAnd in the ... that they should go back there and retake the area in the creative same government for the Libyans\nI well I think I tried that Tom but it's it's failed miserably so far front and Sam you of course wrote books on Benghazi that horrible situation there\nAre because of course we know Boy Scout we hated the guy he was a terrorist and all of a sudden after Reagan bombed them killed is one of his wives and a little kid or you went straight gave up his new ... new planning and everything else what do you think of that whole situation for it\n[noise] well uh first uh you know the state department or has a long history of tragedy I've I've lived through a lot\nUh and uh you look at the guy the guy\nI'm a you know they they have done a tremendous course correction or the organization mild outfit is hired more agents\nAh they've they've now train they now train and protect with buildings on fire uh they've worked with empty and why to develop protocols for that or as an agent uh I was never trained at the state department or as to how to do that in a smoke filled environment so\nThere's been a lot of lessons learned and a lot of changes made and protection\nA been God's he was a mess I I mean ... Stevens never should have been there on September the eleventh or as the chief of mission of the president's representative to to Libya uh they pretty much can do what they want and he decided he wanted to go and he was there and he shouldn't have been\nAnd um [noise] the agents got overwhelmed and you know certainly the the CIA\nHeroes you know they came and uh and and got everybody out of the special mission compound there but uh [noise] um it's just a a another long list of disasters that has happened and and um let's let's hope that we don't see any more on the horizon\nHow many Libyans storm our embassy\n[noise] um ... do you recall the exact number I I don't remember off the top of my head\nAnd the Democrats are not held accountable the same way Republicans are\nWe have to live the systems that just\nRush Limbaugh reduced ten AM to one of the um news talk Ninety five point five which is where ... ... am nine Seventy buildings takes a huge huge ward and you're listening to news talk Ninety five boys\nWhat good show he crackdown object Callahan Fox News the U.S government taking action against several sell to use for the death of ...\nState Department is revoking visas for some members of the Saudi intelligence services royal court and other ministries\nThese penalties will not be the last word on this matter from the United states will continue to explore additional measures to hold those responsible\nAccountable in the oval office this afternoon the president stressed his administration is still gathering facts and the CIA director Gina Haspel will brief him soon on her trip to turkey to meet with their best to gators their boxes\nThe suit on her trip to turkey to meet with a dusty gators their flocks as rich as soon as the state department Turkey's president ... killing be turned over for trial in his country\nPresident Trump to get a briefing on the ... killing later today secretary Pompeo also issuing a warning to the thousands of migrants headed for the U.S southern border essentially turn around\nThe caravan will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances\nPresident Trump threatening to please the military over the border to stop the caravan\nAlthough remains of mystery exactly how the U.S plans to keep these roughly seven thousand people from applying for us asylum even with using the military complete shutdown of the border wouldn't be physically unlikely and economically unhealthy\nFood trays Gallagher at its current pays the mass of people still weeks away from reaching the U.S Mexico border\nSan Francisco's become the largest us city to give people in the country illegally and other non citizens the right to vote in local elections but only thirty five non citizens have registered to vote next month others apparently fearing the registering to vote would reveal their identities and the immigration status\nClaims of one winning tickets so far and Tuesday nights one billion six hundred million dollar lottery jak bought the tickets sold in California according to that state's lottery website\nMaking millions you have to confirm any winters Asian stocks closing Wednesday mostly higher now futures are done more than ... points [noise]\nBush has Fox News\n[noise] what it is this is Doris Brittany Henry and we're excited to be a part of Fox Nation because now more than ever we need powerful\nWe need Fox Nation they don't want to know and a Fox two favorites you already love accept\nLosing memory on they're going to be very PC hell no on the news more like Mason opinion donor\nI made the dot com and find out more\nShepard Smith there's so many streams of information coming summer designed to distract you and to mislead you when news is breaking you have to slow down we have to begin with what's most important I'm here to find out what happened\nTo report it without fear or favor in context in perspective to be honest brutally honest about every bit of we were\nEndless hours to make sure that when we delivered to you as fact\nShepard Smith on Fox News channel real news real honest opinion [noise] big\nYahoo heck few years ago that was led to a financial settlement with many of those affected\nThe company has agreed to pay fifty million dollars in damages and provide two years free credit monitoring services to two hundred million people whose email addresses and other personal information was stolen as part of the biggest security\nBreach in history that pat hinges on a federal court approval\nOf a settlement file this week in a lawsuit looking to hold Yahoo accountable for the digital breaches in twenty Thirteen and twenty\nFour team they weren't disclosed until twenty sixteen about three billion Yahoo accounts were hacked some the FBI linked to Russia the settlement cover that one billion of those accounts held by an estimated two hundred million people in the U.S and Israel twenty\nTwelve to twenty sixteen Lisa ...

then all of a sudden this object just burst run out of the ocean and often goes it's amazing\nThe ocean is a good place to hide it you know if you were up to a you know who knows what a lot of secret weapons and so on but it's a big or the ocean is is it not that there's been a lot of people who have thing that I think that maybe UFOs come from the ocean you know\nYou know maybe that's just one of the another thing that we can't possibly understand right now but a lot of people do see them\nWhy do you think people ... are so fascinated with the unusual and the paranormal hands you show my show I mean people love this stuff they can't get enough of that how come\n[noise] um [noise] I think it makes our lives seem a little a less oil and every you know and makes them a little extraordinary\nThat these things happening around us all the time you know we just don't ... that was the head of the book came from the haunted universe that maybe maybe we live in the universe where everything goes wrong and the other universes that it's supposed to be like as everything goes right maybe we're in the one\nThat you know um but um I don't know I've always\nFound it fascinating because you know you look it day to day life it just seems like there's a real pain to life and then all of a sudden you know somebody you know she's a goes to someone you know I've seen a UFO and and

people like to be scared you know I think there's an adrenaline rush and if that's why the you know a scary movie as a horror movies are so popular [noise] um I you know who knows I think it may go back to when we used to all sit around the campfire and you had to make sure that your alert all through the night so something that doesn't happen so\nYou know who knows but you know you're right a lot of people like it or in all forms of at the medium\nWell and we ... we want to be careful because you know we want to believe that big foot\nExist as a creature that it's not some ape out there in the woods we want to believe that you ... come from other planetary systems and it's not just some\n... nature throwing a plasma ... or anything like that we want to believe that there's an afterlife and goes to the real thing we really get disappointed when I you know the reality of some of these things pops up\nAnd you realize well this was just a natural occurrence or or\nYou know some kind of electrical discharge and the clouds or whatever it was he\nGets to be disappointing doesn't it\nShould because then you know once you get it it it makes the are let's say illusion of life young seem

that but they can't be an explanation for everything that's the way I I kind of look at it you know that there are the things that happen out there and you certainly a big part of it all kinds of different just strange things ah people see things and you know they all can be making up they all can't be hoax as\nA way of instances of the book where you know hundreds of people out of the people a different kind of paranormal type stuff [noise] so it has to be something behind it maybe it's all tied in together you know I'm Talking about this on the show a lot that may be big footing goes in UFOs Loch Ness monster all the whole thing\nAll comes from the same thing when the first people to think about that but we talk about it a lot [noise]\nUm but it's it's an endless fascination with us and with a lot of people\nWell and you write about this important aspect\nNot all these people are making things up or lying or mistaken in even if you have a hundred people\nIn Ninety nine of them are making up the stories that they she goes to new lows and big foot you've got that one person who's not lying who has seen something very unusual in that that's what fuels me that's why I continue looking for these answers\nBecause that that one person is the reason that I go after these stories\nUh-huh show it all it takes is one ghost story to be true and they might as well be true\nI tell Linda molten how who's a reporter Mac\nOr she's an expert in crops formations and a truly believes that most of the crop formations are made from other sources of the man\nAnd whatever those sources could be could be UFOs could be the earth doing it as a vehicle to communicate with us whatever it is she thinks most of them are done that way and I I've told her I says Linda\nIt doesn't matter because even if all of them except one ... is the unusual one it's amazing story it's it's the story of the lifetime\nAnd absolutely for sure and I are like a ghost story you know if you could talk to if there's one person was coming back here from the afterlife sets it most amazing thing that's ever happened ever\nWere you in the you were in the u._s. soldiers is a little boy were you raised religious Mac because there's a photo of questions that\nAre not really you know I I grew up in digester which was the kind of working class pot Abbas than you know we were we were Catholics and and I you know life kinda revolved around the Catholic Church and the school and you know and so on and so forth but not open not overly religious you know\nWhen you were you out there when Albert DeSalvo the Boston stringer was out there doing his thing\nSame neighborhood and I'm Sorry to say but\nYeah I thought so I thought what an amazing story that was social yeah it wasn't he a family man\nA well he had a ... kind of a not a drifter but you know he um he never really held a lot of stable job then you know there's a lot of people think that he didn't do it that he was actually framed by the cost because they needed somebody to um you know to to arrest and because there was I can remember it as a kid you know it was the headlines\nAll the time all the time you know this guy ... a lot of women right in in a little area and um you know there was some stuff that he didn't know about some of them are undecided but who knows but one once he went to jail they did stop so\nYeah they didn't stop and there could have been a few copycat something new to me that is true that we're always on the lookout for those haunted you accumulate\nThe stories for hunted universe how did you get them\nWell ah you know once again had boxes of all this different research and then for a while I work for Robin ...

a new light on the paranormal in fact it should be a book read by all people who wish to find out what is new and what is I guess not necessarily scientific which what science is doing now and how they're looking at the paranormal how we're looking at it with a different view\nRather than the tainted view of the new age we're looking at now I'm more practical less dogmatic view of the paranormal and of course Paul Leno is one of the men who ah you know have been one of the pioneers\nInvestigation of course he he ah he's\nBeen involved with several investigations has a how long have you been uh how long have you been interested in working a on paranormal projects in in ... been involved with paranormal the paranormal itself\nWell it's it's coming up on fifty years is collide a twenty tornado was fifty years time flies and having fun I should I should have like a district one thing the book isn't out yet it can be out another year okay so yeah but unless people storm last year for books in demand that they bring it out sooner but they might\nJust do it after tonight I mean they're getting a new view people are just eager to get new views on this stuff and I'm eager to because I'd rather I'd rather get ahead of the game and knowing what we're learning now in in usually people are saying on science like you said there's orthodox science and the snicker factor but I think the sticker factors going away what do you think\nWell it ... one of the problems in the sciences and it's not monolithic you know I mean there there are people who are in one field to don't talk to other people that are ... for example um one\nOf our our producers is a she works part time for us and she's a behavioral scientists he's an old old friend of mine ... way back in the seventies and her husband is a is a renowned I'm a behavioral scientist as well and I find that many people in that science particularly people on the University of deliberately don't we're teaching\nAcademics I don't\nKnow a lot about quantum mechanics you know uh the one of the problems of western sciences at ... again it's it's I see that the scientists are isolated from one to one another\nAnd reality it's not like that everything overlap stepping interact and we find that in the paranormal uh on steroids really so to speak ah so I think that that is a problem uh the isolation of one science from another but but that again maybe changing I think things are generally moving in the right direction as we discussed earlier\nYeah and and then we we come to the conclusion as we're discussing things are about for example\nA the idea of possession and it seems to be a very hot topic right now or the the Catholic Church of course is are discussing actresses a more a lot of people are turning witchcraft a lot of people are turning to ritual lifting cursing or ritual is thick uh I don't know what they call it to bring him to pass in ...\nAre now or the younger generations are turning to Generation Z is turning to decide calling a generation hacks\nFor lack of a better term um and and the question is is there a vibrant tore or some sort of a power that can I guess it's like really speaks to bring about a lot of things that are that we see as miracles or otherwise paranormal thing\n[noise] well I think before I even get to that climate we have to consider a couple of sociological factors okay ah the death of Oregon at the desk but but but the decline of organized religion or partially\nThrough its own fault shooting itself in the foot with with with the horrors like a clergy sex abuse and I'm really glad I wasn't ordained of the Roman Catholic Church amen would run into all that\nAre so there's that and and I often I always question everything even motives now and the Roman Catholic Church which I'm not been associated with it for forty years I still keep in touch a the Vatican a is a strange\nPlace I had friends there who were priests who were wonderful worked in the secret archives which really is such a thing and uh but you know like like they're going to tell me what's going on uh I get the impression however that\nThe emphasis on ... just as of today is uh\nMostly legitimate but there is a factor of distracting or the public from the clergy sex scandals as well and they\nKeep looking the other way so there are practicality is there a sociologically we live in a society where not to be cynical but most people never get any older than twelve\nAnd they act like it or the parents a lot of times uh many parents don't do parenting any more children are taught self control um you know and and you can get his basic is that for the reason why people are and you know are are looking and enacting\nA sort of a out of control [noise] on the other hand you have the decline of religion as I said which is leading to a a frustration among\nThe human species which really ought to be called homo Ottawa is rather than the hope of sacred and we really don't know much but we do worship we are constructed divorce was built for\nWorship when the worst part of the programming process because it seems to me that is we're looking into the possibility of living in sort of a matrix constructed by something that we're all programmed to do certain things act certain ways and it's all part of the process that's why we have the situation with politics today and religion today\nI mean these are ignoring war and I said no he didn't really even warned sorry with us\nOkay well I was in at one of them's hall semi doesn't sound like a Catholic somebody but it was\nAnd the faculty there was surprisingly friendly to my paranormal involvement the the one to be the ones before them we're not neither was my bishops [laughter] but uh I was home for Thanksgiving vacation it was November Nineteen Seventy four and Lorraine warren a tremendous cause you never turned down a meal cooked by Lorraine warned\nSo I innocently got into my a Nineteen sixty eight Ford failing and headed down a road eighty four to er Monroe, Connecticut where they lived and ah [noise] as soon as I got to their their lovely home in the woods uh Lorraine came leaping out the door and said are you in a high spiritual state right now\nActually I was at a terrible spiritual state because I was trying to decide whether to leave the Roman Catholic Church and and joined the the eastern orthodox church which I actually did but naturally I said oh yeah I'm great\nSo awfully went down to Bridgeport out to a little house people are surprised by the size of the place very small [noise] ah where all these are this activity was in full swing now what had happened wasn't there as there always is with these things\nUm I believed again these are parasitic all energies we were thinking they were demons and the person will get cynical entries will feed upon your fear your anger or even your annoyance and it starts out always very small in this case of started that was pounding on the walls the previous year out of the background here this is a child or they were\nThey weren't childless such the the son had died and they adopted a a Native American girl from Ontario, Canada a who was the name Marcy she was ten years old when I came into the case\nAnd they were all kinds of factors there having to do with her being kept in the house and the energy building up and all of a sort of thing so into the house and the place was a complete disaster or something had taken a a doll carriage owned by the little girl ...\nTaking things out of drawers and off shelves and put them into the Dow carriage and we'll get around that the first thing I actually saw\nA because there were there was a police presence all ready to people if they didn't know what to do an off duty officer lived across the street was a friend of the good and family that this is their name\nCalled in is on duty comrades and that's how the police first got involved [noise] ah there were also city engineers would come earlier before the evidence kind of broke and I'm trying to decide what the pounding was and whether a size making all this business so they were the house was full\nOf cops and when I got there and it wasn't just I went down with that more and Lorraine ah went down with father bill ... who was a Roman Catholic priest who was a ... they were hoping to have him perform in ... in the house now in the Roman shirts that is\nUrban who was a Roman Catholic priest who was a ... they were hoping to have him perform in ... in the house now in the Roman church that is very er an institutionalized in their strict rules about it and you have to get permission from the local bishop\nIn this case the bishop of Bridgeport of that never came over the better part of three days we were in this house the first thing that I actually saw\nWas at a heard was a huge chest of drawers and the little girl's room and nobody was in the room at the time fly across the room and smash against the wall thing that thing had to be several hundred pounds anyway a one point that they also uh I stood there with a three police\nPolice officers on one side three firefighters on the other and the ... the southerners watched a refrigerator about three hundred pounds of it float up off the kitchen floor kind of turned around a little and kind of set itself back down or one of the police officers backed out of the house\nBacked down the sidewalk sat in his cruiser and wouldn't come out\nAnd why are to blame him a again we thought these were demons but I was getting the impression from from the first minute I was in that house if there were four entities\nAnd they didn't seem evil and they were coming and going okay and interestingly enough uh another thing I was getting the impression was that when object would move and you know there were tables would flip over things with his kind objects to turn off the wall at one point I stood in back of of the little girl when she was my job was at\nWar and told me to watch little girl to make sure she wasn't doing any of this [noise] and um she was sitting at the table the the chair floated up\nI grabbed it and pushed it back down and it just that was one of the few times I felt that there was an entity president ordinarily um when things would move I didn't feel any entity present\nAnd I think it perhaps it's because of the [noise] the energies ... if you want to call the most diverse inter world energy use the permit the entrance of these things\nAre who hunt for lack of a better term I Believe today\nOr in in various worlds sometimes at the same time almost like an octopus I've seen cases where they've been I sold my so is my son\nA sort of the these things are hunting in various worlds at the same type or farming different families are people and and that seem to be about what's happening in this case but I was supposed to believe it was demons your servants of Satan who could be dealt with by ...\n[noise] so um as I said that never happened and probably the the the one of the scariest things as ever happened to me and my wife was on the Monday Night of the case\nUh twenty fifth of November Nineteen Seventy four of the warrants had left to be on some TV show 'em and I was in there with John South Dakota reporter from the Bridgeport post the family the three of them are in a neighbor\nAnd the little girl and I must you were playing monopoly for some reason this ten year old kid love monopoly something arrived\nThat's where I can put it in the kitchen of the house you could almost see a ... structure ah and then for these things as I said well obviously these ... these structures came down the hallway I put a little girl behind because I knew it was after her the other is kind of a word the living room\nBut but this thing came right in front of my face\nAnd I just I instinctively pushed against it\nYou know ... not expecting it to be a spirit you do now is the thing had a physical body this was one of the scariest moments not only because of that but because it shattered my belief system will\nSay body them skin or what exactly\nBone structure could we see it but you could feel it almost bird like bone and I'm I'm no one Adam is but it's the mullahs bird like to me but I was so shocked you know it got around me in ... through Marcy across the room\nThe energy in the house got so strong I pulled the family out and it's a good thing that the police have blocked off the street at both ends because there had been several ...\nAcross the room with the energy in the house got so strong I pulled the family out and it's a good thing that the police have blocked off the street at both ends because there had been several thousand people gathered outside the house because all the warns immediately told the press about\nNow it's ironic after I was thrown out of the seminary Nineteen Seventy seven I became a journalist and the last thing I Would do a having done this for forty years is to ah being a journalist I this is to call in journalists\nYou know they're the worst thing that's the worst thing [laughter]\nSo they were all over the place and end up ... they we when I went to call them orange they asked them to come back and this is the\nNo cell phones long before that I had to go to a neighbor's house and use the phone and the kid in the how not to do it gets all mom and the priest wants to use the phone or the the press was always getting mixed up with father sharp and they spent the both of us to come flying out the window as the priest it at the end of The Exorcist which had to come out the previous December\nAnd that that was the whole narrative so I called them and it took them an hour to get back in the city only ten miles from where they were a ... because of all these crowds and the traffic so we went I went back into the house and the the guy on the radio which had been left on was speculating why we have left the house right so\nEverybody had come down at that point\nBut um the whole thing sort of degenerated into chaos because the the following day the or the police uh we we left simply as we dated sometime and eat and get some rest and the police came and as soon as we left in and said this is the end of this the cities and chaos the kid did it\nSo the whole thing was struck up as a hoax by the ten year old girl you know fooling trained as a journalist and police officers and trained observers ... detectives or by throwing a three hundred pound refrigerators around and that is like super kid here\nRight who declared it a hoax in order to calm down with the area is where they ... yeah so ... born and I went on the radio for a couple of days after that we we we were um you know arguing with the cops\nAnd stuff they're tiny Marco show on on the um the local station he was a pretty well known guy at the time and I've been there and then the Thursday was Thanksgiving so I I kinda crawled home I looked like I just crawl out of a prison camp was I was skinny and ah I really finally got my dinner at that point ...\nIt was it was really I I think you can call the probably the best witness\nA suitcase certainly in modern times if not of all time and William J hall I don't know if you've been on your show but he wrote a really great book on that the world's most haunted house and I'm ... dug up on the one or not literally the witnesses were still surviving including myself and I learned things that I hadn't known and I was there\nYeah so but but again that there were many other things that happened in in my uh twenty sixteen book I wrote with my son a behind the paranormal everything and it was wrong I have a whole lengthy chapter on that case and and my own experiences during that but again I didn't think it was demons I thought that was wrong and that was something a lot more to it than that\nSo suddenly beyond demonic a

I ever dealt with the New Haven Connecticut Nineteen Seventy nine by using a joke books\nOkay now I wouldn't recommend that was just at the particular circumstances I think that's brilliant\nYou know I mean it just the humor I always I always tell my two sons that you know always last but not at each other keep a positive right a bit and I call it the Peter Pan theory\nThink happy thoughts what are these things feeding on they seem to to get stronger when there's negativity as I mentioned in Bridgeport you know the the anger 'em and they seem to get weaker or even repelled when positive energy as their\nHands humor a face no anything that's good ... that uh dispel the negative energy will cut off the food supply and they'll go somewhere else\nWho's brings up that is why again just brings up something I'd have to bring up after the break something that uh [noise] I also want to ask you about because I've asked you know people like Rosemary guy all you know there's a nail they agree with maybe ... bizarre but his two I'll ask you the the the do the one hundred thousand one point six billion dollar question coming up on the ground zero so\nBe waiting for it all you know was it on grounds rather read your phone calls in Tripoli fix every three thirty seven hundred has Tripoli fix every three thirty seven hundred I'm Lewis Jewish to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nThat okay well I mean what has been reading my question\nI've had several gas on the show are talking about the way to at least subdue or a I guess you'd say get a demon out or forced him out or somehow and tell to go\nAnd we always get in and one of the things that I I really really really hate is when I watch ghost or a hunter say go to the light the light and I and I\nSaid of the centers I say you know what that's like telling someone to go to the bathroom go to the bathroom I don't want to go to\nBathroom I don't want him to the same thing you don't tell it goes to go to like you don't tell a spirit to go to like the stupidest thing I've ever heard don't do that okay I always laugh and say well the the lives of trapped don't go there\nThe second thing is that so many people and I always get into arguments because I've had experiences investigating ghosts and investigating demons too and they always say all you got to say quiet does that rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ and it goes away no it doesn't and I've always had the argument no it doesn't\nBecause you cannot and I and I tell you that sometimes we have entities\nThat are in places that seem to be older or even pre atomic demons dinner there that it's somehow don't even know what we're talking about they just look at it didn't laugh I'm just curious is that I mean I I always say well that's the that's the first Arab I ought to to use if that doesn't work then what\nAnd and the ones that always works well no it doesn't always work\nOut can you tell me because I've been noticing to that in horror films lately they don't use Satan anymore they're using ... or ... or\nAs Modi is or other demons ... of course was in The Exorcist they're using all these other demons and people like going well they're all Satan anyway no they're not there are there there's a hierarchy of demons even Solomon said so so what's your take on the idea that the the the whole pie review and Jesus Christ\nOr antibiotic get rid of the ...\nWell if you believe it yeah\nYeah ... you don't just sit there like a lump Clyde and this stuff happens to you you bring something to it or whether it be a big sort of spirits us or whatever or possession or as as we call it now which is actually a voluntary bonding and I I I agree with everything he said\nWell I mean I\nI just don't see a point in bringing a priest into a Muslim household and an avid June he commanded by a Christian priest to get out of a home when the gym doesn't answer to Jesus\nAbsolutely I don't think there's theology is the same as ours at all [noise] yeah there are about nine different species of these things at least ... that we've dealt with\nThis is of existence that I assisted appraised with they were using them against us you know the whole ... you know the position of authority you know the the three different exercises and praise within the ritual itself the command to give its name a I think the most horrifying thing that ever happened to me was that at the time\nThey I I don't like to talk about this but we're in the St Lawrence state hospital when the priest demanded that the thing that we thought was possessing Barbara\nSeventeen year old girl a demand that or give it its name and and I told a priest as I said how do you know I was telling the truth you know a while because the U.S and it's it's a it's bound by the authority of Christ to tell us a trip and uh they they send the ritual because Jesus did it twice and the gossip was a bit but this thing\nUh I didn't believe it it said his name was chow C. H. A. O. L. I assume and ... and had told the girl that was a guiding spirit to her and all this business and\nIn my mind I didn't say it it just in my mind I said yeah right\n... the thing immediately addressed me in a language that turned out to be mainly of all things and the doctor had to look it up because he was recording all this I don't know where these tapes I remember there was a Vatican by now but he um\n[noise] they wouldn't tell me what he said at the ... until the end of the school year and a father a Lawrence the priest just said he didn't feel right not telling me what that was addressed to me he said yes and the thing I I when I was seven years old I witnessed my father's suicide and and that was something that got me into\nIt would be interested in what happened to my father right\nAnd this thing and perfect ... said that it had been there when my father had committed suicide and it had told him to do it had he had this thing spoken to me in English I Would have lost it obviously right there and and that's why they didn't want to tell me right so I've had to live with that the words of this thing\nAnd I just don't [noise] excuse me\nI just don't think these things have the same theology snow they're using it against us and it got stronger as a matter of fact within three years a barber was dead\nOf a drug overdose and of of the six or seven people we ah had to deal with at that point a father Lawrence after I graduated the left that had to ... ... exercise them again and the systems at times will take months involve several praise\nYeah it takes it takes a while and uh you know the reason why I I I used to be of the you know Jesus Christ works all things a mindset at one time I was at a a place uh they were ... they called me in\nTo do an investigation and it was a former theater former\nA mortuary that turned into a bar that turned into a bar in the bar was haunted had all kinds of problems that cream it tore him in the basement of all places it was hard it was crazy and uh we decided that we were going to go in and we had this room and we wanted to find out just what was going on you know what was haunting the place\nAnd one of the things that happened and this is the scariest thing that's ever happened you know when you when you do say ounces or when you do things like this you always tell people one if you're going to be part of the aunts you can't have any alcohol at least after you're done you can go have whatever beer you want but don't have any alcohol don't come into the sounds drunk don't come into the say on\nA you know the the way you used the energy and medications because it's a definitely create a problem\nAnd we had a woman that demanded that you come into the stay on that we were doing to try and contact whatever's going on there come to find out what happened is we had corners in the same lines where women that were standing the corners of the same wants to make sure watching everything to make sure everything was going okay no demons or anything or getting into the room\nWe're using a several ways several or goals to look into what was going on and oldest\nOr anything or getting into the room where we're using a several ways several or goals to look into what was going on and all of a sudden I'm I realized something was wrong in the circle\nAnd I noticed the women in the room were ... over you know there were doubling over in pain every woman was doubling over and pain except for this one young girl who was at the table and his older woman and I was seeing what the hell's going on here all of a sudden and this is not no joke\nAnd I have a a a guy named Aaron who I worked with who was doing this and he was there with me and there was another girl and said you worked at me as well she was kind of like describe what we're getting from ... from other things and\nAnd uh all of a sudden these are the demon we've found it was a demon calls itself the average suit\nAnd I realized what was it was the demon that hunt down children in the womb and kills them\nAnd I was noticing all the way we're doubling over now I realize that something was wrong and I and I told everybody to get away get out of a get out of the bar they all had to evacuate we evacuated the bar come to find a there was a woman the woman who demanded to be in the sale has actually had been drinking that night and we found out she was pregnant\nAnd we were furious because this was something that attracted a demon\nAnd the demon was actually a Mesopotamia demon that basically hunted down women to go into their homes and killed her children and the reason why these women were doubling over is because of the fact that whatever was going on in that room that demon was going from woman the woman to try and find that baby\nAnd the only reason why the older woman didn't double over she had a hysterectomy and the other girl was not of age to be in a bar and we found that out too\nAnd so this was one of the scariest moments I ever had and it wasn't the power of Jesus that had to take it out we had the command that calling upon angel after angel and\nEven some of the names of other demons and and and just calling out we had a a medium there we had a priest there we had a number of people there and we were doing every everything we can my poor friend Aaron who was working with the he was actually shot indoor wall and he\nWas stuck on the wall as if he was Velcro to the wall and he had asthma and he could not breathe so we had to get 'em an inhaler and once he took a ... he fell off the wall it was the scariest experience I ever had to that because one person violated the rules\nYou know that's the thing is when you're doing things like this people don't realize how powerful it is and they will challenge it\nThey will challenge it by either being drunk or drug or they'll do something that they're not supposed to do and that's why we hear horror stories about ... that's where your horror stories about turtle cards is because people don't realize how powerful they are and they play with them as if their toys and they're not towards its like play with a plastic bag you put over your head you'll suffocate\nAnd that's that's how I feel about that what do you say about that\nOh I agree a hundred percent meaning shut them down the sides on the first place well yeah you know\nWe ... we had to do it though because we we were the ghost investigators were that we had and they were good investigators they're competent ones\nWe had a priest that they demand that because the problem was that the the building was having all kinds of problems I mean they had sort of backing up they had this black towering dues back you up in the in the uh in the basement\nAnd they said it was this this has happened to go horror stuff Clyde what are you going to do so I organized a group of people to go in and and take care of it\nBut uh you know one of the things they did was they wanted to hold a say on ... and and it was very well done uh but we made sure we had to make sure that people that came in were responsible and apparently they weren't", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to
