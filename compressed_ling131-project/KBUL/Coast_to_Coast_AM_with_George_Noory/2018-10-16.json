because we're apt to overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook temple things if you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule ...\nAction there's an esoteric and a cult dimension to the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences\nFrom cyclical research to quantify the arising we have made the determination over the past eight years that time is not what we think it is linear time is basically a very powerful illusion that we use\nTo organize our lives and it's a necessary illusion but if it's an illusion that means that we are selecting events all the time for him across in and finish to to possibilities so I don't use the term manifest I use the term select and you can select events under the right circumstances\nWithin exquisitely focused and the motive Lee charged thought and that's what's going on we are selecting and the same way that when you take a measurement and the particle lab\nYou're very decision to take that measurement will affect what you experience the same is true in our life\nCan you use these powers to affect your health\nWithout question and and I have to emphasize that we live under lots of laws and forces or one of them is a lot of physical declined one of them is a law mortality there's never been an exception to that but one must never feel that you're without devices that year without tools in the book I write about extraordinary\nCases of spontaneous remission of diseases which doesn't mean that is going to happen to people all the time I Would never extend false hope but the cases are there the occurrences are there and we have to probe and look at these things very often they correlate with intensive\nA meditation people who have meditative three hours a day have recorded instances in the medical literature of remission of diseases not all the time but it has occurred\nYou say that when you were writing the book or something weird happened with the rock band the monkeys\nOh it was George talk about us all being loosen time a couple of summers ago I was getting into the music of the monkeys just completely out of the blue and my wife thought I was going nuts my kids were memorizing there\nWould think you were going nuts yes you would think that no one could imagine what they did have a few good song\nThey really did they had some beautiful pop songs [laughter] and I was playing them all the time I was getting into them everybody thought I was going crazy I couldn't figure out why I was getting into the monkeys\nGeorge it was months and months later that I got a call from an editor at the Washington Post who said to me do you know Mike Nesmith who was one of the members of the monkeys I said no\nHe said that you know Nesmith just wrote a memoir and I said no and he said did you know he was a Christian Scientists which is a a a a healing and and mentally based on a form of spirituality I said no he said well we'd like you to\nIn a a review Nesmith a memoir for the Washington Post the you interested and I said of course I'm interested in I told him this story of how months before without any for thought about any of this\nI started getting into the monkeys and I actually put this into the review and the Washington Post to its credit included this material that was just the weirdest thing that it was almost like retro causality in a way whereas if I was loose from linear time this is why I'm saying that time is not what we\nThink it is I was completely prepared for that opportunity because for reasons that no one could understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason seemed to be off in the future so to speak but my contention is it wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once which is why mental focus is so effective\nI was sixteen when the monkey started plane was there a long long\nOne of the members was Mickey ... that's right who played Sherk is boy on television right that's\nRight and and still touring still touring\nYou yeah who is still going that's an absolutely nuts I Love them [laughter]\nAnd you you know the named Joseph gallon burger money chance I don't ... I wrote a couple of books one called liquid luck oh of course All right I Know the book I Know he he would conduct experiments still does in Las Vegas with groups of people ... ...\nEach each trying to prove that positive thinking in the mind has a lot to do with influencing things that happen that's\nRyan and he is totally convinced and he's convinced me too that if you go into a situation like Las Vegas upbeat and you know just you know positive about things the odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is\nThat outlook has been validated by Syria CSP research my hero J. B. Ryan pioneered scholarly ESP research at Duke University in the early Nineteen thirties J. B. is now deceased and one of the things that Jay be found that he just buried this in the foot notable book with its monumental\nThat when his subject in the ESP lab and these were people tested under very rigorous conditions when they had a feeling of hopeful expectancy when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were positive their scores\nSpiked when they were bored when they were down cast when they were fatigue their scores death\nAnd it was inevitable ... spike followed mood it's the same thing that he says in the book\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't have to be Las Vegas down in ... you know putting that black cloud over your head for whatever reason yeah he's not going to happen for you\nIt's not going to happen and the thing that I always tell people is\nAnd again this one of these familiar things but listen very carefully to it you must really wanted you must really wanted if you're a person who's attitude is neither here nor there about winning in Vegas where the lottery or money or whatever\nIt's not going to work it has to be something that you really want which is why it's so important to me that surely identify your most heartfelt desires there's real power there because the power comes from an emotionally charged thought\nWe're talking with Mitch Horwitz his latest book is called the miracle club as a matter of fact we are going to tell you how you can\nGet a membership in the miracle club a little bit later on in the program his website is his name all linked up for you at coast to coast day I'm dot com it's amazing how did how did you decide to write this kind of a book\n[noise] you know was funny I had written a history of the positive mind moving a couple of years ago called one simple idea and I began to realize\nEvery chapter that I wrote every person who I talked about in the book I was using their methods I was road testing these things myself\nAnd I thought to myself look if I'm experimenting with these methods myself and that's what's driving my historical research why am I right about the methods why don't I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques and it was a big step because\nA lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves as believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted to share\nWith readers the actual hands on things I Do in my own life\nHow powerful is our human mind Mitch\nIs powerful in ways that our generation is only coming to understand look we are realizing that things work out there like placebo surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George\nAnd lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them things that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated\nI think this universe is ultimately mental that doesn't mean that we don't live under many laws and forces but if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs that the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have a natural experiment that the thoughts change the brain you were sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter\nSo if fought changes the brain and fought has to be something that extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nLook we're human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't care if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method it works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel project one of the things that I read about in the book is that we live\nWithin a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces the law of mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by math the mind is the same way circumstances\nAre going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're ordinance that we experiment very clearly and very carefully\n... going to come back and talk more about

with Mitch Horwitz as we talk about his latest book which is called the miracle club ... thoughts become reality will take your calls and your stories\nNext hour as well how does the S P fit into this Mitch you were talking about it briefly but the ... I I tend to think there's a very deep rooted tie in here\nYou know there is without question you know we've experienced in this country about eighty years of serious cyclical research serious experiments that the ESP creek admission telepathy and George the evidence is simply overwhelming and what we're seeing in the S P lab is that the mind\nPossesses extra physical qualities there are ways\nThat we receive and get and give information that go beyond the five census once we've come to grips with the fact that the mind is extra physical but the mind has an existence outside the fence eight body it open the door to all kinds of possibilities we realize we are not just\nMaterial beings and it helps confirmed to us that\nOur thoughts to make a difference in the world we may be like sending and receiving stations we're always looking for people to help us with projects to give us a hand to meet us\nHalfway and as I was mentioning in the last segment Jay be running the grade ESP researcher found that ESP result spike in the laboratory based on the enthusiasm of the subject so that gives you a different perspective on how important your thoughts are what actually happens to you may be based on\nYour emotions your enthusiasm your focus\nThan you believe that you can just change your entire life this way you get a better job maybe find the relationship you're looking for just about all that stuff\nI Do believe that but the here's the key thing and this is really the magic key if there is one behind all of our\nSelf help systems you must wanted with everything and you you must wanted with passionate intensity and we often tell ourselves that we want things without scrutinizing and examining our convictions\nDo we really wanted for example we say we want a job when what we really want is security we say we want a new relationship when what we really want maybe is is is something else you know to move to a different city or\nSurety we say we want a new relationship when what we really want\nMaybe is is is something else you know to move to a different city or to have a different domestic arrangement or to somehow rearrange the furniture of our lives it's very important that we get down to the essentials of what we really want before we put a label on it because\nI Would contend that what you want\nOver time you're going to get do people know what they want\nThat is really the key thing we tell ourselves well we want you know we say gee I Want a better job I Want romance I Want to live you know in this city versus that city but my\nUrging people might urging people and this is something lister is can do right now is to sit down with a pencil and paper and for a mature stained sustained period of time really write down your deepest desires\nYour deepest wants think about this dwell on this be private about this don't talk to anybody about it'd be intimate\nAnd see if they channel in one direction discover what you want to or because sometimes we repeat things to ourselves by rote and they don't represent are really passionate heartfelt desires get in touch with your desires you may think you have but I Would contend that few of us actually have\nMitch how close you echoed the secret that story or is it different\nI ... it's different in some ways I have a lot of respect for run to burn and the secret but I rarely use the term lava traction because\nI don't believe we live under one mental super law I Believe that given the circumstances we live under we experienced many different laws enforces the law of gravity as I was saying and the previous segment\nSo I think it's a mistake to think that our minds and our thoughts are the only game in town so to speak they are part of the game they are part of the game and that's important enough that's essential enough\nYou write about how people travel back into time to help their current life yeah but can't that also be dangerous\nYes it can and it's a very interesting prospect this is why I tell people be careful of what you're thinking about be careful of what you're doing because\nYou know we like to play games with ourselves and we'd like to say gee you know if I could travel back into time and give advice to my Fifteen year old self what would I say well my contention is you may be doing that all the time that may be happening all the time\nLinear time is very likely a very powerful illusion that we used to organize our lives but what we've discovered\nIn the hard sciences as well as over the course of testimony from centuries\nIs that life is intimate everything is happening now there was an infant a tube of events occurring at once and we select among them\nSo it could be that we are selecting among events past president future all the time and yet these things feel very real to us very set in concrete to us but I Would contend that when you think about going back and giving advice to a younger self\nYou may actually be doing that so be careful be careful we are granted perspective we are granted some perspective but use your mind use your thoughts carefully because things that\nYou may think of as a novelty may actually be concretely real\nPut it all into Apple's stock that's when they come back well\nWell who knows George you know who knows the guy who owns Apple's stock right now you know he may have just had that fought based on what you said and he's experiencing that his concrete reality whereas there might have been another reality operative in his life a few minutes ago\nMitch what is the third day mental challenge a\nThirty day mental challenge is something that I invite everybody to join me and it's very very simple and any coast listener who emails me I Will send them a little instruction sheet you basically\nEverybody to join me and it's very very simple and any coast listener who emails me I Will send them a little instruction sheet you basically right out a pledge\nThat for the next thirty days you were going to dedicate your mind to everything that as productive progressive forwarding you're not going to think of negative events of the past you're not going to think of unpleasant possibilities of the future you're going to think that every reasonable ambition\nIs within your grass you make up a grid of thirty days you do this for thirty days it's your private experiment just see what happens see what happens it sounds easy but it's not it's very difficult and if you fall off the horse you don't have to restart the thirty days you just get back on the horse\nThe ideas to just try to direct your mind in the direction of that which is positive and productive for thirty days see what happens when you give thirty days to the possibility of experiencing a whole different life and I will do it with you I Will do it with you and if you're having a hard time\nYou can write to me you can email me and say you know I really fell off the wagon last night

like that anyway wonderful how powerful do you believe in and I will say I believe in this war since I've gotten emails back\nAfter the fact that people say you know so and so's thing was cured and this like that but how powerful deeply prayer is\nI really do believe prayers powerful and it's for this reason I don't think Mother Nature plays cruel tricks on us there are instances and there are times in life where somebody is feeling\nSo depressed and facing such difficulty that they can't do the things that aren't prescribing they can't direct their minds in a positive way they are all kinds of methods and techniques I can give them let's face it\nThere are times in life where we feel crushed by circumstance [noise] that's one prayer comes in that one prayer comes in prayer is an escape hatch from the difficulties of our own psyche from the difficulties of life circumstances when we can do nothing else\nWe can pray and there's no wrong or right right way to pray\nIt's an escape hatch from our own psyche so again I I don't think we've been put into a cosmic framework the tricks us I think we've been given away out\nWhen we can't use our minds and the way I'm describing

challenge that we face in life\nLet's go to the keys in Rochester New York Yankees go ahead\nI yes I have several questions for Mr Horwitz class envy usually is not good but there are these persistent studies that show\nThat home your family is now where you're born ... really do determine where you end up in life [laughter] I see this all the time I get highly myself by heart fast city resident and\nEven though a lot of us in the city have different backgrounds and circumstances there still good people in the city when they just can't seem to get ahead and this would lead me to my second question ah people really have a hard time just visualizing where they might end up and then I Want to bring up the horrendous\nCar crash in skull Harry New York ...\nDouble oh ... I ... I was reading some of their ... and many enough of these people were truly professional in their lives you know one\nBecause there was evidence before the crash of something bad was about to happen I Know myself I Would have spoken up and said get me out of this debt trip but these those people Mr Horwitz of the\nUpper middle class the all basically we remained mom no one spoke up their their very lives were coming to an end and yet you say a from a ... a higher exalted background that people should know but the ... they were like many people and society they\nThey were conditioned to stay quiet and it ended up costing there are a lot there were twenty people killed Eighteen in limbo not one spoke up to say this has got to stop pull over now and they could have but they didn't like she\nDoes say if they want to their deaths\nSort of wrap all of this up um whether me in the city and seen my fellow city resident and many of them\nGood enough but not getting ahead and then in school Harry these upper middle class people not speaking up for themselves I'd like you to tide us together and so far as why to say it if I have to like sheep\nSo many people go to their dome and they just can't bring themselves to grab themselves by their lapels and just speak up for themselves and say gosh darn just let all of this stop and let us all come together and do something about it\nAnd she let me let me ask you because we have the story the night it happened it was a tragedy for sure but what are you\nCome together and do something about it\nAnd she let me let me ask you because we had the story the night it happened it was a tragedy for insurance but what do you mean\nBy should tell somebody to stop what was going on inside that limo ... uh\nThere are indications that the car was basically used my term coming apart that they are people are saying uh amongst the victims 'cause they had cell phones that we can't we can't even hear each other next to each other\nOr talk to\nThe car was being coming very noisy and and literally coming apart at the scenes and you would think that intelligent people and many enough of for both of you these were quite professional people would noticeably higher ... middle class jobs where they should\nHave had the smart the no out just to say I'm going to speak up here get this driver to pull over and I know because you've heard me before me teeth oh that driver would have pulled over no if fans\nOr you know I I Would have wanted to be in that limo would you you would have stopped that guy\n... you know what there's a lot to unpack and we'll keep is saying and of course I I read that same news coverage now you know there's a new age expression there are no accidents and I break with that expression I don't I don't abide\nBy that everything happens for a reason\nRight right one of the things that are right in the book\nIs you know as I've been alluding we live under many laws enforces we experienced many laws in forces and I've never including love accident including accidents birth for example\nNow peer pressure as as Keith was alluding is an extremely powerful force then it can be a destructive force one must never get caught up in peer pressure because it can be a kind of group mentality regardless of whether it holds you too where you've been born or it keeps you from speaking\nUp if you're seeing something that you think is dangerous it's vitally vitally important that\nEverybody acts with independent agency that doesn't mean you can escape accidents that doesn't mean you can escape tragedy but my contention is\nThat the mind is one vital element that participates that participates\nIn other things that are going on and it is extremely important to exercise it at all times you're never without devices whether you're facing a crisis or based on the accident of birth and economic class I Can't tell you and I would never tell anyone\nThat there aren't crushing forces socially and economically there are but the fact is the mind is one vital tool and your belt that you can always use\nAnd it can make all the difference at a crucial moment it is one thing we think of ourselves as having mines that control cognitive and motor function and that's true but there's more to it than that there's more to it that the mind is extra physical properties\nAnd it doesn't mean that it necessarily determines everything and every force that occurs or comes into her life but it's one vital tool and my messages\nUse it use it always and everywhere and in every circumstance whether its environment\nAs Keith was alluding to or whether it's a situation that you think is going to be hazardous never feel bound by peer pressure there is no more wanting force of your own will ineffectiveness in potency than peer pressure it must be escape\nLet's go to Thomas a lawyer in California you know like I'm going like\nGeorge thank you for taking my call very up beat

that\nYour imagination has your reality yes really the outside of events but it's your own human imagination yes\nCreates your reality yes\nYes devil is truly my hero and for any listeners who haven't heard of him he was a British bar Baden mystic who lived and worked in America died in Nineteen Seventy two and if the caller was describing never taught that your imagination is God and that the God of scripture Old Testament New Testament is really a metaphor\nFor your imagination and everything that you see and experience including my own voices you're hearing it right now is really coming from within you it is rooted in you I Am rooted in you as you are ultimately rooted in God and that everything\nThat happens to your relationships your experience you're listening experience right here and now is really your emotive thoughts of mental pictures pushed out\nInto the world so that was never teaching that your imagination is God he was very simple it was very practical and I write about him

your listeners because I find that there ... there are people who experiment with things who actually try things and and and I I I Love hearing from every one of them\nYou say you can lose weight you can get stronger you can do all kinds of things he's using the power the mind\nIt's absolutely crazy there was a Harvard study and George this is the God's honest truth and I give the details in America club is a Harvard a clinical psychologist named Ellen Langer she did a study on hotel maids\nShe found that if she explained to hotel maids the fact that their jobs are actually robotically an anaerobic Lee healthy and then studied the maids for six weeks compared to a control group who had been told nothing\nShe found the group that had been educated about the aerobics benefits of their jobs actually lost weight they didn't do anything differently they were just\nIn that you needed to realize that their jobs or anaerobic Lee and robustly healthy they lost weight and their blood

talked about his work the miracle club the books available for you and we'll get to your calls as well fascinating work much and what's even greater about all this it really does work\nIt really does work you know I always tell people that would never give somebody an exercise that I hadn't road test and treat every reader as I Would a member of my own family every single method technique exercise in this book is something that I Would give to my own kids to use it really does work\nWe briefly touched on your thoughts about people going back into time in order to help their current life how do you do that\nYou know Georgia simple as just focusing mentally on what for example you might want to tell your younger self\nThat something that you are to us we often think of that as novelties so it's easy to picture I made the determination and I write about this and the final chapter of the miracle club at once I had come to feel that linear time was\nBasically an illusion and everything it's\nAnd if you can actually enter into a relax meditative state and\nPicture of yourself into the scene going back giving advice to your younger self or whatever age maybe you want to avert a tragedy or disaster maybe you want to dispense a piece of advice\nIt can change your life right here and now in the present but be careful because sometimes things that we as experience\nAs challenges or tragedies also bring maturity to her life they also bring refinement to her life so you don't necessarily want to raise something that was a difficulty because that might have been a springboard to some sort of greater maturity or lessened\nSo reflect very very carefully\nOn what you want to tell your younger self and then imagine yourself into that scene\nImagine yourself into that scene write down what you want to tell your younger self because by writing it down you'll be able to actually have some sort of a compass point or vantage point from when you can tell whether things are different and I think you will find that things will be different\nWhy do you say that it could be dangerous to do that\nWell because if we go back and we race adverse cities we could be a racing something that taught us a vital are necessary lessons sometimes\nThe aspects of our lives that were most proud of came to us from adversity so we want to be very careful this is not a game this is not a toy is not something to play around with you want to be really sure that whatever the consequence you want to go back and encourage your younger self to do something\nHealthy unimportant and productive but don't think of it as just avoiding tragedy because tragedy can actually be a springboard to maturity\nNow here's the sixty four thousand dollar question Mitch yeah so how does it work\nHow does it work that\nIs the question and I don't shy from that question the fact is I don't think we manifest things I think we select\nThings I think as in the particle lab everything in our lives as in super position and it becomes localized only when we focus on it as if we are almost drawing up a matrix grid and when we isolate a spot or point in time on that grid we experience\nIt as being as vividly real as my voice that you're hearing right now so our actual act of life is an act of selectivity what we emotionally and mentally picture rise and focus upon is the experience\nThat we enter into because everything is happening at once and we go in and out of these things the way a particle goes from a wave state and then it collapses into a localized particle steak select\nVery carefully time is infinite and our minds our sensory tools are a measuring device by which we can help decide exactly what we're going to experience\nLet's go to Mary in Rock Hill South Carolina on

not to try just as a friend was describing golden room or looking at him or you can do it right now and just assert\nIn an emotionally persuasive way\nThis is going to happen this is going to unfold

know but that won't happen wink wink nudge nudge the nine eleven happened right and I'm Wondering how did that happen wow and how easy we're ... we're forgetting\nI think we need to go back and start remembering who was responsible for why we're in right why we're here in the first place\nThey had nothing to do with Republican or Democrat and everything to do with people plotting\nBehind the scenes mostly neo cons neoconservatives\nPlanning a conspiracy\nAnd they did so by writing that project for new American Century increasing our defenses they they wanted to increase our defenses may do anything and their power to do so\n\nAnd I think that when we're looking at the the global establishment and you're looking at people behind the scenes you there are people behind the scenes you don't even hear about in the news that are that are far more despicable they're the ones we're told the heat seriously and they're part of the global establish or they're part of this\nNational world order and what they've done is they they they risen up against the people and the people who responded by radicalizing political ideology this by all intents and purposes eating America from the inside\nIt truly is\nAmerica's eating itself and it doesn't get it's eating itself because ... that that's what the global swung out through a global establishment is a staff that they put together the idea that hey we have this process and and he's counting processes greet a large number of people\nThe idea that hey we have this process and and he's counting processes create a large number of

agendas provided by that stabbed or secret government that wishes to pave the way for an allegiance to the new world order\n\nI didn't think I Would say the thinking how are you to think that the war on terror\n\nHas been replaced with a war of ideologies\nAnd so when the war on terror it's been supplanted with this\nYou know who the enemy is right the enemy\nIs your neighbor the enemy are your friends the enemy or those you used to think had the same ideology or the same political\nLeanings as you\nI mean what was the last time you heard about a terrorist attack on the United states how long has it been since ISIS has been in the news\nHow long has it been since we heard that some Middle Eastern group is decided to bomb a part of the United states or or or or or or do anything terrible that you haven't heard it you know why\nBecause the war on terror has been replaced with the war in America battlefield America\nIt was a dream of people like John McCain he's dead now but you know hey ... the idea that lives on that the enemy is among us what was it the pogo said we've seen the enemy\nAnd he's us\nAnd so what triggered it all why are we this way well because we never really had a time to heal we didn't know we had to continually ... I mean look it can be said that after the attacks of September eleventh\nThe what we saw was a never ending war that is imperiled rather than advanced American ideals by becoming about dominance rather than freedom it's all about dominance has nothing to do with liberty or freedom as everything to do with who is bigger who's bigger who's smarter who has the best ideas who could ratchet up the motions to get people to think like they do\nI mean the whole future after nine eleven happened was an open ended future of war without end and political division over the implementation of state socialism all over the world so it is\nJust summing up that way I mean it's as simple as that the minute the discussions started about state socialism the minute we started talking about who has who has it\nBeen made it we start talking about who is victimizing who wasn't victimize the division began\n\nAnd so you have this Trump but Hillary thing going on right now but Trump Trump but Hillary Hillary but George Bush who's heat but ...\nDon't don't talk about for I'm just talking about but Trump Hillary if someone is down nothing happened\nBefore but Trump but Hillary nothing [noise]\nBecause you you talked to me well that's all that's all they want to talk about about Trump and Hillary [noise] but Trump but Hillary but Trump buddy Hillary but but but but but but Trump but every I smell it by coming oh it's about Hillary no or not and about Trump [noise] this is where we are now and it never used to be that way [noise] it's all about but [noise]\nUm to president surveillance and military deployments some thirty seven to tell them thirty seven countries\n\nThe war on terrorism made the U.S presidency a threat to its citizens and democracy presidents George W.

on the on the towers and the Pentagon and then\nWe were warned that anyone who engaged in conspiracy theory was jeopardizing freedom\n\nHow we engage our enemies mattered enormously for our society evolves and now our society has grown more fragmented and unequal because [noise]\nWe're not we're not fighting against the real enemies of the states were fighting against each other so basically so back to where all enemies to each other we're all enemies of the state and one day someone's gonna wake up and go\nHey you know we ought to do with these guys says they're all bad to each other well just label him all terrorists and won't put up the gulag open up the walls and the and and and put up the barbed wire keep everybody in America and not let them get out\n\nFreedoms becomes him to use

very bad situation we cannot let this happen to reporters to anybody\nHowever inside knowledge inside knowledge indicates that gift show he was about to blow the lid off of deep state players and their interaction with Saudi Arabia\nAnd his bombshell would've collapsed Saudi influence around the world however if the Turks are correct like your show he was murdered by the Saudis President Trump said that it would be major consequences and one can only speculate that he could very well decide to stop backing the Saudis entirely\nIs also report that can show you may have gleaned highly sensitive inside information on what actually happened on September eleventh two thousand one of the attacks on New York in the Pentagon\nEven more intriguing\nAre us media reports now emerging that

actors\nOn a worldwide level\nTo show he went from interviewing Osama bin Laden the Nineteen eighties becoming one of the most prominent journalist in his country [noise] and then he went to self

hijack three commercial airplanes that day were Saudi nationals\n\nPrince Turki has subsequently been named in two thousand two lawsuit mounted by families with the nine eleven victims\nAnd there's little suggestion that he was wittingly involved in organizing the terror plot later public comments indicated the prince Turki was horrified by the atrocity but the question is did he knows the impending incident and did he alert U.S intelligence which then did not take any appropriate action to prevent the nine eleven attacks Jamal to show he knew\nAll of those secrets he he served as a trusted media advisor to prince Turki before the latter resigned from public offices in two thousand seven following the nine eleven attacks turkey was the Saudi ambassador to both of us and Britain\nSo the conspiracy theory here is that ... show gate and his clothes dealings with prince Turki over the years may have gleaned highly sensitive inside information on what actually happened on

basically been kissing their houses for a long time\nAnd we gave it to them after World War one\nAnd and and the thing is is that now they pulled something or that someone has pulled something in the

very bad position especially before the election and the fact that I said before\nAnd I said I think I said on the audience Jones show I said that I think our next step is to destroy the economy and

... he's okay well that can't happen but it is happening look at all the diversity or I mean like that's happening with the Arab by a little up or you got all these\nA fraction of the people that are just pitching a fit about everything and then the country if you look at things weren't being the stabilized everywhere\nMine we are being ... all the countries all the countries that ah you don't want to hold on to the sovereignty and their freedom or being stabilized and make the United states is a big priority that's when they want they want it done\nAnd they look at our our ... our economy on one hand there by like ... even Trump try and say oh we're doing great but then on the other hand you look at or losing jobs and some of these plants closing down we're losing fat or losing all these laws and\nAll the ... certainly uh sounds like we have agreed economy and you know another thing I'll tell you this you know how you judge there there are three ways you judge economy of words going one how much is a Big Mac to how much is it to go to a movie and breathe how much is the lottery worth tomorrow\nYep that's how you join in the lottery the lottery is over or nearing a billion dollars the economy has gone to help these people wouldn't be buying that many lottery tickets it'll be the case that\nYou I mean that's what I'm saying you know in in everybody's looking at the fact that all the\n... and all these people you know saying oh Trump's you know not doing this in in deep states not doing this but if you look at the way things are going it's set up for ... like you say a kind of a a global\nSituation and I do believe that Trump I'm not saying he is the um like I say the leader of that but he has something to do with that I mean\nYou look at when he was going through I guess say in the Republican nomination of getting that I mean everybody really thought he was a joke at first and then he is\nAnd now he's president and all this stuff's\nOn the job I mean I I was very it was a contender I mean I have I mean I I had I had my doubts about whether you win\nThat's what I mean let's say a total joke joke but I'm just saying he he was not a contender in there really and then all of a sudden he's president now and then look at what he's saying he's actually doing it but I think part of it as far as a stabilizing all of the country over\nOn vacation or no I don't think he's involved with destabilizing the country the country was already having a\n... have you on the elevator straight into our way is oh no no no no the\nStorage please you need to stop focusing on Donald Trump and you stop focusing on Hillary Clinton you need to go beyond that you need to go beyond where we started seeing this stuff happened after the nine eleven attacks like you need to start looking at the socialism that was being pushed on the American people after that\nThe idea of the project of a new American Century and the neo cons were pushing that issue of expansion in the middle east\nAnd all that and put that into perspective Donald Trump he's probably fully aware of just how fragile things are right now he's he's acting presidential weeks he's trying\nTo I was a part in it\nWell maybe maybe he's upon it maybe doesn't understand he doesn't understand this who's in control I think he may think he's in control I think the American people who voted for him to be even control\nBut I don't think he's in control I think we've said has been ... and they're not going to let up but he's still fighting like hell because he won't go down without a fight because of his ego and that's fine because these shows that he if you if you get angry at them you hear me ... three times as hard\nAnd people want that and leaders they want a leader who's willing to fight that and that's where they do it but it doesn't make it right it doesn't make it wrong it just makes Donald Trump Donald Trump\nAnd it doesn't matter how much bullying you'll do in the inner how much money to do in the end it we're screwed we're screwed and that's the point and and it won't matter if Trump that all those great and wonderful things they're going to throw that all of them like slot big it\nWas ... ... you're saying you're thinking that he's the one that stinking ... great but he's actually on that's helping each state has all this\nHow is the helping stabilize housing he's I don't even effective at night if he's doing it\nLooked at the divisiveness in this country right\nNow by divisiveness not Trump the media is doing that the media settlers from ... from this on\nThe chest and go into all these well\nHere's what's wrong with him going to rallies I mean what what's wrong with him going to rallies it I Would I Can't marry held rallies that really held rallies ... rock Obama held rallies George Bush held rallies why what's the point\nBut you did not see all the problems with those rallies you did not see all the protests you did not see all him\nBecause they kept them had any did you know that when George Bush went down or when he went down a ... I guess ... Pennsylvania Avenue the parade they have in Washington his car would beg the whole time nobody saw that 'cause they kept the cameras out the fact that he was to me that the uh the limousines were being egg\nI mean they say though he look Trump and everything's doing it's the whole situation that is the stabilize the whole world is\nSaid now these stabilization happened before the election\nNo I'm not saying they that's how it started I mean that's how he got in there I mean it's all these stabilizing and I think what he is he getting credit care smart he's taking advantage of the situation\nTo set everything else on nearby so worried about these elections coming up that you know if all of a sudden all Democrats get it over there or throw him out of office no it doesn't matter who go in there\nI think you have I think he drove through my head and I think I think he's more clueless and George W. Bush was I think you\nAnd then again I don't I don't think so I think he has that everybody's getting\nAnd I think he's sitting there going okay 'cause he's already said one time he thinks he can be the president for life and it's a situation where it's that's what he said look for in this global situation there set him up for that it all that's doing it a stabilizing our country and everywhere else\nWell I gotta say it'd be it'd be makes himself president definitely he's not going to last Fifteen minutes after that\nWell but see that their kid that's part of the agenda I mean he thinking and and like I say I I I mean it's legal situation it's it's ... and his head I mean he's making millions and Amy as God somewhat\nHe's not making any money off of being president oh you'd be surprised not only said he doesn't need it he doesn't he didn't take the salary ... they didn't do their salary of it well he didn't pay\nHis salaries are a joke compared to what he's making for all all of his interests and everything is look at what he ... look at what he made last year\nYeah he's a billionaire we knew he was a billion or we voted him in\nAnd look at oil in late since we put in their\n... and his bank account I don't know what his name was he made me believe I'm not doing their inside Manley is I mean\nHis family is going to make money anyway I mean see this is the thing is we're all going to look what he's done here look we've done here you know look at him look at what he is look what he does look I Would just stand there and he's oblivious he's oblivious he's he's oblivious I Can't say enough he's oblivious\nThat's what they test to sit so he's a delivery is George George oblivious\nHe's is that how do you think he's got or is that he's a smart man that makes everybody think\nHe's a smart businessman and that's even arguable but what I'm saying is that the president I think he's clueless I mean he's got I think he's ... I think he's just doing what he was told\nNo yeah yeah they I think you're a little off I think oh I don't I think you have to watch it\nThere are people call him that are helping him in this situation\nTo directly new with their directing him yes\nAnd Arizona there there there's some things he says no to because he is going by his conscience I think Trump goes by his conscious more more so than people think he does I think he goes by his conscience more so than people think he does and that makes him\nIt it it makes them effective as a person who can engender some sort of competence with the people and that's fine I think that'd be ... Obama had that same power the only problem is is that Obama big you started writing up laws in whims and things and continuing the\nThe oppression and I think Trump has an exercise any of those things yet 'cause I don't know if he knows the answer is disposal or if he does that mean supposedly chooses not to use them you realize he could jail reporters were lying about it\nIf you want to see how it so you have to learn\nWay should but see that that the pitch but if he does that work in white male would not be the time to do that\nWe are right now will not\nBe the time to make any rash decision about Saudi Arabia but he's going to have to 'cause he's being pressure to do it\nAnd then they know that we made the rounds with the gas pump we may see some problems with inflation them economy we may receive some stuff go down and this is why I say this is the deep state move it's just the deep state movement a worldwide on world wide scale\nLA sounding in your ear think it's all the you know against him no I don't have any and every it's against the United states it's against it and it set up for a lot of different things and he's a part of that set up", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Billings", "day": "16"}
