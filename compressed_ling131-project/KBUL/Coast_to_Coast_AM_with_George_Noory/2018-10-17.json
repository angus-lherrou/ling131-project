couldn't print a word\nTo show he took were effort refuge in the United states and became a regular contributor to the Washington Post your show he's um a connection with the Washington Post may have made him a useful\nOf rod Serling was an absolute genius was any\nHe was he was I mean there's no doubt about it and not only was he a genius but he was a prolific genius he um he proved it over and over again or he was\nJust unbelievably productive and he just wrote so many great grapes shows for for television and film\nOr one of our friends marches ... I wrote a book about the the twilight zone then in subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating an addictive phone while he was floating in his bowl\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word um I don't know if he did most of them in the pool in the pool\nBut he's certainly dictated most of the scripts and and honestly I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed or he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nSo let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um [noise]\nYou know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could and he had this um this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper aid that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was\nAssigned to the five hundred eleventh parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne and he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's got 'em for life and and it affected pretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality\nTo them in did he get that from his combat oh he certainly has as its yeah he um\nHe went back to the battlefield um several\nTimes a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the toilets on so [noise] um it was always there was always part of his makeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of twilight zone episodes particularly of one called the purple testament which is actually a lady um during World War two so that was as close as he got to literally\nRevisiting his his combat experience in the twilight zone and in several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in that golden age of television was any\nYes he uh he certainly was it was a time when\nTelevision was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up and television needed writers I was\nIt was it was this fast you know if they've asked we find it was a vast medium that was just devoid of talent at the time and ... you know a jumped right into it and he said\nHe was so prolific and he wrote so much\nThat he just sent stuff outside stuff out until finally started being accepted and and soon enough\nLipstick and he wrote so much that he just sent stuff out and stuff out until finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know his shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk to Scott Carol Serling Raj wife\nI did not unfortunately no no the what he had a a treat with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah\nNow with with rod and he started before he got in the twilight zone user writer for other kinds of shows was any\nOh sure sure there are some people may not know this but rod Serling was\nWithout question the most prestigious writer in television before the twilight zone he had written you know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty\nFive fifty six and fifty seven a twilight zone started and fifty nine I'm so he was at the top of the of the heap or before the twilight zone came out and\nShe just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama\nSensibility into the twilight zone and gave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times what he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to a critique him editorialize and even controlling\nYeah yeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that certainly ran into\nIs that he believed that it's a writer's job to do those things that the writer job to address the issues of his time\nAnd every time he tried to address any issue of any social import on television the censors would get this way the sponsors would get in this way and it was frustrating for him and thankfully for ... for ... he was\nSuccessful enough and he had built such a name for himself that they were willing to give him his own show and he had always loved science fiction\nHe loves fantasy science fiction or you know all that kind of thing so he created the twilight zone because he always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it and say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff by if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it will be a little less controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode Nick that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show with a cool ending it had a message to the\nL absolutely if it was a a television series it just had a cruel twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now and you know it it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that\nUm because he again believe that that was part of a the artist job the art if it's going to be art it has to do what he would say that has to say something about something and you know it has to be entertaining he did wants to entertain but at the same time he had to say something about something\nWhat do you think some of the ... that he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career the big the biggest issue was prejudice um rot had this this innate aversion to prejudice and he believed it was ... believe that all evils stem from prejudice that that's the beginning and that's the root of all of them so he wanted to address that idea\nThat um we have this um this tendency to look to other people to uh for our own faults when we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the twilight zone before and after\nHe has some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about sixty years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary\nWhat do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about six years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine and yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released um science fiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred\nTelevision series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction as all television series and the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one it made it and at this point\nYou know you ask the average twenty five year old they're not getting any Matty black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone it entered the consciousness just as a term you know people know that\nThe twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is off kilter something is strange something is not quite right and it lasted all this time because of of routes messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so\nWell produced so well acted a it was just a first class production from from get from\nPoint a to point the you know so so that's I think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and it's a Bradbury had heard about it and I had written an article about it in a what we had was called the after dark newsletter\nIn a bread Bree just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about ... shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I got and that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office\nBut Raj didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no no listen nobody could write every script on you know a rod wrote Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over five see that's pretty prolific\nThat is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five season periods just if you know and and at the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced it's just it's just off the charts I I'm just convinced he never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty the Nineteen Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted he was just addicted to it and maybe he got back in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah I absolutely had heart issues and that's what's on demand you said that broad de ... do well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty other the total shows that's crazy isn't it\nIt really is you know when I was researching the book it it's you know this couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well first of all yeah you run Ninety two twilight zone episodes he also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories\nHa ha so if you know they do is that's\nA hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides that's why it's on the night gallery\nStay with us deck we're going to take a break we'll come back and talk more next hour we'll take phone calls with a buddy about the twilight zone and the ... with us his book is called the rod Serling his life's work in an imagination\nAnd

to news talk Ninety five point five [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nHey and welcome back to coast to coast Georgian already with you with ... with us a rod Serling his life working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there\nA hundred and fifty six hundred and ... and I know three of them for example it's a good life in praise of long distance call with that guy Billy ... who was a kid that scared everybody into the cornfield\n[laughter] yeah they sure yet\nWhether Tim as a matter of fact I have a little surprise for you Nicholas really movies with a Billy\nHey George how are you man on the line Nick there you go\nHey bill good to talk to you good to talk to you too it's real good [laughter] it's better than talking to a dead grandmother so yeah [laughter]\nOkay ... give us the bad bad man\nOh I'm working for you know okay yeah I just need to tell you some buddy you're a bad man you're bad [laughter]\nYour voices that changed all that much\nThe strike what can I say if you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and then I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we returned to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lowly ana for it still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got six notches on my belt when it comes to the tea zone\nAnd we knew you were in those episodes and they were being done was rod Serling around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when he did as you know bumpers and intros and ah [noise] yeah and he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast\nOn a twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer buck out and we're really seeing kilo in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled control from network hassling as much as they could\nUh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see a Mr Serling when he was on the set and talk to them about what was coming up in the next episode her so usually when an executive producer or creator comes onto his said you know everybody gets a little uptight\nYoga that you know or when Alan's here [laughter] or whatever but uh I recall quite clearly that are on rod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around them\nDid he talk with you\nYeah yeah sure we went out for margaritas every night\nAnd you know that's right and how old were you you're a little kid\nI was six or I was six and seven and nine\nThat somehow didn't they find you believe in these parts [noise]\nUm well actually the one of the very first lead roles I did was a an episode of ... to young show that was directed by James Sheldon the chorus Leishman played by mom and a\nAnd the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James shelled and he brought me in for a long distance call and he also directed it's a good life\nSo having to under my belt or I guess they just you know just called me up for in praise of pet\nBusy guy and you were you were in ... now what do you do in these days really what's new\nWell Angela car right now I've just released are novel a fantasy novel I think we talk to you about it when we were first writing in time and go charge\nOn purpose it's called the devil ... and all that this area has weapons\nLow you set yourself with some uh for the show OK\nYeah a lot to do that and I'm ... thrown ancient aliens and you know I'm playing the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise] making music to\nYou this is the key Billy thinks that's it you got it by George really moved me how to treat Nick that I was\nThinking George though that was great you was a I did run certainly for you on this show you never know\n[laughter] he may my calling from the from the other side\nWhat inspired you to read the book about certainly\n[noise] well I mean I became a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know mesmerized by the show and\nAnd so that started everything [noise] and then really since then I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he's written\nA you know so much of it that was great and I I\nJust wanted to collect all this information about all of these shows that he had written and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually done this type of thing where for example\nYou know there wasn't even really a complete a list of all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced TV or or or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had ever has had gaps whatever but so that had never been done so the first thing I wanted to do is I wanted to know exactly what he\nYeah that was produced in any form whatsoever so and then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that you know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been there haven't been commercially released\nUm I wanted to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about\nSo you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography in this part you know critical analysis of the the theme certainly was was dealing with and the character types that he you know that he researched and you know built into and et cetera\nDid you come across anything that surprised you in your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes I'm probably the most surprising thing that I found was he may have heard of a particular shall we talked about the sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that was remotely controversial whether\nThere's one show that's particularly in some is in that regard called it's called noon on doomsday it was broad certainly is a tent to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until it was a fourteen year old African American a boy who\nWas lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman and this really just destroyed rod Serling she wants to sell some version of the story\nAnd Everytime he tried to he you know he met resistance\nWhile I was able to find the ... the actual first draft of this script that rod wrote before any of these um you know any of these you know if the fear and says came into play and there have been several studies of this particular show\nIn the evolution that it's so from from you know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on television well but none of those studies had the actual first draft and I just luckily\nFound the actual first draft in that surprised me because of all spoil it for you and now it's not all that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that\nNoon on doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect rod Serling\nFit it devastated them he was um [noise] you know superficially he was a Kennedy admirer he was he agreed with his politics and he he admired Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I I came across a letter that rotted written to um\nTo his ... can't say pastor but he was a Unitarian or most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling was and he wrote a letter to one of his Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just\nKind of it just took away his faith in humanity that something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen so it really it just yeah it it it throw him for it threw him into a dark place for a little while\nAnd strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination\nHe and William fruit that one of the producers on this while its own were contacted by the state department and ask to produce a film to introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world while\nIt was a document they needed a documentary they thought you know and we got to get something quick that we can just send to our allies and present to people so you know here's here's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the assassination when he was you know depressed for sure\nFlew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this document\nSo he did that he finished uh\nYeah in fact the you know the uh\nThe the people who asked him to do this or said we ... we need this in five days [laughter] and and and William fruits had listened that's not going to happen we we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we said before rather so prolific and he was so such a fast writer he did get through it pretty quickly and they had they had it ready\nYou know I I actually don't do exactly the timeframe wasn't five days but it wasn't much much longer than that\nWhat is it about black and white TV shows that have a different seal than the color shows that we all see nowadays you\n... drawn in ... raising the standard of living doesn't matter and Rush

and I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really light that my second question would be a doubt\nThe mysterious endings which I think a lot of that could be almost a not necessarily ethic but could have unfolded into actual movies additional scenes\nA ... where a someone could take a twilight zone episode and kinda unfolded into an actual movie you know like a planet of the apes\nYeah I I I agree with you on that and and you get to the first question you know the yeah the escapist aspect that this was only mean that I think that is part of all science fiction and fantasy of course is that that\nA scape is tone to it um but you know it's funny that you you mentioned that because that has actually something that rod Serling are often pointed to about ... gallery ah in the early seventies during the end of the Vietnam\nEra he felt that night gallery was giving people in the ... from the nightly news and seeing you know the stuff on you know stuff on the news about war and everything else they would they go into the gallery in escape\nThrough that so he never really said that about the twilight zone but I think the similar a point can be made about the twilight zone as well\nAnd it is surprising that that that someone hasn't taken you know a twilight zone episode and expanded it into a feature film although there's been there have been plenty of films that are certainly it's twilight zone in ... you know influenced that could very well just as just as well be toilets on movies that are called the twilight zone\nWas it Jack Lemmon on one of the twilight zone\nHe started for twilight zone yeah he actually started one with the movie um in praise of tip that's right yeah yeah and he was\nTerrific guy Jack Lemmon probably gave my favorite performances on the twilight zone and and three of the episodes that he was\nHe was he a trumpet player in one of them\nExactly yes there's one called the passage for Trump rod wrote that one and I'll tell you a quick story about that episode you know he the director um jak caught me was so good in that episode there's just so good that the director actually wrote were called rod and said listen I don't want to take the camera off of this guy I just wanted to keep filming\n[laughter] you know there any way we can make\nA two part episode he wants to expand into an allergist because jak cotton was so good and rod said you know this and we just can't get on the budget we can't can't do more than half an hour but that's\nUnless I'm just gonna let this guy going I'm going to film whatever he does\nIs less a blessing plastic Jason in Portland, Oregon is with us now Jason going it's er\nWell were you folks or wherever that Presidents Day there said why I like those radios theater and they take some of the old episode he ran for the radio\nAnd they also incorporate date things and have a current topics like a just a couple of weeks ago I heard when they had to do with a nano by\nEating up um oil spill in the problem with that good grades and that and I just thought that it thank you and I think with the ... they cool did you know about that next\nI I was not aware of the current uh uh uh current radio series no there actually was the twilight zone a series of radio dramas of the original episodes that was produced some are not too long ago but no I wasn't aware of a of the current one no\nDidn't write ever writes for radio in his early days\nOh sure yeah that's that's where he really got his start was in radio his first cells were to a war to a series called Grand Central station that era and\nI think on CBS um CBS network and the road you know for radio or in college and so yeah that was that was the beginning before he broke and and actually the funny thing is he actually went back to radio and created a radio series in Nineteen fifty four so basically four years after he had\nBroken into television he actually went back to work in Cincinnati and created this radio series called it happens to you\nAnd it was a series of Thirteen [noise] um original radio script\nWhere did he end up living Los Angeles\nA yes or while he once he lived in most and Pacific palisades where most of his a professional career and then he always went back to a if a guy in upstate New York every summer and then he was teaching it if it gets so we kind of gradually spent more time uh and it's like the later in life\nWhen he got sick was it a long illness or did you go suddenly\nUm [noise] well it was it was pretty sudden he you know he had\n... years old was any or something like fifty\nYeah he was fifty and get a couple of heart attacks and he went in for a bypass procedure which was fairly you know cardiac bypassed procedure which was who was in Philly new yeah the\nTime uh and you know it's interesting you know how new it was because if you read\nSome of the news stories at the time about the surgery they'll explain to you exactly what the surgery is you know they're going to take a ... you know artery from this here and play here it's like nowadays you wouldn't have to say any of that you know what a cardiac bypasses but that back then it was so\nNew that that explains the surgery and he had the surgery and the doctors thought he was successful and um by the time they were selling them up he had another heart attack on the table\nAnd that was pretty much a Steve's with us first time caller in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Hi Steve\nHi ... ah I get a little trivia but a ride a uh I live in central New York from Seventy two to Seventy five and I worked on a military base called Seneca army\n... we're close okay and I would say a big a big arts and all that had nuclear weapons are quite a few actually been on the nerd\nA anyway rods home woods had bought two or three miles from that great\nAnd uh a little town called ... up the road about mowing and a half or two miles with the little ... where are you ... where I used to have a ...\nAnd that's where rod you then died yeah when he he had a a swimming pool built on his property there a couple of miles away right next to the base or or it's actually an arsenal and uh I used to talk to the or\nA puppet master it sounds like a one room\nAh it's actually an arsenal and uh I used to talk to the uh\n[noise] a postmaster it sounds like a one room a purge profits and I could I I heard ... could be a country and once in a while and I always wish I had met him but I never did\nBut I I think that's where he's a a sandwich tape cuts to Los Angeles to or the or contrived in period a\nTV program and uh\nYou know that he's here already you know as I say you lived right on Lake ... uh an in Ithaca and that's not not far uh so yeah it could very well be and he would and he would dictate in Ithaca and send it send the tapes out to Los Angeles to be to be transcribed\nInteresting Steve what else you know about him what's that what else do you know about it and that's cool well\nUh when his career started that sank a little bit uh he went back to that area and he taught at a I Believe it's Cornell University down there and uh he uh he buried not far from it it's a word ... in a\nLittle cemetery called the inner lake and right on the lake and much loved that area in its wife or when they first got married\nThey had their honeymoon there ah\nOn ah the lake or a ... a her relatives parents probably on their property and he bought it eventually and they lived there and they always went back there on a summer to uh\nWrite and relax and uh but uh a funny thing is he used to do a little radio a\nPromotion for ah people hey no an area like\nA shoe store or whatever my feet up my store I mean we've kinda cute you'd hear of locally or\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help 'em out\nYeah absolutely and I really hurting which really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in a sense of you know he had a hard a goal\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for free for people or people at the college or or local businesses that as he as Steve mentioned and yeah he would absolutely and and you know going through his\nCorrespond to see what rod Serling kept at everything he ever ever sent he every letter he ever wrote he kept in that they still exist and you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally you know personal letters signed and everything [noise] um he\nTook that time to do that and it's really amazing that

don't have it in the physical store will certainly be a blow to root for you or you can go directly to a university press in Mississippi website um to lump site but if you Google that I'm sure you'll uh you'll come up with it there as well\nTell us about the rod surely memorial foundation\nI'd love to hear some of I'm a member of the board of directors of the foundation and the Binghamton New York based charity or that looks out for rod Serling as a legacy and and promotes his legacy a in Binghamton or as well as around the world really and working on\nYou know we've done a couple of are we call them Serling fast\nHis legacy a ... a as well as around the world really and working on\nYou know we've done a couple of are we call them certainly fast the last couple of years I'm wary of essentially had a rod Serling convention or people have come and spoken and certainly in his daughter and Jodie Serling they've both been you know been there and you know spoke about their dad and\nAnd we've watched rare films and you know had pal discussions and radio perform scripts radio scripts performed um so I've had you know done a lot of a lot of things like that for the community\nAnd it's just about keeping rod in the public eye as much as possible and we're trying to at this point we're trying to really get a statue built for them and bring him in his home town he loved his hometown a and that should come to come across through several twilight zone episodes and so we're trying to get a statue before and they were trying to get a rod Serling museum in Binghamton\nSo these are all things that were that were working towards\nGosh I Would love to have him on the show Nicholas\nAh I Would love to spend five minutes with him I was five years old when he died so\nThan a classic chance though would have been something else what a great interview you would have been oh yeah oh yeah he always was\nTo the phones we go let's go to Linda ... in Medford, Oregon hello Lynda Barry\nMining Mick talking Tina and I'm going to kitty a that was a glass favorite episodes also the man and the radio\nOr you talking about me [laughter]\nNo man had found that ... found that radio in ... in\nThe attic and how it played music and shows they'd only he could hear\nThe classics\nAnd also George at when they get around I Would get praise you for um how you thought up this show tonight I mean after accurate is that is the gas talking about haunted artifacts and they're they're tied in together so many twilight zone episodes about highly doubt oh\nAbsolutely I've gotta I've I've got to give credit to our executive producer Lisa lion and Tom Dan how's your producers for putting that together\nYes and also Nick I Want to know um what was the first episode you saw [noise] you\nKnow that's a it's a funny question because I think most people can tell you for certain what toilets and up so it was the first one is what I cannot tell you for certain what the first one I have a so as\nI could probably narrow it to a couple um ditch hiker is one that I I think it was definitely one of the one of the first ones I ever saw but whatever way right yea going\nMy way and you can have chasing a you know chasing a driver not chasing evidence just showing up on the road constantly uh on the on a road trip on that's a that's a creepy one a rod wrote that one and that was definitely one of the first ones but for whatever reason I cannot pinpoint it for sure if that's the first one I ever saw\nHe remembered the plane that couldn't land in then you we do you look down and you could see the brontosaurus the dinosaurs and it just kept going back into time I guess\nYeah it's called the odyssey of flight thirty three it's about a plane that breaks the breaks the sound barrier and somehow finds itself back in prehistoric times and uh you know a ... you know Raj brother Robert Robert certainly also a very successful writer actually wrote the president's plane is missing which was a best seller at the time\nAnd it was made into a TV movie um but he was an expert in aviation and he actually uh consult Iraq consulted with him about that particular episode and other episodes they did it ever had anything to do with aviation he went to his brother offer advice on those so he actually got a technical consultant credit on on that particular episode\nNext job we go to Brad Bird in the angels camp California Hi Brett heard\n... I'm I'm pretty sure that this was a rod sterling a tail it involved what they call the frog die\nWell I'm\nThat started with a guy at a bar looking kinda despondent or whatever and and uh probably crying you know trying to give up drinking and somebody came up\nAnd gave him a ... a match but said call this number and uh so he was curious he called it they said well come over to I think it was going to a place where they gave him this capsule and they said but the the one the one\nCaviar is you cannot drink to get money not drink because he's a message\nThat will um it will\nMake you very very uncomfortable and give you a really bad stomach reaction and so ... was was a it was some little organism\nAnd it said on alcohol [noise] it was dormant unless you drank alcohol in which case it would wake up and then it it would just you know crave the alcohol and make you really really sick because it was growing\nThat's that sounds somewhat familiar it's it's definitely not necessarily I can tell you that for sure but it does sound that that part about it ... it feeding on the alcohol and growing that does sound somewhat familiar to me but it's definitely not necessarily\nThat they were so many classic shows do they all had these different messages remember the one where the camera took pictures of the future yeah and you name it at a racetrack more did you get the winning divorce and all that\nYeah yeah most unusual camera it was called and that's just one of the you know your previous caller was talking about a haunted artifact I mean that camera was\nAn artifact of swell its own you know they they had plenty of those the you know the telephone that only ... movie was talking about they talked to his dad grandmother on you know there's always those crops that are where the you know we're the ... you know so to speak of that particular episode\nVery in Rock Hill South Carolina hey there\nHello their yard was always a player\nThat next gas where he is out of a job I really love and the bottom line is all that and so for that matter of fact I've got a ... one of my favorite story you tell your or just a partner that how 'bout that Raj serving as low as those nasty or at\n[laughter] now it's unfortunate he really was addicted he tried to quit several times and he just he never never could quite do it\nAll the years the thing either he really loves cigarettes are ... are Jerry roe we're paying ... a lot of them are just ... you\nKnow you're probably right way too much he would he'd come out on the set smoking Whitney\nOh sure sure it's hard to find a picture of rod Serling where he doesn't have a cigarette in his hand it's just there was it was it was attached to him it was given constant\nIn those days it was the thing to do I remember dean Martin lighting up on stage of Sammy Davis junior all those people would come out with cigarettes I mean it was it was the thing\nSure crazy let's go next to too many ... in the San Antonio Texas

things that you've come across what would you say is the most bizarre thing that you would come across that we can say on the radio that uh you you found in a house or something like that\nA boy that's a that's a tough one um\nI mean just the ... heading shrunken heads yeah real shrunken heads shrunken head oh my God\nYeah and I tell you what it had to I I ... I'm going to give you I Want to I Want to answer with two answers but the the fake shrunken\nHeads what they there by the way a trunk and has worked ... fortune alright really come\nFrom the islands and stuff where this was medicine to people okay this was you know part of their culture and at what it was a very small culture so these are very rare\nI Hope they did it with those who died rather than kill someone to do it\nUm I don't know I think I have to think about that but ah my hand handle one of those years ago and you know it wasn't a monkey had it was something\nA little strange little are they how small are they're very small about the size of softball how do they do that I have no idea if I could answer that correctly I don't think you'd want to know me anymore what ya [laughter] that's true they ... they do it with a boy on I'm Down in a different types of medicinal spirits\nAnd also little magic member everybody has a magic and our culture and all the other thing\nThat I uh found dead [noise] I found a pre Columbian pottery all and you're going to love this this is Nathan\nBy Native Americans in a ... now the Pueblo people believe that a great race of aliens live there and those ... before they lived there uh-huh taught their ancestors I'm an awful lot about the world and are you aware of those those cultural yes okay sure you would be [laughter]\nUm I found a pre Columbian which means they came it was made before Columbus came to the the ... world\nHow pre Columbian figure of a a little person now the the dolls or the figures that they made their heads look just\nPre Columbian which means they came it was made before Columbus came to the the ... world\nA pre Columbian figure of a a little person now the the the dolls or the figures that they made their heads look just like what we consider a gray the alien grace amazing that\nIt their faces look exactly like a gray with just a little bit spooky when you consider that\nThey'd had not had the stories about grace back then\nBut that's the way all their little figures look but this one the person is actually talking on a communicator looks like wild and it's absolutely legitimate and I asked somebody in my view out this morning or upstate yesterday now\nUm who is a cleric point person my wife found that out but um\nShe I showed her that right she said wing that is on me I have never felt more energy coming out of anything\nI think the antics of energy to especially the people\nWho know energy she said that has so much energy it actually buses\nLoses a replica of something they saw back way before the Columbus euro and something\nThat the Native Americans made they saw that looks like an alien yeah and it's actually talking now they they're a bunch of these would have been found and they're they're pretty interesting alone\nAnd they all want to sing like he's actually talking on a communicator that's weird I'm going to send you a

made them they depicted them\nYeah I I think this is a depiction of The Elders that taught them their culture who came down to\nBelieve that people from us the stars were there before them I Believe this is a a depiction of one of the star people\nThat could be the greatest proof we've been looking for you know absolutely\nAll right stay with us when we're going to take a quick break we'll come

D. V. copies of this big aerial type and pass them around from city to city to city All right\nAnd this book ... which has a picture of both Craig's\nOn camera type and the paper copies that they made of this this this these three children that they passed around from city to city to city financially up and not watch than a woman says those are my three such children\nWhile those to my husband right before Gettysburg I haven't heard from since\nI'm Sorry he died they go on and tell her the story\nUs but then Craig says Wayne scoping your addict can scrounge around ... takes this is right after he gave me this book we'd go up my addict I live in Eighteen forty house has a few books of its own right\nGo up and is Sadek and there's this little room where there was furniture assembled but when we bought the house ceilings are only about four foot tall it's a spooky little room it's almost like Anne\nFrank and her family lived and there were a bunch of artifacts left over in the house when I was purchased one of the things that was left over in the house was this book ... book of photographs\nOf Craig and I opened it up and there is one of the C. D. V. copies of the same three children we opened it up and immediately there's those three kids there and right at us we dropped the book\nIndustry [laughter] I mean that's what kinda coincidence is that right now it's almost like that conjured up something pretty doggone spooky\nI guess you got to be careful what you do well\nYou know I don't think careful I think that the positive things about antiques as they bring about good spirits a lot of happiness but there are times when you got to pay a little bit careful I knew the warns pretty well and they are used to say don't play around with a weed\nGee boards and stuff and I ... I Believe that\nYeah yeah I don't mess around with really chilly and takes because you know you don't want to open up doors you can't close right [laughter]\nThat's true that is absolutely would you do when when you do your rummaging and you've been to some of these older places and you find some of these things have you found objects that look scary to you\nAll the time it's often um\n... the the things that that make them look scary is the houses that are in um [noise] I was in a house where this famous psychologist or I died and the story was that he killed themself\nAnd uh I go through there with my buddy or another buddy of mine who were doing a kind of a an appraisal of this this for a for some lawyers and\nAnd and we're taking photographs of these pieces and this guy had spray painted things on the walls that were really strange he was a LSD person\nIn the house was filled with all sorts of strange uh furniture from the mission ... period and nuts and had been cleaned\nA and years and he had like\nCaptured animals and skin them and made\nThings out of um [noise] um that was pretty scary when you're the first one to come across these things over the years and that that tends to make all the objects in the house all the scarier so I'm going through this house taking photographs of all the strange things right my buddy won't go up in the addict I got what's wrong with you\nBecause why and there's something wrong there what are you talking about it 'cause I saw something up there I saw go up there I said\nCome on that we're working here right it's not time for this right like we got a lot to do he would not go up in the addict by himself grown man\nWe ended up going up in the addict together finishing my photography up there and went downstairs took some more photographs [noise] All right I developed I I had the photographs developed this was just actually no it was a it these were ah this was just the beginning when photographs were\nThe photographs in the attic all had these weird circles and I'm like or like balloons every single photograph in that house had these these weird or sent him\nNone of the photographs before we went up and he had a cat that so I figured I'd spilt water on the lens and I looked at the photographs or taken after we left the addict downstairs again\nNo problem just up and that strange addict that's where my buddy says that's what I saw\nVery strange do you find that the older the object the more possible that it could be a haunted object\nYeah I think that um age has an awful lot to do with that\nIt was a justice diminished on dreams become patently obvious to everybody and it's very simple if you are a Democrat and you've engaged in any kind of questionable illegal activity you get a pass and if you're a Republican you don't people know that we have two systems of justice in Washington and the Democrats are not held accountable the same way Republicans are\nWe have to live the systems that just\nRush Limbaugh we can handle one ... news talk Ninety five point five we just as we're Montana she'd be well am nine Seventy buildings these huge huge ward and you're listening to news ...

worth\nA lot of money because George Patton was such an interesting so George Patton was you know they made a great movie about him and uh you know he he was just he was just a guy who stood out I'd love to have is a real handle fiscal\nOh my gosh that would be worth ... wouldn't that be something I\nSure would also didn't have like a he ended up not not a team but he walked with something that

your typical part is you know that you are\nIn pharmacist is a pharmacist who actually makes medicine right on your typical part is you know that you are going to Kmart or Walmart or wherever he's doing what we call it an entire school we used to directly referred to it counts correlate can stay and that's what really pharmacy in devolved to with the artist\nPiracy is really the art of making\nMedicine in traditionally that's what the farmers instead compound and pharmacists take that a ... restoring the art of pharmacy to the pharmacy practice by literally making Madison my personal specialty\nWas made in medicine for the skin so I ... I I was competing products for people at burns her trauma or pre surgery or post surgery or you know it was a wrinkles are hyper ... and what I ended up doing\nIs I took my formulations that I developed in the pharmacy for healing patients who are sick and I turned it dies formulations into over the counter products and start a business and and that's basically what I Do now is\nI had a couple of ... that I had another one that I saw\nI create anti aging and beauty products\nYou know you have a unique way of of of talking about what big pharmaceuticals are and you said that when you were you actually did a time as a a a lick 'em and then send them pharmacist\nLike count for like instead count\nPoorly can stick pharmacist you've spent some time there and you said you felt bad because what you were dealing with poison it but that's where we are you said it's poison and see that's the thing is that it doesn't matter I mean we we have such horrible\nA what we say we you know we have such horrible ways of of talking about certain I guess it's a degree of penalty with drugs if you take\nA if you take a pain pill that's okay if you if you take heroin your bad or if you smoke marijuana your bad but they're all they're all there for a reason right\nHappened uh Clyde that that's some drugs became good and other drugs he came back I mean well how did that hurt but I Know\nAnd what are they exactly there for example marijuana how many people in jail now because of marijuana but now or or jail today because they were selling marijuana five ten Fifteen Years ago but today it's OK today is in Colorado you can just you can buy marijuana just walk off the street by marijuana\nFee what getting what gets me is that there is also people that are uneducated about what is

can understand how to\nInto our chemistry to control our own biochemistry and that's what we should be learning how to just be teaching people how to do after we should be teaching children how to do when you're the one you're the one that told me about oxytocin\nHe was saying that the that may be that the the the reason behind addiction not dependence but addiction is is pretty much a a lack of oxytocin\nWhat do you see them among other chemicals that oxytocin is so fascinating because oxytocin goes up when we bond with each other\nWhen we socialize with the with each other when we gaze into each other's eyes or even into a stranger's eyes are oxytocin levels go up and we feel connected to the world and this is based on biochemistry and is part\nUs and so we want to just didn't want to learn how to how to leverage our bio chemicals you know are owned by a chemistry you know a client your donor mean levels go up when you clean kitchen\nYou don't have the stairs to look at your kitchen when it's really messy and then you finish cleaning it and you're so happy and proud you can't stop looking at your clean kitchen do you see them out you know I I just\nFigured out how nice Janine is going to be doing for the rest of the ... if we can because\nWhatever whatever it is also making these are things we can do to leverage our own chemistry including the garage we can finish the project can dish writing that book we can\nUh uh uh uh ... concocted a meal for somebody we can give money to somebody who's a homeless a homeless beggar on the street when you give a dollar to somebody on the street your oxytocin\nLevels go up and you fight cancer in your blood pressure drops and you're in high heels and your wrinkles start that they are like giving a homeless person that dollar on the street or getting a stranger some love and it's so amazing to me how all the things that we call the virtues are bio chemically ballot there\nAnd that there's a difference or or you want you want no pain and you want to have the pain without having taken any uh opioids because of course\nI Do have a prescription for those I don't use them as often as a most people do I have in my column and breaking glass pills I have my and my medicine chest just in case you know I Need somebody to break through pain because ever since I had my surgery my back in my knees wouldn't bother me they told me I'd never walk again\nBecause I had no feeling in my upper legs or because of the nerves they suffered and so I got by I managed to get feeling back a and I managed to be walking I Am walking now but I Do still have swollen legs and I do still have that pain from carrying those legs and\nTrying to get them to give the swimming down so I decided to make a commitment to avoid sugar as much as I can in order to bring the swelling down in since I have done this I have and since I've done this I've lost thirty pounds again about some of the three pounds\nSo I'm learning that sugar is probably the ... the thing that induces the most pain in the body is having sugar complex starches in sugars are creating pain in my body and I and I'm avoiding sugar now because I don't want the pain\nIn many ways sugar is like a drug\nIn the in the sense of addiction and the sense of its powerful a biochemical effects on the body there a case could be made that sugar is a type of drug in so quitting sugar is a can of quitting a pharmaceutical drug it has that kind of potency on the body especially\nWhen it comes to information the human body is just not Mandel a lot of sugar you know you have more than one piece one teaspoon full of sugar in your bloodstream you're considered to be a diabetic\nAnd that's in over ... gallon a blood sugar is very very ... and stuff and and that was a very good movie have you tried CBD by the way\nA yes of course I I well I have an injustice I but I use it uh I I used as a I have used it a before and we meant and uh I've always felt that it kills

as well so who do we have is what\nThey make them a lot of supplements spotted nutrition is made by by drug companies but first first of all ... there's a couple of points first of all I'm\nYet to make a distinction between dietary supplements and nutrition dietary supplements\nOften or formulations that contain herbs\nAnd plant material this is different from what we call the essential or the mighty Ninety essential nutrient Ninety essential nutrients their vitamins minerals amino acids and fatty acids that the body must how they are not optional\nYou suffered a disease or without any any individual essential nutrient a is defined as a substance that you better have are you suffered disease from a deficiency disease from hers are not in that category supplements that the the hundreds of supplement to contain these these tainted products for the most part are herbal medicine herbal\nFormulation the second thing is is your point is very well taken\nYou got to have a certain sense of similarity with the company you're buying your ... your your nutrition from\nI personally would stick to the mighty nine essential nutrients and I would you know I I didn't party um Japanese family now for twenty plus years because I trust the company I Know the people personally could formulate the products they know the people personally who manufacture the products and I I have a at a\nDecades long it's two decades long two plus decades long\nRelationship with the company so yes you got a latch onto a company that you trust and that that you can try to buy your supplements\nFrom that company that sometimes you have to have multiple sources and there are other good companies but I like the ... the company and and that's why I've been with them for\nSo long yeah I like them

...\nCells are in especially in that I have a son that had\nSome problems and the thing is that if you want to find a um\nQueues or so says all you do there are tens of thousands if not hundred thousand parents who have children who are vaccine injured\nAnd then they went on to have other children with no ...\nWhat oh Albert and I happen to be connected to many of those people on line and those children are the healthiest children bubble\nSo what we do is we start with injecting pregnant women and then we inject the baby the day at porn with the hepatitis B vaccine ... below ...\nA damage than natural immune to stop over time\nAnd then when something comes along\nChildren can get sick or as what happened with my son um he had a bad vaccine reaction that was visible to me I was kind of in denial of the other injuries before that\nWhen he was five years old and I had delayed is back to the nation's and I had spread them out and uh there he was\nUh the day after he was in look green to me and um he laid on the floor and bomb at least out of them and I said my style that then I'm done I'm not going to inject them anymore I'm not going to follow\nThese things that the ... and so two years later I'm In the hospital\nAnd doctors telling me that my son has diabetes type one that is a new system went crazy and killed the beta cells in the area and I say well what caused a bit\nAnd she says I don't know we don't know and you know doctors do Mart all the time except when you want to know what's\nCausing all of a sudden they just shrug they don't know what they say\nThey have no light the is well there are different theories and all of that well I happen to have three ... degrees and I went on a research and I reached search for a year and my son and diabetes but try to see what it was that I could do to help\nThem\nAnd as I stumbled upon vaccine and start what do I see like Florida it's died of tech green power which mean ... can you know and diabetes type one\nAnd it hit me like a rock and the head I could not believe that\nI had had a hand in causing that start and I started to get on line with people with similar stories tens of thousands of people\nAnd I started to get on line with people with similar story can get people oh it is the story\nWell they're always you know Noel there's always there's always the the story and I I have a friend of mine close to me\nWho are used to be a ... his wife used to be pro vaccine until their little boy had a reaction and uh the schools\nAre we're just so cruel about it and he said well we can't take certainly can take certain things like that well he can't come to school if he gets the shots and I'm being I think we've got so draconian when people have reactions fit\nThere there are so it was so brainwashed by the big pharmaceutical companies have their kids vaccinated that sometimes they have a bad reaction they're still forced to do this and what's your opinion on this\nHundred
