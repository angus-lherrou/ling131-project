history the sinking of the USS Indianapolis it's taken more than fifty years for the full story to emerge from behind and official wall of secrecy and blame\nTo remarkable journalists have worked for years to tell the whole story\nI was totally blown away by their book it takes you right there into the water with the sailors as they struggle to survive shark attacks and the elements for days and days wow what a story a coauthor is Lynn Vincent and Sarah bladder will be here to share what is already a runaway best seller of the book\nUh but first I had hinted last month when ... was here that he had something else in the works I'm not sure when the guy sleeps but he returns to the program coming up and just a few minutes and in a sense he is returning to his roots\nYou know the first time he was on coast to coast I Believe it was ten years ago to discuss his first book the hoop a project\nWas a typical day ... boots on the ground investigation this time of the big ... legend and David spent two years among the hoop a tribe to hear their tails and legends and to apply police in forensic methods to figure out what was being seen in the forests of the Pacific northwest\nAs it turns out a course similar sightings have been reported all over the world and wild Dave is better known these days for his investigations of missing people\nHe's never stopped thinking about or working on the big foot mystery and tonight he's back with a book that's a great resource for anyone interested in this subject\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approach them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders\nAnd this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big store in Hooper that live ... miles away who saw one coming into town I certainly think about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and uh he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing but I wanted something that a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans and I found a diamond unbelievable look\nAn individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for\nThe state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met in right away we just cook like brothers\nAnd when the Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery and draw the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due the sketch of the suspect that is how accurate this man has\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes they immediately accept and\nPardon me I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends\nWe did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called tribal big foot where he went outside of hoop a and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd ah it's kind of how it started\nOr you say you don't have a dog in the white meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo a front I started the most local the most audacious\nThe most vulgar [laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause but since they were the most\nThey will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kind of went down that path thinking well it must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around who put Andrew the sketches\nHarvey myself in Harvey wife Gina proud also an agent for in Oklahoma\nWe were sat in stunned disbelief because the sketches were very human like yeah they were huge yeah they had hair all over the body but there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss and they didn't look like apes they didn't have that\nTape characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera and it was just shocking and\nWhen the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady into a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it that if you ... you look like and\nWhen you talk about the old there's they would consistently say this is another tribal people is on animals these are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with him at least a coexistence right\nYeah ... in the tribal area I met the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nThe only thing about the ... areas the trinity river great salmon and steal head area a has just so much wildlife and if you drive through Hooper from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes\nThe roadways and the surrounding mountains than I've ever seen anywhere in the world and there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about\nThat and I I I Know that they're seeing eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou uh I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law man a former law man at the state of the evidence about whether you'd say there's ... there's is there is the mission evidence that something is real here or do we just haven't quite figured out\n\nSeveral years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life and there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely\nCredible many of them didn't want to talk about it and many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a a a PHD named Melba catch them and Dr catch him\nWas one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs tissue blood et cetera that we'd bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America to test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many of them were ... were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA\nAnd there are many more were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA and then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood survivor\nAnd all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read the ...\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA\nAnd what they showed was that the ... went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the females side to the ... Arab region to Jerusalem to\nA Jordan into that part of the world and this is when I was sent to a gym bank and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her write a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written up before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't know this but you and I work together to introduce Melba too of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\n[noise] she listen to some of this but you didn't listen to all of it\nAnd unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in the white paper in a white paper but if you extract all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nTo ensure that there was no mistake all of the labs got the same results or was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA has come back as bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her that people are saying going to say well how do you know that's big for their well big foot hair looks different than any other mammal hair in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America and when you look at a big but here it's entirely different\nSo if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle it never went on to DNA but if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using her hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that Melba did to extract this DNA and to get the results\nAnd there's a lotta there's a lotta attitude in this arena as you know George\nAnd it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes that's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like the U. of a world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very bitter conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their take their passion to different\nA world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very turf conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their take their passion to different levels um to the point of\nFraudulent um material um and ah will stab people in the back and will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence ... at a minimum\nUm people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's human but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part but the second says it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with the human match on gender thing\nAnd when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours\nAnd how could that be\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kind of surmise that\nSay a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appeared that big foot with trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipe some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this\nThat people haven't read the study they've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia of the data and read the report because it's available online\nAnd see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit to Melba she's a genius scientists that figured this out [noise] um it's unfortunate\nYeah because it got down to a thrown under the under the bus as she did as well um you you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or did they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it ...\n... let's go to your book big wild man and giants I made a lot of times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really\nA tremendous writing in some of these old articles a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious in in reading and often making fun of the witnesses as well but\nThese things are the three different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eight oh did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seemed to make that fit that profile but we were looking for [noise] but then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded is too\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded is two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as the description twenty four years eight gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U. S. sixteen and Canada three in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it\nA whirl Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana eleven [noise] New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six [noise] and then the numbers keep going down from there but\nAgain it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article in the missing\nBut I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentations his genius\nIs it a lot of people say oh you know a few overlay this map with the maps of the foot wild man disappearances there all the same and he puts up a map of like Bigfoot there's a appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes out and like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything because you know what this Napa because it was a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how\nThey're kind of associated in the same location of the big fight [laughter] and\nBut it was his statement about giants that were found in past centuries in mountains and in a excavations they're really kind of got me thinking or these giants\nThe big for that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories here in Nevada you know the ... century shown to you have legends and stories about the big ... bones or a giant bones that were stashed in the game up in northern Nevada and are you ask what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find\nA lot of these articles pointed to um some universities would get 'em but the the more likely candidate where all these went and it said in the articles was the Smithsonian\nYet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nYou look back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book it's from the Marilyn gives that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three describing an encounter a witness sees this on the ... of a rubber an animal\nBetween twelve and Fifteen feet high it's a sheep resembling a human except the head with it which is an equal proportions the body the seat are two feet long and Harry\nUh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the description semi modern descriptions a big way\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds I I was stunned because nobody talks about it but when you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling\nAbout it but when you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being except the head which is like you said an equal proportion to the body and so\nI'm thinking wow they were writing about this way back when and\nFind out how you can join the cause donate ... foundation\nOr what kind of foster family in our lives changed in the CAT scan reveals amassed in our son Ryan spraying\nAlmost seven years later the Ryan is a happy healthy eight year old who loves playing hockey\nThis is possible thanks organizations like Alex is underneath skin foundation that fight for better treatments and cures and help get families like ours to\nClean up ... ... ... you can visit Alex lemonade not Oregon to learn more\nWe this is where most CPU Willie nine Seventy buildings these huge huge ward and you're listening to news on Ninety five boys\n\nMigrants back on track moving north ...

people out here as well but uh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived the time\nOr exactly and it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to look at the fighting locations in conjunction to the giants sightings and skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first establish\nCivilization and cities that as we move west where were these locations but then even though we're thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings\nWell that's Bruce Maccabee with Ohio is a friend and I went to spend four or five days within earlier this year and the strange things that he's\nTold me that have happened in Ohio in the air and on the ground it's really strange\n[laughter]\nBruce Mac it'd be a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy a boat in person and on the air and in his books uh you know it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big blood or sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nLied and I'd never heard of them either and a again a surprising surprising fact that they're writing about it from there and then end up ... they there's an article from there about a citing ... when you look at the descriptions that they're offering\nThat ended up ... they there's an article from there about a citing ... when you look at the descriptions that they're offering almost identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts and then when you think about present day sightings\nAgain from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\nUm you know some of the descriptions obviously you have to take him in a cultural context now I don't remember when the jungle book was written but Mobley the character Mobley um\nYou know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that you've collected here\nCorrect and uh I people always telling me well what about the star wars creature that looks like big for me how it's kinda strange\nThan it was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's it's it's a similarity\nUm some of the descriptions I I I wouldn't have to leave their way here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of thing which suggests to me maybe they were humans may be read they really were literally wild men out there\n[noise] and usually\nAnd occasionally even nowadays you hear about it for wearing clothing and kind of goes unexplainable because why would they do that but you know maybe it's\nSome association maybe they're trying to break a barrier if they're seen maybe they think they'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared you know we could all through in our conjecture about why that may be happening but it happens too often for people to be fabricating it I\nI hear it occasionally but not very often\nUm if you were to communicate with the try these days a ... a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the hope is is are there any other tribes you would say people that have a relationship one going with the whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one\nI mean there's there's famous stories out of Arizona New Mexico and the high plains out there where [noise] uh they have these and there's many times an association between and this is where they put people start their head start spinning that fact\nWe're there's this association between big foot in UFOs\nEven in the hoop a book I wrote that many of the tribal people said that they saw a UFO and costs time and space to the point where they saw big foot and they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds\nAnd when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars and they're they're not once they have your trust they will tell you hey\nYou know there's this association between us and them and there are different kind of try and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did\nAnd when you start to go back and you look at the history of the certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big put people to die hard don't like it the UFO diehards uh like it even less than they they're not comfortable with that at all but you have to\nYou know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are I don't know what you up those are where they're from but um there was enough cases over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book\nYou can ignore it I I thought the interest there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures\nAre engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents so they own a huge Jerry for anyone out there and talk to them and there's all this I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know\nEvery once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely male and\nGoes I don't understand it [laughter] then\nThe same man told him he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property and something tells me\nTurn around it back on the horse or get back on my ... a TV and Rowley and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property I don't know how it got their so called\nDogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they're going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruit\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take dear Sarah they're an omnivore\nAnd many times\nWhen the natives are in the middle of the woods hunting themselves\nThey'll come across a deer that stuck up in a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound here a native ... could have done it and they don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's not a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\nDavid I have had many sleepless nights listening to everything about the missing persons like it is one of the most unsettling thing that I've heard in a long time\nSo good on your finding um I Want him to talk about the big thing I actually think you're I really love how you're saying that how it's related to wild man\nI'm I feel like Rome are also as the way that we could find out more about while men because there are Amazonian tribe that were just discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like\nYour ideas revolutionary and I feel like within the next ten years will definitely have an answer because if drones and my question to you is easy it's like you're going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones were going to be good for finding that for that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on missing people [noise] uh it hasn't worked real well and you can't use the drone international park it's against the wall and there's a huge fine so probably won't happen\nThat George Bush go on to the next call I had a question for you and maybe you should have kind of touch on it for the people here your work on skin Walker ranch the researchers there saw something very similar to a big foot can you tell us about that\nActually multiple times ah it's more of the tribe that that encounters them they've seen them there as long as they lived there there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers\nAnd we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal rounds they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and\nUh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was a just outside the window and as soon as the dog's made a noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing a light on it it took off running and it went all the way through the community\nAnd you can hear it that way I mean it was just taking these giant stride it knocked over garbage cans you had alarms going off then the police officers chased it\nAh I think they've they've found some tracks it led to a there's a reservoir there this just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared or they are seen similar creatures on the ranch in self\nUm I shouldn't call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we've described on the program before where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin Walker rigid seen what looked like a dirty snowball\nBut Graham before where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin marker rigid seen what looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floating just off the\nOff the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it ... through infrared you can see the the ball of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel\nAnd through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through struggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the er at the entrance to this uh this tunnel stands up it's eight feet tall I'm feature lists dark humanoid shaped\nLike ahead with no neck on a on a body it's just stands up and then starts moving up towards skin Walker ridge where these guys are watching it and they can tell ya they got the hell out of there they were pretty scared about the whole thing but\nAre there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs uh\nUh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and um I've seen it all over the you went to a base and so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures\nAre that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual phenomena and we don't know\nUm west of the Rockies Kyle in Utah Hi Kyle welcome to the program\nHow you doing All right so in your mind so\n[noise] so I had um you're talking about David Was talking about Joseph stealing Smith the one who taught the Cain on his saddle um he thought Bigfoot\nIt happened in Eighteen or over five of us are Eighteen thirty five\nHe was on his way to another ... ... and he was in the ... the prophet and he ... he ran into a cane and uh he described Cain as a as a tall a figure that was taller than a saddle\nAnd ah just to fill the fifth talked a cane and the heat and Kaine introduced this though is that I Am a man\nI'm personally wander here and there and I my gold will basically he she wanted to make men misery or the destroyed their souls\nYou brought that up I just thought in mourning culture LVS coach earlier that we have you know there's two story that are really famous that story than just killing Smith shoe is Joseph Smith nephew\nKnow his brother had an encounter Wesley Smith a in Hawaii at the dedication and the then lay Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one I came came to read the doors of the temple and I'm In his hand or\nA Wesley Smith said that he that was the priesthood the calf came out and told me he was his hand and they just crashed a catch ... and king [noise] and so it's interesting you say that we can and art church you know like some people who are skeptical like eight they're kind of hush hush let's talk about it\nBut as people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted but I just wanted for David like with the disappearances 'cause I've been reading this book for a little while and stuff\nI Do think it's it's a big foot you taking like does he have any idea what's going on 'cause like people are asking me you know like people don't need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you a Kyle and everyone listening here tonight is probably the the weirdo experts in their family and then there are ... social circle\nAnd everyone listening is likely the go to person in their own circles more information about these kind of topics they are to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that likely a big what type encounter or is that something else\nWell the description that the Smith gave was would match Bigfoot but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the\nBig foot may be some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nNow Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence that he's come across that may joined the two topics\nThen the other things like in the Smith and sent the part that's unusual is that it came and it spoke to him and he never said it mine spoke but more like it spoke to him so hard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things\nI've always stated that I'm a man of facts all of my books are filled with facts there aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion and why do I do that\nBecause there are no facts to to establish any current pattern that points to one suspect when you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA but\nAgain if you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met anybody who's read my eight books and they have been thousands that has come to me and said I Know exactly what's happening doesn't\n[laughter] and I should point out that you know you did to address this may be Kyle didn't hear it but there are no credible stories in your view of big wasn't being responsible for regarding people as far as you\nWell know killing them I I think I'm going okay there's\nThere's a story that John Green wrote about a prospect or that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man\nAnd he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and one of these by pitch grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended up dumped put him in a cave and he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them\nA it's a it's a really really good story who and the individual at the time sign an affidavit I followed greens lead and said this is a good way to document the stories I hear and that's kinda how it came came to pass\nI remember that story no yeah that is a good one is it there are some other held in one of your books about a witness claiming just see a big what type creature carrying a person there is a boring\nUnreal you know I think are so low but there's this\nStory out of Wyoming\nThat I I don't put much Clinton said it because the people didn't come forward and they were doing something illegal but a girl disappeared in Wyoming\nAnd to uh people who are poaching we're out in the woods and they claimed that they saw big for carrying this body under its arm it appeared dead so these people never came forward I don't know who they are or destroy it was given to me but from another\nAre just cited whichever traditionally bad manager getting up of today

profoundly as what we're about to discuss you know I saw a review of this book months ago I knew we had to check it out\nAnd it exceeded all my expectations the subject is representing the writing is do the research is meticulous and this story this tragedy really touches a nerve in ways that I think we will explore over the next few hours it for anyone who is not a student of naval history\nYou know the first time most of us probably heard of what little we know about the USS Indianapolis it can be traced to one of the best scenes in the history of American movies is from blockbuster Spielberg movie jaws Robert jaws character when\nThe best scenes in the history of American movies is from blockbuster Spielberg movie jaws Roberts draws character went delivered a moving powerful slightly tipsy account of what motivated him to become a shark hunter\nHere is an edited version of that scene deserved just as a reminder to you [noise]\nSeven hundred men [noise]\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flagship and I'm\nA small park that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of us in our where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was the case of hitting in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent her on this tasteful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theaters I'm Victoria said okay now as well\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five\nWhen general Leslie grows and the other leaders of Manhattan projects including President Truman decided that they want us to send the components of the atomic bomb\nLittle boy which would later ... to head to the forward areas and trim and did this a lot of uh a lot of people don't know that trim and did this before he even knew that he would use the bomb because at that time uh everyone thought that there would be\nAn invasion of mainland Japan so\nIndianapolis was selected to transport these ... components of the bombs she did that a native record breaking run to a Pearl Harbor\nAnd then pushed on Tiffany an island where she dropped off the components of the atomic bombs and then two days after that on July twenty eighth Nineteen forty five she set out on what was going to be a routine voyage across those needs the from Guam for the Philippines and all my straight west down shot\nAnd right when she was in the middle of the Pacific or Stevie middle of the Philippines these on July thirty is Nineteen forty five minutes after midnight\nOr she intersected course with the Japanese submarine called I fifty eight commanded by lieutenant commander Moshe Sarah how she mode of how she might have fired six plus torpedoes\nHit Indianapolis with two of them the first one almost completely blew the foul off the shift Indianapolis the heavy cruiser\nThe second one hit her image shifts the vessel went down and twelve minutes and you know we've been talking longer than twelve minutes it was very very slick without three hundred men went down with the shift of\nA little under nine hundred and made it into the water alive\nAnd when they made it into the water those who survive their wounds were very optimistic if they were going to be rescued and but uh they weren't and they spent five nights and four days in the water struggling to survive\nAnd uh as you mentioned earlier they've they fought madness they've fought the hydration they fought shark\nOr eventually they fought each other because of the madness\nAnd that is the story that most people know about Indianapolis she was a spotted completely by accident on the about mid day on the fourth the fourth day after five nights and four days in the water and only three hundred and sixty minutes devised\nSarah secrecy plays such an important part in this at every step of the way and it leads to tragedy threatened with tragic tragic results because of the secrecy of the what they were carrying and continue to sort of continued over after they drop them off\nOr what did you share with us the secrecy or I did which obviously was necessary military necessity a lead to tragedy and how you probably you interfered with your ability to get at the core of the story\nAbsolutely I mean there were multiple areas that\nHeld secrecy and the story that led to the demise of Indianapolis and ultimately the men being lost at sea for five days\nAnd you know first of which being how messages were transmitted across the Pacific during the war you know there was a level of coding that had to be taken into consideration and you know one of the ships that Indianapolis was to report to when it arrived in the Philippines\nAnd the message he received was garbled\nAnd so you know protocol said that oh it didn't you know didn't come through clearly and no one asked for a repeat so they didn't even know Indian Indianapolis was supposed to be reporting to them you know that was one of the first thing\nI'm so when she didn't show up they didn't know she was supposed to show up you know um aside from that there was protocol that noncombatants shit the rivals didn't have to be reported and so when she didn't arrive lieutenant thought while I guess I don't have to report that either and so\nHe took it upon himself not to say anything even though he knew the ship wasn't there and these were all put in place you know to protect our vessels during wartime but the secrecy of that and the protocols ultimately lead to her not being found you know and then beyond that\nYou know we had broken the Japanese code at this time and there were a message trafficking going across the Pacific and the Philippines the\nReporting you know various subs in the area well none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't want anyone to know that the codes had been broken and that we were using that\nAnd so yeah he should not have been\nThere without an escort he should have had and\nTaking a step back Indianapolis was not you know made really for combat it was made to get to a scene or to a battle quickly and have guns and so she should've had something you know first of all that sold our second of all that had\nAny armor ability you know the armor too yeah and armor I\nMean she was part of the treaty cruiser so her arm or was exceptionally sending compared to many of the newer shift and so that was one of the reasons why she's saying so quickly [noise]\nAh you know so all of these things kind of came together to form the perfect storm and so much of that played into the secrecy of this mission and why she was out there and why this information and was it passed along to the captain who may have made different decisions\nKnowing that there was a direct threat in its path\nTo me this was it difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I I Know there's been so many wrong stories in wrong conclusions made about what happened there then I Would think they might still be suspicious even decades later\nI think a big part of it they mentioned is that I had spent several years visiting with them spending time with their families talking with them that you know with no other interests other than learning their story\nAnd so they I think trusted me by the time that I actually wanted to start doing interviews and putting the story down on film or you know at the screenplay and eventually as a book and lend as well when she came in we had this trust built in with these men that they knew and genuinely wanted to tell\nThe accurate story however hard and however long that would take we would tell the true story\nWas uh it it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters you you you have to know these people a lot of the people who are characters in the book obviously didn't survives you're using them together I guess from people who did know there but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS ah Indianapolis oh Lynn talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat's right one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back\nIndianapolis story because really man uh before I get out and not as it is to you know\nCircle back to him the man who carry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis was an army named Robert an army major named Robert Feldman\nAnd he has spent the last couple of years after the war running down all of the material that they shared the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bomb uh on the continent of Europe\nThough one sadness in with him and then burn and various components of little boy in Ireland\nUm status final grading gather in Europe and and if the conflict and so\nIn writing the whole book we tried to pull back that rather than bringing in a lot of other characters and world leaders and figures including the Japanese point is is in a dish and two ... we had ever hear the dough and accounting guy with kamikaze commander\nAnd what we tried to do was to\nEven to recognize it even though men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and doing what I think\nI'll tell you what I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break into a will come back and you can talk a little bit more about ... and some of the other central characters including captain McVeigh who took the brunt of the blame we'll be right back talking about the Indianapolis tragedy you're all goes to goes day him\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two vet written from commander how she modus point of view and there was a chapter on is devoted to Indianapolis\nBut because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality alive\nHe was the commander who cared for his men he was a commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around saying on doors asking for radar and more technology for his submarines because\nThat means submarines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of his brother said commanders\nGo down to sell the grave for lack of technology they're carrying you had a wife he had three sons um and eventually in addition to his\nUm [noise] book which was called fun\nUm we were also able to interview his granddaughter a and get even more information about his later life half before\nWell as we'll find out a little bit later he was kinda ticked off because the U.S Navy I mean do you took the extraordinary step of having him testify in court Marshall per capita McVeigh and then uh\nThey didn't really want to hear his version of how things went but we'll we'll circle back around that I'm sure I Want to get to uh the moments right after these torpedoes swam a decided the Indianapolis\nOr chaos breaks out um you know we we heard that clip from Robert showing the movie jaws saying that no signal was sent a note distress signal\nAre not exactly true but sort of true why don't you pick up the story there still is described those next couple of chaotic moments after the torpedoes yeah\nSure well it was just after midnight so you know the moon was behind clouds that had been an intermittent cloudy night and so and that was part of the reason why you know\nI don't know if he would say it's lucky for ... the clouds you just a part in the movie came out for just a moment enough for him to see the silhouette of the ship\nAnd so you know after it was struck\nGiven the power went out with the second torpedo and so there was no power on the ship they couldn't communicate over the first them see\nYou know the ... from the sound system and so there was no one to say abandoned ship you know over the speakers there was no one to tell people to report to battle stations\nThey had to pass that from mouth to mouth well this is a six hundred and ten foot long ship the great big ship so with the chaos happening and the ship sinking in twelve minutes you have to imagine that compartments or flooding incredibly quickly you know the ship is starting to tilt\nFirst to the star bird and then it goes down by the bell\nSo men are being trapped inside the ship unable to his skate from their compartment and you know Lynn and mentioned before they\nBelieve about three hundred and men went down with the ship and even further to this because there wasn't any direct command able to be broadcast to the men people started abandoning ship very shortly after the ship was torpedoed all the way until you know men went down with her and were able to escape so\nA mile and a half is what they believe and you know those who went down on and went off on the ... the low side they would have been with more of the supplies you know there were only twelve raft that they believe got off the ship\n'em but you know standard protocol at that time was to go off the high side the port side well the majority of the men went off that side and there was no supplies so they weren't in rafts they were\nYou know somewhere in even in life jacket some were holding on to flotsam that they could find in the water as long as they could until they could get to someone who can help them\nYou know a fellow ship made or whomever and others had to just swim and tell a sailor would pass away and then everybody would help them take the life jacket off the dead sailor and put it on them\nI mean this was\nIncredibly chaotic so scary these are sixteen Seventeen and Eighteen year olds that had just got on the ship not some of them not even three weeks or a month earlier you know they just went on board and right before the last mission\nHadn't really gone to any drills yet some didn't know how to swim and there and just thrown into the middle of the Pacific at midnight it's pitch black they're covered in fuel oil because in a you know in an effort to save the ship but the last moment\nWe kind of a red vain actually released the fuel into the water and so this is very very sick oil that can only be transferred with heat so it's like tar on these men and they can't tell who anybody is they can barely breed they're swallowing it their vomiting\nThere at this point they're trying to stay alive some have injuries and they won't last much longer\nI'm you know they they say that those who head injuries didn't really make it past the first day but the men who were able to escape without injuries were still suffering are from the early stages of dehydration because of vomiting this feel\nSo no one's in really great shape you know by the time the sun comes up the first morning but they're very optimistic that rescue is going to come because they believe\nThere's a ship in the Philippines waiting for their arrival\nAnd there wasn't you know there were attempts to get a signal out to just didn't go I guess they they they they they weren't successful\nExactly um\nI guess within a couple of days it becomes clear that they know what's coming or if they're coming there they're going to have a hard time finding a because as as you describe in the book they're spread out all over the place and and these big waves are pushing the group's further further apart right I'm\nLynn maybe you want to talk about that a little bit are you in this context there is incredible acts of heroism\nThat you described from some of these sailors who were doing their best to help everybody else and then at the same time there's some incredibly selfish acts of brutality that happen as well\nRight um there were incredible acts of heroism and as you mentioned in as Sarah mentioned the current they move in about one mile an hour in that area and they also move in these sort of giant eddies or world if you will\nAnd so two men that would be together\nIn the morning could be a mile apart by afternoon and and all the time these twelve that swelled some days it's it's clear his glasses on the day to rescue but Sunday's there these twelve twelve along with these current\nSo over time over the course of the the five nights and four days and then become spread out over a twenty five mile area\nAnd I'm One of the rescue pilot later wrote that from altitude\nI read the plain looking down on a situation like that\nLater wrote that from altitude\nA rescue plain looking down on a situation like that that head of one man would be the size of a human hair scene in cross section or diameter from across the room so basically they were invisible\nAnd you mentioned acts of heroism acts of cowardice one ... one real hero was I'm\nA captain park he was the commander of the Marines detachment that was aboard the ship and the largest swimmer group and the water the the the as Sarah mentioned the the men in the water we're spread out initially over a mile and a half and then they just got further and further apart with those currents\nThe largest group that had nothing but life jackets was about four hundred men\nAnd captain park within that group and he really spent\nTwenty four hours a day trying to keep them in together the only resource that that group of men had besides their life jackets which not even all of them had life jackets\nWas a single line that was about a hundred feet long and so they form that line into a circle and the men were to tie themselves to the line\nAnd kept in park would uh\nHelp the men that didn't have life jackets and several times he would get a life jacket from the dead sailor and then give it to another man who needed a life jacket and he did this numerous times\nAnd he would round up the stragglers and encourage everybody until finally on the third day he succumbed to hallucinations and and he died and when he died that group became very desperate because they thought wow if this brave men can't make it how are we all going to make it\n[noise] and then in terms of cowardice um you had precisely the opposite happening with with some men being a selfish\nSend men or even officers taking a place on a raft for example when there were wounded men who needed the place I'm worse\nThere was also the ah in some of the rap groups they had some supplies and they're with hoarding 'em ups supplies and and of water especially\nThat's what I was thinking as I'm\nHearing these stories even without the injuries and the terrible burns and the fact they have no water supplies they're out there in exposed to the elements for days they they have no water and after ... days they're just going crazy and

incorrectly and that had and that ... in part had kept the next day\nAnd he was angry years later zero right at the with the retiring of the USS Indianapolis the submarine the namesake ship many years later a there was an attempt to get him to open up and share the story and he wanted nothing to do with it\nExactly you know they're a commander built or I'm Sorry captain bill Tony who was the commanding officer of the Indianapolis namesake submarine when she was a he commissioned\nBill went over and tried to talk to ... and he said and they didn't believe me then they won't believe me now and he wanted nothing to do was talking with him you know but he did what I was actually pretty incredible as he actually wrote a letter you know kind of flashing forward a few years to the exoneration effort\n... wrote a letter explaining his side of the story and saying that the captain should never have been found guilty\nAnd you know kind of did what he could do in order to help things on race this man\nYou tell the story in the book about a Nineteen sixty reunion a group of survivors and captain McVeigh shows up and he's not exactly sure how he's going to be received by by the group because\nYou know he was court martialed um he received as you noted in the book at these terrible letters from the family you didn't feel he'd been punished enough\nAnd um you know I'm\nReally guilt tripping him for years afterward so he shows up at the Nineteen sixty event and how was he received a when\nHe was received with open arms he have very much dread it\nAnd how was he received or when\nHe was received with open arms he have very much dreaded going to this reunion in Nineteen sixty he hadn't seen these men [noise] except for just a couple of them but most\nOf these men he had not seen since Nineteen forty five right after the court marshal so they decide to have a reunion and they have their reunion in the ships named safe city Indianapolis, Indiana\nAnd captain McVeigh was dreading it but when he got there they actually um\nTravelled out a dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives met him at the airport and they formed\nTo receiving lines are across the tarmac because they didn't have debt ways the way we do now they would they would just say we're deep plane right onto the ramp and so they formed two lines\nAnd when captain McVeigh got to the bottom of the aircraft loading stairs\nSomeone shouted attention on deck and everybody's snap to attention and then they began to chair and the clapping and ... came to his eyes and he he couldn't believe that they were receding him so warmly and that continued through the entire reunion weekend\nSure it talk a little bit about difficulty in getting materials you talk about going through archives and records or share with me you did you run into road blocks that you could not get past that and if so what were they\n[noise] I actually one of the the documents that really helped us pay the biggest picture was the quarter of inquiry documents and\nYou know I had tried for years Lynn had you know come into the picture and joined me in this effort to get a copy of this document and the reason it was so important was that it was really the first recorded testimony of any of the survivors right after the sinking\nSo you know just days after their rescued there in the hospital in Guam and their testimonies are taken and so we tried everything to get these documents and this actually this specific report\nAnd we would come back you know oh it's last forever oh one you know we got one copy of it and it was entirely redacted and you know freedom of freedom of Information Act\nShould've allowed us to have this and then you know we contacted the the source again and our contact said well we don't have an unrestricted version doesn't exist\nAnd so interestingly enough you know a a friend or actually a a young man who became a friend was the grandson of the rescue pilot who landed in the water and same fifty three men his\nBig with his grandson was actually um\nI'm an inspector general started trying to remember is titled he's inspector general works with the navy and he was actually the person who got us this document and this kind of showed us really testimonies of what happened not only when the ship was torpedoed\nAnd those final moments but what was happening in the water because\nIn the court marshal they did not allow any of the testimony is about what took place in the actual water because they didn't you know that would impact how\nMcVeigh was viewed and so it was just kept strictly to what took place when the ship was torpedoed\nAnd the events leading up to that so this new quarter of inquiry document was so important because you know Seventy years later stories can change your stories can be impacted by other stories but this was the purest form of what really took place not only when the ship saying but in the water for those five nights and four days\nWhen you talk about the white immediately after they were rescued\nFibers where they were taken um I I Would assume more of them died after because of their injuries and exposure\nWell if you did die and and if you can imagine how awful that\nWas not only for the men themselves that for their families to know that they had actually made it all the way to rescue only to die of their exposure and their injuries um\nSo I think three hundred and twenty were actually rescued is that correct Sara yes three hundred and twenty were rescued but only three hundred and sixteen ultimately survive so they were taken to face hospitals around the Philippines see eventually converging on Guam\nWhere they had um some time to recover before they had to give their testimony\nAnd then they went aboard the USS how ... how ... which was an escort terrier and they actually landed in our home city of San Diego where they were\nActually participated in a parade and then a very quickly they went home uh\nCaught buses and trains back to their hometowns some of them immediately got out of the navy some of them had survivors leave and then got out of them stayed and made careers of the navy [noise]\nUm and you know this was the greatest generation so the vast majority of them and they just kind of put this behind them they went on to have careers as engineers and fishermen and everything you can think of police officers\nThat there were those who could not hold a job and there were those who became alcoholic and um had many many struggles\nAnd almost to a man none of them talked about it and not even to their families um they held it in for years and years and years and um some for sixty years um but\nMostly they didn't talk about it is today that would be a lot different I think people would be out trying to get a book deal or a movie deal or something like that but these men were different\nI think about that Robert ... character in jaws you know you got that story bottle up he becomes a short cut her as a result of being one of those guys and I'm\nA very moving scene that was great I was going to use that clip anyway I was really glad to see the coverage in the in the book or or or did you always have in mind keeping that in there\nWell yeah it's really you know when Lynne and I've gone across the country talking to groups about the story in this book\nYou know one of the things that really comes out every time is that most people learned about this story from jobs so it's an essential part of the stories history is that you know the public learned about it this way\nAnd interestingly enough some of the children of the survivors actually first heard about it and that their father was involved in it by watching jobs you know they came home several accounts\nCame home saw the movie were really impacted by it and especially this scene and only to find out their dad was on the ship the scene is about well so you know it's pretty incredible the men didn't talk about it that long but then to find out this way but that's you know how your dad served in World War two so\nWe've been to serve leather Indianapolis in the book when we come back we'll open up the phone lines and maybe uh maybe you've got some questions or comments or calls we'll be right back\nSarah share with me your thoughts when you heard the news I think it was last year that the ah Indianapolis had been found a who is this a mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier the some commander of Indianapolis\nAnd you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and there they found the ship and\nI didn't know what he was talking about it for in the morning of and so you know gaining my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before\nThe ... group which has the vessel that were sort of responsible for finding the ship and then several attempts than they were the first one to be successful\nAnd what was interesting about it they said you have three hours before we released this information to the press so go ahead and call the survivors so villain I spent the next\nThree hours of calling the survivors up and being able to share with the news that their ship and found so that was a pretty incredible experience to hear their take on all of it\nWhat's their reaction in general\nIt was really I mean it was very somber was most of them I couldn't believe it actually happened and then it happened in their lifetime or what [laughter] mostly reverence and and that was a young man by the name of a fan Lopez he was a sailor and Indianapolis and the day the ship sank hit a really good\nMostly reverence and then there was a young man by the name of a famine Lopez he was a sailor and Indianapolis in the day the ship sank hit a really good day playing dice with his buddies and so he wanted to know if they would go down and find his money suck\nThat winning [laughter] you know across\nThe board it was general you know respect and reverence for the story but yeah there was a ... a couple of funny quotes here and there from the guys that you know they're always sailors that hurt [noise] and\nAnd land you know we've heard a little bit about road blocks put up a to the information they uh you know were they were not entirely helpful at every step of the way to get this story told what about reaction to the book since it's come out from the navy\nOh boy we've been very very gratified by the reaction there is um an admiral named Hancock who is the director of naval history and heritage can end\nAnd we make contact with admiral ... at the survivors reunion and I believe it was funny if ten or twenty sixteen and we send while through we'd really like to have your support and your health on this\nAnd um he was helpful and directing as various resources but\nIf you can imagine sending this real work at the heart that you've done to try to honor these men and honor the legacy and tell the whole story of this shift and and gave the entire history\nAnd draw new analysis that various things that happened in the story you can imagine taking that and then sending it to the director of naval history and heritage and and saying hey sir hey admiral what do you think\nA boy we were we nervous about that that he really really has endorsed a story and I went to his full court since he saw which is what we came up with\nWell I Know Sarah has an award winning documentary film about it sure seems like it would make a great movie I'm hopeful big screen movie any thoughts about that\nWe are actually working on that right now so I stay tuned [laughter]\nWe'll take a couple of calls I've got some other questions but the west of the Rockies Jerry in Modesto, California as a personal connection to the story I jury\nYeah are you doing my father was a on the ship was the first one or the ... uh to rescue the sabers in the water and I'm Still have been one car being used and she was discharged from school you know\nAnd I never saw him I ... years past ... years go by never saw him cry and do you try to talk about that story\nThat's amazing what he uh with the on the USS that peace will take the oil or the path that you know the name of the ship that's in a\nNew ... and I don't remember it's on it's on it's been stone and I was thinking about that before I call not a damn what was the name of the ship but to me she was the first one who knew him\nAnd he was talking it was horrific you know he tried to tell the story a little bit and my father never talked about in the about\nEgypt all that and all those years you know\nHe was like a you know just it was just part of the ethos of that generation that those\nOh yeah yeah he was in World War two and Korea or he was going to dream dinners made for each class you know but he ... he was a police optional who's officer for Thirty years well there is an incredible story and I\nAbsolutely heroic to go into harm's way like that and um if he was aboard the bass it\nAnd I absolutely heroic can go into harm's way like that and um if he was aboard the Basset\nOne interesting story is that the commanding officer and the death that\nWas considered to be a coward by some of his men and indeed when they arrived on the same if you didn't really know what he was getting into and ah he needed at that had been found could probably buy a submarine that they didn't know what exactly had happened\nAnd there was um a sailor spotted a large shark and the water and he said look at that fish\nWell fish is another word for it torpedo and so the cat in ...\nHe tried to get everybody out of there said he said I'm all ahead full we're going to get outta here we're going to leave the scene and his officers actually need need and lock the captain in his state room and continued with Iraq you have to be interesting if your dad was had been on that ship\nThanks Jerry appreciated wildcard line run and used in the morning on\nGood morning ah my father was also in the navy and he was on a destroyer escort Cecil jade de while he was twenty six years old he was the Ensign doctor\nAnd what's interesting over forty years I had opened up one of his um I guess his seat just you know of all of his member was and I found unbelievable and eye witness accounts a letter of the eye witness accounts\nFrom the doctor's point of view of the rescue of the survivors I've got the letter in front of me it's faded August fifth Sunday at sea\nAnd it's a phenomenal letter I think the uh women would love to see this to read this it talks about the sharks it talks about the fact that the pull these guys up tick in the sharks off their rear end\nShowing 'em up with the with a line given a morphine giving them penicillin\nThis is an unbelievable letter from the of view of the doctor and it was my dad\nAnd he has been that some of the reunions but never did talk about this\nBut the fact that I found this letter it's about five six pages of the whole account its its history its historical I Love my fair share this with uh either young ladies if I can get them getting information and now\nI'll tell you what Ron why don't you hold on and Donna oh are are down there will get the information for you will pass it on to win and Sarah and thank you for calling appreciate you sharing that I I'd like to see that myself thank you so how many how many of the survivors are still with us Sarah\nThere's fourteen still living\nClass I don't assume that they still have a gatherings do they\nActually you know um we've gone to several events all over the country with them and they they do have reunions every July and Indianapolis I'm\nAbout five or six I think six came this year and it is dwindling but you know we'll have an event on the USS Hornet on Veterans Day and two of the survivors will be there for that so you know the the youngest is Ninety One but\nThey're still sailors that heart and I think think an arm wrestle man went [laughter]\nKnow it's a generational thing well we're we're hearing these descriptions both from the two of you in from the callers about um how how these men reacted to it keeping bottled up inside you're right it would be\nBoth from the two of you in from the callers about um how how these men reacted to it keeping bottled up inside you're right it would be different now people would be out there on Dr phil or or getting a book deal or something but keeping it inside I don't know if it's entirely healthy but it certainly has changed when you agree\nYes absolutely and I I Do wonder whether maybe ... how ... how the er I I don't know I think ah I think that generation may have been a lot more stable than we are now that uh it is an interesting contrast isn't it and then I think it has to do with the\nThe um ... the

Indianapolis it's taken more than fifty years for the full story to emerge from behind and official wall of secrecy and blame\nTo remarkable journalists have worked for years to tell the whole story\nI was totally blown away by their book it takes you right there into the water with the sailors as they struggle to survive shark attacks and the elements for days and days wow what a story a coauthor is Lynn Vincent and Sarah ... will be here to share what is already a runaway best seller of a book\nA but first I had hinted last month when ... was here that he had something else in the works I'm not sure when the guy sleeps but he returns to the program coming up and just a few minutes and in a sense he is returning to his roots\nYou know the first time he was on coast to coast I Believe it was ten years ago to discuss his first book the hoop a project\nWas a typical day polite as boots on the ground investigation this time of the big butt legend and David spent two years among the ... tribe to hear their tails and legends and to apply police in forensic methods to figure out what was being seen in the forests of the Pacific northwest\nAs it turns out a course similar sightings have been reported all over the world and wild Dave is better known these days for his investigations of missing people\nHe's never stopped thinking about or working on the big foot mystery and tonight he's back with a book that's a great resource for anyone interested in this subject it traces the sasquatch story through newspaper reports and historical records that name big what has been around as we know since Nineteen fifty eight\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police said police background I approached them and they said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nNot going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big story in Hooper that live miles away who someone coming into town I started to think about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and he would sit down with a witness\nAble to draw the sketch from just the witness statements and the results were amazing\nBut I wanted something to a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans and I found a diamond unbelievable look\nAn individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met in right away we just quick like brothers\nAnd when Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery and draw the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due to schedule the suspect that is how accurate this man has\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes they immediately accept accepted him because he's just shy enter ... Native American chief it's got a law enforcement background so we can kind of smell\nWhen it happens and I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends we did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called the tribal big foot\nAnd draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury and a kind of how it started\nAh you said you don't have a dog in the fight meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo ah when I started the most local the most audacious the most vulgar [laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kinda went down that path thinking well it must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around hoop and drew the sketches\nHarvey myself in Harvey wife Gina proud also an agent for in Oklahoma\nWe were sat in stunned disbelief because the sketches were very human like yeah they were huge yeah they have hair all over the body that there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss and they didn't look like apes they didn't have that\nApe characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera and it was just shocking and\nWhen the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady and to a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it that if the sack Lee what you look like\nAnd when you talk about the old there's they would consistently say this is another tribal people is on animals is there are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with him at least that coexistence right\n[noise] yeah it in the tribal area I met the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nThe one thing about the hoop areas the trinity river I great salmon and steal head area a has just so much wildlife\nAnd if you drive through hoop uh from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains and I've ever seen anywhere in the world\nAnd there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I I Know that they're seeing eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou uh I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law man as a former law man at the state of the evidence about this whether you'd say there is that there is sufficient evidence that something is real here or that we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path\nI knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it and many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a ah a PHD name Melba catch them\nWas one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs tissue blood et cetera that we'd bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America to test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many of them were ... were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA and then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva\nAnd all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA\nAnd what the showed was that the bypass could went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the females side to the ... Arab region to ah Jerusalem to\nA Jordan ended that part of the world and this is when I was sent to a gym bag and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her write a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written up before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't do this but you and I work together to introduce smell but two of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\n[noise] she listen to some of this but you didn't listen to all of it\nAnd unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in the white paper in a white paper but if you extract all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten samples cells tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big wild man and giants he's hearing noon and night night I mean big but here it gets into the break\nIt was the best of the best the DNA was sent to for certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake all of the labs got the same results or it was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA has come back as bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her that people are saying going to say well how do you know that's big for their well ... looks different than any other mammal hair in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America and when you look at a big but here it's an entirely different\nSo if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle and never went on to DNA but if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using their hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that Mel but did to extract this DNA and to get the results and there's a lotta there's a lotta attitude in this arena as you know George\nGet the results and there's a lotta there's a lotta attitude in this arena as you know George\nAnd it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes that's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like the UFO world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very turf conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their take their passion to different levels um to the point of\nFraudulent um material um and ah will stab people in the back and will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence ... at a minimum\nUm people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's human but it's not all human\nYou know and that's that's the part but as I can say is it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with the human match on gender thing\nAnd when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that\nGen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours and how could that be\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kind of surmise that\nSay a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appears that a big foot with trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this that people haven't read the study they've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia of the data and read the report because it's available online\nAnd see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit Melba she's a genius scientists that figure this out [noise] um it's unfortunate\nYeah was it got down to a thrown under the under the bus as she did as well um\n... you said that the this\nThis was not engine bank is it now or did they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it ...\n... let's go to your book big wild man and giants I mean a lotta times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really\nA tremendous writing in some of these old articles a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious in in reading and often making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the\nDifferent categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinction\nThings are the three different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eight how did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seemed to myth that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded is two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as the description\nTwenty four years eight gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U. S. sixteen and Canada three in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it\nA whirl Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana eleven New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six and then the numbers keep going down from there but\nAgain it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article and the missing\nBut I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentation just genius\nIs a lot of people say oh you know if you're overlay this map with the maps of the foot wild man disappearances there all the same and he puts up a map of like Bigfoot the ah appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes down like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything because you know what this map because it was a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated in the same location of the big\nFight [laughter] and but it was his statement about giants that were found in past centuries in mountains and in a excavations\nThat really kinda got me thinking or these giants the big for that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories you're in Nevada you know the ... century shown to you have legends and stories about the big foot bones or a giant bones that were stashed in the game up in northern Nevada and Ah yes what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find a\nLot of these articles pointed to um some universities would get 'em but the the more likely candidate where all these went and it's set in the articles was the Smithsonian\nYet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nLook back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book it's from the Marilyn that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three describing an account or a witness to use those on the ... of a rubber an animal\nBetween twelve and fifteens deed Hi it's a sheep resembling a human except the head with it which is an equal proportion to the body the feet are two feet long\nIt's a sheep resembling a human except the head with it which is an equal proportion to the body the seats are two feet long and Harry oh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the description semi modern descriptions of big but\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds I I was stunned because nobody talks about it\nBut when you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being except the head which is like you said an equal proportion to the body\nAnd so I'm thinking wow they were writing about this way back when and nobody nowadays is ever brought this stuff up so one of the articles I I put in\nAnd change the world for everyone affected by multiple sclerosis\nBring unity together\nCreating teams with friends and co workers\nWe can change the world\nFor people with them\nDot org kids and teens a day or unintentionally injured or killed\nEd in family fire dot org brought to buy the castle and and family fire\nRussian you have two systems adjusted to this country and it's become patently obvious to everybody and it's very simple if you are a Democrat\nAnd you've been gauge any any kind of questionable illegal activity you get a pass if you're a Republican you don't people know that we have two systems of justice in Washington and the Democrats are not held accountable the same way Republicans are we have to\nLive the systems of justice\nRush Limbaugh we do have ... news talk Ninety five point five\nWill cut us off the phone rang and I live changed in any CAT scan and yet the next in our son Ryan spring\nAlmost seven years later the Ryan is a happy healthy eight year old loves playing hockey\nThis is talk of all thanks to organizations like Alex is underneath skin foundation that fight for better treatment think yours and help get families like ours to\nClean up ... ... ... ... you can visit Alex lemonade not or to learn more\nWe this is where Montana she'd be well am nine Seventy buildings these huge each word and you're listening to news ...

descriptions is just terrific writing\nIt it's somebody wasn't just bone and get in or when they were working on this story and the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas\nOr that's not where we associate big butt sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why would Ohio in Pennsylvania be so prominent in the numbers and it's because I mean that was the center of American civilization and is Seventeen hundreds or so Seventeen eighties where\nThe bigger cities where it wasn't exactly the frontier because there are people out here as well but uh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived time\nOr exactly and it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to look at the fighting locations in conjunction to the giants sightings and skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where do you refer to stab Bush\nCivilization and cities that as we move west where were these locations but then even though we're thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings\nWall that's Bruce Maccabee with Ohio is a friend and I I went to spend four or five days within earlier this year and the strange things that he's\nBruce ... with Ohio is a friend and I I went to spend four or five days within earlier this year and the strange things that he's told me that have happened in Ohio in the air and on the ground it's really strange\n[laughter]\nBruce Mac can be a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy a boat in person and on the air and in his books uh you know what it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big butter sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nWide I'd never\nHeard of him either and a again a surprising surprising fact that they're writing about it from there and then in the ... they there's an article from there about a citing ... when you look at the descriptions that they're offering\nAlmost identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts\nAnd then when you think about present day sightings\nAgain from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\nUm you know some of the the descriptions obviously you have to take him in a cultural context now I don't remember when the jungle book was written but Mobley the character Mobley um you know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that you've collected here\nCorrect and er I people always telling me well what about the star wars creature that looks like Bigfoot and how it's kind of strange\nThan it was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's it's it's a similarity\nUm some of the descriptions I guess I Would have to live through it here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of a thing which suggests to me maybe they were humans may be read they really were literally wild men out there\n[noise] and usually and occasionally even nowadays you hear about it for wearing clothing and kind of goes unexplainable because why would they do that but you know maybe it's\nSome association maybe they're trying to break a barrier if they're seen maybe they think there'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared you know we could all thrown our conjecture about why that may be happening but it happens too often for people to be fabricating it I\nI hear it occasionally but not very often\nUm if you were to communicate with to try these days in a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the hope is is are there any other tribes you would say people that have a relationship one going with the whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one\nI mean there's there's famous stories out of Arizona New Mexico and the high plains out there where uh they have these and there's many times an association between and this is where they put people start their head start spending that fact\nWhere there's this association between big foot in UFOs\nEven in the hoop a book I wrote that many of the tribal people said that they saw a UFO and coast time and space to the point where they saw big foot and they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds\nAnd when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars and they're they're not once they have your trust they will tell you hey you know there's this association between\nAnd they're they're not once they have your trust they will tell you hey you know there's this association between us and them and there are different kinds of tribe and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did\nAnd when you start to go back and you look at the history of the certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big but people that die hards don't like it\nThe UFO diehards like it even less than they they're not comfortable with that at all but you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are I don't know what you up those are where they're from\nBut um there was enough cases are over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book\nYou can't ignore it I thought the ... there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures\nAre engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really is unusual several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents\nSo they own a huge Jerry for anyone out there and talk to them and there's all this I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know every once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely melt\nAnd goes I don't understand it [laughter] then\nThe same man told them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property and something tells me don't turn around\nGet back on the horse or get back on my ATV and leave and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property I don't know how it got there so\nDogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I recall I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruits\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nOf course the tribal people who are seen them take deer et cetera they're an omnivore\nAnd many times when\nThe natives are in the middle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up on a tree and I could two hundred and fifty pound deer native I couldn't have done it and they don't know how it got way up in the trees and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\nBack in a bottle\nDavid I have had many sleepless nights listening who everything about the missing persons like it is one of the most unsettling thing that I've heard in a long time\nSo good job on your finding um I Want him to talk about the first thing I actually think you're I really love how you're saying it how it's related Wildman\nI'm I feel like drones are also of the way that we could find out more about wild men because there are Amazonian tribe that were just discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like\nYour ideas revolutionary and I feel like with them and I hadn't years will definitely have an answer because drones and my question is\nDo you feel like you're going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but ah there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones were going to be good for finding bit for that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on missing people a husband worked real well and you can't use a drone international park it's against the wall and there's a huge fine so probably won't happen\nThat George Bush go onto the next call it a question for you and maybe you can kind of touch on it for the people here your work on skin Walker ranch the researchers there saw something very similar to a big foot can you tell us about that\nAre actually multiple times uh it's more of the tribe that that in calendars them they've seen them there as long as they lived there there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers and we went to the spot where it happened\nIf they lived there there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers\nAnd we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal grounds they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and\nUh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was a just outside the window and as soon as the dog's made a noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing a light on it it took off running and it went all the way through the community\nAnd you can hear it\nIt ... I mean it was just taking these giant stride it knocked over garbage cans you had alarms going off then that the police officers chased that\nAh I think they've they've found some tracks it led to a there's a reservoir there that's just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared or they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself\nI'm I shouldn't call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we've described on the program before where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin Walker rigid seen what looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floating just off the\nOff the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it ... through infrared you can see the the ball of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel\nAnd through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through struggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the er at\nThe entrance to this uh this tunnel stands up it's eight feet tall I'm feature lists dark humanoid shaped\nLike ahead with no neck on a on a body it's just stands up and then starts moving up towards getting Walker ridge where these guys are watching it and they can tell ya they got the hell out of there they were pretty scared about the whole thing but\nAre there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs uh\nUh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and um I've seen it all over the you went to Beijing so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures\nAre that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual phenomena and we don't know\nUm west of the Rockies Kyle in Utah Hi Kyle welcome to the program\nHow you doing All right so in your mind\nSo [noise] so I had um you're talking about David Was talking about Joseph stealing Smith the ones you talked to came on his saddle um he thought Bigfoot\nHappening Eighteen [noise] a five star Eighteen thirty five\nHe was on his way to another ... ... and he was an awful lot of time that the prophet and he he ran into a cane and uh he described came as a as a tall a figure that was taller than a shadow\nAnd ah [noise] just to fill the fifth talked a cane and the heat and Kaine introduced this though is that I'm a man\nI'm personally longer here and there and I might go\nBasically he she wanted to make men misery that destroyed\nTheir souls\nYou brought that up I just thought in mourning culture LVS coach or that we have you know there's two story really famous that story than just killing spare few is Joseph ... left you\nKnow his brother had an encounter Leslie Smith in Hawaii at the dedication and\nAnd all of the in Nineteen Twenty one came came to read the doors of the temple and I'm In his hand\nAnd Wesley Smith said that he that was the priesthood to cast came out and told me he wants his hand and they just crashed a cash yeah king wrong and so it's interesting you say that we can and art church you know like some people who is skeptical I ate there kind of hush hush let's not talk about it\nBut as people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted but I just wanted for David like with the disappearances 'cause I've been reading these books are a little while and stuff\nI Do think it's it's a big foot he said he can he does he have any idea what's going on is like people are asking me you know like people do need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you Kyle and everyone listening here tonight is probably the the weirdo expert in their family and then there are ... social circle a you and uh and everyone listening is likely they go to person in their own circles more information about these kind of topics\nThey are to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that likely a big what type\nEncounter or is that something else\nWill the description that the Smith gave was would match big foot but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the big ... may be some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nOf Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence that he's come across that may joined the two topics\nThen the other things like in the Smith and sent the part that's unusual is that it came and it spoke to him and he never said it mind spoke but more like it spoke to him so hard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things\nI've always stated that I'm a man of facts all of my books are filled with facts there aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion and why do I do that because there are no facts to to establish any current pattern that points to one suspect\nWhen you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA\nBut again if you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met anybody who's read my eight books and they have been thousands that has come to me and said I Know exactly what's happening\nNow [laughter] and I should point out that you know you did to address this may be Kyle didn't hear it but there are no credible stories in your view of big what being responsible for recording people as far as you know\n[noise] well no no killing them I I think I'm going okay there's\nThere's a story that John Green wrote about a prospect or that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man\nAnd he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and one of these by pitch grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended up dumped put him in a cave and he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them\nA it's a it's a really really good story who and the individual at the time sign an affidavit I followed green bleed and said this is a good way to document the stories I hear and that's kinda how Kevin came to pass\nI remember that story no yeah that is a good one\nIn one of your books about a witness claiming to see a big what type creature carrying a person through the forest\nUnreal\nYou know I think are so low but there's a story\nOut of Wyoming\nThat I I don't put much credence in it because the people didn't come forward and they were doing something illegal but a girl disappeared in Wyoming\nAnd to uh people who are poaching we're out in the woods and they claimed that they saw big for carrying this body under its arm that appear dead so these people never came forward I don't know who they are destroyed was given to me but from another\nOf work and we're here to help you some restrictions applying the darker detailed\nUsed savings on new and

knew we had to check it out\nAnd it exceeded all my expectations the subject is rebutting the writing is superb the research is meticulous and this story this tragedy really touches a nerve in ways that I think we will explore over the next few hours at for anyone who's not a student of naval history\nYou know the first time most of us probably heard a little we know about the USS Indianapolis it can be traced to\nOne of the best scenes in the history of American movies is from blockbuster Spielberg movie jaws Roberts draws character went delivered a moving powerful slightly tipsy account of what motivated him to become a shark hunter\nHere is an edited version of that scene deserved just as a reminder to you [noise]\nSeven hundred men [noise]\nA small parts that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of us now where your father drove the landing fast and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the short on ... and during that time in March thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent her on this fateful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theaters I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battles\nBut instead she went back to mirror island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five\nWhen general Leslie grows and the other leaders of Manhattan Project including President Truman decided that they want us to send the components of the atomic bomb\nLittle boy which would later ... head to the forward areas and trim and did this a lot of uh a lot of people don't know that Truman did this before he even knew that he would use the bombs because at that time uh everyone thought that there would be\nAn invasion of mainland Japan so\nIndianapolis was selected to transport these ... components of the bombs she did that a native record breaking run into a Pearl Harbor\nAnd then pushed on to penny an island where she dropped off the components of the atomic bomb and then two days after that on July twenty eighth Nineteen forty five she set out on what was going to be a routine voyage across the ... the from Guam to the Philippines and almost straight west down shot\nAnd right when she was in the middle of the specific or stays in the middle of the Philippines these on July thirty is Nineteen forty five just a few minutes after midnight\nOr she intersected course with the Japanese submarine called I fifty eight commanded by lieutenant commander Moshe Sarah how she mode of how she might have fired six plus torpedoes\nHit Indianapolis with two of them the first one almost completely lose a fell off the shift Indianapolis was a heavy cruiser\nThe second one hit her image shifts the vessel went down and twelve minutes and you know we've been talking longer than twelve minutes it was very very quick about three hundred men went down with the shift of a little under nine hundred made it into the water alive\nAnd when they made it into the water those who survived their wounds were very optimistic if they were going to be rescued soon but uh they weren't and they've spent five nights and four days in the water struggling to survive\nAnd uh as you mentioned earlier they've they fought madness they've fought the hydration they fought shark\nOr eventually they fought each other because of the madness\nAnd that is the stories are the most people know about Indianapolis she was spotted completely by accident on the about mid day on the fourth the fourth day after five nights in four days and the water and only three hundred and sixteen minutes devised\nSarah secrecy plays such an important point\nFive nights and four days in the water and only three hundred and sixty men survive\nSarah secrecy plays such an important part in this in every step of the way and it leads to tragedy threatened with tragic tragic results because of the secrecy of the what they were carrying and continue to sort of continued over after they drop them off\nOr wanted to share with us the house secrecy or I ... which obviously was necessary military necessity or lead to tragedy and how it you'd probably interfered with your ability to get at the core of the story\nAbsolutely I mean there were multiple areas that helped secrecy and the story that led to the demise of Indianapolis and ultimately the men being you know lost at sea for five days\nAnd you know first of which being how messages where transmitted across the Pacific during the war you know there was a level of coding that had to be taken into consideration and you know one of the ships that\nIndianapolis was to report to when it arrived in the Philippines was um admiral McCormick and the message he received was garbled\nAnd so you know political said that oh it didn't you know didn't come through clearly and no one asked for a repeat so they didn't even know Indian Indianapolis was supposed to be reporting to them you know that was one of the first thing\nI'm so when she didn't show up they didn't know she was supposed to show up you know um aside from that there was protocol that noncombatants ship the rivals didn't have to be reported and so when she didn't arrive lieutenant thought well I guess I don't have to report that either\nAnd so he took it upon himself not to say anything even though he knew the ship was in there and these were all put in place you know to protect our vessels during wartime but the secrecy of that and the protocols ultimately lead to her not being found you know and then\nBeyond that\nYou know we had broken the Japanese code at this time and there were a message trafficking going across the Pacific and the Philippines the\nReporting you know various subs in the area well none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't want anyone to know that the codes and been broken and that we were using that\nAnd so yeah he should not have been\nThere without an escort he should have had you know\nTaking a step back Indianapolis was not you know made really for combat it was made to get to a scene or to a battle quickly and have guns and so she should've had something you know first of all that so in our in the second of all that had\nAny harm or ability you know the armor too yeah and armor I\nMean she was part of the treaty cruiser so her armor was exceptionally sin compared to many of the newer shifts and so that was one of the reasons why she saying so quickly [noise]\nUh you know so all of these things kind of came together to form the perfect storm and so much of that played into the secrecy on this mission and why she was out there and why this information and wasn't passed along to the captain who may have made different decisions\nKnowing that there was a direct threat and his staff\nTold me this was it difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I I Know there's been so many wrong stories in wrong conclusions made about what happened there then I Would think they might still be suspicious even decades later\nWell I think a big part of it they mention is that I had spent several years visiting with them and spending time with their families talking with them that you know\nTheir story and so they\nI think trusted me by the time that I actually wanted to start doing interviews and putting the story down on film or you know as a screenplay and eventually as a book and lend as well when she came in we had this trust built in with these men that they knew and genuinely wanted to tell\nThe accurate story however hurting however long that would take we would tell the true story\nWell he was a it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters are you you get to know these people a lot of the people who are characters in the book obviously didn't survives you're using them together I guess from people who did know them but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... the the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat try one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back the land on the Indianapolis story because really the man or before the crash and not just to to you know\nCircle back to him the man who ferry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis was an army name Robert an army major named Robert Feldman\nAnd he has spent the last couple of years after the war running down all of the material that they feared the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bomb or on the continent of Europe\nSo one sadness in what's going to be and then burn and carries decision about components of little boy attending an island\nUm status the final grading the editor of the Europe and and the conflict and so in writing the whole book we try to pull back that lands and bringing in a lot of other uh characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese point of view so in addition to hash amount overhead and for the though and the county is ... ... commander\nAnd what we tried to do or where to\nBegin to recognize it even though men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and doing what they\nWill tell you what are we I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break into a will come back and you can talk a little bit more about ... and some of the other central characters including captain McVeigh who took the brunt of the blame we'll be right back talking about the Indianapolis tragedy you're all goes to goes down\nWell it was it and then more thought that was published after the war the first ... Nineteen fifty two and a Japanese language and then it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America and English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two that written from commander has tremendous point of view and there was a chapter on if devoted to Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the world war two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot\nA with a commander who cared for his men there was a commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around saying on doors asking for radar and more technology for his submarine because Japanese submarines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and said he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of his brother said commanders\nGo down to sell the grave for lack of technology they're carrying had a wife he has three sons um and eventually in addition to his\nUm [noise] book which was called fun um we were also able to interview his granddaughter a\nAnd get even more information about his later life half before\nWell as we'll find out a little bit later he was kinda ticked off because of the U.S Navy I mean they took the extraordinary step of having him testify at a court martial for captain McVeigh and then\nThey didn't really want to hear his version of upheld things went but we'll we'll circle back around that I'm sure I Want to get to uh the moments right after these torpedoes slam into decided the Indianapolis\nA chaos breaks out um you know we we heard that clip from Robert showing the movie jaws saying that no signal was sent a note distress signal\nAre not exactly true but sort of true why don't you pick up the story there tell us describe those next couple of chaotic moments after the torpedoes hit\nSure well it was just after midnight so you know the moon was behind cloud that had been an intermittent cloudy night and ... and that was part of the reason why you know\nI don't know if he would say it's lucky for how she amount obey the clouds just parted in the movie came out for just a moment enough for him to see the fellow at the ship and so you know after it was struck given the power went out with the second torpedo\nFor him to see the silhouette of the ship\nAnd so you know after it was struck\nGetting the power went out with the second torpedo and so there was no power on the ship they couldn't communicate over the first them see\nYou know the ... from the sound system and so there was no one to say abandoned ship you know over the speakers there was no one to tell people to report to battle stations\nThey had to pass that from mouth to mouth well this is a six hundred and ten foot long ship the great big ship so with the chaos happening and the ship sinking in twelve minutes you have to imagine that compartments or flooding incredibly quickly you know the ship is starting to tilt\nFirst to the star bird and then it goes down by the bell\nSo men are being trapped inside the ship unable to his skate from their compartments and you know and ... and mentioned before they believe about three hundred men went down with the ship\nAnd even further to this because there wasn't any direct command able to be broadcast to the men people started abandoning ship very shortly after the ship was torpedoed all the way until you know men went down with her\nAnd were able to escape so these men were spread out for over a mile and a half is what they believe\nAnd you know those who went down on or went off on the ... the low side they would have been with more of the supplies you know there were only twelve raft that they believe got off the ship\n'em but you know standard protocol at that time was to go off the high side the port side well the majority of the men went off that side and there was no supplies so they weren't in rafts they were\nYou know somewhere in even in life jacket some were holding on to flotsam that they can find in the water as long as they could until they could get to someone who can help them\nYou know a fellow ship made or whomever and others had to just swim and tell a sailor would pass away and then everybody would help them take the life jacket off the dead sailor and put it on them\nI mean this was incredibly chaotic so scary these are sixteen Seventeen and Eighteen year olds that had just got on the ship not some of them not even three weeks or months earlier you know they just went on board right before the last mission\nHadn't really gone to any drills yet some didn't know how to swim and they're just thrown into the middle of the Pacific at midnight it's pitch black they're covered in fuel oil because in a you know in an effort to save the ship but the last moment\nLieutenant a red ban actually released the fuel into the water and so this is very very sick oil that can only be transferred with heat so it's like tar on these men and they can't tell who anybody is they can barely breed they're swallowing it their vomiting\nThere at this point they're trying to stay alive some have injuries and they won't last much longer\nI'm you know they they say that those who head injuries didn't really make it past the first day but the men who were able to escape without injuries were still suffering are from the early stages of dehydration because of vomiting this fuel oil\nSo no one's really great shape you know by the time the sun comes up the first morning but they're very optimistic that rescue is going to come because they believe\nThere's a ship in the Philippines waiting for their arrival\nAnd there wasn't you know there were attempts to get a signal out to just didn't go I guess they they they they they weren't successful\nExactly um\nGuess within a couple of days it becomes clear that they know what's coming or if they're coming there they're going to have a hard time finding it because as as you describe in the book they're spread out all over the place and in these big waves are\nThey're coming there they're going to have a hard time finding a because as as you describe in the book they're spread out all over the place and and these big waves are pushing the group's further and further apart right I'm\nLynn maybe you want to talk about that a little bit in this context there's incredible acts of heroism that you described from some of these sailors who were doing their best to help everybody else and then at the same time there is some incredibly selfish acts of brutality that happen as well\nWell that's right um there were incredible acts of heroism and as you mentioned in as Sarah mentioned\nThe currents they move that about one mile an hour in that area and they also move in these sort of giant eddies or world if you will and so two men that would be together\nIn the morning could be a mile apart by afternoon and and all the time these twelve foot swelled Sundays it's it's clear as glass says on the day of the rescue but Sunday's there these twelve swells along with these currents so over time over the course of the the five nights and four days\nAnd then become spread out over a twenty five mile area\nAnd I'm One of the rescue pilot later wrote that from altitude\nA rescue plain looking down on a situation like that that head of one man would be the size of a human hair scene in cross section or diameter from across the room so basically they were invisible\nAnd you mentioned acts of heroism acts of cowardice one ... one real hero was I'm\nA captain park he was the commander of the Marines detachment that was aboard the ship and\nThe largest swimmer group and the water the the the as Sarah mentioned the the men in the water we're spread out initially over a mile and a half and then they just got further and further apart with those currents the largest group that had nothing but life jackets was about four hundred men\nAnd captain park within that group and he really spent\nTwenty four hours a day trying to keep them in together the only resource that that group of men had besides their life jackets which not even all of them had life jackets\nWas a single line that was about a hundred feet long and so they form that line into a circle and the men were to tie themselves to the line\nAnd kept in park would uh\nHelp the men that didn't have life jackets and several times he would get a life jacket from the dead sailor and then give it to another man who needed a life jacket and he did this numerous times\nAnd he would round up the stragglers and encourage everybody until finally on the third day he succumb to hallucinations and and he died and when he died that group became very desperate because they thought wow if this brave men can't make it how are we all going to make it\n[noise] and then in terms of cowardice um you had precisely the opposite is happening with with some men being a selfish\nSome men are even officers taking a place on a raft for example when there were wounded men who needed the place I'm worse\nThere was also the ah in some of the rap groups they had some supplies and they're with hoarding 'em ups supplies and and of water especially\nThat's what I was thinking as I'm hearing these stories even without the injuries and the terrible burns\nThat's what I was thinking as I'm hearing these stories even without the injuries and the terrible burns and the the fact they have no water supplies they're out there in exposed to the elements for days they they have no water and after ... days they're just going crazy and then", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George
