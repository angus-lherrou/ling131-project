over with us author partner of the sherpas technology group in Silicon valley of former investment banker with UPS in New York His world view has been turned upside down in the late to two thousand sixteen period when he was exposed to world changing science\nWhich suggested that country the mainstream assumptions consciousness has not produced by the brain now after we're searching extensively he wrote this book in the end the upside down thinking\nTo introduce all of us to these cutting edge ideas and here he is on the coast to coast I've got this really shocked you wouldn't necessarily Marc didn't it\nAbsolutely shocked me thank you for having me on\nI'm looking forward to this too I always ask questions of gas scientists and people who are experts on the brain does consciousness exist outside of the brain or not now the pure scientists Joe the medical professional folks mark would always say you have to have the brain in order to have\nAnd I've always thought no no no conscious you why we found out did\nI did and I I was very squarely in what's known as the materialist science camp which suggests that the universe is fundamentally made of matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago\nFilling the universe with physical material that we call matter and when you have enough matter in this big universe you're bound to get interactions between those pieces of matter we call that chemistry\nWhen you have enough random chemical reactions you're ... you're bound to end up with\nA self replicating molecule like DNA chance says that would happen and DNA leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being the human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain that's the perspective\nAnd if you buy into that which I used to then when the brain dies consciousness dies memories are gone so\nWhen you think about meaning in life if you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one is dead there is no memories there is no consciousness and that's the prevailing perspective as you mentioned and narrow science and most of science today\nNo you know while I Would lose money in a scene that you would write a book about consciousness how did you\nI Would have lost money too [laughter] so it was\nAbout two years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally materialist that's what I Would call it now in hindsight\nUh but I I randomly stumbled across pod cast that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had and at the end of it her name is Laura Powers\nShe mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers\nAnd I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula and I listen to a different episodes and people there were many different people who talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities\nThe ability for consciousness to survive bottled up things I had no familiarity with an overtime just hearing enough different people describing similar perspectives on reality\nI got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real\nAnd this was a very jarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless\nAnd here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness maybe the brain's more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that process is consciousness and the identity that we have is not tied to the body\nSo that totally freaked me out and a change in my world view completely led me down the path of intense research because I needed to rethink all of reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in financing consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends overtime at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity topics [noise]\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight\nSo after hearing enough of this feedback and also seeing that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened\nSo it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend and I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco and decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to\nAnd the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days and ended up writing more than half of the book it's now out and then finished over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript\nAnd ultimately a ice cold email Gladstone who is now my agent and my publisher multiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents Eckhart totally\nAmong the people you know wash 'em and so that's where we are\nSuper now what did you mean by an end to upside down thinking\nI consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness what I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing beyond space and\nTime so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness\nConsciousness comes first\nRight without the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests\nNo would science back us up\n[noise] so my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine\nOr I talked about near death experiences [noise] and\nIf you'd asked me a few years ago what's in your experience I Would have said well isn't that just to hold his nation that happens when someone is about to die it's like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described it in near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness it's not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as they ... out of body experience so the person it out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that is suggestive of some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark Goldberg dot com is linked up for you at ... dot com the name of his book we're talking about in into upside down thinking me or read the subtitle dispel the myth that the brain produces conscious this\nAnd the implications for everyday life we are going to take phone calls next hour with mark but I'm going to come back we'll talk with them about\nSilicon nieces pre cognition so let's see how that all works out side of the brain and what's causing [noise]\nDuring the ... Facebook page with thousands of members did great show up the didn't connecting with other ... to ... dot com slash goes to ... am and click the like button\n[noise]\nMarch ... ... ... what did your peers say and your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise them\nIt's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yet they were very surprised to hear that but I think I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before until up with the pre cognition tell look as a psycho couldn't these is you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be researched it knew\nIt absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science they controlled study that hadn't been done on the topic and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about till after the what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt that way who was a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating telepathy and uh she came she came out with so much sounding things but what did you find\nIt yeah I thought that the the very important phenomenon it's it's mine too my communication and just taking a quick step back the reason that I Am each of these phenomenon is that I reason that the material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain\nThat perspective not account for things like ... the and the other things will talk about and I read it in that if any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work\nSo well apathy to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure\nAnd the basic design is as follows and I should say that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter as and when you combine the result the statistics are very compelling mhm\nDoctor dean rate and who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six sigma six sigma refers to statistical odds against chance when you get a six sigma result the odds that that that the effect is just happening by chance is more than a billion to one and in telepathy we have six sigma results\nSo the ... experiment the study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob and very you know very relaxing state listening to relaxing music there's another person let's call her Jane who's in another room\nJane is given a picture by the experimenter ... and the experimenter say Jane I Know this sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally send\nA picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room so jaded mentally sending this image to Bob Bob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture James looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all that Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent right\nNow the ... the last probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent\nSo from a statistical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect is twenty five versus thirty two this is massive statistically it's suggests that something is getting through and it actually conforms to our common sense our everyday experience because if we were one hundred percent ... then we would know each other's thought all the time\nYou're instead it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they tax you or they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase ... percent mark is at the center or the receiver\n[noise] this is something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a have had been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better meditate hers seemed to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI'm always wonder though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events without really having the sender having much to do with it\nI I I think that's a receiver might have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... ethic or communications with the deceased\nThrough medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use this analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's a it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that's not localized to the body those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular standard or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver person in the room and simply not shield them any of them for pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she said to them what do you think would happen\nWell well I think we'd have a distribution first of all we had just an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic than we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw with us\nIt's an everyday person I think it would be the more difficult study to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government studies in uh the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me I'm the program is sometimes referred\nTo as Stargate Program and use psychic spies for national security purposes many of marine had been on this show by the white\nYep during the Cold War and and the people who were involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many reviewers who are involved to say this was ... so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real [noise]\nI'm In my book I I have some documents from the CIA which have been declassified recently\nAnd the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was won by remote viewing is the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being they're physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that's far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes\nIt sounds completely paranormal consciousness is localized to the brain but if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable\nDocuments\nUm say explicitly and I am looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon\nThis is from a declassified documents that has been released recently [laughter]\nSo I mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that in my business world that I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me\nAt least made me question things um even further than that there's a page on science panel and there are some very credible people including someone from Cal Tech\nThe next page in the document says science panel's report principle findings either direct quotes implications are revolutionary\nEvidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we have the looked at these tell a path to studies\nAnd I've always wondered\nIf the government really never stopped doing it but continued now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies\nThat just that same question and they say no it stopped because they would have kept us on they would have used us I'm not sure what the government has found other people and they've continued these kinds of blindness studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used\nTo find a downed Russian bomber in an African jungle that they couldn't find so there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful\nSo you'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that a organizations would be trying it\nPre cognition mark the very valuable tool for people in their life because of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings and to react to them now a lot of people don't react\nThey don't do it it's something happens and they go oh I should have done that and I I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre

body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another offensively\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm On the go ahead\nHi George and yeah I have a question for your gas sure how I thank you for\nA ban on the show so I'm back in two thousand and one I experienced as I told Tom it was seven but it was actually six mental tell a path experiences with in one week\nAnd I had a spiritual revelation that made me become vegetarian in an instant now\nThere was no one around no um food now animals that I was by myself and\nI guess I'm I I like to know people that are tell a path that now you said that people are are usually good with meditation I I haven't done a lot of ... meditation my life but I have been on my own\nA tremendous amount of time I'm at\nA deep thinker I'm spiritual and I think I'm an empathetic person so I wanted to know if these qualities allow people to be more tell a path again in addition for about twenty two years I've seen\nDouble and triple digit I'm On the clock on you know addresses license plates and whatnot and the phenomena has become bigger and society at the time I didn't know what was going on and people didn't understand what I was trying to tell them but um\nI kind of thinking that this might be a telecast experiences well\nSeeing something like two two two on the clock I'm thinking important messages you know something important in your life seeing signs so I kinda think that it's all intertwined and then just one more thing um\nWe know awhile ago someone had told me um you know the spirit and the solar actually different I I Believe and maybe a Bible or some religions it's the body and mind spirit soul\nAnd so I kind of think that what you're saying is differentiating between me and it's like the spirit\nOr the other person is is it's outside and the spirit inside her or either or but um I I kinda think of it on a spiritual level what you're saying as well\nI Would think more than ... maybe one to say what do you think\nIt thank you for your question on the um I tend to agree with you George and there's an analogy I Love also from Dr Bernardo Castro which summarizes the way I think about things which is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water where water represents consciousness\nAnd each of us is like a whirlpool within that stream so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we are fundamentally still made out of water so what happens when the physical body dies that's like a world full of dissipating and the water doesn't leave the stream it just transitions into a different state\nAnd so the water to me of consciousness and consciousness is having this variety of experiences whether localized in a world full or otherwise industry\nDo you think that's consciousness\nIs a normal process of living or it's the supernatural\n\nIs a normal process of living for its supernatural\nThe way I view consciousness is that it's like max clump he said I regard consciousness as fundamental I regard matter as to rebut if\nFrom consciousness meaning that consciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things point to that but I Do everything that we experience as being a basically a modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow is this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter] so I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective that I subscribe to a leads to a very bleak outlook on life once your brain's off at Dover\nI mean I understand the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching um now I think that that consciousness that does not die when the body dies because it's the consciousness isn't dependent on the body\nSo I see much more uh ... meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish this had been taught me a long time ago but going back to the near death experiences what people often report is known as a life\nReview where they experience their whole life in a flash and again this\nIs when their brain is either offer highly impaired and they're judging themselves for how they acted during their life but this is the kicker that really I think about this every day was that some people report experiencing the life review through the eyes of those they affected\nSo let's say Bob harmed chain in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experience the pain through chains eyes\nAnd he comes back to his life forever changed carrying much more about uh how we treat people rather than material goods so it will be talked about meeting in life the life review as a potential lens if we take that as a literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life that we were given this gift to be able to do these incredible things through consciousness\nFree cognition fill up to the\n... and things like that well yeah I I I think\nThat these are natural abilities that we tend to have and the telepathy study I mentioned earlier where people are thirty two percent rather than twenty five percent there's the subtle ability even ... in people who aren't trained\nI think their abilities that are just simply not harness in modern society because these ideas are considered a novelist and totally paranormal and this is one of the reasons I wanted to write the book itself so compelled to do it is that\nAn understanding human potential and these abilities that we have could revolutionize I think the world but also our science and our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into what we do\nFirst time caller John in Flint, Michigan welcome to the show John go ahead\nYou doing sir great\nI'm an ex military and I will tell you I don't believe in ghost UFOs and everything else but I Will say that again retired military I was assigned to a multinational units two thousand six and Iraq\nWere by the way we're going to preserving for ... days that\nI was assigned to an empty every intelligence unit and we basically we're looking for a bomb maker\nUm we were able to use what I understand if he remote viewing from a section of the three intelligent shop where there was a coal location for a boss and some buildings\nWere able to find that very UAB and the person I Believe who was the remote viewer there was brought in a was Paul and I believe me it was an albino\nWhich is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English\nIsraeli descent from what I can get up who I dealt with over there mhm my question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in a remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or non American ... uh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality bit is more than ... ...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers\nAll over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\nI Would say that consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being researched widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there's certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be wiped\nThe ability to proceed something with the mind around\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has our he's outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the world for an allergy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their ... and they accept water that outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still\nWith us Yes sir I\nSo you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately it ... me only because of my background [noise] it would be you know personal experience I uh [noise] a lot of things that I that was a I including those sightings and everything else I've been able to do something else\nOkay so you're you're basically a

Ninety five point five [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast our final segment with mark ... market can we concluded that consciousness is a part of the universe always was\nAnd that it survives outside of the physical brain than physical body but it's there it's out there in the ether I mean can we categorically all agree on that\nTo me the evidence point in that direction more strongly than any other direction when you put together the phenomenon that we discussed night a psychic phenomena like ... the cycle can eat that's pre cognition\nNear death experience as children with ... memories when you put all the together combined with certain phenomena of quantum physics\nIt's they get that consciousness is playing the fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the bird ...\nGeorge ah may God Bless you and your show in the bus and you think it was wonderful really wonderful\nAnd my uh my question is do you get other got out of the callers a reincarnation as a result of consciousness living outside the body and each of us and the so AKA consciousness moves\nOn to affect another human being good or evil how this free will play a part in or effect consciousness and I'll take my reply on right\nThose free will have anything to do with it mark\nThis is a very tricky question I think the question of free will get ultimately boils down to who is the agent that we're speaking out that had the ...\nAnd I think the question of free will get ultimately boils down to who is the agent that we're speaking out that has the free well\nUm are we talking about the ... body having free well are we talking about like the consciousness itself\nAnd if we think of consciousness as being like the stream of water than all there is consciousness so at the level of the fundamental consciousness it would appear that there is a infant it pretty well but at the level of perhaps at an individual that is\nConsidering itself to be separated from that consciousness or at least appearing that way than perhaps the free world does not exist at the same level that\nThat makes sense yeah it does it on a very difficult subject\nIt's very difficult and I think there are some of the concept that we are talking about night I think are beyond what what are linear human mind can conceptualize sort of like insanity we all know infinity exists but we can we really understand what it means I think there are certain concepts that our brains just limit of trauma understanding falling\nYou think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and how to ... with us how to use it a Andy Andy use it\nI I think there were probably people throughout history\nUm who really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how Jesus might've interplay with consciousness but from the bits and pieces I I've heard it's possible that he was one of these individuals\nWho really understood how things work and it seems that when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem totally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nOr we have a guest his name's Joan ... a gallon burger and he's a he's a professor and he is conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck he has concluded beyond a shadow of the doubt\nThat the ability of the mind and attitude will determine whether you win or lose in his studies in Las Vegas where he's tested and ... and ... and he said it's uncanny so if somebody goes in the Las Vegas offbeat positive\nUh there's a high likelihood they're going to win but if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results are on candy\nI think that's all tied together like consciousness it's all part of the same don't you\nKnow I'm not familiar with those exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just stay out of consciousness is the basis of reality where everything is just the stream of consciousness than the reality we're in is almost malleable\nAnd sometimes it's very subtle where you have a random number generator that's behaving slightly non randomly and other cases we have reports like he talked about a metal being that using the mind\nSo who's to say that outcomes which is just a a part of the physical reality could also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James

I don't I feel like sometimes if I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing\nMy life kind of it's like wreaking havoc right I'm like a buildup of energy and if I'm working I Do a lot of technical

effect let's say um I still have to work a day job so it could interfere and that's one thing I always have to kind of be aware of\nWhat would you say has been the most fascinating case you been on to date\nOh jeez fascinating um to me we investigated the Portsmouth White House um one time and there was a the last\nWhite House keeper his wife ... small I Believe what's her name and to me it was fascinating because this was the sweetest woman that had come through I felt for energy and it was nice for a change you know so I wasn't\nI wasn't a in fear for feeling um painter having any ill effects\nAnd it just was a pleasant feeling and what was even nicer it was after we were done and I was investigating how she came through she was so excited she I channeled turf felt like she just was so excited to be alive again so she can talk to the people around her but to me what\nReally was fascinating was you know we investigate and a lotta times it's you know ...\nCentury afraid that you're dealing with so you don't necessarily see the person face to face that you can overcome you know communicated with\n'em and so we had done a talk after this investigation um and once we did that talk you know here's this woman Connie small her picture as life size in front of me and I just I didn't expect it but I literally just broke down because it was again the first time I got to really see a woman I just felt a connection to her that I\nCouldn't explain notice it that's kind of that's got to be emotional sometimes\nWhen you see things like that and I bet when you were in the ... you know you look at a gravestone did you actually think you know here's a person who died\nAnd you know means or right here in this new show grossly operations attached to that that's got to be emotional for people did you ever have you ever just broken down\nA you know I've broken down on while I Try not to break down but when I'm done reading for people um you know and I've actually you know you you talk about\nThe loved ones you talk about I mean these are real people you're talking about you know their pains and it's ours and it doesn't help them really to break down but you can't help it sometimes because if you're a compassionate and you have a hard it's hard not to\nUm ... as much as you probably try to try to stay focused you know you get involved in these things\nYou do definitely down you can put yourself in their place and and realize that you know our own you know mortality right so it's it can you come face to face with dealing with death on many occasions money it can be hot breaking\nWhat would you say is the strangest keys you've come across strangers gauge\nStrangest case okay well when Ron would take me out to investigate many times can just hear about

because it's the keep me honest right so I'm not\nGoogling information eager for 'em\nTo one day he gave me a call and say hey marine you know I have this case that's ten in the morning you know can you come with me it's really only take us\nIn our you know so yeah exactly I'm sure are on\nYou know he's very creative right so I said\nOh okay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we go to the home it's just you know little ranch style house and we we get there and stuff you know meant to guys there want to they just look really rough and tumble you know and this one guy you know like one I think his name was moose and the\nBig big guy covered in tattoos I mean you just try to you know just\nOverwhelming right to sit there and so was just looking at me and we get in this house and he said I think I have a little girl in here spirit and you look around and the mayor is shattered glass table from busted and it just looked like someone went through the house with a bat\nUm it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know they've\nMy phone's been ringing with all heroes on it and my wallet went missing and\nNow he's telling me all the things they kept saying I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see what we can pick up so after a few minutes and thinking oh my God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know a spirit of a man very angry I'm very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this is a man no it's not and he was getting\nAdamant that you know it wasn't and I need to talk\nTo use them brings us out of the house\nAnd now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right um he leaves Ron up at the top of the driveway with the guy most any rags me down on the driveway and he looks

I had cut my fingers off on a table saw a huge yeah well you know anyways uh I went to the hospital and they looked at it and they really couldn't do anything at that time\nSo they can to wrap them up and nice and and kept me an emergency room until they can bring a specialist and six and a half hours later they put them all back together and uh you know it was fine but during the night um\nI ... up to see me and she realized something was wrong even though I I I thought I felt fine and she called in for a CAT scan actually had to bring the the woman in the hospital was nobody on it at that time and they realized they had a blueberry embolism and\nFrom then on things begin to have a well it was all going on I had\nWhat I Believe was a death experience it's not like the\nThe usual ones you here and and that it was I was just basically in a different place it was\nExtremely bright white I guess it's the best way to describe it and ah they were uh people their figures anyways I couldn't really see any features or anything but they were also white and ah [noise]\nThe weird thing about it is also there was what I thought was\nThe any features or anything but they were also white and uh [noise] the weird thing about it is also there was what I thought was it sounds really ... music it had that same type thing and uh also it it felt a\nMan there's a line in the ... like a prayer that I always quote and that is it felt like home was very comfortable it was very warm\nAnd then the whole thing just being disappeared like the closing of an iris and it was in the law that ... with us and it was just the stock or a ICU that I was in there was no music was just my hot you know in the\nMorning there was nobody around and it certainly wasn't a warm\nSo I when I got a hospital I didn't know if it was a true experience or was it just the drugs they gave me so that's how I got I got into the paranormal\nWhen did you conclude that the it wasn't just the drawings that there was something really unusual going on here for you\nYou know it's something you you just have to um what's the word I'm looking for the ... ... they're really either believe it or not and uh\nSo I Know that I had this experience can I tell you it is absolutely a and yet I just that the experience you know can absolutely tell you it wasn't you know so it's one of those mystery that that pushes me to the other uh things that I Do\nThe ... the fingers were they able to do\nYeah yeah well oddly enough and uh how many do you cut off I cut\nThe the middle one all on my left in the middle and totally off the the um next to it I had several places that was a kind of dangling at the top of the funding I had cut off completely uh they actually put a ... when they put together\nMy a mental thing and so if I ever given by the finger I always tell them it's not me [laughter] 'cause it's possess ask about that [laughter] that was a joke\n[laughter] ha ha ha [laughter] at three thirty in the morning it's good that one soldier to the hand works normally yes it's amazing to guide yep\nIt's a you know what the time it's it's a you know a little difficult with the cold but ah yeah it's fine\nNow tell us about the New England goes project that you started what the what is that\nYeah it's a a ... for um probably about Twenty years ago\nUm when I get out of the hospitals looking for something to do and\nA media one was often a course in TV production of the time 'cause my hand was in the cast and it was all kinds of blood than us and things so\nIt looked interesting it was a thorough cause but they're not up to complete it you had to do it on a a show on something and I suddenly had this near death experience I don't know if it was the drugs they gave me a lot and also I own a manufacturing company in manufacturing company it was supposed to be haunted by people that weren't there and uh\nYou know it hurts all kinds of [noise] anyways I ended up I so I said you know I got to do it all goes\nAs a lock and uh\nThat's how it all started I went on my first ... TV shows slash investigation and ah I realize that we're a lot of things even though I have a good science background that I couldn't explain and I was curious and I'm curious I get them all I did it and eventually I began doing it fulltime\nAnd you lost that I Do they still\nNot sure of all the things that happen what's real and what's not\nSo you've got a degree in environmental science yeah you were\nOn the moon program as well\nAre you interested in in ... you were a skeptic\nEnvironmental science\nYeah you're on the moon program as well\nAre you interested in in ... you were a skeptic but now you're a believer that you've made this full circle how far are you on the other side that you believe is\nYou know I Believe there's something out here I Believe in an afterlife\nDo I believe that everything icy and and it's you know I'm always skeptical bite my science spring I guess you wanna call it a or my grounding and brain always you know makes me out what's going on and I've had a lot of unique experiences but uh [noise]\nIsn't enough there that I Know that the experiences that but ah they really paranormal already you know something else mentioned Asian or something I just can't explain\nWhat keep striving you why do you keep doing this\nIf there's a lot of reasons the the primaries is to try to understand it more I Try to understand all aspects of the power of I'm just not going in as a you know\nWell to give you an idea a when I first started doing this I thought that all mediums were shallow things like a gypsy zip to the beach do fortune telling and uh when I met more rain I was pretty much in the same category but I figured it couldn't hurt\nTo at least a try to understand what they are and who they are and what they do\nAnd uh so that's kinda my whoa aspects of what I Do even if I don't believe in anything I'm always open minded enough to at least try to understand if I'm going to criticize it I got to know as much as I can about it to do that so that's kinda\nHow I Am more open minded but still get that heavy skepticism\nWhat do you think of her abilities as as a medium\n... is a very unique and I know there are a lot of mediums out there and\nBut a wood working with her as she comes up with some amazing stuff and and our trash channel like horses stills skiffs the crap out of most people who see it so uh yeah I you know I definitely she believes she has some type of ...\nDo you run across a lot of people like her in what you do see like you know you spent ...\nMedium lots of mediums lots of them yeah\nI mean and we you know I also do a lot of studies for instance the physical medium ship is as something that's always fascinated me and in the cause for those who don't know there are two types of a medium ship mental mania ship or a disparate speaks supposedly speaks through the\nYes to this country and it's become patently obvious to everybody and it's very simple if you are a Democrat and you've been caged in any kind of questionable illegal activity you get it passed and if you're a Republican you don't people know that we have two systems of justice in Washington and the Democrats are not held accountable the same way Republicans are\nWe have to live the systems that just\nRush Limbaugh we do tend to handle on the news talk Ninety five point five which is where Montana talk CB well am nine Seventy buildings D.C age age ward and you're listening to news talk Ninety five boys\nThis could be the strongest storm ever on Florida's panhandle ...

I have a granddaughter who is you know too young to do that sort of thing but she's picking up spiritually she thinks spirits are ready um so what we're doing is we have in St Michael's prayer card that I put underneath you know her mattress and in her pillow and I have a different varying crystals around the room\nTo how much energy on and she's doing a lot better so I Know you know and again it's an belief right so I Believe it works on its intention networks I think if you believe in yourself as well on you can tend to have bought out bought out most times would\nSay you were on what about it\nWell I agree with it away and and you judge because you talk about the the hurricane in your intentions sure\nMake good yeah so and tensions as a hundred percent but being a good old Catholic boy I rely on my religion of course and so that's that's what I always recommend\nYou you know and I've seen this happen before I've seen hurricanes go from category four down to two dumb moon and you know who's the sea prayer is the cause but hey you know what your word worked\nYep crank Korea hundred percent with the judge\nSneak in any way we can let's go to bill in Idaho west of

program where they were military military militarized wing the police\nAnd and they're doing this and it just creates an intimidation factor I think and I and I I think that was one of the biggest

being that if we don't pay attention to what people want and that's the thing is that\nYou know every ugly horror you can think of can actually generate from this fracturing and is fragmenting of the country and I don't think people realize just how many people are fighting against each other right now hundreds of sides\nHundreds of ideologies it's not about tribal divide the Republican versus

talk to you a little bit of drug something called conversion theory [noise] and oh this is jumping though I haven't talked about a long time\nAnd this is something that I haven't talked about a long time I think it's time to review it time to talk about it\nYou know in the United states there's a majority of of American citizen sensitive and natural aversion\nTo certain words and phrases one of them as civil war\nAnd the reason why they have a diversion too because they only can think of one way of civil war can be fought in that his two warring factions fighting against one another they've never had\nAnything else to compare a civil war too and so they're willing to go back and think about what it was like in the Eighteen hundreds rather than understanding that it's not about two warring factions anymore in a country like the United states you have many warring factions in groups\nAnd they use news speak the media uses this big social media and the algorithms use new speak for the division process or the fragmenting of what can be seen as a country that the stabilize this is how it was done in Ukraine\nAnd how Russia was able to do what they did with Ukraine by doing the same thing okay this is this is how it's done\nHappens because the republic is dead and it's been dead for quite some time and it predates the election of Donald Trump and it's the result of that and the fact that the government exists only ... states following the who\nPerpetrated by Mitch McConnell back in twenty five or six teams was it yes twenty sixteen or twenty Seventeen rather when or where it no twenty fifty and I'm Sorry\nWhen he ... he uh decided that he would singlehandedly with a minimum ... majority decide to take control of the last institution that we had integrity and safe in which is a Supreme Court because the psycho drama is only a result of the frustration because the Democrats\nWho are the only main opposition to anything that occurs at that level failed to address what had occurred and now all that energy all that anger all that hatred is now translating it trickling down into the lower levels of the micro\n... of course ... billion is what I really don't understand is\nThat I I and I beginning to I I was reading this and say to myself\nLook what we have here is we have fragmented portions within a country fighting against one another this isn't about one group against another group was among several groups wanting a piece of the action and that's why I think when you have that many groups want to see action in the fight we are in we're in a civil war we really are\nNo no we are this this is what's gonna happen because right now it seems that because I'm disappointed disgusted in dejected by the fact that it would appear the Democrats at least right now are willing to allow this to occur at not to get their hands dirty\nAnd I'm questioning what is going on in the Senate level because I hear stories from other radio shows more you know the mainstream types that are I consider you believe it or not a little more mainstream that you might like to be hearing these say but\nAlong those lines where they said Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer are getting together and even though they have the fifty one vote threshold the judicial appointments that are being shoved through one after another after another\nUm he does have a a place at the table with it and I'm Wondering what is going on here rather\nThan go out and you just it just seems like it's by design and like I said if if we look at the center in the mid term we find the Republicans hold the holder a majority in the Senate I like you know with the Knicks tipping points going to be I think you know what the next scratch you ... are going to be\nHarkening back to your very first caller I'm a person who goes around and have been saying now for three years that I consider the Supreme Court de legitimize because while I can I meant to you politicizing the court you can never make it partisan political because the integrity and the faith\nAnd the judiciary was the last institution\nEvery everything's been radicalized everything's being radicalized CJ and that's the whole point\nWell that's it but you didn't have to go this far and that's what I don't understand it and it seems like there's this collusion between the two of them on a new because there's nobody complaining about anything here and like I said I don't buy that you know I don't like Donald Trump\nI Can't I cannot blame this on him I have to blame it on the Machiavellian machinations of Senator McConnell and when he was only a round complaining and ... and the ... uh the moaning obstructionism and changing goal post in that long winded speech he gave I was\nSitting here waiting for the very words to choke him after everything that ...\nRight right right well I mean we'll see what happens after the midterms and it's going to continue the midterms and then we really see the gloves come up I think that's something that will have to be prepared for the patch in Illinois Hi Patty from ground zero\n[noise] how you doing I'm I'm very nervous some try to do is um [noise] I understand and I've seen\nHi Patty from ground zero\nDoing I'm I'm very nervous suddenly try to do [noise] um [noise] I understand and I've seen in a witness to a lot of things that happened to get what you're gonna feel like you got justice if they settle where you went in court you don't understand they don't care if not their money\nYou don't understand when it unlimited leaving understand news you don't understand you actually get caught a hatch patch you don't understand the situation my wife has a place\nIn law enforcement and public safety she has a job in law enforcement public safety\nOkay she identified herself financial and I'd still was abused I understand it so I don't\nCare where I'd been allowed these people I also work for the state of Illinois okay I reported thanks mhm nothing was done except\nFor I was at that okay um you have to you had a hit and target the actual you had to be able to target and sue the officer is what\nWe're dealing with it in a lot of ways are not just you know we got a lawyer just in case more do we have going with it a lot of ways that we're not going to be a you know we're not nasty to the police there's no way you're going to be nasty place especially ... when my wife has to work around police officers\nIt it's just something that I I didn't know who the officer was what he thought he was doing and who's the body was messing with but you know when you have a public safety officer who's in the area who was involved with very command and those are the people that are you a command and and she states that and says hey you know EMT a there needs to be an EMT here\nBecause the guys in pain and the guy decides who the hell are you to tell me that's when it gets ugly and that's what happened so no I don't believe for one minute that there's going to be any enemies here because I think Janine smart enough to understand what's going on here I mean it's not going to be like you know it's not like most people I mean you know when we when it was first heard about the number of people\nGood police officers were there ... and there were plenty of police officers are there to back up and I'm sure we're not going to name the guy's name we're not going to talk about it and will be going to say it happened\nI mean you know a ... wouldn't mind Maxine Waters said to harass people she should have been taking in and she should have been talk to but she didn't she got away with it and now people are doing it\nWell Maxine Waters and and uh what's the guy's name Corey Booker or something like that Cory\nLet her know but anybody who sit there and encourages this type of saving\nEncouraging this type yeah there\nYou know immediate Joe the media doesn't to encourage you to\nWell I I think it can lead to assassinations because\nIf you look in our past a remember we used to have abortion doctors that were assassinated ... and and this is the level of hatred that we're at right now\nThat the you know if you're confronting somebody in a restaurant or at their home who's to say that they don't have a gun and they're not going to assassinate somebody\nWell yeah that's the point you see that that that's the moment they're waiting for their waiting for the moment where somebody has a gun and shoot somebody who harasses them telling them that they can go one way in a car you know they're waiting for that moment there waiting for that moment someone say ... I'm turning left my gun says I'm turning left\nAnd buy me three or four people blocking my car since then I could go forward and backwards\nWell actually uh tonight on Tucker Carlson he led with the film footage of what's going on in Portland\nYeah I Know and when did you think of that did you see it\nI saw exactly what you're talking\nAbout barriers to be I'm embarrassed to be in the city because of that because our mayor won't do a damn thing about our police don't act but they'll do they'll do other things including you know harm my wife because she was doing her ... she was standing away for the officers let me ask you do is work\nShe said who she was and then she said by the way I Believe this man he's an EMT just saying and and he got angry and hit her she said oh I was reaching for my radio\nWell I Hope in regards to your wife that um you said you have an attorney um I Hope the arrangement that you have with your attorney is that he's taking a sudden the contingency basis both on his face and his costs\nWell I I did this is it in my view doing ... she has like I said for position she she works in public safety and I'm only giving the barebones thing I'm not telling the whole thing but she does that so she knows exactly how the she knows how the courts work she knows everything about the court\nYeah so um I think a lot of people don't realize that if you're um a ... if you're a Supreme Court justice a member of Trump's cabinet or a senator or a member of the house representatives\nYou don't have security if you notice when these people when you see the footage of these people being confronted they don't have\nFor for senators you don't have security if you notice when these people when you see the footage and these people being confronted they don't have security to only a handful have security if you're in a leadership position\nRight speaker of the house where justice frame but the other\nJustices cabinet members senators house representatives they don't have security I think they should have security because they tell you somebody is going to get shot at\nWell rice and does it need security on does it come at rice and went out they could have gotten to the president could have gotten to the joint chiefs of could have gotten to Ted Cruz\nSo some things are a lot harder to protect and others so of course rice and going through the mail system is is very difficult to protect against\nRight it's really hard and then that's the thing about\nClyde how it comes down to you and me and your listeners I wouldn't be very reluctant this political season to put a bumper sticker on my car or a sign in front of my house because I think you're leaving yourself open to get vandalized either having your car vandalized like ...\nOr having your house vandalized can or yeah he doesn't like your politics\nWell that's the thing that's how radical we become the idea of radicalization radicalization has not proved that we're in a civil war right now I don't know what will the idea that you can't express yourself\nBy having a political view either way and having someone come in and say I don't like his political view I mean the key is car for I don't like his political view I'm going to spit in his pizza\nThese are the things that are going on in this country right now and and this is evident I mean if you want to bring physical harm to people regardless of who you are you in uniform out of uniform whether or not you're wearing a mask on the street with a baseball bat if you want to bring harm to people you're participating in a civil war\nSo here's here's what I think could happen and you remember I started off by saying that we're we're in a unconventional civil war as compared to our first civil war but you could see\nThis situation growing and growing and escalating violence so that we are some time in the future in a civil war that looks like our first silver or you could easily have red states that gets ...\nBut that's not what it is ... or ... what it is because it was bad but you would have to you you have to take into consideration all of the groups have been organized we've only black lives matter me to\nA separatist groups or you know a patriot prayer Proud Boys you know I I Am trying to go down the list of all these groups that want to be heard\nRight and I think a lot of these groups are tend to identify either with the left or the right leaning Democrats or Republicans not always always that\nI'm just saying that let's leave open the possibility that in the future of this civil war could escalate into something much more violent than it is now\nRight all out war between people yeah a purge when I'm trying to talk about do you think\nYou could see you could see that the military getting involved um yeah of course is getting involved\nLike South America exactly what it is going to happen in South America jak things for the call go to Tony in Texas Hi Tony you're on ground zero\nTake quite I'm enjoying your show to light a I spoke to a couple of months ago and I mentioned that my family my mother and father were in Argentine at the same time that you were ... and I think it's very difficult for you and I because you know we know what happened there with\nThe facts faction what America\nDon't understand is that all of these different groups that festival war situation breaks down and there's not a um there's not a a a pill\nIt's different groups if a civil war situation breaks down and there's not a um there's not a a a police force or ... or civil order what you have also are within the factions individuals settling vendetta mhm\nOkay that it just goes from bad to worse now my father's family I didn't say this before but you'll understand the insinuation here my father's family or German ... mhm now the ... in in in Argentina it was amazing how the police\nWere uh they wouldn't do retribution strikes that were very very similar to what they get stopped though did in Nazi Germany wasn't that amazing how that occurred\nOn so amazing how they were rounding up Jews as well do you find that amazing that they were doing that is it and is it interesting that Mr burglar was part of that and these are pope now isn't that amazing\nWell I well I I ... for criticizing the Holy Father obviously a Roman Catholic so I Will say Jesuits\nA life of my family was not very fond of the Jesuits and you notice that a certain Jesuit turned on its own people and that and the desk floods came in and killed a lot of things as a result of that\nOh yeah yeah we don't want to talk about that do Tony that yeah the the death squads killed ... and ... under his direction but no one talks about that were just so happy that he's pope now\nWell I'll tell you the people in America this is very important to what you're talking about tonight um I Hope well I'm going to say something and you may disagree I Would hope that perhaps the national guard\nWould be called the sooner than later so that it doesn't get out of hand especially in states on the left coast\nWell you you watch what happens during the mid term will be a lot of security I'll bet there'll be a lot of self during the turnstile\nPaint Clyde I don't know if you're aware of this but Sen Cruz is not going to be harassed much longer because the governor of our state governor Abbott\nDispatched it details the Texas Rangers to protect our senators and I don't know if the American people know how bad the Texas Rangers are but there is that going to be anybody hollering at either of our two senators on another occasion\nWell that that makes sense that they call those in because I don't know why Sen Cruz was targeted targeted for the\nRice and attack that really raises a lot of red flags there I think and I don't like Ted Cruz aren't going to matter\nA new like\nI'm just saying I just think it's wrong that they send rice and to him I don't I don't know who's going to be really bad bad to deserve this type of treatment from anybody and and that's the thing is that you know you don't necessarily like the politics that doesn't mean you have to act like an emotional zombie just because you don't like a certain individual that just wants to make\nSure you don't want Argentina in the United states doing quiet and you don't do that\nNo we don't really trying to tell people they can't believe that it actually happened and he did and it's happening again you're in the United states\nBecause the same people are involved Henry Kissinger ladies and gentlemen thank you so much Tony talked to enter already by by Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred the history of relief except for three thirty seven hundred will be bad news talk Ninety five point five the
