of hours Robert welcome back\nMy burned thanks for inviting me always a pleasure hobby Ben I'm pretty good pretty good keeping to think what are we going to Mars\n[noise] um at this point it looks like we're going to go to Mars when I'm either ... or one of us ... and we're one of its competitors takes a fair um space sex is pushing hard a following up their success with the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle with\nA developing their beer far rocket which will be a fully we usable or to stage to orbit hundred and fifty tons to earth orbit vehicle that's\nEquivalent to a Saturn five but fully reusable or that will give us the capability to go to Mars\nUh and if they should um you know ... off the edge of the ice because you know ... to skate next to the edge of the ice [laughter] I'm there and got a\nBlue origin company by a led by ... the owner of Amazon is a is a coming up on his heels so uh we've got a new space race going on and I think that one of these outfits is going to get us to Mars right now [noise]\nYou know NASA is does great work with its robotic planetary mission Senate space astronomy missions uh ... their work in that field is ethic but ah the human spaceflight program is dysfunctional uh they claim they want to go to the moon but they're not even planning a reasonable plan to do that\nAnd um so I think it's gonna be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy the privatization is taking off the way it is and that NASA is kind of like feeding away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA's human spaceflight program as dysfunctional ah I'm not happy about that at all um the uh you know I ... it would be a disaster is NASA's robotic\nSpace flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but\nI mean it's really sad to see this program that I mean that storm have it in the Nineteen sixties\nDoing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I was at a conference in Florida a month ago where a high level NASA official that actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said we're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThem and [laughter] oh what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got ... maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember that to die off so they can help people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who do that\nAll the people that can remember that to die off so they can help people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who'd dumped that we went to the moon jumper joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is gonna be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission I mean let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay\n[laughter] the the the ...\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal\nI Want to read you an office in Saskatoon now you're gonna have to pay to build the building and you're gonna have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill to pass on that had the whole and this thing\nIs that I buy the ... and you probably sell me\nWhat you buy the swarm play and you probably want to sell me\nA lot better off with the swamp land than with this as well\nYou know with measles doing what he's doing well in a space acts are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching NASA just kinda and not do much anymore with manned space flights in and say it's disappointing Robert really is\nWell it is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and ... built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\nUh and and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible um I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class in terms of its ability to execute great projects\nAnd and act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan\nA chaos and the the the you know so there it is but uh I gotta tell ya you know I was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while\nWould come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what what the incompetence who preceded us uh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the mood I was hoping brain and spine would do that but he didn't he just went along\nAnd I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance through a witness the flight of one of the falcons or at night to another team back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the guys that night\nUh the they didn't know what it was they thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was spectacular to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time uh because\nSure we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get them to be usable\nWe started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get him to be usable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and and I got to tell you this thing that mosque is done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and\nAnd he's reduced the cost of space launched by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram perform us now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram\nTraumatic it's dramatic it's protect killer and it was done on a shoestring compared to [noise] um what a\nNASA considers normal for developing new space systems\nI mean it was done like from one tenth the money in one third of the time that anyone or it was accepting would be normal\nAnd this thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space and a number of other advanced fields that people thought were helpless uh so okay Bezos has his own money Scott blue origin but we now have three small launch companies\nA firefly a vector space um electron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars\nA two to field a small launch systems and it even goes beyond the the\nSpace industry we now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded because people you know they were looking at future parents all this is just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years and but people than say maybe it's not really\nAn impossible technical problem maybe the problem with it and um\nI gotta tell ya I actually worked in the future program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around the table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what is going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours next the coast to coast to you know\nAlways on your own you'll be happy to know the ... website is no optimized rule users just point your iPhone or Android ... to ... dot com and enjoy\nWhat can I say he's an unusual guy I'm new like him a\nYeah although he can be a difficult at times ah [noise] I mean he has a sense of humor it's kind of dry and uh he he is\nUm [noise] uh okay look um\nThe thing to know about Iran is is this okay on the one side he well he is very driven is very hard working uh uh and he is\nA driven to want to do\nSomething great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what he's about\nUh [noise]\nNow he he he really wants to do he wants to go down in the history books for doing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that\nHe doesn't just want to do great themes he wants eternal gory for doing great deep so he's not Mother Teresa can be selfish and he he um and he certainly um\nI'm\nNot above using people uh [noise] and you know and um that that's the other side of it so you're a ... you know there is [noise] um\n... you know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great speeches\nEagle [noise]\nIt's not in fact he ego it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the only had this is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great dates or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth\nYou know a a when you get to that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core to to fight the French because he he even though I mean the odds\nIt with anyone so you know that's must to AT T and um and and and so but really um [noise] you know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think\nMust gives a hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that is a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant to goes out a ... looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about but you know um\nHow would you can hear him to just results Robert Well Jeff measles as much calmer\nA much more laid back um\nI don't know these cells I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh and if you look at how the two companies are run\nA they reflect the at a mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast or he wants everything done yesterday and um\nThe company takes chances and thus far um they're winning um blood is certainly a there they pushed very hard bees owes the model if his company\nIs step by step ferociously he's not in a rush measles strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why a limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise] um well in one sense it's obviously is a but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space sacks is racing ahead of him so this is the you know space sex and the hair\nUm blue origins the tortoise\nAnd ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque okay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also won a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA effort the military base just doing it all with his own money\nOkay these shows\nYou know is the richest man in the world a and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon stocky cheer sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time I'm mosque knows that I'm you know in aerospace a cost just people times time\nOr the quicker you just do something to cheaper costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no it would cost much less\nUh because uh you know a space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still or whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in March what what's going on with some of these latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOrange what what's going on with some of the latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular\nOkay the European book all these experiments or ex discoveries by the way are being made now with a\nUm something it's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar and his radar that can look through the ground and see what's underground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water [noise]\nUh and um but it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment um it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was liquid water underground on Mars it has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place\nI think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth are still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the ground water\nIs is as it was billions of years ago and they been down there and if there was ever life on the surface of Mars it would have retreated into the groundwater and it'd be they're still [noise]\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American Mars Reconnaissance orbiter has found glaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is a a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers of pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust\nKnows it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight ... a a north and the northern hemisphere Mars which by the way the same latitude to San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers in San Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC you know that the the latitude that these things are\nAnd what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get at it with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there and that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view\nUm I think so there's there's ... there's two different versions of it one is the scientist\nSaying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay contamination\nYeah well that's like saying if you go to France you won't know if the people there are friends who are not I mean the ... because they might have all gotten off the plane with you\nI mean look if if if how do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did well for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower there's all this stuff that they built in the past\nWell if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and there will be fossils of it\nAnd I mean to to to say that fossils of life on Mars don't prove\nWas there before is like the people who say that dinosaur bones don't prove that they weren't dinosaurs because God could have put the dinosaur bones in the ground and and and the world could have been made in seven days and there never was a geologic past it's all been a a trick by\nThat brings together\nCreated with friends and coworkers\nFor people within a\n... dot org Russian you have two systems of justice to this country and it's become patently obvious to

three questions you have one more Robert one more okay one more\nLike a third one is um would be viable to design a space station like a memorial type thing to to um oh human physiology reacts to Mars gravity\nAll right Robert lipstick that one first go ahead\nAll right well let me just a run 'em down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one in Lear jets and anti gravity I don't know anything about that\nSecond question artificial gravity um which goes along with your last question of a spinning spacecraft yeah we do know how to create artificial gravity you spin the space craft\nCrates and cheer physical force that mimics gravity and that's a uh in my view a a a a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order to ah prevent the deterioration of bone and muscle that you can't with 'em and see well gravity\nFor long range for a long long time so\nYeah exactly 'cause if you you know anybody who just walks around on earth the you know ... not an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store\nThey they get somewhat of a workout 'cause they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and and and and and and you know and moving it around a a worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that and so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity\nFor use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and zero gravity we can but\nIf you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition no role liberal do anything for their\nRight and then the the the third question was electrical repulsion yeah I Know a fair amount about electrical pulse and [noise]\nUm electric propulsion is using\nA electric or electromagnetic forces to accelerate at ... pounds to very high velocity she didn't get about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric roster that you can with the chemicals roster the problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot\nAnd that means that I'm your power is limited and therefore you're thrust\nInsist that electric propulsion systems are kind of like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to sixty in a week\nI'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town but if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world\nOkay you floor of the car you know in San Francisco and um\nYou know a week later going sixty miles an hour and you've reached a the east coast and now you can go driving around the world because your car can drive over water in this case but in any case now you you you have a tremendous advantage in that your your your mileage is great but if you're going from earth to Mars\nAnd actually takes longer to get there with electric propulsion than it does with chemical bullshit if because it the time it takes to speed up is longer than the time it takes to get there on the other hand if you're going from earth to Saturn electric propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nPick Mars you would um because you know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago or we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their grandparents' generation dead [noise]\nUh the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe\nAnd Mars has got much more resources so many to compare Mars to the moon\nTo the choice in the age of ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon the way North America compared to Greenland you know Greenland was closer to Europe Europeans got to Greenland long before they got to North America [noise]\nBut it wasn't a place where you can build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources\nAnd uh so Mars is is is you know it's a much richer world\nBut you know here's NASA and frankly doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars well then they say well then we'll go to them as well but I see is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then get on with they go to the moon don't come off with\nSome other thing that's a halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if we can go to the moon fifty years ago we could go to the moon now\nCan you believe the next July will be fifty years since we went to the first time fifty years already run the word the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody had told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were crazy\nYeah I Would agree easily the Rockies Joe's with us Long Island New York to Joe go ahead law but\nI'm Sorry they can get to go to the mall but a couple of questions are in deep space uh when we send out these\nProbes a shoe or or what would you\nBe dealing with extreme heat even open space as opposed to these planets\nAnd would it be advantageous to us to kind of go to mercury though with some sort of probes in case back here we have won away a global warming due to maybe solar flags combined with CEO to increase was\nUh in other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat and space help us to deal with it potentially back here and also what kind of person would profile are going to Mars\nHelp us that there was a potentially back here and also what kind of pro somewhat profile are going to Mars uh how would you profile a potential candidate a travel on a ship come tomorrow what type of person always looking for\nAll right let me take the questions one time uh the first question it the hot and space if you're close to the sun um if you are a far away from the sun it's called a and\nIf you're in earth orbit it kind of depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\n[noise] um but um you know\nWe do have a kind of I mean you can you can get the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can write a\nOn the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so\nYou kind of have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it and you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people well okay\nHold on for a second the rubber we're going to hit the brake already school by fast with you Robert Ruben ... with us we'll be back will let them finish up your questions there and

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast our final segment with Robert Zubrin here from the Martian study Robert ... by the way are linked up it goes to goes damn dot com what Robert you you have looked at profiles of people and personalities who would love to go to Mars what are they like\n[noise] well um well there's all sorts of people that say they want to go to Mars uh [noise]\nUm I mean quite literally and and some are people that are\nYou might well one on a crew a that is going to Mars and others not a chance that the caller asked what sort of people would I select to go to Mars um and I'll tell you it's real simple it's the same sort of people that you would select to go on a say\nA a hiking expedition with you I'm a or an exploration ah adventure of any kind um they're the people who you know\nHave a high spirits are fun to be with that sense of humor a you know or not you know a grouchy um and and and bitchy and and and you know and and the people who can laugh when things go wrong and people who you know our one for all in all for one\nThat's all you want to take to Mars what's going on with the uh August conference you're working on\nA well we're having another conference or in August uh or actually this year it might be in September in Los Angeles [noise] um it could ah it it's probably going to be at one of the major universities in Los Angeles [noise]\nUm and ah\nI'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this lunar orbit gateway or is it a gateway or is it a toll booth\nOkay you know we're going to have that one out um you know we're going to have all sorts of presentations on the latest discoveries [noise] you know it there's a Mars probe on its way it's going to land in November ... insight\nAnd it's going to find out how a geologically active Mars is so that's kind of land this November and we'll probably have [noise]\nUm I'm discoveries from it um there's also\nGot into orbit um a couple of months ago which will be reporting data discovering planets going around other stars\nOr am I guess it will have discovered hundreds by them and you will probably discover thousands what's done I'm ... pass 'em you know a will you know since we're going to be in Los Angeles will have a scientist from Jet Propulsion lab coming over and\nTalking about a um all the latest discoveries from the rovers on Mars and the plans for the next one's ah probably have space X people talking about what they're up to I'm hoping to get flu arching people there too\nSo we can hear from them and maybe some from the the the small entrepreneur rocket companies like vector space just got funded by Seventy million dollars to\nCreate small launches you know the we now have small satellites that can do what it used to take big satellites to do and so small rockets make a lot of sense I'm and I'm a I'm myself from involved and design of a mission to go to the moon with ground penetrating radar\nWith for satellites each of which are the size of a shoe box um and so little launchers like this could really play a role um\nAren't sinking few more calls for you ... the first time caller Armand in a bell gardens California go ahead Armand\nYes good evening George did you and your guest I just wanted to put something on your radar screen so to speak\nAnd that is that you may not be aware of this but there's a whole new paradigm for water planetary water on not only earth but on march\nIf you're interested in learning more about it you can go to jail water I. N. G. L. dot com like international geo water international\nAnd the reality is that it's already been well demonstrated on this planet\nBut the water comes from the back ... below and whatever you got the ... the planet fractured\nThat water that hydrogen and oxygen elemental hydrogen auction and make its way to the surface back in areas ... sure that happens quite often and on Mars the same effect is there in fact\nThe largest volcano in the solar system is Olympics moms are bars which is over eighty thousand feet tall just perk digits\nThere is it called they're on top and that's what ... for ... Scott city or lava flows that happens\nSo that's really where the water has always been on Mars and that's where the water is on this planet and it's time I think for us to start factoring that into our calculations for a Mars trip\nWell send rubber what do you think\nWell I I it sounds interesting we certainly know there's a lot of water on Mars we found the lakes we found glaciers and there's probably more to find so I think he's on the right track\nDo you think we are the Martians that a long time ago either organisms flew here from you know shop the media writes a slow off the planet\nOr or maybe they had a full blown civilization long time ago and the skiing I think\nI think the former is is this a good chance is true\nOr not civilizations but a microbes on on meteors a because Mars um well a couple things first of all life appeared on earth almost immediately after it could which either means one of two things\nLife appeared on earth almost immediately after it could which either means one or two things that life can evolve very quickly from chemistry or that life was floating around in space and as soon as the earth was cool enough\nFor life to to prosper here the ... it landed in the seats to cold as it were um and\nNow if you think about that\nWhen you say here's Mars nearby it's being hit by meteors knocking chunks off sending them flying and hitting the earth we're hit by Mars meteorites all the time [noise]\nUm if life could evolve quickly\nOut of chemistry it would've on Mars Mars coup before earth to Mars had liquid water before or did so of life is is is a quick study evolving rapidly from chemistry it would've occurred on Mars first and then it would have landed here\nSo there is a good chance that keen for Mars the the the the a and also that is supported by the fact that we find no organisms on earth no free living organisms simpler than bacteria and bacteria really pretty complicated they have this ... well\nI'm sure of DNA and are in a whole alphabet for transmitting genetic information [noise] um you know or imagined you you've found a um an ancient manuscript that\nI had a complete alphabet along with all the punctuation marks and everything and [noise] ah it could not possibly be the first written document that they would have to be more primitive things before\nYou know the complete alphabet and punctuation and comments and paragraphs and all this had been worked out so uh but bacteria have all that so that suggests that\nThey came here already fully developed it could've come from Mars or maybe both earth and Mars is needed for interstellar space\nI just lost his how did you get interested in all this Robert Sputnik that did it for yeah\nYeah well I was already somewhat interested I I was an early reader I was five when Sputnik flu\nAnd while to the adult world split it may have been a terrifying event to me it was just great ah because what it was proving was that the\nUm the space faring uh stories that I was reading we're going to be true and I can remember reading about uh like it a space dog in my weekly reader and later a I'm a ... and ... the next space dogs and you know I'm I have a dog today her name is ... and\nI'm a beat the struggle was the first off to come back from space alive and she even had puppies and Khrushchev gave one to Jackie Kennedy and um and her descendants are alive today um anyway so um\nAnd the Democrats are not held accountable the same way Republicans are we have to\nLive the system's just\nRush Limbaugh we do to turn into one of the um news talk nerdy fine point ... says where she'd be willy nine Seventy buildings these huge huge ward and you're listening to news tone of voice [noise]\n[noise]\nMurder at the University of Utah ...

seven two three four\nJulie Leslie seal oak to Howard grow up with my fourth interview for a director of operation it was overwhelming running the day to day and being yellow it I thought that the job I mean and it wasn't that but what really can\nAs you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter]\nI there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um would environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans May New we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nUm there is a researcher out there Michael ... hour who categorize these environmentally sensitive people um and what he found was people who are environmentally sensitive have longstanding allergies chronic\nPain fatigue migraines fibromyalgia and just an overt sensitivity to light found my\nCity and smells more than maybe me and you do so I could walk into a room and be fine other people could walk in the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place or get\nBashes [laughter] so these environmentally sensitive people actually way way way more paranormal experiences than the general population um there's those higher it's uh\nAnd what the thought is is these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on\nWhether it's act federal magnetic fields more than the general population in other words they have a veteran Tana or biological radio and the electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment to tune into things but some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios\nAre and they're picking up on things in it and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up for the general population doesn't\nSo this ability to truly experience paranormal phenomenon it's it's more likely to be detected are registered among this group and I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real I think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental sensitivity\nSo there's science behind it and then there's also signed saying these people are having way more ghostly encounters why is that in that kind of where we go a little further into that\nTo some of these people brand didn't realize how sensitive the yard to picking up these things I mean do they know they get it\nI I think they do it in in in when I go out there and I ... my research was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are environmentally sensitive and what you find is\nYou know not only or do they pick up on things or have way more paranormal experiences but it's genetics so their mom did to wear their dad and then they're ... and so forth and so on so this is something kind of like most\nYou know genetic diseases or or what not this kind of passed down from generation and listen they know they're sensitive to the environment\nUm just by walking into places some people you know like I said get rashes um they can be under neon lights some people almost allergic to electricity\nA so these types of people just experience a different world and and believe me they know it affects them probably more negatively than it does positively\nYou know you talked about some of the reality television shows Brenda my a criticism of them because they always seem that they have to have some kind of ... leading donor\nBecause it's television and you know they don't want to do this three minute one hour program and not have anything happen so looks like they create these things and I think that kinda hurts the credibility of some of these uh ...\nYeah I think it I think it it it really does too because it implies that\nEither people are misinterpreting normal things or there's over fraud and um you know every ... those those people who do this on a regular basis and are genuine do you know out of ten locations that you go to you might have one experience\nIt's really impossible to have you know thirty or forty experiences every time you go to a location 'cause then it's your money in the waters and I and then you kind of lean towards that that fried type\nOf thing so we we talked about the individual who might have the ability to spot goes too few goes to more than others but what about the ghosts of cells are there some does that come back more often than others or because they have an ability to do that\n[noise] um I think it's really I guess which one is stronger and when you think about it is the person's ability to sense that goes if if I'm really sensitive to it I'm going to pick up ghostly encounters a lot more than everyone else so I might pick up on a ghostly encounter a civil war soldier I'm\nVery often if I'm really sense I mean a good a good reading\nElse so I might pick up on a ghostly encounter a civil war soldier I'm very often if I'm really sense\nI mean a good a good radio or real good radio probably some she crane is the ability to pick up a weak signals from radio station\n... isn't that much that way with the person that if that person is a receiver he or she may be more apt to pick up these ... things\nExactly yeah exactly so you know ... and ... and that that's kind of a boils down to the environmental sensitive person\nUm they're going to have a way way way more goes the encounters and um so I think it has to do to your prior question I think it has to do mainly with the person not so much that goes to encounter the environment but you have to ask you know hey I'm an environmentally sensitive person I pick up on all this stuff\nYou know I go from place to place to place throughout my day however\nOne location I'm picking up a lot of\nUm having a lot of ghostly phenomenon happened to me um the places pretty active whereas in other places it so then you start asking yourself why why that place and then why not the other places um so then you have to go into why is the location have more um paranormal phenomenon\n... out of the other locations you know it's like those antennas we had the rabbit here was\nYou know why is this configuration picking up channel thirty three and this configuration is that you know what I'm saying you have to figure out the right combination of things that happen for um the TV to show up in a clear picture and the same with ghostly encounters you have to figure out the right sort of ingredients\nAre variable of that line up the habit ghostly encounter location is one person has to 'em and then there's there's probably other ones that I you know we haven't really identified at this point but the person not only as their sensitivity but their internal ... electric\nA consciousness of all this stuff really plays into it and it's really fascinating to me it\nReally is I remember when my dad brought home a better TV and\nYou know there was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears but it had like a little a novel on it that you blinked and it brought into signal better that way too and I thought for use this technology amazing times have changed brand\n[laughter] I remember those too so [laughter]\nYou know or have you come across demonic spirits in your work\nUh no I haven't and I'm I get that question a lot though the the demon question seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so\nI think you know when you have a go sleep counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great uh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the good the bad weather the positive with that this was at that and\nI think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's demonic\nDemonic deem as\nMore of a religious perspective than it is sort of um you know like a\nA scientific perspective so usually whoever classifies as as a demon or um you know a regular goes\nI think there's more of a religious pills to it um that's why I usually when I meet Steven knowledge is they're they're very religious as well um so I think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience\nUm and some people perceive it as good or bad I might perceive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience and be terrified and believe it's negative and then kind of you go towards the more demonic part of things\nSo I I really just enjoyed not enjoy but I have the experience\nThe way the negative and then kind of you go towards the demonic part of thing so I I really enjoyed not joy but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the female label on any\nWhere with Brandon ... his book is called the ghost studies ... dot com of course linked up at coast to coast am dot

I mean who sends to goes back to do what it does it does it do it on its own or is there some organization that's involved in doing that on the other side\nI'm a strong believer in in conscious so you know who who we are as people are are personality our memories are um\nJust this so you know who who we are as people are are personality our memories are um everything that we are um are after we die you know what happens to that\nRight or some people will say that we're just computers and when we die who everything of who we are memories are ... ... it just seems to exist\nUm and that's kind of mainstream science says you but when you look at things the\nGift consciousness survive death and it goes in and it continues to exist it's it could maybe it really be in the environment to some degree and I think when needed\nMaybe like ... example with the husband when needed he can sort of resonate or or link up with the consciousness of his past life\nSo I don't think it's a pecking order as much as you know someone just really needs something and then they sort of resonates with the consciousness of of a path loved ones and then these experience may be happening\nSo yeah you know I I really believe that there's obviously things in the environment that that we don't know about and the consciousness I'm electromagnetic fields all this stuff that really happens in the environment\nIs is really important or Michael pursing or who recently passed away if it was a neuropsychologist basically said and he did all of the numbers behind this but that the environment holds enough energy for every every person that ever ever lived their consciousness to exist at it\nUm which means we have access to memories from Abraham Lincoln civilian a kid it's it's all out there and the environment has enough energy to store all that and then maybe some people can just connect with that or resonate with that and that's when he was great experiences half of\nWhat do you see the skeptics Brandon you see these people who have these encounters or mentally unstable or something even worse\nYeah unfortunately I think you know when someone tells you a ghostly encounter um a lot of people will just kind of say oh you're crazy and they kind of said jokingly but it really makes the other person feel like they're you know they might be crazy [laughter]\nUm so ... you know what I usually tell people who ... skeptics or or things like that I usually just basically\nKind of go over listen you know in in my experience it's all I Do all day is diagnosed mental health and and um you know you see at all\nYeah I mean my job I I worked in the ER for seven years so I just did behavioral health assessments on med floors in the ER and I've I've done probably five thousand assessments them over the course of ten years\nUm so I Know how to parcel out you know significant mental health issues and all these real life and counters that I've come across um Ninety nine point nine percent of them are\nFrom people who were genuine and had a subjective paranormal experience that's huge yeah you know and\nAnd I think that it's easy to say oh you're crazy or your this or you're that or your unstable or you're losing aiding or you're drinking too much or withdrawing or whatever the situation is but listen to it in my professional opinion a lot of these ghostly encounters are the ... there are genuine and the people's eyes it's not the result of mental illness\nWell I've always found that skepticism as healthy as long as opposed to skip the cousin open mind\nMhm exactly exactly you know it's it's really easy to beef you know a steadfast believer or a steadfast skeptic because\nYou can just in golf yourself and whatever your reading journals magazines books and it's really easy to sort of said on everything is everything is ...\nAnd whatever your reading journals magazines books and it's really easy to sort of said on everything is everything is not a goes through everything is it goes\nIt's being in between an open minded that's the most rewarding and challenging because you have to take those side you have to read the skeptical stuff and you also have to read the believe the believers stuff and you have to have common sense in a way and sort of parcel out what's\nYou know what's fraud are fake or just\nPeople being overzealous and then come up with your own conclusions and that's where you're right the open mindedness part is is essential when it comes to\nBeing involved in the paranoia uptick for I'm pretty much a majority of my life changed you\nYou know I I\nWhen people would tell me and I was really interested in Paris psychology like I said before but I never had an experience so I always kind of thought well these people who are having experiences\nMaybe they're just misinterpreting things and just getting it wrong so when people would tell me experiences I Would kind of sit there and as they are talking I wouldn't even listen to him I Would just sort of go over how to debunk yet or what could be happening\nAnd then I just sit back and you know I'm going to start listening and I started listening and I'm like oh okay and then I started picking up\nBooks like um Carl Young's collective unconscious show drags stuff I'm ... and Harold ... life feels\n... yes exactly near\nDeath experience at all this stuff and you start reading it and you go wait a minute there's actually this might be happening and then you go deeper down that rabbit hole and you're reading research articles about untangle matter and then you kinda go wait a minute this is actually somewhat possible and then\nYou know as far as ... the and things like that I mean the research on that is growing every year\nUm I I Know every year I'm reading more and more journal articles which statistically give credence to the idea that come up at the end ESPN the site phenomenon is legit\nAnd then you're like whoa wait a minute if all this is saying this and these ghostly encounters could be possible as well and that's kind of what led me into it from a skeptical to more of a believer party saying\nHe

out for that goes to come out and you know try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them\nYou know it's it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that there's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environments are resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling goes to come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nWe teach in Rochester New York Yankees\nYes I'd like to ask about possible early imprint teams on the brain that might explain to an extent\nWhy people see ghost like others I've seen film of the baby ... chicks being fed by humans with hand puppets made to look like the mother so wouldn't return to the wild the chicks\nNoted key in on a mother conned or a you mentioned the window or who was searching for the pumpkin and his\nWife appeared and then those gone I've never had any experience like that but the closest I've had over many years I'm now sixty three I Will rub my eyes in various ways and all different kinds of figures\nWill appear before me a figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have a Kurd with in me a different figures in all different kinds of actions some of them quite grotesque\nAnd I'm sure that those are not ghost by definition but just kind of bringing us together and closing a one about imprint teens\nThat lake with a widower or seen his wife saying look uh\nUh in the back of the garage [laughter] can't imprint teens can people be so emotionally attached mentally like a husband to his wife that he would see his wife worse than the rest of us would not and maybe I in my life with things that the rest of you would not\nMhm [noise] yeah [noise] yeah it's that\nI I don't think that's a tough one to answer I I think that you know I it's a little bit with a widower they were talking about it's a little bit like he is resonating with something and the environment that's why he's seeing his wife he's not saying Abraham Lincoln or whoever else\nSo it specific to him there's a there's sort of a connection to him you know as as we're driving down the street in our in our cars uh there's radio signals all around us but if\nI I only pick up Ninety two point five\nBecause we're matching frequencies so with a husband and wife with with ... and a mother they match frequencies and that's one of these sort of experience have happened\nAs far as an imprint goes I'm if I'm understanding that the way you're you're describing a ... there is I mean Carl young had this idea of collective unconscious\nSo were all born with these archetypes and the sort of a blueprint for how to really manage life\nUm so we're sort of imprinted um with with with these archetypes in with sort of ancestral beliefs that are common throughout every culture that's happening\nSo this could be me here in Ohio or you know um people in other countries we all have similar sort of\nVisions and and stories and things like that so I think we're all imprinted I'm In a grand gesture but it could be more specific for cultures it could be more specific for families can be imprinted I'm with certain information so you pass that down to your family\nUm so it could be more micro than macro when it comes to this collective archetypes that are out there so I think there is something to the imprint I I I couldn't answer your question differently but that's sort of my best guess that it\nDoes your religion kind of changed your views about these ... donors\n[noise] yeah I think it's it it changes our views and it it just basically changes our perception of an experience so\nYou know you can have someone who's a devout religious person have the same experience as someone who is not the religious person might perceive that as more of um like we talked about earlier a demon or an angel\nOr I'm a of of a sign from from God are assigned from a deceased person that they love\n'em round the person who doesn't have that religious 'til two in my experience that I simply you know an experience or or um a mundane thing or ambiguous stimuli so everyone's\nEveryone's past sort of influences how we perceive any sort of ... paranormal phenomenon\nUm and that's how we talked about before you know the believers are automatically going to go to whatever they believe in and if they believe in earth bound spirits everything is in our found spirit or so I think perception religion or they play a huge part and how we perceive a ghostly encounters a paranormal phenomena\nHave you ever witnessed an extra ...\nNo I never witnessed that would you like to um [noise]\nAs long as it's not yours [laughter]\n[laughter] you know it was somewhat although I did interview a while back and and I can't remember what I said but I was kind of like yeah I'd love to have an experience like that and then someone emails me and says careful what you wish for those types of\nThings [laughter]\nSo I don't wish to be part of an exercise but scientifically are worth my fascination I'd love to sort of be part and sort of gain some information from that or knowledge\nI Am very curious ... Simpson you know how they can get this demon disappearing demonize the person's system and you know be gone and it it's really weird and remarkable it's the same time\n[noise] yeah yeah it it's just

Believe that\nTo Shelly in North Dakota Hi Sally go ahead\nWell hi either you know I mean I'm ...\nI'm gonna talk about a serious\nCar wreck when apple that my well my daughter Christian [noise] you

five [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd we'll get back to the coast to coast your story along with Brendan will sue low in his book of course called the ghost studies and brand and we're going to go back to selling in just a moment here\nSally in North Dakota has a situation where her daughter died sadly in a car crash a but she's getting visitation Sally how often are these visitations occurring\nShe's ... she's not there anymore okay well I'll get your reaction to that Brendan what do you think's going on\nOh that that's actually becoming more and more common I'm at I've heard\nWe'll get your reaction to Brendan what do you think's going on\n[noise] well that's actually becoming more and more common um and I've heard more and more stories about this in the last ten years but this this idea that\nYou know this is somehow I'm ghosts are utilizing electric electrical equipment to to communicate so that's like phones tax emails these types of things um\nYou know typically people will report they'll get hang ups from a family members number who's been deceased for whether it's five days or five years\nUm then they'll get text messages from them you know after their death or you know these types of things and there's a there's a book out there that I'm a pair of psychologist Dr column Cooper rose cause telephone calls from the dead\nWhich encompasses a great he he lists a bunch of these um phenomenon that are happening and then there's phantom menace messages which has recently came out as well which goes over this as well it's hard to really know that\nTo me I mean listen this is the idea that um\nGhosts or consciousness or wherever you want to call it is utilizing electrical or electrical equipment has been going on for a while so you know to to know the exact or how that's happening I'm not sure\nUh but anytime we talked about this numerous times today anytime there's some sort of trauma or crisis or life threatening events\nLike she was talking about um it increases the probability of these types of things happening I'm so we we the only thing we can do is try to see these consistency is there's similarities and then try to find the answers as best we can from the back and\nChange is getting smaller and you\nAre I think you could um put some some doubt and education in there about what could possibly be happening or it's it's a challenging it's challenging because you know at this point ghosts are measurable phenomenon\nAnd the paranormal is difficult to study in a sort of a logical scientific way and this is mainly because paranormal experiences are you know there are radical their episodic\nThey're poorly documented um their random and they're not repeatable at will which is essentially it's everything that the scientific method hates 'em for these things are tough and and isn't that kind of why most people go into its fraud or mental illness or imaginations I'm\nNot a cop out though to be just to see the\nAh I think it's an ... a cop out would be an easy answer to it so that's the idea is if it's if I'm presented with something that I don't know the answer to um rather than spend hours and hours of researching it I can just say that the person's misunderstanding or it's fried or over active imagination\nAnd then I could go on living my life in my normal views and it doesn't blow my mind at any kind of way\nSo it's an easy way to sort of give an answer to something that you know which is pretty mind blowing phenomenon um but ... you know there's all this this stuff out there that that some people point to as evidence like pictures in the piece\nUm but there's really no follow up after that um and then those things nowadays are easily fake\nI I think really if and this is kind of what I tell people out in the paranormal investigator is is you kind of it's about collecting data it's about sample sizes it's about being consistent and what you do and that was over how you that's how you progress or advance of field\nYou know similar questionnaires at all these people are using when they do investigations similar methods\nUm you know if sample sizes huge in academia and in which skeptics as well\nSimilar methods um you know\nIf sample sizes huge in academia and and with skeptics as well is that you know if if you have a sample size of three hundred people that's pretty impressive if you give questionnaires if every paranormal team gave a questionnaire to somebody and they did a hundred investigations a year and there's\nYou know I don't know of three hundred paranormal teams out there your sample sizes getting pretty big and then academia takes notice because you have a hundred thousand questionnaires that are just waiting to be analyzed and then you start getting some variables are um some similarities inconsistencies and then you have a measurable phenomenon\nSo you know it's it's hard to argue with someone who has a close mine but if you could just push him towards a piece of research or a book or something like that and maybe they pick it up then that helps you know and that goes for the opposite end to what people are just adamant believers there's\nThere's things you can push a more towards the middle with which is to me is the best place to be\nLet's go to Tom drunk driving in Pennsylvania I'm doing\nFine how are you ready

sea cucumbers [noise] but ah I was so blown away by the same because I'm a I'm I'm just terrified of chicken and as I said earlier there's actually\nA legendary [noise] they call it a legendary chicken ran [noise]\nBut then I did a one time I was on the air some guy was calling because I was talking about fear and it was a Halloween ... or after Halloween party I was on the you're talking about fear\nAnd I said one of my biggest fears with chickens I talked about this guy calls me tells me he says well you know if you kill a chicken you know if you kill yourself in your pocket yourself you'll be overcoming your fear because then you'll know that you can you can conquer it and I thought no\nTelling me the story about how he killed a chicken\nAnd and everything you just made my skin crawl okay\nSo we're thinking about that floating headless chicken that they found out that Antarctica it's not really have a chicken they call the sea cucumber looks like a floating chicken but anyway so I'm Talking to the guy and I told her I said no no no no this is creeping me I don't even go there don't talked about executing chickens don't talk about ... dropping chickens and having their heads chopped up running around ... you do you do and don't do it\nSo it kept doing it and I just got off of a Halloween party look I wasn't drunk but I was you know how it is when you're just buzz\nAnd you're capable of doing things and your heads kind of cloudy it was how I was feeling 'cause I was just coming off I figured I'd be fined by the time I get on the air and still feeling a little bit you know one of those if I Do a few cups of coffee I'll be fine after I was doing low number copy the guy called the show here is a bit\nFrom the legendary chicken rent just to show you a where my head was at the time All right I'm ...\n... that's creepy Seattle risk fear by by just no you can't do that being an execution of chickens does not change your fear no it does not\nIt does not change the fact that these things they are ruthless they package you may go they make that ...\nYes you can you imagine you can you imagine being held in a chicken coop\nFor a long period of time hearing the sounds of clocking every day and scratching and pecking\nThat would drive you nuts that's how would\nKnowing chickens are that's why we put them in buckets then we'll use eleven herbs and spices on them because they're scary\nWhen you had all these people are the old airport defenseless chickens no one attack me when I was a little kid there not defenseless\nThey're not defenseless\nThey're scary poultry what they are\nFrightening foul he was what they are\nAnd they do fly you know that they do okay don't let anybody tell you that for chickens fly they just don't like to fly obviously they're lazy good for nothing chickens and they only fly when they need to\nThey only fly when they wanna piss you off they only fly where they want to scare the hell out of you\nHow one coming down stripping down on you and flying as they jump off the coup on to you that is when they decide to fly chickens fly\n\nAnd they attacked children they're worse than there were those damn dogs those pit bull dogs are worse than ... bowls\nOkay to keep your chicken under lock and key [noise]\nFive oh three five three five ... back in the old days when the yo ...\nI was younger okay and ground zero was you know it has been putting the and like I said I went to a party and this guy just you know he calls me and he starts talking about how it could be my fear\nOf chicken so he said I had to kill it nah I went into this chicken rant and people were like going I recorded bath [laughter] buddies sending me this this chicken picture that chicken diction I called is those chicken ... so uh anyway so that's my right about chickens once again they found this\nThey found the sea cucumber because the cucumber of all things actually swimming off\nOf Antarctica or Australian group founded\nPut on video it looks like a flying like a swimming headless chicken and I was watching it today gave me the creeps I thought my God you know there are plenty of creatures that we don't know about and the scary and they're out there and they're freaky All right so a especially chicken with his head chopped up men nothing worse than the\nAnyway a lot of ended up a chicken ran [noise] ah [noise] it's very rare I pull out the chicken rent but I pulled it out just so you can see the [noise] yes in my younger days there's a reason why I wasn't a national talk show host\nLet's say you're right what is this where people why we thought it over the coolest thing [laughter]\n[laughter]\nI laugh ... what's that\nThat was the level of life\nYeah that's what I think too it's another lifetime thank God I couldn't I you know lead you to have a ticket to the limit herbs and spices [laughter] you're ... or\n... ... ... barrels a day when the feathers and everything I Do it All right Tony man you made my nightmare thank you for each night\nYou know and that's the thing is that I I wanted I went to that in practical joker show and one of those guys on the show has a fear of cats I don't get it you know I mean I'm sure people don't get my if your chickens\nBut I I Do I have I have a fear that you just heard what he said you've heard what you said about you know Jason what your blood all over our heads would come in and we thought they were an accent that's exactly what they are they bleed everywhere and they chase you\nAnd and and and I actually someone actually sent me something once it was terrifying thing I thought it was a chicken Parker\nAnd what it looked like it like a washing machine it was like he took the chicken or you put it like you to spin cycling what we've done it was blocked and always walked with his with his feet and it's been blocked\nIt was a chicken Parker and I'm thinking oh so there's really no washing machines you shouldn't be chicken blockers okay I didn't want to do a whole show about chicken spot\n[noise] uh I just want you to know that the idea of a headless chicken monster caught on camera is the most terrifying thing floating in the waters off of Antarctica okay you know\nAnd you know it just reminds me of and this is what I really want to get into tonight because it's like Halloween is kind of chicken scare me anyway you just heard the story about you know hunting down chickens and bleeding all over he's simply a horror film\nBut ah you know this whole idea of the headless chicken monster that's what scientists are calling it even though it does have a stage name easy mia one name sounds like it\nDid you see the ... floating around in the water cooler or or you know and that that is but anyway scientists\nScientist suggest that a second genesis to place\nIn its infancy where there is a fifty percent chance other life forms which opposed the norm do exist\nAnd they hide within the normal biosphere\nNow I Know this is a radical hypothesis in a very high brow way of declaring that\nThere was a twilight zone seriously\nSay well this is science is limited to the study of a mirror world with different microbial things and different\nPriya Demick creatures that may exist and made this turn up out of nowhere [noise] why don't we just stop with microbial sciences why don't we just stop with the you know these things that are hidden you know they ... and this is beyond the scripted thing and yet we can talk about ... men we can talk about big foot we can talk about Chicago we can talk about all those things\n\nBut it's been many years since\nI discuss with my audience the reality of what can be called\nThe second genesis\nAnd it's a theory that when the earth was created\nThere was the story did we learn from our bibles and true science however there is this hypothesis that another genesis took place beside our own in another dimension\n\nNow for marriage proposed that there was a form of multiplicity ended the creation and the multiverse city is unseen the agents called it the underworld of course and others are called to the abyss and in the TV show stranger things it was called the upside down\n\nNow the timeline of creation immigration mess that we adhere to are the ones that had been handed down through millennia each one is unique and its interpretation however it's basically the same concept\nAnd it's from these creation myth\nWe hear all of gods and monsters were upon the earth in its infancy and some of the monsters beans you pass the since died out they want some have survived that are still considered predatory and\nDangerous some like the shark and the alligators and crocodile zero considered prehistoric and of course remember we talked about the ... megawatt on whether or not they think that Michael that don't exist but anyway recently there have been numerous reports and discoveries that indicate that there\nIs in fact an active shadow biosphere that exists in the same time and dimension as the one we see and living from day to day\nWhile scientists speculate the strange organisms that might be alien in nature exist on the planet if it isn't a very far jump\nTo suggest that stranger life exist on the planet and and that when you blow open the shadow biased here\nThey're lurks every monster and violence thing but no one wants to ever come in contact with\nWhat I'm Talking about is not big for it it's not the Loch ness monsters it's Myanmar man fight with monsters beyond the trooper caught bra these have been cited by many people and so far they're identified by some of their well reported trades mean big puts a big hairy creature that walks around and then you have you know the mock man\nThe Jupiter ... you know various ideas looks can be seated dog ... it sucks the blood out of you know\nShe you know it has certain traits but\nWhat if you come upon something fat ...\nNo one has seen before nobody's heard of like this had was chicken floating in the water that swims you know I looked I didn't even know what the hell was that it scared me because it looked like headless chicken swimming in water\nBut he was a sea cucumber all names but if you didn't know what a sea cucumber was you'd think to yourself why is this thing\nSo when I'm Talking about\nAre creatures that have appeared what you've seen the do not fit the mold\nCreatures that come from somewhere [laughter] but they certainly don't belong here\nAt least so we know I saw something\nToday on video I Wish I Would have said that because it was a big besides the chicken or\nSomething and I swear it was a familiar animals not matter if it was an armadillo but it wasn't it was some sort of a a a sneaky looking character with armored scales that was actually ripping apart the foundation of a house\nAnd somebody said oh that's one of those things I'm not going well I didn't look anything like I've seen I've seen people and it was the second one I saw\nIt was the idea that uh you know something bizarre when he was trying to call me someone's trying to call me and my phone to the other end of the room listen to that\n[noise] yeah [noise]\nNice doesn't always happen always get colds when I'm On there\n[noise] [noise] yeah\nI'm going to turn them in front of you know I was charging it earlier that's why it's kinda scary in the middle of something\nYour phone line and let's make sure it doesn't happen again anyway\n[noise] so uh where was I okay I'm Talking about creatures that\nDon't necessarily fit the mold and what I mean by that is is have you ever seen anything\nThat it's not a big foot\nNot a big foot none of my men now ... you don't know what it has it is and could you describe it for me\nBecause I've been thinking a lot about second genesis since I saw this creature today and its other creature to I got to find that that the creature I'm obsessed\nBut ah [noise] but I had somebody also send me a pig [noise] some as in\nRock band really cool rock band I guess they wrote me I got to look this up to playing OCC has written Chilean creature like behind them and there's no reason for me there's no rhyme or reason to be [noise]\nAnd ah [noise] and then coming up in the next hour [noise] got a woman named Barbie who I met at a\nPress tour was unimpressed ...

Facebook page and see these things [noise]\nBut once again these are things that don't fit the mold these are things that certainly don't belong here I don't know why they are [noise]\nDon't have an

that I've ever heard of them being in any temperate zone what a lot of Oregon but that doesn't you know evolution doesn't stop I mean as I said actually classify as protests okay\nShe'll look into the slime mold problem they they're called what again\nA slime molds there ... okay and they can move okay in their their colony of like a single celled organisms they could live on their own but they're also capable of colonizing the organic polymer they stick together and start moving from one food source there next\nHorrible how do you see the pictures then make\nSure that that's fine but I saw him on this thing and the lord what kind of like the insect type ones too\nYeah there we were going to have an inspection though that's what we do have a credible inspection is do a follow up to find out what's going on I'm sure\nIt did it was a great idea I think\nOkay we'll do that thank you so much good broadly Washington high bro you're on ground zero [noise]\nThey were ... doing good you're on the Barbie go ahead and\nDo something I was thinking I don't know she owns or rent so but uh like I've rented they'll say those are the ... or something you'd be able to call to have to look that up put it on to their homes as having someone come out or I mean he up for the free\nOr what are you saying Barbie tied jazz and bought a house last October\n... having to put any insurance on it yet\nI mean I'm sure I'm had I had a ... like my um law on that and it's not a rental set out to his church I Am sure that some kind of insurance yeah sorry ... my answer okay\nProbably looking out what it\nIs and kill\nYou got to figure out what it is very my thoughts yet to\nSee how this is I work for a couple of either fire metal ... and I don't know I just sort of Bruce they're set up for it but you said that says that means just\nYeah but like water pipes are what what kind of a toss up I had that I had twelve in Delhi why come out and check the wider plumbers and I had a personal friend that come out and check lead pipes and everybody has like like no no everything's clear\nEverything nothing comes up like it just it they rent cameras certified [noise] no we have a little machines that are the camera you see on the screen that pushes the certified and they can see that\nWhat we're going to do or is it like I said we're going to get inspectors involved and they'll be able to get on there that will be able to do the uh the do the report also get will will get tons of Barbie and get the reporter yeah All right yeah we are to do that\nOkay well Barbie a we know you've got to get back to what you're getting back to what we're doing I think we've gotten enough people to give me some ideas\nWe also got the attention of a home inspector so what we'll do is we'll give you the name of the home inspector we'll call you a tomorrow will be\nLeaving home inspector in the name and then when you get back or will ah arrange to have that done for he's going to do it free of charge that's what he sees a ground zero is certainly going to do it\nFor you okay thank you so much\nI knew I think it helped me with the EU Clyde is the fact\nThat like Star Wars that [laughter] I Know you asked her I Barbie will say why and if I may\nThank you for the central new department and uh in my department and and so yes thank you so much and we'll talk to you soon in fact and I'm actually going to go on a program called around the house this week a top I'm probably going to bring up your case or talk to you about haunted houses houses with problems that you don't know you have\nOr certainly worthy you're talking about especially run Halloween and so I said the chauffeur around this time because I wanted people you know because that's all part of Halloween right the creepy crawly busy with the spider things going down up and and it's crazy but there are these are things that happen\nAnd uh but I'm going to talk to you know this is something is really out of the ordinary Jason calling you from California how are you tonight man\nGood how are you doing great now you sent me some pictures tonight of of what you say you were doing your rock musician am I correct\nYeah I play in a band and a metal band there at San Diego and we were filming a video and using a ... a black and white backdrop ... and when this occurred it was in front of the black backdrop\nAnd I'm the only band that a band member did this happen to but prior to this occurring I I went with my wife and a friend to Vegas and we went to Harvard museum there and I pretty much decided open myself up to it as probably pretty stupid but I'm\nQuite well I like to have answers you know and my wife's a medium so we we do this kind of thing from time to time but I went to this place um and it was it was it was something it uh it it ... me out because when we got there\nI kind of felt a little nauseous like ah maybe it's just my nerves whatever went through it it was really cool and then when as we're leaving\nMy energy just dropped and from then on for about a month I was having a um a have a nightmare as as having bouts of depression and I was seeing stuff and uh this is probably two weeks after we got back\nFor no this is the week after we got back\nFrom Vegas that my senior cop who happens to a man we caught something and I don't know how to tell you this but it's moving independent like independently of you it's it's not a it's not like a shadow or anything moving\nIt lifts mimicking you but when you move it moves like right after you and I seen it and it's like forty five frames and it's a it was really bizarre and I had this attachment um for about a month until\nA I Do environmental testing work I'm a pastor had called me too because he needed some work done and his church some asbestos testing so\nA show up at his church here in San Diego and uh he\nHe looks at me we're sitting down and it gives me a weird look and he goes you got to check it out you say excuse me and he said you got to hit tracker you went somewhere you shouldn't we open yourself up so I told him this story and a prayed over me and gave me so annoyed she no oil and I fought it and and uh it's\nIt's been one of those things if it's almost feels like it's a it's over my shoulder from time to time like it's kind of there\nBut not really an attachment anymore but um as I was I thought this this that photo was was pretty weird and then when you were ... was the I think it was friday show when you were talking about reptilian when I when I showed it to people they say that they go wow that looks like\nA reptilian alien and I'm like well look at my shirt you know [laughter]\nYeah that's true I mean do you have one that's not green I mean the ... she sent me it was kind of agreement a clear picture and I got it looked like a looked like a promo shot right\nYes I created that just on my phone I have another one that I can send you um\nShot right yes I created that just our lifestyle I have another like send you um\nBecause he looks okay here's this\nHere's the thing the reason why I Want something that ah\nI Want somebody to put up it's a different he's because of the fact that while I'm One of the picture is obviously something shadowing you okay I don't know what it is obviously something shouting it looks like a promo shot I mean you could not you it's cool rescue right yeah yeah that yeah\nThat is I'm going to end you I'm going to send you hum\nKilling ... band baby tyranny [laughter]\nThat's that's a that's you know that you're saying yeah or I'll send you a CD as well I'd\nLove it I Love it at ... years of metal right yeah that's awesome where I Will be some new metal\nUh let's see if you can send me one without any logos on it or anything so I can analyze a little more than I'll get it up on my Facebook page that people can see that whenever that his behind me it looks bizarre aid you know I don't know if it looks shrimp telling me it looks it just looks like some sort of a a shadow kind behind\nYou that uh that uh it it looks like it's kind of faceless I don't know I'd have to analyze it some more\nYeah I Love you to to check it out I I'm a I'm I'm a senator you right now it's a it's just labeled attachment\nOr ... on it it's just it's weird whatever it is it looks like it's got a mouth and some some Canadian eyes it looks like I don't know I don't know what it is just behind your shadowing it and\nIt was a it's it was it ... it was a it was a rough month ...\nAll right so yeah send me another one that's an attachment and I will get up on my side and we can take a look at it and uh and and we'll just say that this is from your band or would you know you're in the band and and this is what was behind you kind of a strange a faceless thing I don't know what it is\nA little ... little hedgehog or that's that's one way to look I appreciate I think your body ... thank you very much\nLike you had to take care not killing Tierney the name of the band he has a picture of something that looks like a shadow him a hitchhikers some kind a it's it's just bizarre it's going to bill in Florida I Believe on ground zero\nYeah there I was driving down a little dark ... road and Titusville that's where we live for the last two creepy\nAt all the music the does the ... heat wave in the song heat waves and it was just like at the end\nOf the civil war which is very unusual because I don't like that particular so\nAnd it was real kind of\n... and like I said was that are just so that road shows a strange place anyway and so the the ... the oil that per\nSe there's like a ... a little road and sitting in a parking lot\nIs a big sale on a trailer\nAnd the name of the sail boat happens to the heat\nWave wow I thought that was very straight\nA that's the ... century finger in a city and what that is is that where you you feel like the world is revolving around you it's kind of a a play on that say the world is revolving around you were like for example you're you're harming a song right the song is on your mind you're ... you're in the car and the songs on the radio for you or your\nIt's like for example you're you're humming a song I write songs on your mind you're ... you're in the car and the songs on the radio\nFor you or you're talking about a topic with a friend and the next day you hear somebody like me talking about it on the radio or you're somebody on on a you know they're talking about the very same thing's a very detail you're saying it's a thinker needs to be but they called us centric speaking secretive be\nBecause it's only about you with the idea that you weren't the sun and everything is kind of revolving around you were kind of like or being around you topics music ideas and it for some reason it's where all the things clicked together for you and that's what the strange experience it\nWell it produce something what's that\nThan I Am convinced I don't know if it has to do is opening old let's say a temporary portal or if uh I used to say that say in this city was a specifically\nOr merely a check which is kind of all that you didn't know that okay you're on track mhm with\nWhere you're supposed to be in life at that particular point\nRight they say the same thing about Asia who actually to the dead your day job you also means that you're on the right track or something but yeah synchronous city is one of those weird a weird things because\nYou know people that meaningful coincidence certainly is something I've talked about before and it it's something that happens to people and yeah I Would say that it has something to do with the times clicking together opening together at one point and if you're aware of it it certainly makes for an interesting\nUh anomaly it really does so I\nAnd I don't think it's a coincidence because what was the uh the like I say I never listen to that station really for the most part I don't like the song normally I Would turn the song off I like Motown and that kinda stuff but not that particular song\nSo I Would not be listening to that song was hurt at\nAll just depends on who's saying that\nWell it's a heat wave by the un to run that Ryan the original one right Mandela's or Vandellas you have other than Dallas I guess yeah Vandellas\nUm so I left it on and let and really what hit me afterwards was the vote\nSomebody had planned on parking at white there while you know another parking lot why not another position with why did I tell and I never took I never never usually take that road helium centric synchronous city [noise] yeah well it\nProduce something in your head as of what it what it could", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "23"}
