I I feel like whatever she does with the only just so amazing but instead of doing the work for me she empowered me and and taught me how to do it myself so I just you know I picked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest is history\nI feel very very confident with with what I Do you know with the spells it I've been executing so that's how I got started it was\nIt was more about healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like well I probably don't need a healer because I'm I'm using magic as a form of killing\nHave you ever ... never\nAnd I want to make that very clear that I Will never ever ever cast a spell to hurt anyone um to try to bring love my way to try to win the lottery [laughter] that's not what\n... what what what good is that if you can't win any\nYou know I think that the power of our minds because I have discovered one thing I have discovered with magic\nIs that in\nMy mind is more powerful than I realized so I think that when we\nStart healing on so many different levels that we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial abundance hands spiritual abundance so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will conjure up a money spell and work that\nBut right now I've just been focused on doing the um healing and an crossing and reversal\nWhen you talk about magic what do you what are we talking about we're not talking about David Copperfield we're talking about something oh sure absolutely\nAnd it can be used by anyone I think people you know use magic every single day with the power of their minds so when I talk about magic I'm simply\nChanting spell and when I work my rituals I chant between anywhere between one and two hours I don't just Trenton said resigned really long I really do I mean I

every single corner of my home and really really works and then I'll ward all the windows\nYou know the the ceilings and the floors and everything else so um that's fun it's really really fun and then

demons Savage U I have I have do you fight them off or do you do with her\n[laughter] yeah I Do I have a story that might have even Slayer [laughter] well it's it's not as tragic as that but I have had one experience and I I Will share that with you I Would say about Nineteen Twenty years ago and this was my first experience with a real\nLive Damon men this wasn't like a portal it was in my house and it came out and you know wanted to play it was actually a demon that was summing up by a very evil some federal and he sent it my way\nWhat's on the medal I said I said is ... is a

I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just fall and as soon as I\nI made that adjustment in my mind right I I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just peeled off of me

reason I think that\nMany other were you ever to laugh you don't have a ... which uh which never check your email\nYou know a which is actually a wise woman so that's the definition of a witch but yeah I think you [laughter] I'm\nKind of wanted a chemical sensor can view it even if I\nTried so one of the reasons that I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand\nI'm considering we've all lived thousands of lifetimes I'm and I'm Glad I haven't remembered any of them um some of these lifetimes we were not the best of people and um it's very possible that this is my theory that could be wrong but\nI have proof for my showman who kind of confirmed um my you know my thoughts about this um it's very possible that some of these people these victims who are experiencing what is known as karma so they can be\nYou know harassed and molested in this lifetime with the demon the\nDanger packed with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in this lifetime I'm ... the demon the pay is is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I've ever heard of a demon die unless you've like\nSlate cash them out but they don't exactly\nThere's thousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at George it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demon and what's going to happen when we reincarnate and\nLike people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demon and what's going to happen when we read incarnate and the demon is going to probably harass him and molest him now that's one one theory and I can say\nI'm with confirmation that it's it's it's probably very true because my sharman has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days\nHas a lot of cases of of people\nWho are being molested harassed and just you know that possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a ... journey into their past lives and nail it\nAnd nine times out of ten these people have made packs with demons or they were maybe a big\nPowerful black which and you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is she just\nBreaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situation and you know these demons or not bothering her neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified sharman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are these dark for she wants to ... what what are they want\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity\nDuty we'd also\nAbsolutely and I'm sadly a lot of black magicians will cast spells against people who they feel they can steal light from and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and they look into us however they do it\nAnd what this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent\nSo this is why it is extremely important especially right now um to to really really really really\nClear ourselves on a daily basis and do vanishing rituals prayers and and ... our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases\nOf the demon intrusions into people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um

consider her a gift excited and she sat at the board and the message came through and it said they asked what should we call you wish we call this tool to for this device\nIt's spelled out we job\nThey they decided let's go we just so ... so they needed to get it patented so in Eighteen Ninety they went to the U.S patent and trademark office allies rub on the attorney for this group went along with miss Helen Peters they sat down at the board because they had to prove\nTo the patent officers that this tool works everybody kept saying no I'm not going to do this no I'm not going to

life so I\nKnow you've got to have your hands on the plan Shen after that\nYou have to so it's voted out they didn't know him and it was that you know that's how the story goes so this woman miss Helen Peters not worth the ah is really critical a crucial to the naming of the board and also to get a patent it and a lot of people didn't even know about her\nIn Robert merge the chairman of the board of the talking about ... dug up an old archive\nStory than letters about her and so it is we were honoring her just last month and as a Denver, Colorado and gave her beautiful gravestone with

and thankful and\nAnd now she's got to be well no and she's going to go on the heritage with a group of people who do tours and its graveyard it's called the Fairmont cemetery and Denver, Colorado and

weed you board the proper way he felt and it was to burn it and he said as he was burning it he could see little sparks come read off it and screams she heard screams coming out of the board you believe up\nWell okay so you have the stories right and again I'm gonna I'm gonna references again we all have our stories based on our perceptions belief\nOn how the world her own fears our own

to Ninety three board so I got um rats they started being made in Nineteen Ninety One and production minds when you're after that\n... how do you explain this back in St Louis when I'm doing my night talk show must be Nineteen Ninety seven Ninety Ninety eight\nSomebody gets me a weed gee board I've got it in my studio and I'm going to do a little bit with it and I've got a producers there\nAnd this ... board is in the studio with me\nThat I never had any technical issues with in the studio all of a sudden everything is going wrong what commercials I couldn't play him because the computer board went though the board that monitors middle my voice levels that was all screwed up the lights were going out and I didn't know what was on and what was off\nHe was weird and I finally told my producer Howard at the time is an hour to get this thing on the year he took it out and within two minutes everything pop back up working on the computer the board everything and I want this is weird\nAnyways what I didn't know at the time was Howard\n... widow news guy named Daryl and hot word game Darryl Luigi board he said that in Georgia doesn't want those you try to get and so he took it as a gift I didn't know that\nAnd I'm sure I Do my show or within works in the ... that was fine uh about two days later Darryl is no longer employed at the radio station which was kind of strange what he's gone and I want boy that's weird ah\nAgain not knowing that he had the ... board I I run into him about a week and a half later\nIs at a restaurant and I went Darryl how're you I'm Sorry I heard you're not one of those in the morning when George nothing has gone right with me ever since Howard gave me that we'd you board I got fired\nSure I Can't get a job I got rid of the thing and hopefully things will get better how do you explain that sure\nWell it's always all too easy to point the finger at something out there than to look at yourself you know maybe the filing down any way on a path of not doing very well working there or maybe he wanted\nWell what about the studio thing with me in the beginning\nWell you know we want to blame that we've all by something that you want to make it mysteriously don't want to look at something logically first\nIt was ironic that it it's very ironic\nI but I have to give you that George but I got to say we we we ... the ... the Ford because it's so controversial\nAnd it just causes all kinds of meetings and and visceral reactions in people we've really got to look at um what's really going on inside herself and what's really going on in the world around us and not just quickly jumped to say to board did it but that happens too often because it's almost easier like end is to blame for that external\nAnd to think that's the reason now now hold on that's another way to think about this too\nWe create a lot of things we could just have the thought in our mind that ... is scary dangerous bad and then we can draw those things to us just for the power of our minds is when the power of unconscious mind and then send her on and go I told you the it's like self fulfilling prophecy\nI don't know I don't know you know all these years I've known you Karen you haven't been able to convince me yet to use the region board\nI Know it that happens sometimes\nI mean could you be wrong could you be wrong\nAnd there's something very wrong about what aspect of it I'm sure that it can conjure up evil spirits luxury all say\nThat you can conjure anything evil in your mind because I think evil exist in the heart of humanity I hate to say that evil is and people there's evil all over the world look around it's people cause evil\nBut what I say is evil is not a force outside yet we can draw these energies to withdraw other evil people too if we can have evil things happens and they are real bad evil things\nDoesn't see me just because you get a piece of wood out or cardboard or there's numbers on a piece of paper or letters that that's going to cause any problems so I I I for my world my life and what I've experienced with this tool\nAnd away from the tool I'm convinced that you cannot now but having said that

becomes just that permission allows me because my allowance becomes my a gateway or becomes just the channel I used to do what I actually can do I mean I did this as a child\nBut sometimes we put that stuff away as we get older and grow up and were told not to do that and not to talk to beans that aren't there are a magic right flaming go to school and I was told those things\nAnd so I found myself putting away but this was the one tool that worked really well for me to be able to have those communications and to this day I'm I have communications of that I used to have the trial but now I can

Republican or a Republican started she's not\nWaters and that was intercepted uh US Congress mail facility which was located on site where the congresswoman works a\nBomb that was sent to Eric Holder ended up being re routed to the return address of Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida and there was no package addressed to her but multiple packages had her address I as a return address on them so ah it looks like the CNN package got all the way to the the mail room\nOne or more of the package is also contain envelopes that had an unknown white powder inside so not only was there this possibility of of a pipe bomb possibly a more rice and perhaps anthrax who knows\nA an ATF official said during a press conference at the device into CNN was a pipe bomb NYPD said the device sent to CNN was a lie of explosive\nDevice\nAnd the implication is that they that this ... and the other devices had the capacity to kill\n\nNone of the devices went off their lethality has not yet been confirmed by bomb technicians we have not heard the lethality of of these so called bombs how the feds wouldn't\nDisclose er during any of the press conferences exactly what was in the packages they said well it's consistent with the other packages let's just put it that way so we have the investigation is ongoing of\nSo many crazy things have been done a lot of what we call security theater happening I heard something about New York and the national guard being\nCalled out why how's that going to prevent the mail from\nThe finding is that ... ... it's just I just find it interesting now do you remember back when we were doing the rice and report\nRemember that remember that I was talking about the rise to report and how it's going to you know all those people that I said wow this is the biological attack I guess I I I predicted and I was all over it and I was reporting it there was not really that much of any type of reporting going on in the mainstream\nFrom CNN or or or MSNBC or any group I I Know the Fox was all over it because this was an attack on the president\nBut now this has happened to democratic leaders this has gotten you know this has got the most attention I've ever seen and the truth is is that the rice and that was sent to these ... ah to the ... of these leaders was activity could've poison someone and made a few staff members that Ted Cruz's office sick\nBut not one of these bombs went off\nSo they were sending a a pipe bomb with the triggering mechanism on it you know they weren't there those those balls weren't there to take anybody out there were there to scare people they were they were they were basically scare type of of tools they were there to ah they weren't there to ah ah kill anyone\n\nAnd uh and so that raises my my eyebrows just a little bit but I also saw the John\nBrennan or on all of them were bombed below they they said the bombs below John\nBrennan Time Warner CNN [noise] ten Columbus Circle New York New York to set up there [noise] and uh apparently all we have are just maybe six stamps there are no post marks on the\nOn the package [noise] so I'm Wondering if it was courier hand delivered or what [noise]\nThe bomb scares all that this is going to create a perfect storm for misinformation\nI mean what you get and that I Am I'm being kind of in and out ah and and\nDoing some analysis having an analyst here what you get as you get breaking news reports and we we prove we would prove this with nine eleven the nine eleven shall we did a while back I wanted to I Want to just kinda reiterate this you get breaking news reports\nWhich are always riddled with holes there's a lot of unanswered questions as a lot of a gag and going on where they they gag police officers and FBI\nI mean who sit in the packages were they address to what was inside where they really are bombs et cetera et cetera set in any incidents involve\nHigh profile polarizing figures in American politics who already are the frequent subjects of misinformation who already spout in misinformation and then of course you have the networks that are constantly pushing misinformation to push the cognitive biased for their own constituents\nAnd here we are just what\nDays away from his mid term election\nThrow it all on social media anyone can basically speculate anyone can say whatever without any of the facts put me on the air talking about and if I don't if I don't tap into your cognitive by us I'm a wire in a shill\nFor the ... or for the you know my Jewish cameras or whatever you want to say I have I don't I I don't I just can't stand that stuff\nYeah we all know investigations take time but I Know that you know the way this all works the FBI\nIs going to say that they're more packages out there if they haven't said All right I mean I've been following the news since I did prep for the show I just everything I'm getting is just\nProbably an hour or two before I went on the air tonight so it'd be more copycat situations going on I can promise you this a\nOf these reports being made people are claiming they're getting bombs\nIt the more these reports arise it's imperative that you have to be vigilant you have to figure it out you have to say well you know now we have this going on we have to be aware of packages react to be aware of\nYou know a package that look kind of I'm suspicious\nBecause I I remember ah the Unabomber bombings uh they happened in Utah and there was also the Mormon document bombings or this guy who uh had the bombs actually his car blew up like a block away from my apartment\nSo I I Know that that this stuff is the same mad bombers are insane because people are always fighting bombs where they don't exist or they're trying to make up stories that don't exist you have all these people you know freaking out over this\nSo\nLet me also tell you this okay if you were to look through history of you look through or anything that deals with civics you know that these types of activities\nGo on in the elections in third world countries and they do so to try to shake up the government they shake up the regime they shake up who they want out and who they want and it's all done to uh it's all done and it's all traced back to rogue intelligence rogue military\n\nAnd what we're seeing here with the delivery of the rice and and the bombs\nAre exercises and drills and then possibly even a a I guess you could call them cry will scenarios I'm a decapitation exercise because if you recall the rights of the attacks were aimed at the president and military leaders the latest bomb attacks though were aimed at the Democrats mostly a\nLaw enforcement authorities said today that they believe potential explosive devices send to the former secretary of State Hillary Clinton for President Obama billionaire philanthropist George Soros and former CIA director John Brennan CNN or all linked\n\nThat's from Newsweek us Secret Service intercepted a device yesterday or last night actually send to the Clintons and chop according to New York also another to bronco bomb in Washington DC in Manhattan and CNN evacuated employees of the time Warner center this morning\nIn fact you can go online and uh it was during a one of the morning shows they were on the air and they heard the fire alarm and then they were immediately taken out with no questions\nI uh I just have a catch the ... just the last bit of that today middle went into a you know we'll Blitzer and everybody else making commentary but you should have seen the hysterics\nAnd I thought were it was the hysterics for the rice and bombs and and and why is it that that didn't get much press but this is getting a lot more press why because this is political theater it's ... ...\nYou take something like this these bombs and go off nobody was hurt nobody was killed\n\nIt was important in San Diego union Tribune newspaper reported its offices were evacuated this morning after a stack of suspicious looking packages was spotted\nOutside the downtown building this gave ample opportunity for CNN and other news departments to blame Donald Trump for his over the top political rhetoric\nTone it down Donald Trump he needs to tone it down nice and they were claiming that his political rhetoric his rallies or whether it will ... is what is doing is okay and there were no comments about the harassment of leadership like you know Mitch McConnell Nancy Pelosi was harassed you saw that to\nTed Cruz so you you see all these other\nGetting harassed then we're talking equal opportunity offensives here now that's why I threw a Nancy Pelosi Mitch\nOther leaders getting harassed than we are talking equal opportunity offensive here now that's why I threw a Nancy Pelosi Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz the president the generals\nBut it's it's all the I guess you could call it the incest you as few there they got attacked or at least were threatened today and now it's a big big deal\n\nThere were ... today was there was there was no mention also of negating of leadership in several cities where my violence has been common like it here in Portland, Oregon in New York didn't even mentioned that they didn't say oh this is all culminating in one big mess is it was all about their their their\nTheir leaders there was almost like a leader from like North Korea or you know they say the trumps of fascist or the Trump is a naturalist pig you\nKnew that the way everybody is just like so into in love being in and finding over these guys when we've had this has been going on I mean it started with the shooting of all those congressman\nAwhile back\nThen there was no man should have been surprised at the interruption tactics as a symptom of civil war in this country but it's best review that this is what is happening in America the truth is is that we have been having a plethora\nOf homeland conflicts that have been asymmetrical distributed and diverse and we've seen the conflict with numerous dynamic factions organized by social media around ideological and affinity networks\nAntifa Proud Boys white supremacist\nAll part of the patchwork of affiliated insurgency groups and their counterparts engaging in skirmishes along overlapping edges of their networks\nEveryone has a place in this faction of civil war and just say it's not a civil war I think you're blind because after the attempted bombing today will be seeing occasional high value terror attacks against soft and hard targets mark my words\n\nMaybe it's just going to continue we have bombs going off we have we have a red but rice and being sent the leadership soon it will be schools again it will be it'll be neighborhoods\n\nAnd people tell me oh we're not in a civil war or do you want I mean this is one civil

throws a civil war as we speak because we do not listen we did not pay attention we're too busy writing people off because they said things that we don't agree with\nI'll just read job I'll just a friend you that makes me feel good I'll say something bad on Facebook about best I've done my part screw that you've done nothing okay you've done nothing but you just contribute to the the whole problem with this country now and that is we're against it were against it were against it well what are you for I don't know but I'm against it\nJohn Carmen with us tonight on ground zero\nFormer Secret Service and talking about the bombs that were sent out today um you know these are pretty strange bombs especially when you know you'd you'd figure benefits was a a you know this was going to be some ... some sort of successful endeavor that one would go off\nBut none of them went off I don't think any of them were a program to go off so what would you say that this is a bit of added prop\nYeah I mean a a friend of mine was just reminded me not too long ago about false flag I mean he is false flag almost\nEvery show almost I mean it's it's just kind of terminology but I mean my training goes back to eat in Quantico, Virginia Secret Service they take us down there to a Marine Corps a semester or should strike team member San Diego with US Customs cells\nSo I've seen and then exposed to all the various types even a basic training and Secret Service or Washington DC\nSo that there is a incidents if they had like a some famous as that happened back in Michigan years ago back in the sixties so they use the old\nFashioned stuff you know pipe bombs are oh that's not the technology that's all just the stuff they use nowadays I think I made reference to you and all of a\nEmail message or something about the movie the body of lies the floater DiCaprio mhm\nAnd he was a CIA agent in the middle east and it's really interesting if you follow the movie but I've seen it so many times I get what am I watched as two nights ago for psych grade so it's like they're using cell phones to set up\nFree designated bombs which are high tech stuff just like I ... in the middle East that don't use pi farms anymore that stuff is like old hat I mean it's like they're they're just saying yeah they're just trying to show you they can do okay I Will send Roche lobes\nRight here's here's a question how did they are able to flag on certain packages being a suspicious I mean what are some of the ... seizures and criteria that you're supposed to analyze well were you at this go through\nI'll give you an example I used to work at the White House that one or the gated areas and whether the CIA career came in with a leather briefcase ... seventies it came in with a of a daily brief that I took it an X. rated I looked in through an x-ray machine\nAnd I could use the love to go all the way through it all the way back like this you pay for like a C a single day for ...\nSo they don't even get stuff that goes straight to the White House she goes to a designated post office or a male facility so they process stuff like that if it comes at a packages like that have you with a pipe bomb and players or should find a buyer\nDevices late it's going to be heavy it's going to get an X ray that's the first designated then they can use a swatch to sniff it here's another machine that they used to sniff us for powder centuries list you're\nSo all kinds of other explosives ah syntax and his mother key words I won't use so that they can sniff it out those are high tech okay so they can ... it can use that medic extras they can use other types of machines that as a ... or ...\nSo that there's a way to scan it if it's too bulky too big they are going to open it for their gonna what could possibly opening I've discovered packages right outside the British embassy in Washington DC or two in the morning\nThey had to come out or tears the typical security explosive ordinance state would come up and they were sort of affordable X ray benefits really in doubt they'll take it carefully with a bomb a person who's been properly dressed they'll put it in a special tank and they'll we'll it off with the U.S army or something and exploded somewhat see\nWhat I find interesting is that you were talking about the rudimentary nature of these bombs being sent out\nAnd buy it kinda makes me wonder about that ah when what was it just a few weeks ago Venezuela or their leadership or someone tried to assassinate their leader and he tried to do it with a drone or just to find drawing they were going to use it to kill the area\nAnd I think you know there are plenty of other ways but then see\nThat's why these pipe bombs I think are affected because they're there to scare\nThey weren't there to kill their their to scare and they're they're in my opinion a to a you know pork or at least change the views of elections in political moves is no different than when the uh uh the the bog one rushed me she's in Oregon put ah salmonella in salad bars to make people sick so they wouldn't go out and vote\nThis is the same thing they did with before cabin on with the rice and the the the and they get older the vote there to get to simply there to be distracted and it also happened now would be a just before the vote happening in November ...\nDid you get a look at the um a website I sent you was twenty four hours are two of us weapons bandleader autonomous weapons that are located yeah\nThree grams three grams of something like center so just used as a possible and and then they throw them in their thousands of them even just one and they had one that was a a different type over by the White House months and months ago\nAnd that's that's a violation of the air space over there but that's a separate discussion kind of live right at the same technology which means that they target you and it's got recognition on it\n... you're on ground zero [noise]\nAnother one that doesn't know how to do it okay we're going to another call good at dealing in Michigan Hi Bill and you're in ground zero pay\n... by doing great awesome awesome\nA lot of your guests to um I just talked about you know with this all civil war stuff they talked about um you know that's sort of stuff that I started doing research when I was about such team you know I'm over ten years ago\nAnd they said that you know that they will say that project protests have they have with things console force and they you know start hitting us am probably going to be around here are twenty twenty\nOr so when all the circles that's starting to hit the ... and ... and um you know you in are so many other people like uh like ... ball and Jones and all of them recovering the rights and stuff and\nIt is about any of the ... at all and all of a sudden it a hit right it is just as many as ... as soon\nAs I say all swipe pops up my mind right away you know how far we are some you know it's going to totally crazy I mean I Will say that I was also\nI think things have already gone totally crazy I mean when you have a police officer standing down and riots when you have a rice and being sent him political leaders when you have bombs beings into political leaders\nYou know sure there are no deaths or casually that we're willing to walk up to a civil war nobody's not yet I mean we've had two men were beaten to death in Manhattan during a standoff between\nA Proud Boys an anti by big was the Proud Boys the did the beat down to the anti by members\nBut those are two deaths that will not be a tribute to any civil war and the fact is is that nobody is going to get on a TV Donald Trump does not get on TV and say I hereby declare a civil war that's not how it's done civil wars are not cleared civil wars are actually called civil wars after the fact\nThat the thing is is when you're in the middle of one you don't realize you're in the middle of once you start noticing a lot of strange things going on where people are at each other they're fighting with each other they end up killing each other or it's not an armed conflict are always it's a war of ideas\nPeople are at each other they're fighting with each other they end up killing each other or it's not an armed conflict\nAre always it's a war of ideologies it's more of a factions in and union then and other groups have interest that they wanted to see their interests be heard in tap into their riots or marches they're blocking traffic there ah\nYou know we're a hostage situation that happened and he's all go down and uh you know you don't necessarily have to have an armed conflict for civil war it just that when you were in our when I was in Argentina\nUh the armed conflicts where we're between certain groups of certain factions military versus police police versus military\nOr their own version the national guard on the streets going from door to door\nTaking out people in their ... in the middle of the night these are things that happen all the time in this type of atmosphere\nYeah and that's one thing I Want to touch on and if I could ask her a son who is on a quest shuttle so as well that what that rings a bell ... civil martial law on you know how far off salt\nMarsh ... I'm like what what is going to take such ... or something like that John coming a martial law [noise]\nUh yeah it's kinda hard to hear him and says look he's too far off\nOf this stuff is all Cold War stuff for people need to concentrate on her back in the forties and fifties that's what they do they go behind the scenes the American public is aware of it and they're going to do that with that out he opened this is typical pro war tech\nSo my answer will know he wants to know about martial law what would trigger a martial law\nYeah yeah we've we've discussed or stuff like that that capital soccer when he was questioned at some point because there's two systems of government\nAnd if we go to military tribunals the president has the authority as the commander in chief should go ahead and take action stickler temporary martial law get these indictments on these people or so called untouchable\nAnd put them through automatic tribunals of as it gets them put away real quick\nBut indictments based on information than the arrests and then it through some sort of the tribunal and then after that it goes off the deck and all that day if you're getting sick about that so yeah\nThere you go I appreciate the call the sewage villain for college go back to uh Brian in Nevada Hi Brian you're on ground zero [noise] right in the second time Yes sir be right there when I talk to you okay and that was my way to go ahead I bet thank you\n[laughter] so uh I hate to be in tagging this terror but I Believe you have a quite a few listeners that are disagreeing that we are in a civil war\nThere not disagreeing at all they just don't know what a civil war is they don't know what it feels like the ...\n... what is the definition of a war\nWell civil war and more are two different things no no no no that may explain don't know I'm trying to tell you when you talk about war in general it's an armed conflict am I right or wrong you know you're right okay so we have a civil war is not necessarily an armed conflict\nCivil wars are not necessarily armed conflicts when you get it wrong up your own definitions no I'm not making my own definition you want me to find a definition for your guest definitional ... civil war now in a war between citizens of the same country symbols that\nPoor definition of a war\nNo simple more and more between countries are two different things to marry or no wars are not necessarily with guns for all their ideology\nAre they are or no wars are not necessarily with guns\nFor all their ideology and their ideas here I mean and and when you're talking about an armed conflict yeah so what do you call it high bones between ... rice and\nIt's a biological attack what do you call a pipe bombs what do you call it what do you call it at a job\nThat is our government working against us that's\nWhat he said well we're at the government can't even go out and people against the government and the police against the military to get the military that's what a civil war is\nHell no no that that was the name of the people doing that that rice attack it was all straight into the government\nEven if it is just raided by the government if the government against put people into civil war but it's still a war is more a tactic of war therefore it creates a political change it's terrorism it's domestic terrorism okay\nThere we go civil terrorism\nRight which which part of a terrible war absolutely\nA it's a civil war ... sorry [laughter]\nSo anyway that British is don't matter next time I learned how to use the telephone on a radio show AAA picks up at three thirty seven hundred\nThat's AAA thinks every three I Swear to God I get this guy and I wanted to come on and talking to my show and he's not there and then go back to him he's not there and then he comes on my show and proceeds to tell me that my definition of civil war is not what he likes\nIt just it just it's annoying when you're trying to get messages out to people and they're not willing to have a conversation or do the right way\nOkay little or no kidding Samantha Tony you're on ground zero [laughter]\nI tell you what yeah ... ... what you John Clemens right you're right this is definitely entail\nI mean these supposedly carried by a career they have stamps on them that aren't cancelled they supposedly went through the mail they have no markings on one with the Eric Holder all the way back to Florida with no markings on this damn snow cancellation thing he's not saying they're pristine envelopes\nYou know what I mean it's just it's every marker the intel community and it just blows me away you know they put sticking ISIS sticker on one of them you know the obvious that this is this is this is ... what what people are hung up on Clyde is this is asymmetric or this isn't\nYet for North and oh by God and ... eight metric warfare and they don't they have to really read the ad\nAnd at the end of the day what it will boil down to is the police state\nCracking down yet they're going to use this to clamp down on people like you on Alex Jones that don't care about the the uh line of the the government and the establishment media they want to make sure that that people don't disagree with what they say anymore\nAnd it will give them the justification to crack down on people that are getting out there and telling the truth and then they're not telling line that the government once said\nYeah it is difficult for people to see a lot of people think in this country that we're too big to fail there were too big of a war\nAre way more we are way more fragile than people at I mean look at the ... the velvet revolution and Ukraine Ukraine was relatively stable\nYeah back when I see happening this is like Ukraine you're very correct this is the same as\nJohn McCain talks to to the neo Nazis and now they everybody here supposedly a neo Nazis\nThey use the neo Nazis there to destabilize now they're using you know that the leftist claiming that that we're not that the Trump supporters are Nazis and like the Proud Boys are feeding right into it and give them exactly what they want to just\nLike Ukraine you're very correct you are brilliant near the first call that night I think I I've been going through a lot of hard cause your little\nWarrior Clyde I I Know how the tactics work and joining right this was yards asymmetric guerilla warfare\nI've been going through a lot of hard cause you're really warrior Clyde I I I Know how the tactics work and Johnny right this is yeah say so much a guerilla warfare\nIs
