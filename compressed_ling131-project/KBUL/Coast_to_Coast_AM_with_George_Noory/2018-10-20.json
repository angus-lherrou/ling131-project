thought maybe we could exchange some veal recipes\nBecause there's absolutely nothing going on right [laughter] I actually remember slow due date news days back in the nineties when we would sit around and say wow there's nothing going on well that certainly isn't the case these days\nSoviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that uh they're somewhat um I Would argue blind or to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nThey want to rise again they want to be a great power again and they do have them the means through their nuclear arsenal and of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that you know we have a modern weapons systems\nThat really a push against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the oven guard a twenty time speed of sound a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a defense system\nWeapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back they are concerned about NATO and we did violate a the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves\nIn a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative the Russian collusion handcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps\nSmoothing over relations pulling back from the break if you will because now\nBecause everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House\nOr that he has to be asked to appear almost overly aggressive against the Russian how much has this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact potent said once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nAnd Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was ridiculed reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nI I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower or not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and the like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of it is but at the same time he does want stability he does want in the tensions uh but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nWell let's pay the China you mentioned the trade wars are ... and how people need to appreciate how does this trade war strategy or terrorists\nUh against China is is not just economic it's also national security and that if I Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later in this and it tends to weaken China significantly economically so that they can uh a cheese military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two\nEconomic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest to keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so have seen somewhat of a ... you know there is what six and a half percent growth\nIn the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters [noise] uh but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property and Trump says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company the company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let\nOur wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position so are there hopefully going to be within the month maybe in Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement and the right direction I Know the Chinese\nMedia is is trying to figure out Trump and it just like the ambassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree gassing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nIt is a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other a component to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of ... the Russians and the Chinese becoming\nA bed may is is driven by ideology in any way or are there still messages of\nA communist ideology here or is it\nWell as a combination of things uh I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy as it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to what they would call an amoral west\nAh and the things that they represent they paint the wife says what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you

have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week you had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who\nEven started to you know hit at perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\nYeah this past march [noise] you know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that food is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political corps and a predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare um\nCovert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there's a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're

the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived\nWho do you perceive us the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nThreat Richard is Russia a given\nTheir provocation but also a military capability which they're not shy to exercise around the globe I'm very you know the chief of naval operations animal rich\nHave said recently we were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two the old Cold War with the third one\nOr the Russians have put in place I ...\nA nuclear submarine and a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the Atlantic but in the Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course are confronting enough militarily or in the air or they're back off our coast\nThe training and elsewhere and of course are confronting us militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines are they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as we know all about the allegations and\nIn justifiably are the sanctions put in place because of their interference in the twenty sixteen election in here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid term we arrested\nOr someone of course this was a Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are\nBellicose and they're you know claims against us and to a certain degree or we're pushing back you know President Trump's not a you know backing down and that and given that there's you know some given some take but maybe\nA it's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy ... an issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a\nWay of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe you know they'll say Russia is more dangerous now China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] while we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas now why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic weapons that\nAre putting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours um but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it as well put and says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that's in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nYou know why the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen now wants to fund a new counter to\nAh that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there I I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nUh we got there the the mere threat in the long term threatening especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with\nThe defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok twenty Eighteen\nJoined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise\nThese sorts served indicators that demonstrates that are these two nations are pushing back against the former yeah dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can\nCome up with the conclusion I think that perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration\nAnd as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry\nA and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course though not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that are clearly we don't have and we're trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five of course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three ...\nWell that's a that's why you know Trump has been over there you know\nTrying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more and yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia going in and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one of the declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked a\nYou know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and and the light can we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so [noise]\nUm no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's\nCapability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need that may not have\nThe wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to a you know make these tough decision so\nUh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in Claremont next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts than NATO and\nAnd he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise] uh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nHad better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even Poland which is a you know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what\nThey did with Ukraine these are all issues of\nGreat a magnitude that um we've gotten to the side and thus far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nLet's talk about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president has accused the Chinese of of meddling in\nThe mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states\nI'm the big concern as I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about a Chinese made computer chips and components in electronics they may have a back door or even in US military equipment talked me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly at the Pentagon you know the [noise]\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly the Pentagon you know the\nA defense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate said look you know even in these

can sanction entities and individuals or even if ... ... was you know demonstrated to have been murdered as it would appear to be by a henchmen that were under the\nYou know demonstrated to have been murdered as it would appear to be by a henchmen that were under the\nLeadership of saw him on don't know but that could be clearly we could cancel the arms deal but I mean we've been not only a hundred and ten billion it's far in excess of that\nAnd we have a lot of people on the ground working hand in glove with him but we risk a relationship\nWith a with the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons [noise]\nUm and the packs of course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so you you've got to look at second and third order effects of any decision geopolitically and that part of the world\nUh otherwise you end up with no one that you can go to and work with and given your your vested interests and of course the the Yemen situation we've been helping them a great deal the rea Riyadh government\nAnd trying to battle the who cheese and others of course the Iranians you know through proxies in that part of the world um [noise] I Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided and of course as we\nSee is what I call the alliance of evil Russia and China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes through a variety of proxies not just the north Koreans in the Iranians but others\nI think all a era one is going to be one of those proxies to a certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you are in John Bolton supposition or you had the president's ear who knows maybe you do or what would you be advising have how ... how do we counteract this how do we get back from the brink of war\nI I Do believe that a boat and we will talk to his counterpart about uh you know renewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that it's in neither country's best interest to\nNot have a an agreement that isn't for civil the problem is and the Russians notice that a Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty was\nWas violated or with their own cruise missiles\nAnd uh you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or you know we've done a lot of in the open a so I think that will will get something I Know that\nYou know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July that yeah they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas\nAbout the fact that he can meet with the world's leader ah on the west Trump\nYou know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint so if I were both ... and ... you know I I've I've talked to John Bolton before and so I just\nI kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy\nAnd but he does have the president's year and I think that that's a that's going to be the top of the agenda and of course uh he'll probably try to deal with the issues in Syria and with air to won a fan of course uh the Iranians the Iranians are our problem for Israel\nUh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know those volumes of ...\nWe have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know those volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs [noise]\nUm we don't acknowledge a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up to no good\nIf there were to be regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that will come about by the Iranian people are just getting fed up with the situation with and chasing the mullahs out of there\nIf Iran were to become a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation [noise]\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the\nYou know the military and their diplomacy or you know for me to\nPromote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic world view of of the removal of when I I think that you find that they're not involved with the ... are not involved with Assad [noise] ah they're less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests\nAnd perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia Riyadh and tear on it's going to continue um but it ... if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his law in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas and\nYou know Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them or the Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another follow from that are positive aspect of that might be a\nLiberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nIn the news is in billings news don't Ninety five point by\n\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis is with us before we go to the phones are Bob let me ask you the last three years well projecting into next year the Trump Administration is earmarked proximate lead to point to a to point three billion dollars increase defense spending we had\nSeven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year in another seven hundred coming up this year\nA ... is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to the salaries and that's why people often say well gosh you know [noise] you know how can\nThe Russians and the Chinese be such an adversary and and competitive with us while they hide most of what they're spending on their own national security you know the answer is uh we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must cut five percent well we went through this quest ration period in which it just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight\nTo replace you know with your new aircraft for these antiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing with ships\nYou know it's an incredibly expensive\nTo have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of of something that a Ronald Reagan said you know this was obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested a furiously on all fronts by\nA both China and Russia especially\nContested a seriously on all fronts by\nA both China and Russia especially combined sewer forming a new alliance and so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustained the investment in long term capabilities\nUh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics and artificial intelligence or even in an investment in our our blue water navy uh\nUh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting it on our rights glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas Skinny Me good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast am\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the Chinese tapping our electronics for information well what I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed to an end date into all of these electronic chips\nSo that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future\nYou know it's it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nQuick question Steve is that possible Bob\n[noise] well I'm not an electronics uh no expert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern\nA and that's something that I think that uh Jim Mattis our defense secretary a is concerned about that things like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a programmable and reversible inundated\nElectronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nOr ships and it's and so forth and we\nCould find that this could be catastrophic so you know I I think there's plenty of caution today\nA there's a wakeup call across or certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that uh this is a very new world that we're facing and we have to be very careful of\nOf the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of um winter and um the U.S spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time\nUh I think it was maybe a near collision involved and and I'm I'm just I'm Wondering if that that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it was ... it was ... it landed there because of\nBeing hacked into somehow you know well\nYou know that's the sort of thing that we are very concerned about a cyber the battleground or the you know cyber as a woman before that I point out an alliance of evil and\nGo into great detail is two and not only the threat of taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that uh we hear about every day and this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the\nPresident's strategy and he says that there's\nA there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today a and yet you know there's so much we don't know so you know could somewhat take on an aircraft could take down a satellite takedown of Los Angeles\nI think all that is possible\nBut take on an aircraft could take down a satellite takedown of you know Los Angeles I think all that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and the capabilities to prevent this in place\nOne card line Dina's intent Ohio Don good evening good morning welcome to coast\nBrother Robert happy Sabbath a and lieutenant colonel I I really appreciate your service your patriotism and your wisdom during the meetings that you have do they ever consider the Bible prophecy of Daniel eight where America will attack Iran and destroy it\n[noise]\nYou'd have to remind me of ... and Daniel late where you're looking at dawn I'm you know I I understand perhaps where you're coming from a you know I I don't know that that's something that we would do unless we perceive that the threat was a against\nYou know our key allies and against our interests in those five it claims that you know the he go from the west will come upon the whole face the years there will not touch the ground\nAnd it'll to destroy the ram that has the two horns and said the the ladder horn is the bigger horn that comes up last than the first one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last one that comes up will be destroyed and claimed that no one will help\nIt says that you know a a nation that comes from the west will not touch the ground which means it's going to be unable or an air force\nAttack or Iran is you know a huge country and that and uh but it's also states that no one will come to her aid\nAh and I find that kind of interesting since it as you know alliances with were actually North Korea China and uh uh Russia\nAh so you know it's a and this is a dual application prophecy also uh I Know Alexander the great a Congress but he did not use\nOr anything but an infantry a probably a column a hundred and some yards wide they're not covered the whole earth as you know explain to you know this prophecy so ah and actually it also mentions that he goes I'm from the west will have her or has the wing husband eagle\nAnd are those wings will be blocked in I have to stand up as a man so uh I didn't know if the joint chiefs are considered any of those biblical prophecies in their uh\nUh you know summation of this whole incident over their\nGreat question Don Bob would say you\nKnow I I understand you know we're done is coming from the eagles certainly you know we like to think of as the United states and its it's used elsewhere even in revelation\nOr the possibility of interpreting and like that you know I I tend to you know shy away from\nA piece of Jesus and and going more in the direction of extra Jesus in terms of you know what's the context of that particular scripture [noise] I have not studied Daniel aid to the degree that Don or would you know benefit from an analysis of that so I I really can't answer the question though I\nWould say that yeah it's not my experience that our chiefs of the armed forces\nAre terribly a biblical illiterate and therefore are in tune with a Bible prophecy I'm not that they shouldn't be but I just don't get the sense that they are and certainly the material I read doesn't suggest that they have\nA Susan is on the wild card line and she's in Springfield,

before and uh the last caller\nA and it it it you know I'm [noise] I'm not a young person in a [noise] and I've been in this country and uh haven't went anywhere around the world at all I have never left the country and it seems extremely obvious to me\nThat uh something has happened to our government over the last fifty some years and it seems all the old and a lot of people think that uh\nUh you know they preach uh patriotism they preach uh uh you know go defend our our country's three I'm In a charm military\nUh in our military really is and our military anymore as far as I'm concerned it seems obvious that we're not really in control of our government anymore it seems very um yes and uh it seems like a [noise]\nPeople is a you know I Am a course of the younger people don't really you know remember America is it was you know in the fifties and sixties\nAnd uh they've lost touch with you know would they didn't lose touch it just it was it was never a savvy to them or what came

something about ending the draft yeah will\nDraft shouldn't be ended the draft should be reinstated as what I'm really saying that one of them but I mean here's the problem where do you think oh about ...\nAnd I don't want him last year it seems to me I'm American never been out of the country I was raised in Indiana\nAnd you know in the middle of this country why should I feel this way Kennedy was shot dead when I was maybe ten years old I remember that\nI was Catholic of course I was that was a direct assault\nOn or you know a on me in the program\nAnd all the uh nine eleven ...\nYou know a Richard wants to leave me alone\nHere said you're fading out on me again Tom so I'm I'm Sorry I'm going to have to respond but then I'm gonna have to want to thank you for the call [noise] well\nBefore Kennedy was McKinley and there was Garfield and there was Lincoln and there were multiple attempts on other presidents um I don't know that that certainly something changed since Kennedy\nUm\nBut has much changed I think once the United states\nAre sort of grew up in matured and became a major player certainly after the civil war or after the first World War and began to engage in multilateral\nA trade organizations and ah he did all of those things that some of the founding fathers sort of warning against foreign entanglements I think is what they called they called it a\n... these sorts of\nUm\nGames dirty wars and so forth are almost inevitable when you become entangled in in uh in other countries' business and and\nYou put yourself out there or you end up fighting wars on foreign lands so that those wars don't visit upon your own soil\nAnd yes it's it's nasty and it's dirty but one thing that the United states has I think that most other countries don't have and that is the power of redemption\nAnd I'm I'm a Canadian so I'm a bit of an inch or low over but I have strong emotional ties to the United states and I believe strongly in the idea of the United states and I believe in American exceptionalism it hasn't been fulfilled perhaps the way we'd like it but the United states yes\nThey they have been involved if you talk about a lend day in Chile and the overthrow the government in ... in Iran and in in the in Nineteen fifty three and in Guatemala and so forth\n[noise] just doesn't this isn't ... to the United states most other countries that have the kind of a power and responsibility at the United states has they do the same thing but they don't reflect\nLet me at the United states has to do the same thing but they\nDon't reflect upon those so it was dark chapters in their history the way the United states does they don't talk about it on public forums they can't they're not allowed and there is no redemption at least in the United\nStates that exists\nWe reflect we right we Sean and we try to make ourselves better and I think we should all be thankful for that Tom thank you for your call\nA Doug is east of the Rockies in the great state of New Jersey Doug welcome\nThank you very much our either through everything I'm well thank you\nI'm Glad to hear that I'm going to go a little bit off topic here um I tried to get married some time ago a there was a guest host and such as yourself\nAnd uh they were talking about our climate change in a warming and are very rising over the ocean now I'm not a a you're not going to go either way with the\nPro or con on a global warning or anything like that but ah they're talking about how the season the oceans are rising which uh that is the fact that it was a measure of all they can tell that\nBut I was wondering I've never heard anybody take into consideration water displacement\nEvery year we put billions upon billions upon billions of vessels in the water whether they be military whether it be giant a mall tie a million dollar a cruise ships\nSubmarines we're sinking um subways out here on the east coast to make artificial reefs were sinking old military\nNow this is taking up space and uh I Know that Hawaii has been having a volcano that has a stop for some time and that's also taken A L all about taking of water but it's adding land\nAnd uh I I think if a if anybody a you know of or any of the guests that you've a hat on or hurt speak about this uh ever brought up the theory of water this place [noise]\n[noise] uh no not that I'm I'm aware of um I I think the type of sea level rise that they're talking about is about you know the the the the ice melting that's in the water because\nYou know what happens when when ice cubes melt in a glass of water doesn't overflow\nI'm Talking about bits of ice shelves breaking off and so forth but\nWater levels sea levels have been rising for a very long time\nOr we were in that\nKind of a trans glacial period we're coming out of an ice age we're still technically in the United states and we have ice in the north and south poles we always we haven't always had I used to the north and south poles so\nUses didn't billings news talk Ninety five point five [noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back the coast to coast am we're talking near death experiences and much more jarring are open lines the segment let's go to Dan in great falls Washington hey Dan welcome good morning\nKnow Richard yes but then there there are many days ... days my ailments\nAre or many and um I had it in the ... or something very important\nAll right what did you see I\nSaw a guy that but one thing I've ever been so much\nAnd I went through or damage of emotions are listening to music eighties even a rather low fat and I were to pitch or the two little girls I have my wall there that can be from saint Jude belong do great the a rural area\nAnd they looked at them and I just kind of broke down and I've never been a very Christian a whole life I've never been able to handle the pain of the like you have long all day to me and\nEven though I never I uh that's terrible well probably what I said father as a picture of the other the little ones and not suffering more of this and not go on ... ... ... this was going to go on for years and decades and decades hundreds of years\nAnd I said it can't go on\nAnd I felt the promise I looked at the pitcher I couldn't believe it either mildly they smiled and the father was saying to me it's not going to go on\nYeah if people just don't know that it's going to end very soon that they are they're going to be standing in place when you actually you're going to be standing well laying are sitting in their place\nAnd uh they're not going to know that this comes upon them if they're not ready for me\nAnd um that's that's what's coming up my end or\nAn outlet ... I'm barely I Believe like a C spend the night ... like a seat in the night\nOr twenty five years and one\nWas never diagnosed with HIV I was one of those I was lucky that I've been a long flight last long but when I went in with the doctors didn't say you have HIV they said I went and like not feeling good and they said you age\nAnd I said you know probably about a bigger yeah that's what you have

think it ties into geopolitics it's going on today and I really do believe that maniacs\nAnd I I don't want to use the cliche of the deep state I Would call him\nA I Would call them the maniacal money pours I can tell you that on line the ... maniacal money horrors of the world they're going to bring that about because they have said China and Russia to hold outs\nIran of course the satellite state and they've said you are going to get bogged down to us\nAnd you are going to accept our way you're going to accept or corporations and all of our norms\nAre those are going to be a war and\nCalled me

five Nineteen eighty seven he ended the game getting people to three hundred and sixteen\nYears ago the ... in the baseball and yes he is in\nN G A set of continuing on and that in that realm he was on the pitchers man I Believe one game and he saw someone struggling ... in the in the stands\nI'm not sure whether they were having grass and he was getting ready to sign on ... got a pet

gym he played the team and and they mocked him every every place they go up to bat the plague hallelujah chorus music they show him on the scoreboard crying when he cried when he lost the Alabama\nIn the in the playoff game I guess and he also the issue of the river dogs people will revert to black patches and the guy jumping over him you know marketing John three sixteen the bottle the what happened later in that year people last like two or three of those games I Believe\nThe later in the year when the big thing was when they were winning three games to two or whatever all of a sudden they lost the third game in the fourth game and the Astros win it instead of them and so God remembers\nYou though that was more and more and more important than the other\nThing with people on the

Lewis you are listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\n\n\nThere was a ... guys the expert by the name of Dr Allen Robert George oh and then he created a group called the Toronto society ... a ... a ... a cyclical research and um\nThere are eight people in the group and Dr Owens wife was involved there was an industrial designer to counter housewife a bookkeeper and associate sociology student and so ah there was a psychologist by name of Dr Joel Wit and who also tend to many of the experiments as an observer well\nThis experiment was known as the Philip experiment and it was a film I Believe that uh did this experiment happened in Nineteen Seventy two what had happened is they created a fictional historical character\nAh they pulled facts out of thin air to attach to this guy this physical ... this this fictional character and then basically they gave it to the study group okay they had an a or they they handed him a biography and they said that\nHe was like the seventeenth century English noble man who was very beautiful it cold and unfriendly wife and then one day you ran into a beautiful gypsy girl named Margot and they fell in love and and so\nYou know they were trying to keep their love a secret but of course the secrets go it didn't last forever because his wife Dorothy up found out about Margot and accused her of witchcraft\nOkay so\nFilled was worried about his reputation he didn't protests the idea of Margot being a witch and that resulted in her being burned at the state can event later was stricken with remorse in which the only way you could deal with it was to fight in some battle and then one morning he was found dead on the battlefield\nAnd the guy Phillip or Philip veils for words what his name was he was no more well the only group\nThey didn't stop at a biography or one of the members sketched a portrait of them they they it was this whole thing with their imagination they created this character this Philip guy and\nSo they got immersed in that character they started making up a mythology about him and they acted as though he was real I mean they they thought him up they thought he was real and they literally were trying to conjure this guy\nSo for months for months they would you say on is trying to find this guy this Philip character\nAnd what they were doing is they were trying to trying to actually demonstrate how the mind has the power to conjure\nSomething out of thin air whether it be an imaginary goes to it'd be a real entity that may be in the subconscious right so for months they didn't get any contact with a ghost name\nImaginary goes to it would be a real entity that maybe in the subconscious right so for months they didn't get any contact with a ghost named Phillip and then one day during a say on\nAn entity came through whose name was filling\nIn each terrorize the group of scientists with a few aggression boost you would move furniture around because of like light bulbs to explode he would pound loudly on the doors\nAnd so um there was a documentary that was made on the experiment um we never saw fill up but we got to see what his powers could do\nSome claim that what the experiment was proving is that goes do not exist and they simply are created by our minds but know what was lost on everybody was the remarkable probability that you can actually thinks something into reality that means that magic\nOr causal engineering whatever I call it it's not a fallacy okay what we might might have as an idea\nYou're taking idea and you empower it you magnify it your released into the ether and then if the mind brings will chew it to fire it up\nYou can well we can conclude that they are all sorts of reality is behind it simply imploding all around us but then in front of us is the reality and that's a reality we know just be on their feet but this is a great world of esoteric and strange things\nAnd it's hard to explain to people unfamiliar\nBut there are some that are smarter than others and there were some that know how to walk in the multiverse and it's hard to describe the multi verse and then you get into this bridge your bridging this area between what is reality in with his witchcraft\nWhenever the subject of witchcraft comes up or even sorcery there are many people who already presume but at the core of all witchcraft or sorcery is a demon or devil this cast a curse into the ether simple magic\nSymbol magic and the use of power brought in by the natural elements that have been around for thousands of years um I Know that there are many opinions that fly and there's considerable\nDivision among people relatives of the term which\nAnd suddenly acquainted with the devil or should the devil worship they equated with daemon conjuring which of course has been done by the ... of those reading the abyss however there are many other forms of magic in which ... which some would want to employ to describe the workings of angels\nThat lately there have been depictions of good which is like in Harry Potter you know Harry Potter fighting against the evil which is that are led by an evil wizard named Baltimore there's also a new movie called a house with clocks in the walls were there which is to an air fighting evil which is so they're the good which is probably to eat what you see in the middle ages in Europe there were\nOr there was great activity in witchcraft in conjuring and then came a time\nWhen the pope's\nTook cognizant of the practices towards the lame in the church and the outsiders were practicing and condemned it because certain functions rituals and ceremonies were generally reserved for the priesthood\nSo no you couldn't be practicing what they called priesthood that was witchcraft\nThe earliest settlers of America the Spanish English Dutch Swedes French and Germans all had a working knowledge generally speaking of religious backgrounds especially respecting good and bad angels in witches and most of the books brought to America\nWherever religious\nA lot more about witchcraft I mean having of course general rules for the religious behavior of course but uh but the idea of using moral and civil\nBehaviors when the bridge with things like witchcraft\nNow the Bible\nWas the staple in religion and the Puritans came to the United states by was brought over from the from there to the United states the old myth is though that these pilgrims or whoever they were were only seeking religious freedom as if they were being persecuted for their belief in God\nThe truth is that there were the puritan settlers that were religious fanatics and of course there were those who practice folk magic alongside those who favor a traditional Christianity\nAnd the thing that would surprise most Americans is is that before the settlement at Plymouth\nThere was a settlement of Jamestown where it was believed that the small group of newly formed secret societies actually were coming to America to establish world order in America\nAnd the founders of Jamestown had thoroughly well they have different values than the Puritans and the separatists pilgrims many perform a sonic rituals and conducted magical ceremonies while still participating in Christian right\nThere may suddenly beliefs indelibly shaped American culture and America's future\nLike today they're they're like do they ... you know where we have a ... a polarization of the people are division there were the same polarization divisions than they were the people of the villages which consisted mostly the poor farmers and then we had the lead masons were emergency bankers\nOkay and the merchants are the merchants than the bankers prospered alive they made a lot of money kept making money which created this schism where many believe that if you were if you were actually prospering\nBecause this was going to get some puritan faith in that you were in league with the devil said the puritan pilgrims lumping them because they despise King James and yet we're told that many Christians\nThe pilgrim principles and their religious freedoms or based on\nPrecepts detail in the king James Bible that's a myth because when James the first became king of England eight at actually sixty three there were two translations of the Bible and use the Geneva Bible was the most popular and the bishop's Bible was the one that was used for reading and churches and the Puritans were intolerable zealots\nAnd created all sorts of nasty conspiracy theories about the new settlements including the conspiracy\nAbout which is that that were used to gain power and destroy the secret societies that were said to be the work with the devil\nDoing Christian fundamentalists wants to defend the political and spirituality a bit of a new called aspects of the United states\nThey often refer to America's a Judeo Christian nation basically a nation build on Judeo Christian principles but they tend to forget\nThat when America was being established when the colonies were being founded by a puritan pilgrims at Plymouth or sequence decided odious from Jamestown or whatever Judeo Christian values were just barely being defined and the Bible that most Christians believed in hadn't even been written yet\nSo the old time conception of what may have happened didn't happen the way we think\nAnd there was a lot of magic and a lot of myths and a lot of conjuring and a lot of powers or\nBeing utilized in order to establish the United states of America [noise] so we are a country that's deep rooted in conspiracy\nDeep rooted in prayer deep rooted in the supernatural and deep rooted in magic whether it be good bad\nOrthodoxy or an orthodoxy we are what America is and our

I mean the early saints like St bonnet base in St Patrick and all the others they're all carrying that Britain the bishops crook which is another passionate that where it's kind of got a curled top but that was because of the early Christian missions missionaries\nInto Europe it didn't particularly northern and Western Europe half to ... to stop all this time with them in order to share their spiritual authority as a whole ... now what I found\nThis Pope Francis guy has is it looks it looks particularly ancient\nIt looks particularly at ... at unrealistic and I'm half of me is wondering if there's some kind of real style for when\nThe the early church a massacre in pagan in Europe and if there's some kind of symbolic gesture in his whipping out this thing with is\nThis you know Arden style is true it it's a ... it's a very strange picture and it's um it's a very strange event eh water see up to age that very strange poll I it's hard to say\nI Know it ... I I see that and I and I saw that immediately and I recognize it as a cult\nOr which is stay but it was it was certainly something that a reminded me of Gandalf\nA in lord of the rings or or one of the other uh\nWizards at the time holding the staying with the ... but I saw the nailed for me I thought oh my God this is a representation of the fellows penetrating\nAh basically it's about ... it's about uh the male or female divine feminine being pushed by the mail and and what we're seeing now in as you said earlier about the witches and the rising of which is the nature of power if for some reason politically we have this gender fight\nBetween the power there's even a TV show called up American horror\nStory we're right now but the fight happening in the TV show is between witches and war locks and whether or not a character by the name of Michael he's the Supreme which or the anti Christ said it's amazing fight because the witches are fighting amongst each other\nAs to who was about to lead and we have the same problem now with the which is they want to curse Kavanaugh and we have the Catholic Church coming forward and say well we're going to reverse this person it's like\nA witchcraft now is is being a actually is having a renaissance\n\nThomas that's a good point I never thought about that one and you hear me okay I can hear you fine thank you yeah go ahead can you hear me uh-huh yeah yeah I never yeah that's an interesting point I never thought about that and the thing is that this witchcraft\nThat we're seeing like in Brooklyn tomorrow and so on it's not it doesn't come from a healthy place it doesn't come from\nA a desire to restore feminine feminine power [noise] it doesn't come from that and in this much the same way that Hillary Clinton wasn't particularly a female president ... are in terms of how she operated herself and\nHer political life she was very much you know more like a mom so I I decided they're up to this being I think this is more desperation than actual\nOr a kind of at a ... a volcanic uprising of feminine power that's been repressed I don't see it that way at all I think ... I think it's more like a a desperation that that people they don't want to accept that\nThe world is changing and they're not getting their way and I think they actually see this this idea of doing these magical rich goes away to sort of oh please make the world right please make the world right but I don't really work like that much doesn't work like that and if you're going against the laws of nature which is really what\nYou know what's happening here are the laws of the universe it it's a it's a dangerous game to play it's a very dangerous game to play you're you're actually trying to hold back the core of the ocean or a strong river by standing in an holding your hands off but it's not going to happen\nNow what you're referring to when Thomas is referring to is that tomorrow\nOr in Brooklyn are witches are planning to place a public hacks on Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd are on the invitation it says it says please join us for a public ... 'cause I'm Brett Kavanaugh upon all rapists and the patriarchy at large boulders rewards that protects them uh and in fact that says this will be done\nOn a waning moon and what's interesting is what I what I didn't find until much later after I did my notes for tonight they want to hurt him they want to make him suffer that is I mean\nWhen they were going to put a spell on Donald Trump's it's the same group by the way the same group who wanted to put a spell on Donald Trump was a binding spell this is a spell to literally hurt Brett Kavanaugh so what are the differences between dining spells and what they're planning on doing to Brett Kavanaugh\n\nA binding ... what is basically them saying well we'll just stop them from doing his work but it's a it's still black magic ... look\nThis is there anyone who's ever been involved in or did you and your cold if they're mature knows that the first rule is that you don't harm a person who has an armed you directly [noise] no and I said these people seem to think that he has attacked them somehow that\nBecause he is now the Supreme Court justice and and so on and there's this controversy about his background which was never proven one way or the other you cannot curse or hacks\nOur bind to Paris and who is not\nAttached you personally and by parents the adult men are we came out for me because I'm a woman or he came out because of the ... because I'm working class it's they\nWe pick on you by name by name I didn't know who you are to deliberately do us harm [noise] now I just as I wrote about in my book sorcery these kinds of things are are very extremely Davis for lots of reasons firstly if there's no\nJustification for direct justification for it it will it will blow back at the people doing it I mean I Would I Would like to see how many people who took part in the original Trump binding spelled who are\nNot on happening right now I Would imagine many of them their lives have probably been very badly damaged by it because Dan because again Trump didn't\nHarris me go out the damn let us all to another side to this and I ... I spoke about this in the book and it's very common and Scottish and Celtic folk law I Know there are places that one of the reasons you don't ... you don't\nYou don't curse bell blind\nOr sorry blind or heck someone is awesome pass on to their children people doing the no harm [noise] this is why it's so deeply on ethic alumnus so I have to wonder are these people doing it or not aware of the fact that this thing travels in families and secondly if they do\nKnow that it affects their children are are they ... me and wicked that are hoping to hurt\nCommunist children I mean 'cause this well this is potentially what they're doing here they can actually\nCause horrible things to half of the communist children and grandchildren and yet those people are innocent now if they're real that they understand magic and they noticed on the history of sorcery and next thing they know that that's what happens\nSo I'm I'm quite disturbed at the eater so stupid or so vicious that they don't care and they're gone ahead and doing this\nFor troubles me is that as we see the symbolism being brought forward by the pope\nAnd what you hear of women ganging together to cast a spell on cabinet this is the spell of harm other spell a binding\nAnd when we hear about this and then we hear a about a number of other women who have ah they're ah I guess anger and resentment among wanting a Trump and we hear that she was in a plane recently in the plane nearly crash or that it was having mechanical trouble these are things that terrified me because I'm thinking that if these powers are\nAre ah are being contradicted the thought forms are being created I mean we may be seeing some things will be put into play in the next few weeks that could really be damaging to the country as a whole and then we have a black magic and curses\nThat are backfiring and our weaponize they could really harm a great number of people not just the Kavanaugh has children\nWell I'm Glad you said that Clyde because this is this is like taking what's happening tomorrow very seriously and I'll tell you why [noise] one of the reasons you had\nSo much emigration from Europe to America a hundred and fifty or two hundred years ago is because quite literally rural areas in many parts of Europe or destroyed by everyone ... everyone else\nThat literally the communities fell apart\nAnd the only way they could actually escape these Texans was to go across it was literally emigrated to get away because they were traveling and families know traveling in and one of the family we had a grievance against another in the village of ... ... from you know all over Europe is a major problem and it's never talked about because that's the damage just those\n... ... ... ... what's happening right now could create a male strong of psychic attacks now anyone has ever experience as a psychic attack knows exactly what it feels like now these people are hoping on some level at the very least to\nImplement a psychic attack upon cabinet and the Trump Administration to people who support them but the things that they have this is this is not\nIt's like a tax upon cabinet and the Trump Administration to people who support them but the things\nThat they have this is a is not that there's just not specifically directed weapon [noise] this is the kind of a thing that\nBlows up like a nuclear weapon and flies all over the place and causes on told her mother specially to\nDo the ability to actually and integrate reality as president as president state\nIt can actually damage reality it could actually leads to things like complete social breakdown I wouldn't be surprised in the past and it's led the civil wars and things like this and it's you know and then it's all happening at the same time that we have the NPT seemed mean coming out I think\nI have to commend your show Clyde because you guys have popped into something something profound is going on right now at this moment and day at\n... like you said watch watch just watch the bigger picture look at what's going on the world and tried to read the science because we really are living in a time of ethics and Assad is at the moment and where it's going to go I don't know but I Am afraid that some kind of A M\nLogical ed\nInconsistency coping with incompetence coupled with a lot of press anger could lead to something very dangerous and we've got to watch and read the psychic weather over the next few months as well as you guys have been doing it [noise] I I was there showing up unimpressed them for a while\nWell we have and uh and then and then it because I have to dig deeper than what we see on the surface to try and figure out [noise] you know you first you you analyze the political venue out alive\nOr what may be going on within the political and if you cannot make heads or tails out what's going on I Can't connect the dots\nOn a more I guess you'd call logical contemporary level you have to dig deeper into the rabbit hole and realized that maybe something is being conjured from the deepest darkest up to be a bit and that they're trying to create these thought forms to confuse and as we said last\nNight what little glitch in the matrix watch Big Love Chaffetz the aisle people react and how they react to trauma from a his motivator fear is what will motivate people in the anger anger will motivate people into killing one another and this is what I worry about this is what I'm terrified of\nA war footing but it's for me it's a new war a new type of war which utilizes for violence and cyber power\nThe idea of a of a psychic\nWarfare with the physical warfare Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred movie by [noise] you're listening to news talk and I'd be five point five [noise]", "show_name":
