at the foot of the casket because that's usually where the ... family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects\nAnd so anything that said they can hear because they're very very nosy and as to what people are saying about them or how they look or you know they they like to know that stuff and but in the last seven or eight years\nThis business where the IRS table set off to the side with all these photos in and\nTheir life in pictures and if there's a group of people standing around by those pictures than the spirit will go over there and listen to what they're saying and it's funny because I've already been there where a man said see that lady with that had on over there I said yep\nHe said well she's saying that that picture happened when we were in Missouri she's at her mind we weren't in Missouri when that happened we were in Pennsylvania\nAnd it's like okay you know I'm not going to go argue with your

and I told them why was and he said I bet my daughter bounds you she would find somebody crazy like you\nAnd I'm thinking okay and so I said well I said yes your daughter did call me and he says I met my son doesn't know anything about this and I said to the to the daughter I said does your brother in law you called me she says oh yeah he's really into this and I just sort of looked him you'd rather and\nGave him aside law and so he said will call my son over half recall my son over so he says to me tell my son to go home right now that my brother bill is in my basement trying to break open my gun cabinet\nOh boy and I\nLooked at him and I said now you're telling a crazy person that I mean you know he called me crazy\nWas it was rather than try to do so when are\nWe just wanted the

right on ... yeah [noise] so\nIt it's interesting when things like that happened or were they telling me were money hidden or a I Can't tell you how many gifts I've found for wives that the husbands died right before their birthday\nOr an anniversary and you know it's like look in this covered in his shoe box you gonna find a really pretty necklace that he's out for you you\nYou give them closure\nI Do I Do and if you think about it you know it would've been really nice to talk to a couple of your loved ones before and you couldn't do it anymore and I think people like that and it's not always wears the key to the safety deposit box a lot of times it is but not all the time\nWhen a when you're dealing with the siege how many of them are generally known but their debt\nEvery one of them how do you not come out of your body and look down in your spirit leads the body and look down and go holy smokes I Am dead\nSo they're not in denial\nThey are not and I know there's some\nPsychic sent me the and say that they don't know they're dead but I mean the middle of that you don't know how do you not know usually I I Would agree with you yeah nine million do\nThis now I'm not saying they're happy about it but the death I don't really know that they're dead\nYou know not everybody who dies moves on thinking this was all fun and games ha ha I'm dead and I'm going to happen it's gotta be depressing even for some of the ah the deceased I Would guess\nWell it's adds a lot of them are set because they think that they won't be able to see what's going on with their family or watch their grandchildren grow up and it's like no no no no no once you go into the light you can come back and forth\nYou're not gonna miss anything plus the fact there's proof of that\nBecause if you take pictures and you'll get orb send pictures perfectly round circles they can be a little they can be big they can be any color they can be sparkly\nThose stairs that have

don't like you why don't you\nMove you know look at it this way if I said to you George tomorrow morning at ten o'clock I'm going to have some minor surgery say a prayer for me I Will say a prayer for you\nExactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen Everytime she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't debt debt\nNow can that person one realize this is happening to them and to fight\nIt off [noise] they can eventually but remember calmer you know be careful who you credit for a while under the bus ... you never know what\nGoes around comes around that's true right but I mean the the recipient of the curse for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI think if it's done with enough intent or if you actually go to someone for his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody\nThey pretty much know it easily the three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one two or all three of them and and no particular order\nIs health money or relationships\nAnd you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problems dating and you always had a good time and all of a sudden now you're going out with a new person after the second date is\nIts own right down the toilet so something's going on but if you\nYou know if you go to somebody like me or you look at my one book that he has the instructions and how to remove negative energy once that's taken off ... and anybody can remove negative energy

something do they see I think someone put a curse on me\nWell when things started going bad and you don't feel good or your relationships go down to to where you lose your job and you can find a job um then they start thinking that's when you hear on the born loser I must have a cloud over my head [noise] uh if I didn't have bad luck I wouldn't have any luck and\nPeople don't realize that especially if everything was going fine in their life or normal in their life\nAnd everything that's going down the tubes and eventually they figure it out or they go to somebody or somebody that they know go cheap but Heather fish rotten\nLuck for the last year what the heck's wrong when they start thinking about it and like I said it you know what nobody have to live like that you don't have to be a martyr\nSomething about it have it removed it's not hard to\nDo you can do it and it is long and you know ... actually a person doesn't even believe they have a curse than him and I tell them that they do\nSit down in front of me I'll take this off of you they don't even have to believe that all they had to do is give me their permission my\nGrand daughter got a promotion where she was working and uh apparently she got a promotion over somebody who saw they were entitled to that job and she did it fair and square and you know decent and everything she's bright girl\nAnd strange things started happening to her I mean things that would always go well\nThings were really kinda screwed up\nAnd she called me up one day and said papa ... I think somebody put a curse on me and and I said Ari let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you I mean you're in good fun person you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over\nAnd I went oh huh and I said oh look couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes and sure enough it ended up being the person oh who apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine\nOr stop sending negative energy to her a war off right exactly\nSo my question is when someone does get hit by a curves mhm how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who put the curse on them\nThat's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is um [noise] did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words that you have an affair with a married person believe\nYou me a woman you know ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to find somebody in the nose a woman gets angry at somebody ... women meaner than men she's gonna curse that person and\nIt was a woman gets angry at somebody ... women meaner than men she's gonna curse that person and because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens\nAnd but the bottom line is this who cares who did it just get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself you have to call Murray and when ... how do you get at all\nNope you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and again they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and in ... when go speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nYou use every body susceptible to curse what about someone who's got so much energy positivity and they put up for ... for you to kind of block it and she you\nKnow unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that may be has to be do something at every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were first\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed most people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have a curse removed off of them again it does not affect them\nAs a matter of fact think about the ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's a game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York\nAnd so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time there best hitter gets up the whole stadium is going oh would lose you jerk don't hit the ball given out and then they clap as he does it make it an energy thrown on that person's\nOh yeah absolutely and that's why the home team is an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on the airplane to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's gonna be added on every other stadium that is not his home stadium\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players\nWill her ... let's say a really\nGood a slum or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time and the other thing too it's especially ballplayers\nLook the dead fans that goes that

later\nI think they did read it in their house dead rats gee yes\nAnd he died from the extreme trauma he smashed flat it's somebody dumped game and there's rat sir Yes sir his just flown all over the place\nIn the house in the house and he died from the most extreme trauma who would have ... who would have squashed him\nI Can't I I don't know charge and less for a second cat a\nNo cat witness squashed rap like that I just don't\nThe algorithm maybe it started out with a cat slip than while I flipped out for a minute and I can't might have flip thing killed him\nHe would have taken him with him though\nI just don't think that's weird\nAny you got some strange things happening over there\nYes it has been for a long time in the foot steps up stairs in the air when all three of life mama grandma and me I was sitting here and we all heard the first steps up stairs\nWhile you know a lot of people hear footsteps like that strange things Tom thinks is houses haunted he says he your stuff that will go there and in Frankfurt Kentucky used to the Rockies am\nHow am I joined Murkowski and I'm going to say that even though I Know judge Kavanaugh not going to be on the court okay\nProbably outlined though I Am I Believe he well and I'm going to make\nA deal with um [noise] I saw a lot of mess representation and deception on both sides\nAnd he\nWasn't there and joined in on some of that and manipulation\nAnd therefore I'm hoping that he will do what king Solomon dead and pray for wisdom and learn to love the church so much that he could never\nJoined in any kind of manipulation of the truth he will learn to love the truth so much that maybe someday you'll be as great a justice on the brink cart as judge Judy could be\nAn interesting take 'em all of that would you vote for him\n[noise] I Would have to do they do like Murkowski a he's not ready he might he might someday be that great if we ever had on for\nHe may he may end up with that indeed\nYou might do that as well because uh he's been through a lot but some voters Saturday we'll find out tomorrow what's going on a Sunday night I'll be doing the program and we've got Dr John Kurdish and Howard Bloom reacting in

the the world is pretty pretty insane right now\nI've noticed she really seems to be out of control doesn't it uh you know I\nI just kind of want to say I I was listening earlier and I was just wanting to say um we just need to really mellow out [laughter]\n[laughter] we really do there there's just so much negativity and\nMuch pressure in culture right now that I I think it's just feeding this kind of\nMass anxiety and um maybe that's part of what what um you know I'll be talking about tonight with with the tower oh because uh uh tools like a narrow cards or believe it or not [laughter]\nUm are very very helpful for remembering who we are and I'm letting go of all of the [noise]\nA leash and programming constructions and opinions and a cultural biases and all of that it's it's a way of suspending all of that stuff [noise]\nAnd taking a deep breath and receiving um\nPictures that come to us from a really a mysterious place nobody knows the origin\nOf the courage to tell you the truth we know some things about it [noise] it ultimately the tower is a mystery we know that it it it descends from ancient mystery schools and a ancient wisdom that it has been called the perennial philosophy [noise]\nUm but there is something a universally relevant for everyone in the ...\nHow far back as we've been able to track the terrible\nUh Thirteen Ninety I Believe is the earliest evidence or fourteen twenty is the first full jak that we know about in the accounting and\nRenaissance but no one knows who the first desire was actually [noise] and I I really like that I think it's part of what tarot is ultimately it's it comes from the human imagination\nMaybe it was given to us from a Bob\nUh from above or from beyond or below [laughter] below or within and you know I'm a union psychologist\nSo ah we've then is the place that I look\nLet's explain to people who probably knew what it looks like what they might not know exactly what it is\nUm it's a tool for self exploration it comes out of the Italian Renaissance um it's not it was not brought a\nTo Europe by the gypsies as is often miss misinformed\nOr actually the gypsies chain quite a bit after the first tarot decks uh started to emerge a in Italy and Spain um other places in Europe\nUh it is a deck of cards um and uh in in some ways it's it's not clear which came first the playing cards at the terror of cards and actually\nIf you think of a standard set of playing cards that is equivalent roughly to what's called\nThe minor are Connor of the tomorrow\nThe terrible has an additional twenty two cards\nThat is called the major are coming up and these are the cards um that people commonly uh think of when they think of tarot cards you know they have they have the magician\nRyan gold card a fool and wheel\nOf fortune and things like that\nAnd that's your favorite car George yes it is [laughter] see her because I'm fascinated by it\nKnow I Know you are and it is it is an extremely a beautiful card the jets card as is the devil card\nAnd the tower ... usually three cards which people think are the most uh uncomfortable parts of the major are coming up but every card in the tower deck has a positive and negative aspect\nI'm In the modern tarot which is really my forte um has really moved since uh you know ... it can vary a cult oriented in the\nUh nineteenth and a early twentieth century in England with the society of the Golden Dawn and that's where the modern tarot really was birds with the uh weight jak or the Arthur weight back the right away\nWhat uh what

[noise] now I think that's a this is a we have to take a break their stopped there the guy had because this is a this is where it gets even more interesting and we're we're we're just basically this is basic fed ...\nIf you draw a line from each of the corners\nGives you the ... the six sided star the allies to end the mega it is also the\nSymbol of lead it is the ... of Saturn the star of David and this is a combination Clyde of male and female energy it's a combination of fire and water the fallacy of the challenges and so\nIt is the goal of the outcome is to transform the base metal led into gold or to slay the great niece and achieve in late ... through this trans mutation and so what all this means\nIs the base metal is the base shock rough and through that rising of consciousness that some called the ...\nStudents are able to transmit led into gold notice the crown shock right and the rise of this consciousness is the movement of the solar spirit through the sevens fears or gates of the classical planets from beginning to end alpha and omega and it is the distortion\nOf this power that suppresses man so that there are those things those entities those things we talk about collide those\nParasites that feed like empires off of the depravity right and I think as you were talking about earlier on on Alex Jones a show I think that is what is suppressing mankind and we are being suppressed from this understanding and that's why what we see these types of things in movies and TV and entertainment\nWe give our attention and energy to it but we see distorted versions of it and\nWe're scared of things like the Pentagon were scared of things that otherwise are very powerful symbol that could help to break the constraints that this system has over our mind body and soul\nOr many of these symbols have been associated with that even the cross is associated with that but the the the the Cuba's associate with that I miss go is associated with that but yet all of these deaths symbols have always had their connections to life is I was talking while I was actually relating in my article I said isn't it interesting that Salvador Dali Nineteen fifty four\nDid a a a painting called crucifixion corpus hyper Cuba X or hybrid harbor coup for Cuba is\nAnd in it he basically hung what looked like a a you know is it is the fiction of Christ and across the cross was a ... but it was a cubic cross it wasn't a a regular crossword showed the\nDimensions of the cube and if you look at a word to cross was in in a relationship to history it was on a show called calvary\nAnd Calgary was representation lacrosse now and then the skull and as I was reading on I realized that the school they're talking about a calorie is the scope of Goliath and Goliath was in ...\nAnd then not only was the descendant of the dark of the of the fallen angels and so when he said that Christ was on the cross in the school was below speed he literally bruised the head of the descendants of the fallen ones\nAnd and so ah the symbols of the cross the cube the skull all of them are sacred symbols that have been perverted and distorted over the over time\nAnd the cross also if you turn it sideways you get the ax and what the axis is a combination\nSure either of the upside down and the upright triangle which is the male and female and the scholar and bones interestingly enough if you look at where that comes from it comes from the temp blurs many temp players were buried and since\nThey were buried in smaller ... the bones would be taking the thigh bones and they'd be placed up near the Gulf so you'd have a skull and you'd have the crossbones the Johnny ...\n... and when the ... than to Templar began robbing British ships they flew the skull and bones as a symbol of death and in Scotland bones at Yale University and the frame of sonic order\nThey use the skeleton they use spell and bones but it's not a worshipping of death it's actually a very humbling usage of the symbolism because it's a reminder to live life morally to live life well the debt that the around the corner so it's not an evil symbol as you said right into it\nIf not ... it's symbolic though of of how\nBoth the uh the sacred and the profane come together and confusion and with the confusion comes division and were division comes perversion and this is why I think it's important to be symbols are as as they're showing themselves now they're giving in syndication of and like I said on our show the show today I said it's giving us an indication\nOf a war footing and we don't know of his brinkmanship lead over saber rattling but it's certainly a war or division of some kind that would certainly bring turmoil for at least\nMaybe who knows how long but uh it just seems that we are in a time of tension and we need to rely on prophecy would need to rely on ah the numbers the symbols and and use them as a I guess you could call them ... to find a way out of this darkness\nYeah and it's interesting because I read through your your your introduction your monologue and I was thinking about what you were writing in there and also what you said today earlier on the radio and I've said this for many years institutional religion promises us salvation through fate\nInstitutional science likewise promises a salvation through faith the more specifically salvation through technology and it seems to be no matter where we look for salvation we're always looking externally we're looking for a vicarious atonement there external means\nAnd then the essence of the mysteries the cult teaching the esoteric teaching the secret teachings\nThat focuses on the elevation of the soul spirit for materialism to God has them if you will trans mutation and it does that internally because for example science is the study and structure of the physical world so when you say someone is anti science\nIt's not the same kind of science as mainstream orthodoxy because mythology for example is a form of science all the branches of mythology all the symbols all the character types all the arc types\nAll those methodologies are just ... from a single source is what is called a complex polytheism all of the different gods and goddesses\nAre really branches of the same tree and because of that Clyde if we define the word life I always found this interesting life\nIs defined as the capacity for growth reproduction functional activity and continue will change proceeding death\nBy that definition fire air water earth all are alive and they were all given\nCharacteristics and the form of the salamander this lift the ending in the no right and the mythological characters quite as I'm sure you know have just been carried over today in the science nitrogen oxygen hydrogen and carbon\nOnce again we go back to the carbon base of mankind's these protons sixth neutrons six electrons which of course the numbers\nTo sixteen the number of God the numbers cube the number of demand the number of the beast and the number of the false prophet all of these things come together and we need to pay attention to these numbers and symbols and we need to use them for good rather than perverting them for the evil and about in the world\nEssence of all of the mystery schools and all the secret teachings before they were perverted by those same sources that today promises salvation through technology through faith or some external beans that further traps the sole spirit in the material world in the black cube\nAnd using it it was like he was a metaphor for space the metaphor for the universe the metaphor of of the city of God even ah we we neglected that we we talked about the war we talked about all these other things that we see in science fiction but the city of God you must remember is a Cuba\nAnd and the and the symbol ah represents a destruction in some regard and rebuilding in genesis and another so the re genesis rebuilding after the destruction is the most important theme of all the resurrection envy coming together\nDeath and then the resurrection of coming together and the ... refurbishing and renewing and and paradise if you will as the promise that will be with all the numbers as they create the sum total of all things in the universe\nAnd Saturn is a God of destruction but it isn't necessary destruction and a necessary evil the stories and mythology of Saturn sitting in the field and\nWatching a flower die but once the flower dies Saturn makes room for more flowers to bloom and blossom now that is a necessary evil however I think like many people have hijacked\nThat concept they have hijacked that idea and they have applied those ideas through science and through many other means\nSo that what is natural has been made into something synthetic and so as you were saying earlier that's why I don't want to say scientists but that's why the engineers and the scientists behind things like AI\nContinue Ford despite all the warnings even within their own community because they are playing God they want to be Saturn but they are not a Saturn that will decide what lives and dies to bring about new life it is a Saturn that decides I Will live and everybody else will be subservient to me that and that is and\nThat is true and and you know a lot of people don't realize that when we are approaching Halloween and we approached Thanksgiving we approach the feast of the winter and of course Christmas\nAll of those holidays it will actually the new year Christmas uh not withstanding with all the holidays combined or what we're actually the holidays is the sad and return meaning the gods Saturn arrives and tries to\nRemove some of the wheat from the chaff and the ones who survive are the ones to celebrate the new year and that was the whole purpose of the Saturn return [noise]\nThose are the holy day the holidays and that's where we get as you said Christmas ... a celebration of Saturn Saturn's also a fertility got kind of like ball or bell right and I think one of the things that's very very simple and important to recognize about all of the things that we talk about ...\nOr that yes a character like Saturn is a symbol of death and destruction right but again it's a necessary evil it's unnecessary destruction and there are those that\nTV phone at a two

foundation of credibility especially when we're talking about something as complex is of course the school welcome back Dr Bennett and we're glad to have you on the program a so\nYou have written a crystal skull guides you are written books on how to interact with the crystal skulls how do you expand your consciousness with these crystal skulls or what what is it that they bring to the table\nOr that that the key question isn't it yeah [laughter]\nWell we basically when you look at it costs that go back to the courts or because that\nBegan to say that for ... for the material the court system most powerful ... calls all our ... it has the ... the rain so frequent says and is not by coincidence that of course also technology is using ... is a key point\n[noise] and when you look at\nWhat the court is doing to people and our days we can measure the effects of holding ... call all the different energy systems black potential difference on what you can you can look at many different changes in the system and then it turns out that just holding court\nWith attention because they he it'd be called back to consciousness again with the tension change his whole off the energy [noise] now the energy you know it's a very vague words because so many different types of energy a lot of this\nUh important as far as the brain because whatever we do and the thing that we ever want to understand goes through the brain system even when we are able to to to see if it's through what she called long a physical sense is\n... cents a perception but you still need to translate it through the brain in order to be able to indicate\nThat one of the nice thing off crystals calls is that they stimulate and especially court stimulate the functions of the brain ... calls it literally active and the different brain frequency\nWhich allows you not only to receive more information but also to perceive which means to translate in an understanding\nThat we're already talking about the fact that pretty small scales have been used to store information all you can put\nAs much information as you walk into it if you have no way to get it out and troubles lay that in one way or another and then we still miss the key aspects of life crystal skulls are so\nThe angels all like markers on the top there have been used by people in the past to help us to at least\nShow if you can access it how to work with them and then you have all this contemporary ones that are there to train us to make it easier and easier to access all of this information system [noise] so\nActually you can say that it's working these crystal skulls is a journey off ... spending potential and expanding\nConsciousness and awareness because that is that gift and I think they know by coincidence that than make if the shape off a call because if you put information in any\nParticular uh courts yeah how we would even know that that is where the ...\nI'll be any effort to make sure that people in the future of the law to realize wow that is ... so that is why they let ... ... people killed one day probably all access crystal skull\nAlways ... always remember like crystal it was the court soon crystal the provided\nThe means by which we could communicate now with one another using crystal radios crystal radios were the first radio is that where we can broadcast information\nTo and from each other long distances there were ... you know people like Tesla Marconi there were very much aware of using crystal in order to create that sort of a communication not only that but to record\nSuch as what we had with the idea of the phonograph where the or the or the digital recorders these are all the technologies that came from the original crystal from the original ports and so it's important to understand that some of the ancient technology like what we find in the crystal skull is not being utilized in our technology today\nA doctor about it and I appreciate you coming on his program thank you for your thoughts on this matter I really did enjoy our time together [noise]\nI fully agree it's like ah what are you at Ryan's that he's bringing together of the feminine and the ... and the and the in the in the mail and the feminine bring them together\nAre bringing a brings us closer together sort of dividing it's we're in this pointed division right now with what politics are having a ... right now in and of course we've had the\nThe uh the profane symbols being erected in Washington DC like the arch of bail which of course represents all things Cornel and the sacrifice you have children and all and this is the symbol\nLast night we were talking about the darker symbols of angles and of course the darker symbols are brought forward by those who wish to uh I Would say more more or or ... which is sacred bring the school here I think is our way of fighting back\nAnd that's why I agreed to have it on the show tonight so I'm very grateful for you wanting to bring this as a weapon against the darkness which is something I I really appreciate\nThe school has a message has been coming out now it's all has to do with balance and balance is so important and as long as we're in balance you know the negative really can't really affect you but what happens is you get thrown out of balance and you go into the chaos and then\nAll this stuff affects you so it's a matter of controlling your mind and ah get back solid in the balance and then we as craters\nWorking on a positive things doing positive things can change your life in the world\nComing up right now we're going to have a real sharman intuitive on the program several folks who of course ah have had experiences and wants to share experiences with the crystal skull tonight or without further ado rerun the program several of you there\nI Am good evening good evening and for having me up voting I\n... to have you on your background is but you are a a viewer worker you worry yogurt what would you say are you might worker or a person who has had experience with the schools is a utilize them or for positivity tell us about your experiences with the school\nI probably have to start with my first encounter um and that was back in two thousand and eight I was attending a conference in Scottsdale, Arizona\nAnd here was this crystal skulls sitting at the height of the room with a long line of people that wanted to experience the energy or maybe have their photos taken with that and a friend came up to me and she said let's go over and get our\nPictures taken with the crystal skulls that I was like oh no thank you I'm really not that interested and Bill Gates has presentation and his lecture on the skull and it was fascinating and I learned something about them than interestingly\nThere was a crystal skull again that Michel Hedges sitting at the site of the room with another long line of people waiting to have their little experience with it and my friend came up to me and said\nThe line has died down let's go over there and said do this thing so I thought okay so I went over and my hands around it and maybe\nIn the energy is palatable it is an amazing frequency that is emanating from the school and I thought cools full stop\nBend goal disappeared for the rest of the lecture and it was well into the evening and Claire audience lay I heard you get up to you or it could be\nThat the crystal skull and I thought to myself you know I'm really not that interested I Want to hear the rest of his lecture on crop circles\nAnd then I heard you get up to now so I pay attention when I have intuitive messages like that I left the conference hall I started walking around great hotel in Scottsdale and I'm thinking to myself\nThis is ludicrous I really like I don't find this crystal skull behind so deep hotel door and I'm sure enough that's exactly what happened\nAnd a door open and I saw bill and I put my head in the door way and he said\nCome in we're waiting for you and I said\nI got this crazy message I'm supposed to be with the crust and I couldn't even get the word\nCome in we're waiting for you and I said I just got this crazy message I'm supposed to be looked at Christmas and I couldn't even get the words out and build said sitting out I Know that's how it works\nAnd that was the beginning of a very interesting an extraordinary journey for me it's colored my life with these experiences that have\nTaken me to um places like coupon I'm In Guatemala it introduced me to people like scientists explorers and that's the gate of mythology just and medicine people\nOf the highest caliber and I've witnessed the paranormal true the crystal skulls first hand time and time again I'm I've witnessed instantaneous feelings and\nI personally have access doorways into portals of awareness or I'm Amazed and delighted with my work which in cages these\nVery high vibration all crystalline beings\nWhen you're talking about portals new awareness are you talking about a demand for a possible dimensional travel or we are putting the mind in two dimensional rooms\nThat part of it yeah [laughter]\nUm so are you are you are you indicating that are beyond what we have in the physical there are many dimensions ... we are\nAre in some overlapping or there's overlapping dimensions but we certainly are can have one foot in the in one one for the other would you say that's true\nAbsolutely true yes can you know other things\nAnd with the crystal skulls um [noise] I offer\nGroup meditations with the schools because I feel\nThat having personal experiences with them are really our best way for communicating what they're all about sharing our firsthand experiences and you know they come with a key or a non button [laughter] really through\nThose personal experiences that we are expanding our awareness and our conscious us\nSo in one of my circles um there was a woman who later came up to me um about a month later actually\nAnd she said Stephanie and your circle I was brought there by a friend for the meditation and I wasn't into crystal skulls I had cut my leg and I knew I was going to help to stitches and I was trying to nurse it along so I wouldn't have to go to the emergency and\nYou know spend the money to have that taking care of but it hadn't stop bleeding for about\nThree days when I she said after your meditation I was going to go to the urgent care and get a stretch and she said because I really wasn't in to the whole thing I was sitting there with my eyes open and from the circle a beam of light shot from\nMaine crystal skull and the center of the circle and my leg was healed and um she showed me a scar on her leg where it was and she said she did it stop bleeding she didn't need stitches and it was like an end\nTo Haiti is and then Hany us he'd like [laughter] that's one little story\nAmazing though you know you were able to the ... the beam of light the dream out you know I don't know if you've been hearing about or whether you're fired whether your phone\nIs it there is a beam an energy being of matter that they have no account for that is coming from space through the climate out through Antarctica\nSo you know there is an once again the whole idea behind bring the scope here had everything to do with technological signatures that they are now saying they're going to trace in space to find The Elders to find a the extraterrestrial entities to find the extraterrestrial intelligence is\nAnd and these are the things that are most certainly ah can be and and and could be a extracted or at least discovered by using the ... these powers these technological signatures they call them up of ancient technology from ancient civilizations the skull in my opinion is ancient technology\nAbsolutely they are kind of knowledge and air hype racial tools to work with like that I Do believe that they expanded I cut class were laying off a county\n... very strict Right rally crystal skull\nAnd you know what channel a lot of people are channel should go down and chat started me\nWell and that's exactly what's supposed to happen I get a as I said before\nThey're becoming a scientist or becoming more aggressive they're into a finding of a consciousness is they're they're looking to Penn psych gives them\nA quantum immortality we just going down the list and and using mathematics and trying to join together the mathematics the ... the Tego signatures and everything that we once said was supernatural paranormal it is now becoming the normal and uh I find that very important as we move\nA throughout the twenty first century and in through the new millennium all these wonderful experiences that you've shared with Seventy thank you so much for being on the programs and I [noise]", "year": "2018",
