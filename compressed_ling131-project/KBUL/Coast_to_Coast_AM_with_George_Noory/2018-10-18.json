there are no human rights\nYou know we talk about you know this country waving banners human rights and you know wanting to you know take a stand against a various countries because they're so human rights abuses by the countries in which there are no human rights at all like you know watching federation\nHave things changed since the last time we talked about student loans northern they've gotten worse I bet\n[laughter] well yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we're probably at it and I think I was about a year ago we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab\nWhich is now a sitting officially in about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still there's a lot of loans that the don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm going to walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school\nAnd I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman laws right if the school provides a you know at the the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans [noise]\nAh but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of uh is that in nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or removed\nSpecifically for student loans and most most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most apps and of the consumer protections that I just mentioned\nWhat if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in ah his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nAnd they get that discounted author student loan that you know ...\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless\nYou're making a minimal a annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise] um [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there\nBut I can tell you that what we have now today is the most predatory lending\nI'm sure he has ever seen a you know the founding fathers way back in the day\nUh people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants\nOr so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniformed bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war has the power to raise an army and many other very important powers [noise]\nAh so the ... you know are they required bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student\nLoan absolutely we are going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition that one\n[laughter] sure well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to uh be able to repay the loan in other words to default on the loan you\nKnow you walk into the fold nope that's\nRight if it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead\nWell that's a defining hallmark of a predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the services and the guarantor ours are often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than a loan the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where\nYour credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default\nA but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled the bar or to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they got a sixteen ... percent commission right off\nThe wild [noise] so you know where\nThey can make the three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for servicing healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation\nAnd so the financial incentives that under this for a federal student loans system are just completely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nSnowy spleen to process over the Fulton loan in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of\nAnd by any means so a student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nSure that's a that's a good case a good ... easy numbers to start with so I'm fifty thousand or student loan when the student graduates what say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years\nUh they're unable to make payments they lose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise]\nUm the student can expect a lot to be thrown into default so the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably defaulted somewhere around ... let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars what with penalties and fees and capitalized interests that are slapped onto that loan very quickly that would\nMm Fifteen twenty twenty five years in the bottle or is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment and fall for roughly let's say a hundred and twenty five or so thousand\nDollars oh my God so what the what\nThe lending system will do will say oh you're in default on your loan big trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment\nWe can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nThat will be taxed too you stuff like that that's right yeah\nUm you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other uh no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or\nSo ultimately they will wind up um hopefully in the government hopes to I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments for about for ten months typically none of those\nPayments go towards alone this just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that oh Tate this rehabilitation\nAt the end of the process they wind up signing for much a new are much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars well these agents again is sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this loan rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it does it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nFees and the ... these agents or collection companies [noise] well yeah these\nAgents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well on these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own Gehring tours so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would far rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than\nAh than alone that remains it's good said and I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there do not rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these\nDefaulted loans that rehabilitate they default again three to four times and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loans if that default again\nAnd that happens something like eighty percent of the time\nThen the whole process starts again\nTo stay with us Allen let's talk about if there's any recourse here in the again we'll take calls next hour with Alan calling U.S Coast to coast\nSigning up new recoup zone or

other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court that there is no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is they will receive a summons from an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the ... and they become subject\nTo arrest show in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced to ah to come into court that way\nTo deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server as the sheriff or private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying that can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nRuled that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly are in just this one federal district or they had planned on arrest gene\nIn thousand people [noise] uh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was like three thousand dollar loan and they hold this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interests and corn costs and fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um that's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison [noise] uh that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy writes ahead of the power to declare war as far as an army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse\nSo let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans they all fifty thousand now they want to pay the fifty let's assume that's what they want to do what you're saying because of the ... the fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that and grows even more\nCan't they just cut a deal on the fifty\n[noise] well um they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it defaulted\nWhat kind of settlement is\nFor most people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place\nUh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan went into falls is free unrealistic for most people [noise] uh so that you know the government has got you where do they want you on these student loans\nThey're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org so many years ago you know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nUh you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um [noise] I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this was the sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this is happening to realize that you know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you seeing that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there was about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to rescind revoked suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses a man across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired a from this public employment ... for the case of default to student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nDoes this cross a park party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what has President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans\nAre unfortunately the past say three presidents really have only made the problem worse under Obama Obama essentially federal lies the lending programs so that where before\nA bank such as those that I mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae Nell et cetera where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government\nAnd by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year which is more than any corporation on earth on the lending program\nNow Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before he said why is the government for offering on student loans this is nonsense you know of all places that the government shouldn't be making a profit\nYou would think student loans would be it a and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five\nYou know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the lending system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those are those days I'm so unfortunately you know does ... known Trump's rhetoric was really good\nBut since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him\nA et cetera so would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy device\nWho herself had stock in struggle and collection companies [noise] ah and you know I I frankly I don't think President Trump has really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds [noise]\nUh so I have I hold out some hope for him a but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight you could file bankruptcy in a way to students that what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um [noise]\nSome of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they tried it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away\nAnd so um so yeah Congress ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable\nWhat we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening far less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy is less far less than the average for other loans\nSo there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that we've had to suffer under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing of ... this was a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against us citizens\nWere with Alan ... student loan justice dot org linked up and goes to goes day in his book is called the student loan scam you're on some kind of a nationwide tour these days only what you doing\nOh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called HR twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply delete the one line of federal code that makes student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings\nSo this really gets to the core of the problem and ah by by getting this bill passed\nA we would immediately see a dramatic decrease in the price of college\nAh we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality of the job that the government does it ...\nSo this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nTelling a lot of people would prefer not to have to file bankruptcy they just don't like the stigma or is there anything else that we can try to do or get past legislatively to fix some of these student loan

I'm a conservative everyone knows that I'm the guy that almost won I lost a four to three\nSplit decision in the shadow case I'm pro life pro gun I'm as far as conservative as Rush Limbaugh and most of it's not even the liberals want a free hand out okay\nBut the college tuition is technically and legally attack because it's money go into an arm of the state government college and were being over tax that told a liberal as a matter of fact\nThe price of college is about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and here's the thing okay we spend a lot of money on our military\nAnd it it's too much really we spent all in you know even as a conservative we spend a lot of money on Social Security\nBut we can only cut those things a little bit the on the third or fourth thing is probably the tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee college loans and we don't need to spend any money of that not only does it put the tax dollar on the hook and it's going to crash the dollar like Greece or Venezuela Georgian\nAnd I'm Alan by the way I'm Alan was good enough to make me the leader of the Florida group and I hope I'm\nHe's gotten on an equal talking a little too much and you know [laughter] but\nListen ... and all of the reason is here's the deal OK almost ten percent of the total that as college dead and and it's going to crash the dollar that the only thing if we get rid of that you want to let him get a credit card Idaho okay with the loans but let them get a credit card it'll save the tax dollar and it'll save the student is college will drop like a rock\nAnd the I I look I Love my rates man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide jobs in hospitals and police looking here it\nCan get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get but look if he can get bankruptcy repeatedly for millions in bailout and handouts\nAnd if all these rich banks and these colleges can get rich on the students looking here that that that those are the two beneficiary in here and\nThen okay and they use the third or I we all got your point there Gordy\nAllen [noise] you know I I he said a lot there but I appreciate all those points and he's exactly right you know if\nWe can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq [noise]\nI think we can throw maybe a trillion her show at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view [noise] you know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow I think on balance that would probably be a good thing it would return prices\nBack down to rational levels uh and you know it would it would um really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system but ... but ... but in particular it would it would lead to lower prices\nWill who has all the debt right now\nThe white to clean well I Will say that\nIf you had a minimum bankruptcy protection is or not restored so that people can go to a judge\nAnd according to the wisdom of a judge I'm settled that debt according to their means if that does not happen\nThen we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a nonpartisan guy but I Will say that uh the Democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling all student debt and [noise] you\nKnow I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people are out there are able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon if at a minimum a the bankruptcy writes that the founders demanded aren't returned\nWell then you do have salaries and teacher salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[noise] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate is that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly overcharging their students by and large\nThey could probably suffer eight thirty percent if not forty percent reduction\nIn the student loan income that they're currently receiving and still be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person a and you know be able to service all the students that they do today so I think there's a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia um\nSo yeah I mean ending the student loan program tomorrow would I agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise] um but certainly there's got to be a middle ground you know and with bankruptcy back in with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other Linder has to contend with [noise]\nAh that would go a long ways towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools to lower their prices improve their quality and decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFirst time caller mark in Provo, Utah hey mark go ahead\nWell George you said they can't uh they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school I was on a full scholarship they even pay for my books but the federal government makes you go to student loan counseling and so I went\nAnd I told the lady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me Will Hunting if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest on it\nOh boy I Would love to sue her this\nDid you end up doing that oh yeah and then life happens the money disappears yeah you know ... over fifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student loans and loan balance is a hundred and three thousand dollars a gallon never pay it off I Will die owing money do they harass you mark [noise]\nNo I'm right now they've got me on some ridiculous thing where uh my payment is zero um I did a double major in a minor ... some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility um I just I I Would have never tasted that crack had she not pedaled it\nTo me exactly exactly well what do you think yelling the these loans are\nOn the students way ahead of any scholarship or any other um any other aid that where you don't have to pay back I mean the college and some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them\nA private banks and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's it's just disgusting [laughter] you know I might actually out on the repayment program that that a mark is on a is probably the income based repayment program so they're a bunch of government programs out there that sound\nThe um the repayment program that that a mark is on a is probably the income based repayment program so there are bunch of government programs out there that sound like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness ... there's income based repayment but what all everybody out there needs to know\nIs that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where you work for a you know if you work in a college or a hospital other nonprofit get your loans forgiven\nOnly about point three percent of the people trained for that forgiveness are actually getting it so the rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more\nSo mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments\nWell interest continues to accrue on that loan so\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I be our program and actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount forgiving under the I'd be our program is taxable income so\nTwenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals Ari ... probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nThough the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nBig was gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was ... acres that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit the inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many\nYears ago Ellen

these student loans scam Ellen are the student loans that are out there now hurting or helping the economy\n[noise] [noise] well I think it's clear that it's hurting the economy at this point\nUh you know interest alone on one point five trillion dollars more than Ninety billion dollars a year\nOr so that money that gets taken away from home purchases a you know business formation a auto ... you know other big ticket items that improve the economy [noise]\nUh so certainly it's hurting in that respect a and you know it's it's also hurting in a number of ways are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people a straddle or you know strapped under ... this these sort of debt levels\nDirectly to sort of oppressive type of debt [noise] um this really can make people do bad things um\nDo things for money that they wouldn't otherwise do I'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy [noise] ah and certainly those people pay no taxes and and et cetera so so it's really hurtful in many ways that are maybe not a parent or to the naked eye\nIt's going to call Fresno, California to get things started here west the Rockies ball go ahead sir\nHey I'm very grateful you take my call thank you very much George Janelle them [noise] um they graduated from college two thousand Fifteen just before it closed down [noise]\nI'm I'm One of those fortunate Casey who are at one point three to aloe with talking about that actually got um most cars that were given I ah got thirty four thousand of the thirty seven thousand but I got\nYou know that I owed forgiven wow how'd you do that graduations and\nI appreciate that thank you well I I did a little bit of our way ah there's something called a the findings\nAnd what that is is that like a lifting of\nPretty much like a courses you cook or a trait that trade you chose yeah and what it is is um if it of course who are the reason they're in the situation because they both by ... so if you were from a certain time period to a time period at the end of the school I'm\nPretty much that's when they committed a that broader so it actually took me from I Would have to say December tooth outlook they seem to around August of two thousand and fixing to get it all given what I did is I actually wrote Kamala Harris that email\nUm she surprisingly responded um but the the avenue that I went to get a laugh or give it to write a cover letter I submitted a pretty much a with a cover letter I had to put a plenty on it then I had to pretty much just uh put it all out there what I'd gone through no that that's the transcript to a\nA cover letter transcripts and pretty much all the information that I actually I have to prove that I went to college\nYeah it was the fraud that got it reduced I guess right\nA yes or that one of the main things I put there because if you see many of the hill college commercials one thing they promises lifelong job placement of cooking [noise] so what how I false advertising\nYeah the exactly so when the schools shut down there goes your fall on the job place there goes your your life like long ... like what if the\nRight you got that right the interesting Alan isn't it\nYeah that you know and that's a good\nPoint and I maybe I should have brought up a at some other point the show there are some breaking news now where if you went to particularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught well why you're seeing just like the just like Paul mentioned\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates and you know say oh you know average earnings for your degrees this much and these could be lies and so there actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where if your school ... you\nThen at least on paper you have available to you and avenue called defense to repayment where you\nAt least theoretically can get your loans cancelled and I\nI think I'm Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen does work successfully for him [noise] ah but I Will say that even just yesterday I'm One of the federal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of delay and slow walk this ... this program so as it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who were lied to by their colleges are then there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be\nBecause believe me the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely have to uh you know\nBy the legal community but [noise] um but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so if you're you were lied to by particularly for profit college or you may may may possibly have some avenue for records you know\nWell you know with all these credit card fraud that's out there and just credit fraud indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency for some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy of the new NATO provided to you they're up a creek aren't they\n[noise] well that's right and you know similarly for student loans we find a lot of a private loans the underlying note uh well first of all the loan has been bought and sold so many times that whoever says they owned a note actually does not owned the note and they have no business collecting on that loan I'm\n... now there are other there are some avenues that the the lenders can go to they can\nSay that the new it was lost and they have other avenues to prove that is a valid note but that certainly is something to be aware of\nAnd I should also say people who have private student loans are not federal student loans they do have statute of limitations so somebody comes up to you Twenty years hands and starts demanding money from you for a private loan than\nWill almost certainly that loan is not little ... little there you suspect um and you want to look into the statute of limitation laws that govern that particular alone depending on where you live or where he took up alone\nIt's going to pat Minneapolis used to the Rockies Hi Pat go ahead\nI worked in a Social Security office for a while and I figured out that at at least one of the agenda is is the destruction of the Social Security program because there are families with co signers\nOf grandparents and parents and students none of them are ever going to get a security forum I have a question and I think Justin alright if\nIf I own a house and I have co signed on one of these student loans is does that blame it on my house so that when I die instead of my air is getting at it's collected for a for a student loans yup\nIt goes to the lone first doesn't it\nWell that's a that's a great question to her first point\nYes Social Security wages are being garnished as we speak for student loans and what is even more disturbing icy legislation out there right now and I wasn't passed yet but I see legislation out there right now which offers a loan forgiveness in uh in return for people for going\nTheir Social Security when they when they reach retirement age ah so there are some people at work in Washington DC very busy trying to figure out how to\nTake away Social Security benefits down the road from student loan borrowers\nInteresting is that what did you hear what other things did your\nFamily has already where ... generation the grandparents and parents and the kids are never going to get any thoughts that scary\nBut my question is that if you have if you want to help the students and tear the already you write a check to the school or a money order or travelers check or whatever and when the kid brings yet you know says\nWell here's my

project\nI think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it's still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nNow other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told\nBeing plug has been polled well Lu I was on both sides so ... doesn't matter you can continue a project with you know using can count on resources which is absolutely\nTrue uh but you know it is it is a mystery what I Do suspect what's happened is if it is still an extent program it was probably changed twinkles again this is typical government um alphabet soup\nTerritory we're not even a hundred percent sure about the name of of a tip Lou has said its advanced aerospace\nThreat identification program a painting can press officer said one time it's advanced aviation\nA threat identification program and then we learned that a tip them in part from

I Believe a faction became or or certainly interacted with an overlapped with with a tip\n[noise] and they effectively I guess you got the chance to\nPut those those beliefs and those hypotheses within government we've taxpayers' money and and that of course gives us in an interesting opportunity to find out about the asked because and I hope we'll we'll have time to get into this late but but now of course talk of\nCongressional hearings to to get to the bottom of this but but the bottom line to answer your question is is that I think there was a believer function\nThey made them move they came up against some road blocks couple of different road blocks one road blocks which they simply go to a point where you know they they looked at this and\nAnd they investigated but because they didn't get a definitive on so the feeling was that they taking it as far as as they couldn't what else can you do\nThe other sort of road blocks but they had this is very controversial is the hitter\nOut of college a religious road block from from some senior people in the Pentagon who frankly for the UFOs and the paranormal with demonic and therefore didn't didn't think what we should be having anything to do with that\nWell what do we do\nDo we want [laughter] oh well I mean um it it would start to eat whatever the laws but I I as I say that there were people\nIn the Pentagon ... who who is deeply conservative religious beliefs\nLead them to think that that they are dealing with it you know make a demonic\nPhenomenon here I might come I come up again there's a couple of times in in the u._k. as well at the ministry of defense in fact one of one of my bosses was I'm a you know they're pretty extreme\nWith the S. and indeed the the individual who wrote the ... to find\nIntelligence assessment\nOn on UFOs in the ministry of defense code name project combined he would have wanted to get to go too far down that road he had some slightly old beliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible\nIn the book ... so I think it is where it refers to say as being the prince of the power of the ... and ... I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious\nPeople dead the idea the UFOs might be demonic\nAnd there were lot of folks that believe that\nYes and and it's it's it's frustrating in a sense because and and it's almost call me clean ironic in another way that the ... you know you\nIn the ... the the the IRA elsewhere and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people who thought this would dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it researching it in a proper scientific manner and we come up again skepticism and you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect\n'em to system is sort of in the coal or intellectual\nA human they kept the system but I think most people\nI associate with that concept it's actually it's a ... probably trying to do the trick skepticism itself I mean it to have attractively the so called UFO skeptics in the ... um\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic quality just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief for another really these are these people were skeptics are told they would\nBelieve that they would you believe us in some some great Warren happened with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back and chat more right here on coast to coast or you\nKnow you can show up dates with other ... would you do in the ... million Facebook page just go to preschool dot com slash goes to goes to him and the like button [noise]\nKind of luck dot com boom luck dot com [noise]\n[noise] oh no one\n\n\nWill go back to the cultural back with Nick Nick do you think at all but the alien\nPresidents appears to have any kind of threat to us as a human species\nWell this is a problem we grappled with a lot at the ministry of defense and and then find the um law to files\nIn in the what's now being a ten year program to declassify and release them go heavily into the question of whether there is or isn't a threat and how could you tell and who should make that assessment and in fact um it it gets quite\nFractious um between different divisions in the ministry of defense and and some of the the\n... make quite amusing reading as as the intelligence people are telling some of the other people you know who do you think you are to suddenly put yourself into the role of of of an intelligence\nAnalyst and and you know ... that's not your job and um what what the intelligence people\nConcluded they they made a a kind of analogy um they said\nI'm a ... if if you don't mind I've actually gone to document in front of me home please give us some cultural yeah this is a this\nActually haven't officially been released\nYet I'm there will be tonight will night I'm\nThe same can them critical question is do you a pace represent a possible threat to the defense of the realm we could argue that assuming for the sake of the argument that something exist\nThey have never shown any hostile attend intent and therefore kennel represent a threat however\nRussian act Croft attempting to penetrate the u._k. I defense reaching in the Cold War never showed hostile intent but they certainly represented a threat not the only logical conclusion that we can come to is that we do not know if you ate pays represent a threat to the defense of the realm\nAnd so this this is quite interesting because ah parts of the the ministry of defense was saying to parliament the media and the public know there's there's no evidence of any threat here we we look at these things to see if that of any difference in ... but no no no threat\nAnd yet in June of ... there were classified documents saying well look we just don't know we have not yet made a proper\nAssessment and so we we can't tell\nWe simply can't sell well what about the alien abduction phenomenon I mean wouldn't that be some kind of\nIt would be if we could absolutely say that it's it's physically rail and not not some sort of combination of hoaxes and psychological delusions and\nAnd an other misunderstood phenomena the the other thing is of course we don't really know what's going on some of the people who claimed to have had these abduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic and and suddenly researchers like about Hopkins\nMine too have had these abduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic and and suddenly researchers like bought Hopkins type Jacob's\nUh we're we're always saying you know that\nThis whole style and it's it's a threat on the other hand people like John Mack and and some of the other people who take him on new agents spiritual view of this\nTalk about healing and things like that and he goes back to the idea of who who can really say I mean this sounds bizarre but in millet treat 'em there is actually in a way Asian\nFor working out whether this is a threat to our knowledge or rather this this is a kind of them we don't know the values but intelligence some military circles\nAnd we say that ... is defined as being a construct of capability plus intent\nSo so you look at the capability you look at the intent and then you would count whether there's a threat and if there is\nWhat ... what kind of a threat it is well we have some idea about the capability of you ate pay and and again the the file the ministry defense files stay quite clearly you know speeds and maneuvers\nWay in excess of anything that we've gone so the capability\nWe we know has a higher value what we don't have any idea about his intent if the if there is an intelligence behind this phenomenon frankly we don't know what it is we don't know what it once we it may be unknowable\nIn the u._k. the astronomer royal to march in race\nSpeculating about extraterrestrial intelligence and and uh gender and motivation said it may be trying to approach to try and figure this out he said it might be ... the analogy would be trying to explain quantum\nMechanics and you can find the\nWell we don't know what it is we don't know what they want what can you categorically scenic that it's happening\nLike I Can't say that abduction is happening no I don't know that\nBut I mean visitations visitation\nWell what I can say is that there seems to be strong and credible evidence that\nYou a pay our rail that they do routinely penetrate are already defined\nRegion I'm In the u._k. the U.S and presumably elsewhere and they all seen by pilots they aren't trying to write all they performed speech and maneuvers that we can't match so in that sense yes this is a real phenomenon and of course we've now seen which brings us back to the tip\nStory we've now seen those declassified videos of of navy F. Eighteen super on its chasing some of these things\nYou know it's a matter of fact let's talk about the navy jets what's your take on\nWell so far we got three three videos I'm pretty amazing do\nI absolutely I've I've sat down and watch these things with um pilots\nWith I I've actually being in a situation where I've I've I've watched these things and been sitting around a table with with the commercial airline pilot and I'm retired military pilots and we've we've found this around and\nAnd nobody's saying that this is is fake or anything and of course of course it's it's not um [noise]\nWe don't know again and I I'm not one of these people you know sometimes I listen to to people being interviewed makeup known for everything\nYou know again and I I'm not one of these people you know sometimes I listen to two people being interviewed and they called ... for everything [laughter] I'm sure you've probably interviewed a few of them they don't want to name any names I Hope\nHe will will respect the fight but I'm not afraid to say I don't know\nWell I Do I mean because you're not a skeptic by any means but if you're a researcher darn good one and the scene that you don't know that's fine with me\nThank you I mean I'm not no I think time I'm\nA skeptic no either I'm only a a ... I'll I'll believe everything kind of\nPerson and again let's be honest there are there are quite a few in\nThis field I mean the wheel real life in my experience of looking at the ... the real real situation is is far more complex than than real or not real and skeptics versus believers and the idea that there's ever going to be one solution to the U.S how you mystery is is I think\nYou know crazy I I just don't think it's going to pan out that way but but to go back to your question yeah we've seen those three videos um we know that there are\nA more videos that I think will be something that will come over the next\nFew weeks and months there is always the pressure going on behind the scenes to say well come on this doesn't happen in a vacuum these sorts of incidents have been going on for years um we have a number of pilots on the record talking about this there must be\nMany many more videos Lou Elizondo has said that there are other people involved\nIn in old lists have set that there are part of course none of these people want to ... to ... the cod or the CIA and and any other agencies involved might decide on this I mean I think if if people start talking about stuff that's genuinely still classified and the government\nHasn't released those people will end up getting a knock on the door\nWell we've heard that happened before haven't we [laughter] yeah where\nDo you think your thoughts are on President Trump's request for a space for a\nWhile it's it's it's interesting and it certainly caused more than a few rumors in conspiracies\nThe wrong way he draw on the economy was raising the standard of living doesn't matter and Rush Limbaugh and increasing the number of people at work and raising wages bonuses being granted the none of those things\nI just cited which have traditionally been manager [noise] getting out of the day we're told him that Rush Limbaugh he's training them on the news on Ninety five point five which is where ... ...\nAm nine Seventy buildings these huge each ward and you're listening to news don't know do you find\n\nWhat facts if any did he find object Callahan Fox News secretary of state Mike Pompeo is back\nFrom his mission to Saudi Arabia and turkey trying to learn what happened to journalist ... you'll break President Trump later this morning the secretary admitted to reporters all the way home he was walking a bit of a diplomatic tight rope and we have\nNatural relationship between us Saudi company\nWhy says if President Trump has asked turkey to share with the U.S the audiotapes they say they have a good show these torture and murder Washington Post is published tributes to cause you'll get today and what is believed to be his final column for the latest Fox News ...

this thing that I think a lot of people in this field do no I'm the idea that this phenomena and suddenly started in Nineteen forty seven is of course crazy I mean people have seen\nStrange things in the sky since the dawn of time but I think the other interesting thing about this this call and these these familial\nRecollection is is the fact that you know these these phenomena are always interpreted through the lens of of personal belief system and culture and and it is interesting when you come up against couches where where this\nThis thing is is almost so commonplace that it's it's like oh yeah you know that that's the thing we don't necessarily know what it is but yeah it's it's real\n... real let's go to Andy Norwalk, California now why Andy Glyn\nHi George you're agreeing hatred and Mr Paul it's a real honor I listen to many times and you're very um [noise]\nInformed and entertaining to listen to a two part question if I may uh first of all are based on all of your knowledge of um [noise]\nThe western powers all of the NATO countries him for that matter and let's say the eastern bloc countries ... how many as long as you've been following this how many uh aircraft and uh pilots have disappeared and this guy while pursuing so called UFOs\nAnd are based upon your response I I have a second part a line of question if I may okay\nNicky with us yeah sorry I thought you were going to hit me with pot too straight away while we're waiting for that one\nI'm now I'm going to sound a little bit skeptical on on this I Would say the answer is less than than a lot of things that I've I've read in in the UFO and alternative belief communities I mean I've seen some\nTalk about pilots carrying missing and and you eh fires and I think you know unfortunately flying is an inherently dangerous um occupational certainly laws in in the early days in a lot of lot of ... just\nDisappeared because they crashed now now of course then you have\nDo you have some kind of see cases like a ... ... the mentality case he didn't disappear of course but he\nCrashed chasing a UFO which skeptics say with the planet Venus we coming off of cost to the fortieth anniversary of arguably the most famous disappearance of all time involving a UFO Frederick ...\nOh yes that was strange I think we're literally die you to weigh in Australia right yes\nI absolutely over the or is it the by trade I think all the time and straight maybe the brash straight is part of the past month say excuse me I'm geographically challenged in that particular part of the world but\nUm but I I don't buy into the room is that that I've heard the pilots were were\nSharing and disappearing or all the time as a result of of that we had a case in the u._k. tragic case involving a pilot who who just flew his car off into the city\nIn in I think Nineteen Seventy it was during a night exercise and some people years later I tried to attribute a UFO\nA story on to that but I pulled out the board of inquiry file which was about two inches thick I went through every single paper in not filed and I couldn't couldn't actually steps\nFile which was about two inches thick I went through every single pipe in filed and I couldn't couldn't actually substantiate any of these UFO rumors so I think I think the answer to your question is is very few\nNursed him indeed okay go ahead and they say oh okay so the second part question based upon your your response to this ah\nAs you probably know during the Eisenhower administration there were so many aircraft\nThat we're a suddenly a malfunctioning falling out of the skies\nAnd uh yes in some cases just suddenly disappeared that the Eisenhower administration gave the order\nTo stop the pursuit the aggressive pursuit by American aircraft obese UFOs\nOr and secondly I spoke to Dr Heinrich before he passed away a Chicago radio station for about a five to seven minutes [noise] and I asked them what are the chances of\nA life or not existing on other planets and knocked coming and visiting us um and he said impossible that that was his response impossible so I I appreciate your perspective than\nI Do personally believe\nThat they dominate the skies any time and every time that they come a within our airspace there are so many thousands tens of thousands and God only knows maybe millions of years ahead of us they could be entered the mention all they could be physical or both\nBut I don't think we're much of a match and they do have air superiority\nAnd [noise] I Do appreciate the honor and pleasure talking to both of you\nIn the Persian and ... by the way and and\nAnd he made a really interesting point which goes back to something in the British Intelligence assessment ... and that was a I have I don't like to call it amusing but ah I it was kind of\nPoignantly amusing maybe the there was a line about the flight safety and safety implications off you ate pea soup which goes directly\nOf of course to the point just made and there was a recommendation in ... combines final report and it said I don't have it in front of me but but if I actively pilots encountering you ate pay should take no action\nApart from trying to place the object is gun in other words you know whatever we dealing with here don't mess with it\nDon't mess with it at all we're going to take a break pretty soon that can come back with final phone calls but I also want to talk with you you've done a thriller out called blood brothers don't you\nYeah I Do a kind of a different thing for you\nYes I um ... although I'm best known for having run the UFO program I did a lot of other things in my Twenty one years at the MIT and my final posting within the direct threat to defend security we did a lot of counter terrorism and things\nI've written fiction before I've written to finally find novels about alien invasion so I decided to write to a thriller about terrorism and counterterrorism and the intelligence agencies it's our turn Kendall now and ah it it's going straight to a paper back on I think November Fifteen\nGood lord brothers that's the name we're going to come back and take final goals Nick

final segment with Nick Pope of course huge part of the ... the Pentagon filmed the DVD as well in his latest book is an action thriller called blood brothers and how do you get the book Nick\nWell its own candle at the moment I'm a I'm coming out in paperback in November but it's on Amazon so so basically I just don't give it to Amazon and look up blood brothers make pope or it's on late Nick ... website on the books\n... in your opinion assuming we're being visited do you think most of them look like these so called de Leon Gray's people described or do they look like gosh what do you think\nWell it's a tricky question because I think the media I'm kind of Mike to have this this kind of\nTrue ... or ... or whatever you call it of of the alien gray and then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because I think um you know when people say oh I've seen one of these aliens ... gray large head\n... shaped it gets reported but when when somebody says they see something that doesn't quite fit the mold maybe it doesn't quite make the caught or get the coverage but in my experience when people report entities just as when they report UFOs they come in all shapes and sizes\nRobust sure do what you but you saw almost saying then that people basically they hear this year this and then they think they see it\nYes I think perception plays a big part in this but here again who who can say what um what technology if we are being visited by a civilization in let's face it the universe is nearly fourteen billion years old\nImagine what a civilization which you say a million years head start on us money to be able to do in terms of you know hiding themselves masking that true appearance\nA deception uh it's it's unimaginable so so again I think we're in the territory where ... we should what we think we see and perceive may be very different from the reality of what's going on and they may ultimately\nBe unknowable to us through a species of our town level of development what's your son of the propulsion system that\nWell it's it's clearly a community ought to be some something exotic I guess we're in in sort of\nStar Trek parrot tree and in one

they were they were planning on going to the moon now they have their ... over budget they're they're under a they're under a performing here\n\nSecondly white issue a brand new plan that is intended to energize a host of agencies who can contribute to the potential ways to prevent such a disaster if if there's no disaster looming for the foreseeable future why are they doing this something doesn't smell right here\n\nUse accordion NASA there are more than twenty five thousand asteroids lurking out there that are one hundred and forty meters in size or greater those are the ones that pose a threat there are a lot that pose a threat and there are ... million near earth objects that could pose a potential threat out there and so\nIt definitely makes sense to be prepared for such a

overnight okay basically overnight the planetary\nFifty million dollars for their budget\nAnd this is for asteroids okay they say asteroids quote asteroids right so now you know why I'm feeling a little tension because we have\nThe Russians saying they saw an armada let's say there was a dual star cluster it looked like a circus or to be do get me wrong I'm not saying there is there an amount

there so I had I talked about it and be able to say I talked about on Monday show I guess I talked about that on Monday show\nMy friend Sara says yeah you did talk about because I Want to know why they think it's an armada and river I called you yeah OK you called me\nThey can't send astronauts to the highest that's because the rocket malfunction we have to\nX ray or you have the Chandra X ray

no longer possible to hide the fact that there's an active alerted the moment for extraterrestrial contact\n\nThe as we are looking for confirmation of alien life forms heat is difficult to hear the breakthroughs in science that have been announced with well at least those announcements which certainly confirm of life existing in space\nI mean this newfound sense of confidence from NASA and the

mainstream science\nMuch of what we're hearing about can be fulfilling of our life the dreams and other discoveries are those that make up our nightmares thinking or nightmares come true I mean all

that I can hear you say\n... says shit on is that a is that it let's start class\nIt confirms that I did hear you say about those ships\nUm that day you thought it was the star cluster and this Russian scientists thought they were ships [noise] um I Do remember that because\nI went on YouTube looking to see if there was anything about that and all I saw was there was something about the moon getting hit\nBut it was an old entry so I didn't even open it but there was another entry that\nI Can't find now that said if you see something in the sky that looks like spaceships it's it's just a hologram fate\nReally use are familiar\nYeah and because I'm always I'm always looking on YouTube and and looking um I\nI'm fascinated with with\nUs those and and space\nOr spaceships and that and so I'm always looking at the different YouTube than some of them you can tell or fake and some of them are interesting but when they said this I\nThought oh I heard that wants to be for somewhere and I did remember if I heard it from your show or if I heard it from somewhere else that that they were\nThat the government was working on some weight to do like a hologram in the sky to I'm frightened people and to keep them in line\nOh they've been talking about the project will be many times before\nSaying that you know you can recall Graham sky to fool anybody and that's what they're saying things that could be good for the this was something else this was a guy in uniform this is what was said there was a guy in uniform that was on you to be looked official and he said\nSomething is about to hit them and rather than having nothing go viral is proposed speculated for you to shut down the channels because he didn't want that message to get out and\nWell I Can't tell you that that I Can't stay up late anymore because I have a job now that gets me I have to get up early and so a lot of times I listen to your um ... pod cast because I Know you're saying yeah I'm a partner\nOr and so I and when I listened to those um it's shorter time for me on you know to listen and plus I can look up things on YouTube and see if I see anything that you're talking about on YouTube\nAnd that's what happened when I heard you say this about the um the the possible spaceships [noise] um that you saw it just looked like a grouping of stars so I went on looking for Russian scientists anything\nAnd I didn't find it in\n... I I have to believe it or not I had the picture in front of me\nI have the reporters from Russia Today okay I thought it would be from the problem but no it's from Russia Today looking at it and I I I remember making a comment this SARS me say this could look like a tomato came back to try and find that again no trace it anywhere on the Internet no trace it oh\nWell that's that's what I was trying to get to\nI not only quit and I find that I couldn't find the the old posting of something hitting the moon and I couldn't find the you to the talks about is their spaceships showing in the sky their fate\nMight find any of those\nTalk about if there's ... showed in the sky there may not find any of that ... law so whatever they did they eliminate a lot of stuff not just outlined [noise]\nOkay so many little I'm getting a lot of twitters tonight tweets telling me that oh send a link\nTo Youtube video your face but ... you're talking about\nOkay we're gonna we're gonna take a break right now [noise] um [noise] but yeah this is this is a weird story this is the weirdest story I think ground zeroes ever been in the middle of because of what I said a couple of nights ago and in what has transpired in the past three nights with the\nI guess I just wanted to add one other little thing will be for ...

that would be shawndra X ray telescope down the Hubble down\nThe Mars rovers shut down and the astronaut will go the IMF but something bizarre it's happening in space\nAnd the idea that man was trying to expose it went on YouTube and you you to shut down because they want to keep the video from going viral it's dumping off entirely and it's certainly worth investigating go to Kevin in Oregon Hi Kevin you're on ground zero\nFake [noise] I only have a lot of\nAll I got a\nDry erase objects out there that I was watching\nYour watching things around the moon last night\nReally oh yeah okay [noise] I Am a young man I have the time I think in the end of that but last night there is like five celestial objects orbiting around an F\nAnd you saw them how would a telescope or with the naked eye\nSo\nDid you see that with a telescope or with the naked eye and you saw five celestial objects around the moon last night yeah did you take very long ago did you think footage of it\nI didn't have time to get my camera okay we're in there for about one minute and then they said\nNo carry so you will say you will go on the record so you saw it\n\nAnd where are you where were you at where you saw what part of your ... it says you're in Oregon\nBut on the record say use soy sauce\nAnd where are you where were you at where you saw what part of your it says you're in Oregon what part of

bottle\nOkay well I guess we have one with is is that something was around the moon last night ... fire\nKevin thank you for the call there you have a one call someone saying five celestial objects were seen around the moon last night uh we have time to take this call or Mr hood called himself Mr hood you're on ground zero go ahead calling from Connecticut\nHello Clyde or yeah hey ah I was a\nI I look at some of the ones all the time and I travel quite a bit mostly at night\nLast night was really clear it was seen stars I had stars and everything's Connecticut's Ohio and I you know I look at their own all the time when it's out as much as I possibly can and that's it was just really weird last night and I ... I see that damn slow\nOn the north\nEastern ... on the right side of the motive here looking at it the right side I Would say it was about to me looking at it was eighty percent\nBrighter than it was darker so it wasn't quite have but it was somewhat\nPass and ah it was weird though all strict in night I could not believe what I what I see I I just it was just really weird and then here you are talking about what happened last night and it's like what the hell\nYeah really I mean\nWell there there were some guy the Johnny ex army the name of the video stream or there were some guys is actually a shot some footage\nA from a were they were and they saw a cluster go around the moon and near the moon and others say they thought hit the moon\nAre getting more moon footage uh uh sent to me that oh there you have your plume I have another video of this plume sort of a kind of a Milky kind of weird color\n... around the moon I'm there you know\nThat there was it yeah it was weird and I you know it gets out when you look at the shadow the mowing the right side of the dark side but it was just started I which I couldn't figure out it was stored I kept looking at it looking at it and looking at thrown out all night\nWhen I got closer towards a western part of the United states uh\nIt was it cleared up and the Mona was Vegas how I mean I could see it then I you know I should shut my day off I stopped and\nTurned myself off but uh that's up throughout\nThe light from the time I bought it so I stopped around four or five o'clock in the ... well\nThat morning at somebody sent me a somebody sent me a video of the moon and in the cloud and coming in and it's not something they're and they're saying nothing happened to the moon the infield there well do you see a little white headline like being in the sky and the\n\nNow need is designed to hunt cosmic rays from outer space so the high energy neutrino community was buzzing with excitement when\nHis instrument detected particles it seemed to be blasting up from earth instead of zooming down from space because cosmic rays shouldn't do that and scientists began to wonder whether these mysterious beans are made of particles never seen before\nNow\nMore anomalous activity was reported recently when scientists monitoring the Ross ice shelf in western Antarctica\nAnd this was just recently\nThey were monitoring the Ross ice shelf and the western part of Antarctica and they caught something\nThey caught a signal\nAnother signal that this time I don't think I'll be shutting down radio stations where this signal okay the other single from the armada for some reason every radio station most every radio station at my network went down when I played it but I don't think there's going to show what this is\nThis is what makes it all even the more scarier okay they have these ultra sensitive seismic sensors in Antarctica\nAnd what they discovered\nWhat they discovered where some sounds\n\nThat resemble those are the Nineteen fifties B movie about aliens arriving on earth it's it's a it's a strange time it's like it's like something out of a\nOh I don't know\nThe Forbidden Planet it's like something out of Forbidden Planet\nOkay\nAnd beyond being spooky these sounds are making people wonder if there's something ... going on right\nNow\nSuddenly ominous going on in space something going on under the ice shelf of Antarctica and there are plenty of scientists but you know the saying not it's not bring its seismic waves if if the wind blowing on the ice it's you know they they've all these ideas\nBut of course the trap seismic waves are are are actually setting out sound through the ice that's what they say pot others are saying wait a minute you know we've been tracking this other stuff we based on what makes you think it's just some signal that we have to pay attention to something we should get it we need to analyze some more\n\nSo on top of the moon the so called blue to nominally the shutdown YouTube last night apart from the Chandra X ray telescopes shutting down at the apple telescope shutting down and the Mars rovers shutting down almost simultaneously\nApart from the Russian said they saw some armada that's looked at me like clusters stars and apart from the signal that I sent you the shutdown radio stations across the country\nI don't want to play you

a hundred and fifty million dollars any field on the second letter and fifty million dollars\nFrom the threat is real\nThreat I mean why up if it's unreal\nI mean this this with okay this is a a a a Politico is the article in Politico NASA's asteroid depends program aiming for more impact it's blaming the first ever demonstration not went off course the funding is in limbo it's not in limbo
