pyramid\nIs forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly leveled rock pointing exactly true north south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years\nAllegedly and yet we know nothing about it a few\nShort decades after Cleopatra's rain is pharaoh any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egyptian history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew\nHow to read I highly ... nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they traveled to Cairo and they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that\nYou know and the answer air quotes\nWe don't know you know\nBut it's really big [laughter] that's that's it it took nearly Eighteen hundred years\nHistory Channel Discovery Channel and you know off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... and focus\nAnd then a ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the vine mystery by Robert Duvall\nAnd that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the pyramids were aligned with the stars and it's just that that's just kind of open something up and and so I started reading a little bit more\nAnd uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I had to you know I I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and life and I met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shock or a few months later and um you know just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um a few a couple of years in\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a y papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those ads linked tonight on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the papers section everything listed in the row a new is the first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight uh you and a Robert football and Robert shock\nSat down and started discussing uh the the snakes and published that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is a this goes back to old Ryan mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the gentleman yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah builds the three pyramids a and a line and and want it to align them with the three belt starts off Iran they had to be some kind of record and you know it was it your pauses believed that uh the architect of the great pyramid the first one of the three it was you know\nAnd so I looked at the stature I started looking at the stature of email and then we looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while I so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on that are on the pedestal if that statue\nUm I noticed it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the uh the book the that they just have co authored origins of the ...\nThis yeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section he's developing a you know something that he knows when the dream Steeler which is you know in front of the parts of the ... between the positive things and\nThere was a a so he was talking basically about the things in the sky and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about this things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the pure events were built if there was a schemes then it's it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been a mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remembered the line is on the pedestal one thing led to another I posted something on my Facebook page\nRobert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or at the um I think it was causing the origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast at night I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than ... minutes and\nWe uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight yeah why is it that the mother gives a lot to do in general but you had the great pyramid the great things\nAre two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBut he's not documented the anywhere\nIn Egypt history where you would think well you know do you do to love to write everything that he loved to go to tell their story and not only that but taxes and and accounting in season everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the grades things in the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy um I I mean you know the you want to answer you could give is that maybe we just we haven't found a record store the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or or maybe total absence um and of course that was the problem with this things you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nAn inscription that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something that leads to things um\n[noise] the pyramids we um you know when you are in ... when you buy the great pyramid there's a tune from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years after a you know who fool key ops was alive and if you walk into that tune to is actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the uh in in in the two of them is called uh the whole rise of coup fool and next to it it's the um the you know the the conference grade so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid\nSo they call that cover his grade and coup whose job it was called their whole lives of Google\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is the glaring exception you don't really see too much\nDo they expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have but but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other something about how was builder who built it or the year was built you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that it can be all\nThe way to have auditors um you know fifth century but see now this was in during personal rule um two thousand years after the fact and and here what is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers [noise]\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know you're saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plateau and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up to box but\nYou would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's got to\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is the great things yet we also have those same issues and if it wasn't for the dream style a while and the inventory Stella we may not know anything at all\nBut yes\nThat was the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn of a um twentieth century that may be tougher laws to force who is the author of the dream still up between the parts of the things that he is the one who built it that was actually being debated\nUm but ah and there is a there is a small\nReference to pray but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it definitely does not say that he built it [noise]\nUm and so that's the drinks are like the image towards the ... the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when ... when I ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same at the ... the Greek name kudos to Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that the mentors dealer says three other perfectly with ... came to the ... things already existed in fact it was broken the repair that\nAnd then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queen Newt so\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leading off right now the coast to coast damn our nearest you'd be church or ... my news said is ... and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nWind up ... ... ...\nTake unlimited Katie's morning noon or night you can always know how your heart is doing\nCardio ... much peace of mind and your pocket for only Ninety nine dollars forty or that I visit hardy a dot com K.

A. dot com and\nYou're listening to news talk Ninety five point five [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWalking back to the coast to coast am I ... church it's the great pyramid all my ... be or we get to the great pyramid\nOr ... minute say Saudi and my new uh we were talking about the inventory still in the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward and in the dreams della\nA top most the fourth says mentions and in illustrates two things says there\nAnd desert Fox just tweeted\nIs there a second ... thinks well there's two ... says there I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a but is there a second Spanx\nA great question on so that was for that was Robert ... who is interpreting the second things uh as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo [noise]\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question that's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things uh and\nAnd it's it's a great question and it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is a ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these depictions are um you know they're on the unmistakable so so the answer to this question specifically of course it hasn't been found there is but there are stories uh Arab historians referred to\nAn actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the granted was used to build mosques so they're they're apparently was physical things\nAre on the other side of denial but is there are things buried under the fans are that say west of a conference pyramid it's possible\nThe\n... and ... you had mentioned that uh she\nSaid that he repaired this being but build the great pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the image ... is saying that he was just to repair guy but he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why the discrepancy\nUh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as he had of course Egypt colleges are most Egypt causes do not accept the inventories de la as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we countered there's arguments so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so it to your question\nUm they're the uh you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egyptian means to be a means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the with the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the ... the combination is pat him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of the sellout or is a is a strip of tax where you know the pyramid building as mentioned and they are the verb that this is not\nFurther a qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuilt\nUm is that a hundred per cent proof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the tires of rare that was found in ... in the right to see\nYou know they are saying well you okay this is the powers talks about tour store and being ... or ... or um but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and ah who was a it means they interview you have written the other day he made a good point you said that uh he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was back failed\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour I took ... that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nCourses and then you back so later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind\nAbout it and there was a quite a bit of relatives are you ah you know pyramids that coup was dealing with uh also one of the ... why do why they could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramid\nThere are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes\nYes yes there is a there is a reference to a head Knutson\n'em and hit Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who went to the news and so she was supposedly it's clean\nAnd uh he build a pyramid for her the southern most of the three ah of the three a green permits that are on an empty field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but\nIn the human Tories though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting to sell out because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a princess so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that she I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we've we think is the poop shows that she was a print says\nSo that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then don't you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or a an old Cyrus on this Stella and that those are much further reasons why Egypt colleges reject this though because they're saying\nYou know if this were an old getting them story or at the time of coup who these ... ah you know as as an aside as we're not yet a weren't being worship there weren't not official states sanctions or the eighties and we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nI'm like you know it's it's contentious I I don't want to make it sound like we have the outs or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nAnd then there's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling may don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same man with the same pair flight and those would be more simple to build\nAnd you would you would expect those to be just as elegant even you know more complex yeah they're not and they don't work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing a A R is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just call me that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality of you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm I'm a you know middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old kingdom and\nNow let's get to or what happened last year which was the big news about his new chamber above the grand gallery yeah\nThen last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yeah after we haven't been told over and over again\nAnd it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there well clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is what are the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing\nUm and and what I like about it is that it was non invasive um you didn't have to drill old she didn't have to you know like a\nAlmost seven years later the Ryan is a happy

Kathy\nYou like that my news you like that the area [laughter] okay I\nHave a day or I always love hearing is that all that it may have more do you play so great for me they gave the power\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I've got two questions and then I've got a great little short clean quick ... just at the end\nOf the first\nQuestion is who is credited with Jimmy\n... or the deciphering and learning to read hieroglyphics and then the second question is\nAll Howard graphics found go back recap in Egypt in that area of the world the same however are good things that are found in the pyramids of Mexico central and south ...\nIs\nThe ... so the question is how are you asking if there are a hero cliff lipic inscriptions and go back like that that is that what you're asking\nOh no I'm asking are the ... that are written all the ... and Egypt on a pair of the civil war and go back like that the all the same Ira Glass objects that are found all the pyramids and Mexico and central and South America\nAh okay I understand I'm not I don't think so they are there different higher there are different ... and it's interesting you I've seen this question because you are\nYou are basically giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak you you're saying that the era lipic inscriptions and go back you can't be in other words you're implying there is a there is there is writing there and um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be onto something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry okay although I'm not an archaeologist I don't have any fancy degrees after my name right but there are certain things that are are in\nNot only on the stones at at go Beckley Tempe but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures are they in the same I don't know there is an H on the belt\nThat looks very similar to the age blocks and ... are are they related I don't know right there are some astrological signs in Beckley tabby [noise] are they are they representing the zodiac uh that uh we're in then Darrow\nAnd throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world after that are they the same I don't know but uh go back lead happy being that old certainly is indicating that they were the first is the oldest is the same language\nAnd then that no I I don't think so but the ...\nFirst is the oldest he's at the same language and then that no I I don't think so but the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic cheese like the I call it their knees age I'm the bells when it looks like but did that age that age is repeated a\nThere's a very exciting possibility um regarding that question to ask and go back to the Chevy um end it's regarding the symbol that you mentioned Jimmy there's a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I ... I might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know what\nWe'll do writing your own coast to coast oh there was one other oh one other point that I wanted to make about uh uh go Beckley Tempe and it just got away from me Mary it was right there but it just disappeared\nAnd mentioned it later on in the show thank you very no problem I throw a absolutely\nAnd uh the phone lines Manu I expected this ah are completely jammed up let's get one more call them on all of them yeah let's let's go to this is a let's go to school to my dad in New York my uh Europe next\nYes good morning gentlemen and ... and now a new I guess I have a two part question than I'd like to know if he um\nHad looked at any of that ... highway second set up the highway of any age and I and I'm also I think that might be the one that deals with the founding medical knowledge that they had that if if I'm correct on that particular one\nThe second part now listen over there and whether he and and and the hobbit and and shock ... had can fit in some of the um\nThe African African American ballet who studied the net net net too at a wicked name on the language which is is is still out of that that ... that to a\nPhrase itself deals with say quit and whether he looked at people who call themselves or you\nCan it for and that in the kitchen you know before they did Greeks gay men and consider themselves that they can that colleges cabinet is when we got word from for chemistry and also um the what you call the thing\nWas that was the word that degree Scott came up with and to me\nWhat negative side with the little if not what it is and the African American dollars that I'm thinking of they call it a little odd that horizon Saturday you turn to renew old saw oh sad if you follow them a question and I'll listen off the air\nThank you mad Bree okay three great questions and my new I'm going to get to them but that just goes to show you the extent of knowledge here with the ... uh they don't play around on\nThe first question um I I I Am all I have heard of the ... but the the one that I have looked at more specifically regarding medical\nInformation is the ... the trick actually in my book um because on the reverse of the eagles PR piracy there is an interesting calendar or that's fixed Egypt colleges and I think um I found a solution to a this calendar and that's described in the book\nUm and and yes it's a this was in the ... so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about piracy\nCalendar and that's described in the book um and and yes it's a this is an ... so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about piracy that's I think over sixty foot long\nUh it describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments and their remedies\nUm and this ... I Believe dates to the middle kingdom and and reaches back a most likely a probably to him or taps time so um if there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nThe second part yeah Ken Mitch and uh which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a group that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was the southern Egyptian culture\nAnd that script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from two of 'em you Jay\nA king scorpions and that is I think were the African roots sly\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt a ... probably from Bhutto and Bhutto was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably as opposed to any uh with the live on\nAnd so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a picture all so it was picked up perhaps\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa and maybe you know ... maybe I'm maybe even further south and that\nAnd she brought up another really good point before we get to the break we've got about thirty seconds the Greeks adapting uh the analogy a chemistry coming from candidate\nRight yes ... as she I think she mentioned it stinks so uh my uh we we think that speaks was making before uh before Africa game I think there was a we think it was the lioness and her name was make eat and by the way that's also probably an African of Africa or Joe\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast a damn it's\nAll Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long\nOr guessing I my new save Saturday his paper is right there click on his website the coast to coast am we're going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us [noise]\n\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to ... am done\n[noise] to me\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is the perfect school for you\nArizona State university offers over one hundred and fifty highly ranked at great programs one hundred percent on line\nYou learn the same degree as he went on campus from wherever you are on your scheduled class I ask you one line except for the most transfer credits for information live two three five five line seven\nLearned for yourself ... ... ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report and learn to thrive with Arizona State university for more information about all the one line tax live to three five five one south and that's how the eat two three five five wind sat on us\nNews and talk in billings news talk Ninety five point five [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nBack to the coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I guess in a ... minute save Saturday more talking about uh the great pyramid\nAnd the discovery of not only chambers inside of the great pyramid\nBut his formula in his white paper they published last week and how to locate them and I want to say really quick minute that Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now and you can follow me on Twitter at a ... church radio\nAnd post your questions or comments about Tonight Show\nEither of for me or my new right there and this question just came in before we get to a\nA page three twenty eight of of of this report\nA minute this is the question this is from ... Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurements of the great pyramid or possibly coordinate and that those coordinates point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe our courts\nEvan yes um I haven't\nThe right to propose\nIntegrate see this is this is when I really enjoy a about the coast audience\nAnd I guess like you're so there is so much information out there but there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid yeah and this is one of those questions where the math of the great pyramid\nHas revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and that they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alison green who is looking he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able\nTo connect uh the uh the title page of the ... Shakespeare sonnet\nTo the coordinates or not to heaven but uh of course Allen might say it is having a ... to the coordinates of the great pyramid and specifically ah the the coordinate Thad Allen just discovered a fall right next to them I stop off game you know\nWhich is next to the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have him on coast a a very soon probably next month\nAnd it is you're absolutely right in the title page of the sun and it's with a Shakespeare\nAnd his work Alan Greenspan work at deciphering that page and what he's revealed\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it it is absolutely incredible and we'll have Marcos next month\nThe okay so now as the the top half of the pyramid yes as you said at the beginning of the show let's get to this it's a page number three twenty eight everybody in the ... the the ... report ...\nThe top half you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where we had been told there are none\nGlide right and so um you know when we talked about a um a confident for your Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring the ah found is when you get to guns and brings door\nAdjust pay for the the the floor off the off the off the canal drops suddenly it's there's a depression\nAnd the way he isn't Turpin one of the two ways he interpreted that is that must be a space that allow that forward to cave in slightly so that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know the courses that we've just been discussing\nThere is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in\nAnd that might correlate with uh if I go back to three twenty six well quick that could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth\nUm and and then that let's go and so you know so there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been detected by me on again\nNow the row mutts or let's let's get to this first second and the uh the audience is gonna look\nThe road mutts or let's let's get to this first second and the uh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting in a row eighty four which is a shaft\n'em and are you going up words every body of one of those seven a and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the construction\nThat have a different size in a different thickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as a show and going all the way to the surface and that is incorrect so I just use the illustration is is an old illustration um so that if that particular chef did not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of twenty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basic the establishing in the lower part of the pyramid I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the ceiling in other words there is a space at designed space not thought you know an accidental space\nAnd designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses\nNo you just got back from Egypt yes we have to discuss the ongoing move on a project their which uh did help them find this have any this new chamber above the grand gallery\nYou describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw a new detectors being place I'm at this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up the grand gallery to the king chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and there was confirmed as the scanning\nNow for the audience tell them what the new on detectors actually do where do they used for\nBy so these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so and cosmic radiation hit the atmosphere of particle called them you on his created enemy on is\nA negative charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier ah than electron but it can pass through solid matter if it's a travel at the speed of light is lifetime is just over two seconds\nI'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs and in this case you can basically quote unquote X ray to pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then uh it showed ... then you have a chance\nTo see his face or because the yarns will travel more rapidly through open air than you know through solid stolen so if you have a space in the ... way of what you're what you're looking for than those viewers will arrive more rapidly and they and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors plays in the grand gallery could they be used to find the [noise] the chambers that you were proposing in the upper half of the pyramid\nIt is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges\nIt is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifact jewel\nAnd I think they using this angle to concern that's a big voice is real but it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of scan that yes that there could be some some of the lower ones maybe a you know on the graphic if we go back\n... draw on the economy was raising the standard of living doesn't ...

break this is coast to coast am [noise]\nAnd I'm I'm I think Roberts uh ... was telling me about this I think uh you can there's you can't stand in there it's maybe six foot deep\nI'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but um but you know maybe there's some\nBut I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but um but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that um\nI can tell you that the uh you know the world to cruise shouldn't um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling the quote was inclusions\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there is another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves or into the things that are looking for a chambers\nAnd then you know the one that you just mentioned of course we know from seismic analysis that they are here to our space is under this beings\nAnd one of those spaces specifically which is what Robert shock or a was studying uh years ago um is has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um they might be something in it that self interest\nYou know he did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back woods another research expedition to all bleed room right\nYeah yeah first of all what we are what we would like to do first is to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced uh\nFive small graffiti and maybe electric conductivity studies and to really get a very detailed look especially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know if you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven and ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw space about two meters\nA deep and uh and and then Roberts ah you know did his studies ... a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that this phase is five meters deep so we have a little bit of a death problem and then of course you know that's I have lots of marketing or drilled in that area\nBut we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far west from where we think the chamber is so they didn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them in of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so what we want to do is you know just like a you know just like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non evasive study and really finding out the space\nAnd we'll be having a good idea where it is then with permission of course then we're try a small probe into that space and see what's at and\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey is talk to about ... and there's there's there's rumors going around you are quite a while it would just be great to finally uh but just to bed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and sinks temple and there was a little depression and it's wet\nUm you can just you can just see the the water coming up and if if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber\nAnd so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber or the very first thing we have to do is to a very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue\nWhatever it might be inside um you know sufficient enough itself becomes a very difficult project but it's doable Robert things it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly\nSpeaking of the things that came in on twins\nUh on Twitter and I have heard that it does things may have been a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small for its body\nYes well if we think\nWe think it was a female lie and so that part is partially we agree with that yes I don't think it was a person's head so um but we think that was a lie in this there before and the head of the line as was weak carved into a what we see today\nNow um I Know that you tend to be a little reticent to talk about alien jury tee when it comes to ...\nI I leave all doors

intelligent life out there but I think I think there is it's a very likely and especially the physics of of a of the universe you know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following this\nBut it you know there is one way that you can explain everything as a projection and if that's the case\nOr then just like Robert Duvall proposed in Cosby gloom is one way you can explain or some of these contacts is there may be a message that gets broadcasts across the universe through you know through um ah through a Clinton fields\nAnd that message ends up on our end somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid\nUm I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is but we have to have some proof I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see some solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line or a Robin Vancouver Rob

Monique how are you there\nOkay I didn't do that so let's go right in order to go to Mary in New Jersey Mary Europe next on coast\n... hurricane you and your calf I'm kind of something like four years older or younger and somebody of a shiny unmanned standing there with the sword from the garden of Eden and he just don't frightful block and building and the native to never end they said\nHow are you doing that he had I any that I Am in that town now I think that is from Bob Ehrlich\nA tree of life\nIt seems like off the Bible and the tiny round in Egypt Abraham right in there for fade have found that in their ... their hair and um the Lyon\nCounty office where um they hated the woman little crush ahead of them because the evil I found like that it could that possibly be the original thought in the garden and the\nUh the dad is the million dollar question Mary and thank you for that uh my new gardening beaten in Egypt\nUm yeah I well first of all I I Want to recommend an author to you a merry I'm a David roles so he's a he's really done some excellent work on a ... a basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt\nUm and so you may find some answers or you know with him so I think he's producing a television series and he's with books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think Timothy Mahoney if I remember this correctly\nUm but yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the uh the early ... um what they were in Egypt um I think\nA ... for specially Joseph I'm that's what David role is describing Joseph real figure and a live in a in a in a place called a virus which isn't a delta and had a palace and was that was basically a A N tuned in\nSo in a place called a virus which is in the delta and had a palace and was that was basically a A N tuned in a pyramid and he was such an important official at the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know this virus community disappears and this is archaeological evidence and well piece together um and David role is basically saying that\nAh where are you worried historians got it wrong is that they they were looking for the biblical story in a in the new kingdom and it it David role is finding that it was probably a couple of centuries earlier\nThis or just came in on Twitter this is from Jay and Jay's as I heard the surgeon tools for found indeed you shouldn't pyramids that doctors use now true or false\nUm I well what was found is that a is a a tool that looks like a ... a like a small it's like a fish tell\n'em what on I I'm not sure that was a surgeon's tool but of course we don't know um it was found in the I think it was in the northern ... a shaft of the queen chamber by a waymen Dixon\nUm and he uh and it's now and the British Museum a with a with a ... with a granted ball um but whether or not that was a surgery with you and other than that I don't know of any surgical tools found inside of the games up here on ms\nLet's go to bill in Oregon bill you're up next on Kos added Manu\nName on there Hi Jimmy yeah this is a really academic discussion tonight and I've got nothing nothing against that congratulate you on your discovery\nBut my question is um okay so I just want you to speculate a little bit is that you just chambers or for construction in engineering\nCould they be like for instance for architects to put gold on the Internet or could um if their theological could be you know some sort of burial chambers for for those I'm the king wanted to proceed him into the um afterlife\nYeah great question yeah great question bill I'm Glad I'm Glad you asked that because I Will speculate now I I'm I'm looking forward to ... I think\nBecause there is obviously I'm proposing up to ten chambers I was thinking well what if it's the logical what could that be and I think the answer is the end they add\nSo inherently ... a day or the ... was known for the center of the worship of the nine major God this kind of like the pantheon of of the ancient Egyptians\nAnd I think ah these chambers are dedicated to each one of these deities and and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one that is the crucial chamber\nOr wherever we may find the kind of things that you just mentioned are but I'm suspecting there could be ... and there are with inscriptions\nI'm so that would be very exciting if that if we're if that were ever to be found um but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm all I think I'm with John P o die think this it's still on the table that there may have been space is there that\nHelp of workers to pull up the stones or to the top it's possible\nUm and we'll just have to wait for the next scan I think the next county will give us some new information\nNow I Am heard some rumors minute that they have already got inside of the new chamber above the grand gallery and have removed items from there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nThose rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's put it that way\nIt would certainly help the tourism I mean it indoors or less right\nWhich has dropped off I Am heard you know you just got back from Egypt where I Am heard from so many friends that have been going to Egypt for decades\nAnd that you can as a tourist because ... years past it was crowded all the buses were there you had to wait in line and there was a you know thousands of people on the ... but today you can burn truly be the only person there\nYeah that I had there was a couple of days when I felt like that Jimmy I um you know it was not\nThere were there were parts I think he's a plug toll where I was the only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders\nSo yeah tourism has been down and they um you know they want to build a new museum and uh and of course they have to if they discover something they are they're going to show it to the world so that people come and look at it I that's why I'm hopeful that if they have something that they haven't shown us yet that we'll we'll find out about\nThis uh this is from Twitter this is from David I Love this question actually did the Nazis research Egypt shouldn't areas as depicted in the raiders of the Lost Ark\n[laughter] ah that's a good\nQuestion it is a great question it's a great question the question\nUm\n[noise] you know I I I don't know I don't know for sure I Know that Germans this was before

[noise] yeah there's a there's an opening yes um yeah I I take it that within the past year the Egyptian authorities have removed about a half dozen walk I had a\nWhole back by the hail walk by the tail end yeah yes\nYeah ... or the south side the ladder get over it and you have any comments like we're looking for hidden chambers but obviously we've already found them right there when we get to know what's inside\nNow he's talking about the south side of the rear of the things\nThis ... I see the south side yes um there is\nA ... or so Robert scan did show on both\nSides if I remember this correctly or there were spaces under under the flanks of the things which were extending backwards yes um and ah but\nI mean I have no ... I don't know you know if when it when a antiquities goes and investigate those things and their own published a data you know there's no way for me to know what they found\nUm you know so your guess is as good as mine but I Am based on a base on to the chamber under the left paw that we think exists and we think it's a manmade chamber\nI Am pretty sure that's not a blind chamber I think that chamber may just be the entry all to something that goes further back\nYou know um and so yeah I'm with you I think uh I think that there is more more than than we know and maybe they know it and they haven't published it\nJ widen or ... told me that he was down in that very same area\nAnd he's walking around he was alone and there was nobody around him so we go to the back of the things in the south side by the tail and he looked down on the ground and he sees what he thinks is a piece of wood covered with dirt\nYeah so he he leads over grams would picks it up and it's a a piece of plywood\nAnd he'd lifted up and looked and it was an entry way it was a tunnel going straight down and as he was looking into the whole a guard came up and yelled at him he dropped the wood and he was escorted out of there\nYeah and he's a Jimmy I'm here to tell you I'm no matter what I personally lifted up a piece of wood\nYeah and he's a Jimmy I'm here to tell you I'm no matter what I personally lifted up a piece of wood and looked into a tunnel underneath the south side\nOf the ... by the scale of this things and he saw himself but yet they'll say that it doesn't exist but he saw with his own eyes yeah\nI I don't have any doubts about uh the ... the I think that there is there's the ours basis under this things the main question is does it go anywhere or there's just a blind LBJ that's the main question\nWell you brought up something else too about I'm Andrew Collins now his\nHis that is one of the craziest videos I've ever seen I mean ... and his nerve wracking and if you've got claustrophobia in any way you watch that video and you almost can't get through it\nBut he did find a tunnel a that started up in the north west corner where the bird uh two was gone and he finds a hole in the back of one of the tunes are for these birds that were there\nAnd it turned out to be hundreds and hundreds of feet long that stretched out and appeared to continue underneath the pyramid complex there wasn't supposed to be anything there then ... denied that there were any tunnels there\nLater went on his own expedition and film crew and went into the tunnel complex which again wasn't supposed to exist but it does\nBut there's also a potential half way from the ... or from the ah the old Cyrus shaft\nUm you know that's I I don't know if it was ever explored but I Know Robert was down there Hamas was down there filming and it was actually a documentary years ago\nI'm In you know he was really excited about the shaft um of course Egypt colleges are telling us that these are you know late period shops and these are not from they don't dare to the old kingdom\nUm but you know I'm not so sure it might be that the upper ... the I'm Talking about the specifically I'm Talking about the old Cyrus shop it's possible that the upper two layers are they taking them but the the lower level is much older we we don't we I don't think we know for sure and it may connect um but yeah without a probing\nUm nowadays we have the technology to probe very small spaces um but yeah until we get the data we just don't know\nYeah you're talking about the two of us iris\nYeah the to write the access is on the south side of the ... of conflict causeway uh and then that's how you and then you go under it and then uh it's three layers or or three levels rather and the lowest one is the one where you had this our topic is submerged in water and the surrounding database and had sort of the shape of the ...\nFor a house I'm a and a and you know it had this conference inside and and that the four pillars around and it was fascinating um you know this ah this some the symbolism of it but the dating of it I I'm I'm a I'm a little bit doubtful about the official story\nWell he went down almost a hundred feet and the end of Hitler's that were surrounding the area where there is our topic is again underwater or those four pillars had fallen over but it was something that was also supposed to exist on the ... the plateau and there was\nThat's right and so any inventories the you know we talked about it earlier there are so Robert and I think there are the the the meant dimension of the house of Cyrus or on the inventory steal it actually may be referring to ... to that\nOlder too and then it was being intruded on\nYou know we don't think we know\nOf ... before we had to the break or how much do you think is still love to be discovered on the gays applied to there's an awful lot of sand there yeah\nBut well my my favorite place to look at it and and of course Robert Robert favorite place to look would be a besides\nThe you know uh besides that left paw is in front of the two temples if we could dig deep in front of the temple is you know where people nowadays uh watch the light show\nA there could be the actual entry to this passage that we think is under the things that could be in front of the things temple and then the other thing is we I predict innate mentors to our paper we're predicting\nThat there may have been also a temple or east of the valley temple a and that it was dedicated to Cyrus and that would be also underground so that will be one of my favorite places and then you mentioned as things on the other side is there's things on the west side\nYou know of course if that's a great place to look a is there another sings maybe those three places will be my favorite places to go\nWhen you look at when I find the the most intriguing about the gays applied to of course everything facing west and pacing the Nile ah there's there's a lot there had been for reasons with the causeway and the entrances and so forth but\nWhen you look at the original survey maps that were done in the Eighteen hundreds of the games are plateau there is an awful lot of that is being ... the uh the pyramid complex facing a west in northwest there's a lot there and\nUh not only were the tunnels represented all the way back into the uh early Eighteen hundreds but there is a construction that is represented in those ... original survey maps that really hasn't been explored sense\nYeah yeah that's right that's right there there there are some places in Egypt that cannot be export because there are military zones or you know for example the the northern a pyramid of is that why it or are we on a you know this is an incredible amazing place\nA with a huge trends and this Oval Office placement\nUm but there's nothing going on since the sixties because it's a military zone so yeah I mean to your point in the in the west field way out and I do notice for a fact I don't know if this is a military zone right now but you know some areas are basically off limits and yeah there was secrets hiding under the fat and potentially\nAnd who knows where we are going to be able to on earth them\nWe'll be right back this coast to coast am stay with us\n[noise] um [noise]\nNever missed a detail issue or a guess sign up

finally starting to give up uh some of its mysteries so with that let's let's get right back to the phones are we've got one last a segment here let's go east of the Rockies Larry out in Jacksonville, Florida\nMourning mourning mourning jam\nOr good morning Larry Ann how are you in the ah hurricane Bree okay\nWell I'm a I'm a God man I'm okay\nIt was a such a wide big storm that it it it affected

does life reading uh postponing march Nineteen sixty eight\nBut ah he talked about between ten thousand eleven thousand period um there was a migration of the car paging region\nAnd they invaded and conquered Egypt [noise] one of the leaders of this trial was re Tom ... case they\nWill dream candidate it of course\nI'm ... all are wanting to stay was basically the chamber of the teams chamber negotiation chamber it it's not a to write um according to written as you might check that out at the very end lightning and the original capstone what's courts\nUm ... the pyramid pyramid has granted in it which produces under pressure five electricity\nAnd you may know all that's already happened and maybe we're done that\nI've heard the theories yes um especially you know the electricity theory I've heard about that of course Edgar Casey\nWho produce energy just tell your occurrence earth currents of the Nile his rerouted it did route uh adjacent to the pyramid or under the pyramid and the uh the purpose of it was to generate a electricity\nMalaria let me ask you a question instead of you asking my new a question [laughter] are you reading if I can answer to cure absolutely\nYou see a you\nKnow and Christopher done and others have talked about uh the the pyramid being a machine and possibly a generator of power and energy on that is the case Larry what would they have used it for\n... to ... to provide a labor free [laughter] energy\nYeah you know what and Larry thank you for the phone call my new that's exactly what a Christopher done\nAs said to me last week while he talked about it for years of course um it wasn't a big revelation with me but that it was energy for the for the people of Cairo in Egypt\nYeah you know you know what I really love about Christopher done this that he he looks at the observations and he puts it into a model that is a completely uncovered by prejudices and biases\nHe just fits all the observations into a model and that is he you know if I if I were doing the investigation he'd be the first call to have them on board um you know so I yeah I he's amazing absolutely I I Love the interview and I've read has worked before and very impressive person\nLet's go to wild card who's going to Carol in Charleston D.C Carol you're up next on coast\nHow Hi Carol hello Carol\n... several years ago ... last only twice for both found found artifacts and thought oh ... oh outweigh underground oh did you\nAnd in fact I thought oh man found Cleopatra him on that when I'm there ground oh did you\nCarry anything that you\nKnow I as far as I Know it's I I I haven't looked into this in detail as far as I Know but to them is not discover it but you know maybe it has been discovered and it's not published as possible\nWoman's your second question Carol\nAh without being in archaeology is how do you go about getting involved with one of their research grade\nYeah that's a great question I so yeah I have to I Want to make sure I explained to every one so I'm not an archaeologist I'm also not a credential Egypt calls is this is for me it started as a hobby and of course if a serious endeavor\nUh but you have to be associated with an Institute a research place or university which I Am now I Am a you know association affiliated with Boston University\nUm and so then you can apply for a permit and you have to you know you have to do the application you have to just\nUh they have to review the application and they may say no and you don't have a recourse um you'd also will have to see if they allow us but if it's not me it's okay or somebody else you know my my I think you know I wanted to get the information out there are other people can see it other researchers\nAnd they might be able to get a permit to investigate further and that's okay with me\nYou should do the same thing ... are you researching on your own now\nI'm interested in what they found an ally curious why napping apple ... added that and they said they national nature twice\nYeah and and Carol ... one of the things that that I like to do and I encourage others is blog right research and and and publish and self publish yourself and and continue because once you start to do that because I Do it myself and and certainly so does my new\nThat others out there are\nAttracted to you and they will find your information and then they started sharing their information with you and you suddenly have a network right in front of you so I I encourage that and I encourage blogging and creating your own website just like my new did and and look what happens in the end\nLet's uh let's go east of the Rockies is going to Manuel in San Antonio Texas you're up next door goes man you\nDon't give them how you doing and I know a thing

game but there was also one of them now and how Peru and there was a little ones the mythical\nIf those ... made the same thing if the bird the same thing oh that's a good question and you're putting my other question I wanted to know how can we get all this stuff and come up before and you say right off the bat if what if money\nIs called a lot of money and stuff in there\nYeah you're absolutely I'm not hearing I'm hearing the question\nI mean he was saying that you had brought up a ... why you answer this question that why hasn't this been brought up before and it always comes down to money that's where the devils his point but the first\nOr the birds a dinner represented a throughout different cultures around the world on a different temples and and pyramids and right and we're seeing it over and over\nRight so the big ...\nIn the world on a different temples and pyramid and we're seeing it over and over\nRight so the big the the the most important question in my mind okay which is probably the same question that ah you know early research has worked confronted with when they looked at the Egyptian ... lives\nOur we have two systems of justice in this country and it's become patently obvious to everybody and it's very simple if you are a Democrat\nAnd you've engaged in any kind of questionable illegal activity you get a pass if you're a Republican you don't people know that we have two systems of justice in Washington and the Democrats are not held accountable the same way Republicans are we have to\nLive the system's just\nRush Limbaugh we do to turn into one news

S. A. Z. it's been four years and\nWelcome to everyone listening all around the world all across the United states [noise]\nProgram and do you live [noise] from the great pyramid headquarters [noise] that's right [noise] which tonight is the coast to coast AM Studios right here in Los Angeles California standing in on this beautiful Sunday evening I Am your host Jimmy church and tonight\nMy guess is my new save Saturday\nEverybody let's get started [noise] listen to me [noise]\nEverybody wants the gift that keeps on giving that special gift [noise]\nOne that you don't put in a drawer and forget about no [noise] it's it's the one gift that you can visit or use every single day and tomorrow and the day after that and for that\nSingular perfect present that's all wrapped up in a boat for this planet\nAnd every one on it it's the great pyramid of Egypt you don't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving the great pyramid\nIs forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly level rock pointing exactly true north south east and west\nAnd it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years allegedly and yet we know nothing about it\nA few short decades after Cleopatra's reign of sparrow any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egypt should history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read ... nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they would travel to Cairo and they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that you know and the answer\nHistory Channel Discovery Channel and you know off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... in in focus\nAnd then a ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the Orion mystery by Robert Duvall and that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the pyramids were aligned with the stars and I it's just that that just kind of open something up\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more\nAnd uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I had to you know I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and life and I met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shock or a few months later and um you know just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um a few a couple of years in\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those ads linked to night on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the papers section everything listed in the row a new was first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight\nUh you and a Robert Duvall and Robert shock\nSat down and started discussing ah the the snakes and released that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is a this goes back to old Ryan mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the two gentlemen yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah builds the three pyramids a and a line and and want it to align them with a three belt starts off Iran they had to be some kind of record and you know it was it your policy is believed that uh the architect of the great pyramid the first one of the three with him you know\nAnd so I looked at the stature I started looking at the stature of email and then we looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while I so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on that are on the pedestal of that statue\nUm I noticed it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the or the book the that they just have co authored origins of the things which is an amazing book by the way\nIt is yeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section he's developing a you know something that he knows and the dream Steeler which is you know in front of the cause of the ... between the positive things and\nThere was a a so he was talking basically about the things in this guy and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about the things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the servants were built if there was a schemes that and it's it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so\nAnd with the line is on the pedestal one thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page Robert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or at the um I think it was cosmic origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast at night I knew I only you know I\nHad to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and\nWe uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight yeah why is it that the and one of the games are my two in general but you had the great pyramid the grades things\nAre two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBut he's not documented the anywhere\nIn Egypt history where you would think\nWell you know the ... love to write everything [laughter] he'd love to go and tell their story and not only that but taxes and and accounting in season everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the grades things in the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nYeah that that's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy um I I mean you know the one answer you could give us that maybe we just we haven't found the records or the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or or maybe total absence um and of course that was the problem with the things you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nAn inscription that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something at least the things I'm\nThe pyramids we um you know when you're on next so that when you buy the great pyramid there is a tune from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years after a you know ... was alive and if you walk into that to him do is actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the uh in in in the two of them is called uh the whole rise of coup fool and next to it it's the um the you know the the conference grade so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid\nSo they call that cover his grade and coup whose job it was called their whole lives of Google\nAnd so this was a brief that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is the glaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou bring to the pyramid yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have right but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other something about how it was built a new bill through the year was build you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that it can do all\nThe way to have auditors um you know fifth century but the you know this was in during Persian rule um two thousand years after the fact and and here what is the writing the way he described\nAnd so it's um I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know you're saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plateau and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up to box but\nYou would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is look great springs yet we also have the same issues and if it wasn't for the dream style a while and the inventory store we may not know anything at all\nBut yes that was the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn of the um twentieth century that may be close to Fort who is the author of the dream still up between the parts of the things that\nHe has to want to build it that was actually being debated um but ah and there is a there is a small reference to pray but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it definitely does not say that he built it [noise]\nUm and so that's the drinks are like the image towards the all the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when ... ... what I think overall I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same at the ... the Greek name kudos to Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that even towards the lord says three other perfectly with ... came to the plateau distinct already existed in fact it was broken you repair it\nAnd then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queen and you would say\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now the coast to coast am primarily to be church or ... minute said is ... and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nMind up more of us and I just logged on Tuesday in\nFind out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar search

to coast am I'm ... church it's the great pyramid all my big beef or we get to the great pyramid\nOur guest is my new said Sunday and my new uh we were talking about the inventories tell and the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward and end the dreams della a top most the forum\nSays mentions and in illustrates two things is there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second ... thinks well there's two things is there\nI Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... is there a second Spanx\n... it's a great question on a so that was for that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the seconds things uh as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo [noise]\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question that's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things\nAre and that that will end its things is in the underworld and of course he's a is\nA ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these depictions are um you know they're on mistake of all so so the answer to this question specific of course it hasn't been found there is there are stories uh Arab historians referred to\nAn actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build mosques so they're they're apparently was a physical things\nAre on the other side of the Nile but it's there it's things buried under the fans are that say west of ah coffers pyramid it's possible\nThe\nTeam and tore Stella you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired the banks\nTory Stella you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repairs is being but build the greed pyramid there are others that have interpreted the image or ... is saying that he was just a repair guy\nRight and then he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why did discrepancy\nYeah uh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as he had of course ecologist at most Egypt causes do not accept a inventories the la as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we counter there's arguments so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so what's your question\nUm they're the or you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egypt she means to be a means repeat again and if you could sit together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a\nA is a is a strip of ... where you know the pyramid building is mentioned and they are the verb that that this is not\nFurther a qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuild\nUm is that a hundred per cent proof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the ... of ... that was found in ... in the red sea\nYou know they're saying well you okay this is the ... talks about to a store and being ... a\n... a a but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go you have written the other day he made a good point you said that\nUh he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was backfield\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour I to be that that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up to courses and then you back so later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind about it\nAnd there was a quite a bit of relatives a pyramid like who who is dealing with uh also when the ... why do why would there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramid\nThere are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes yes yes there is\nThere is a reference to a head Knutson um hit Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who is going to the news and so she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he build a pyramid for her at the southern most of the three ah off the three ah green permits that are on an empty field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but\nIn the human stories though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting to sell a because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a print says so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that gee I in fact was a princess\nAnd oh Cyrus on this Stella and that those are much further reasons why each apologist reject this though because they're saying\nYou know if this were an ... story or at the time of coup who these ... ah you know as as an aside as we're not yet a work being worship there were not official states sanctions or the eighties\nAnd we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's a contentious I I I don't want to make it sound like we have the ads or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nAnd then there's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling may don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same man's or with the same care\nFlight and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect those to be just as elegant even you know more complex yeah but they're not and they're ... don't work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing a A R is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just call me that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a new since pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality of you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the parents after the old King I'm I'm a you know middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old kingdom and\nNow let's get to a what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yes after we haven't been told over and over again\nAnd it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there well clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is what are the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing um and and what I like about it is that it was non invasive um you didn't have to drill holds you didn't have to you know like a\nA ... the early explorers they used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful\nAnd nowadays uh it's kinda like get your image is telling us you know you wait until you have the technology to to find out about me or without destroying me and I think now we're getting to that

I Believe dates to the middle kingdom and and reaches back are most likely a probably to him or taps time so um yes there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nBarred damage and which was the name of Egypt imports come in a group that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was the southern Egyptian culture\nAnd that script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from two huge a\nA king scorpions and that is I think were the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt of probably from Bhutto\nAnd brutal was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably ... uh with the live on\nAnd so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a ... so it was picked up graphs\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa and maybe you know ... maybe I'm maybe even further south than that\nBut before we get to the break we've got about thirty seconds it was the Greeks adapting ah the etymology of chemistry coming from candidate\nRight yes ... issue I think she mentioned it stinks so we we think the stakes was making before before Africa game I think it was we were I think it was a line is and their name was ... and by the way that's also probably an African of African origin\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast am it's\nAll Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long\nOr guessing I my new save Saturday his paper is right there click on his website the coast to coast am we're going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us [noise]\nYou just\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com\n[noise] even in the uh the um [noise] me on\nSome of them you\n\nThe you want to earn that quality degree from a world renowned university and he said yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is the perfect school for you\nOne hundred and fifty highly rain degree programs one hundred percent on line\nYou learn the same degree as he went on campus from wherever you are on your scheduled press the one line accepts north transfer credits for information live two three five sidelined sapping\nLearned for yourself fly all here with ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report 'em learn to thrive with Arizona State university for more information about all the one line talks live two three five five wind surfing that's how the two three five five wind slapping\nThe best news and talk and buildings news talk now de five point five [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I guess in a ... minute save Saturday more talking about are the great pyramid and the discovery of not only is chambers inside of the great pyramid\nBut his formula in his white paper they published last week and how to locate them and I want to say really quick Manu that Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now and you can follow me on Twitter at a ... church radio\nAnd post your questions or comments about Tonight Show either for me or or buy new right there and this question just came in before we get to a\n... page three twenty eight of of of this report\nA minute this is the question this is from ... Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurements of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that those coordinates point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates to have in\nHeaven yes um I haven't worked I propose\nIt's great to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience\nAnd and I guess like yourself there is so much information out there but there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid yeah and this is one of those questions where the math of the great pyramid\nHas revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and that they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alison green who is looking he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able to collect uh the uh the title page of the fun of Shakespeare sonnet\nTo the coordinates or not to heaven but uh uh of course Allen might say it is ever write a ... to the corners of the great pyramid and specifically a than a quarter of Thad Allen just discovered\nA fall right next to the ... which is next for the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have 'em on coast a a very soon probably next month\nAnd his you're absolutely right in the title page of the sonnets with Shakespeare\nAnd his work Allen greens work at deciphering that page and ... what is revealed is I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it it's it's absolutely\nNever been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it it is absolutely incredible and we'll have ... next month\nThe okay so now as the the top half of the pyramid yes a U.S said at the beginning of the show let's get to this it's a page number three twenty eight everybody in the ... the the ... report ...\nThe top half you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where we had been told there are none\nGlide right and so um you know when we talked about a um a confident you're Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring the ah found is when you get to guns and brings door\nUh just before the the the floor off the off the off the canal drops suddenly it's there's a depression\nAnd the way he isn't chirping and one of the two ways he interpreted that is that must be a space that allow that forward to cave in slightly so that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know these courses that we've just been discussing\nThere is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in\nAnd that might correlate with uh if I go back to three twenty six will quick\nThat could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth um and and then then let's go out and so you know so there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been a detected by me on again\nNow the row mutts or let's let's get to this first second and the\nUh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting at ... eighty four which is a shaft\n'em and are you going up words every body of one o seven a and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the construction\nThat have a different sides in a different thickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as a show and going all the way to the surface and that's incorrect so I just use the illustration is is an old ... I'm so that if that particular chef did not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of forty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basically establishing in the lower part of the pyramid I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the ceiling in other words there is a space at designed space not not you know an accidental space\nAnd designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses you\nKnow you just got back from Egypt yes and we have to discuss the ongoing move on a project their which\nUh did help them find this cabinet ... this new chamber above the grand gallery you describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw new detectors being place I'm at this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber\nPlace um I at this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up to a grand gallery to the king chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and there was confirmed as the scouting\nNow for the audience tell them what the new on detectors actually do where do they used for\nRights so these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so and cosmic radiation hits the atmosphere of particle called them yuan has created enemy on is\nA negative charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier ah than electron but it can pass through solid matter it's travels at the speed of light it's lifetime is just over two seconds\nI'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs and in this case you can basically quote unquote ... pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then a show and then you have a chance\nTo see his face a because the ... will travel more rapidly through open air than you know through solid still and so if you have a space in the ... way of what you're what you're looking for then those nuance will arrive more rapidly and they ... and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these the actors playing in the grand gallery could they be used to find the ... the chambers that you are proposing in the ever happened to him as\nIt is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifacts are all\nAnd I think they using this angle to confirm that the big void is real but it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of scan that yes that there could be some some in the lower ones maybe a you know on the graphic if we go back\nWe keep America beautiful the nonprofit working with millions of people just like you to end lettering improve recycling and unify our communities\nBecause every mindful action as a ... habit\nHow you can join keep America's youthful\nAt ... dot org together we can do youthful fangs Russia\nYou have two systems of justice in this country and it's become patently obvious to everybody and it's very simple if you are a Democrat and you've engaged in any kind of questionable illegal activity you get a pet and if you're a Republican you don't people know that we have two systems of\nJustice in Washington and the Democrats are not held accountable the same way Republicans are we have to live the systems that just Rush Limbaugh reduced turning them on the news talk Ninety five point five\nPeople joined ... to raise awareness and fun\nThat change the world for everyone affected by multiple sclerosis\nAspirin communities together\nFor people within a\nAt ... dot org we\nThis is where my daughter she be well am nine Seventy buildings these huge huge ward and you're listening to news ...

failures but the article is right there and you can read all about it over at coast to coast am dot com ... church now our guests tonight is my new as safe as our day\nI'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind LBJ but um but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that um\nI can tell you that the uh you know the world's a crucial um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there is another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves or into the things that are looking for chambers\nAnd then you know the one that you just mentioned of course we know from seismic analysis that they are it to our space is under this things\nAnd one of those spaces specifically which is what Robert shock or a was studying uh years ago um is has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um they might be something in it that's of interest\nYou know he did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back\nThe expedition to hopefully drilled right\nYeah yeah first of all what we\nAre what we would like to do first is to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced a size longer fee and maybe electric conductivity studies entered really get a very detailed look especially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know if you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven\nAnd ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw space about two meters\nA deep and uh and and then Roberts ah you know did his studies couple a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that this phase is five meters deep so we have a little bit of a death problem and then of course you know that's I of us in marketing or drilled in that area\nBut we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far away from where we think the chamber is so they didn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them in of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so what we want to do is you know just like a you know just like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non evasive study and really finding out the space\nAnd when we have a good idea where it is then with permission of course then work try a small probe into that space and see what's in it\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about and there's this this this rumor has been going around yea for quite a while it would just be great to finally uh but just to bed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and the things temple and there was a little depression and it's wet\nUm you can just you can just see the the water coming up and if if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber\nAnd so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber or the very first thing we have to do is to a very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue\nWhatever it might be inside um you know sufficient enough itself becomes a very difficult project but it's doable Robert things it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly\nSpeaking of those things tissues came in on Twitter this is from ... minutes or on Twitter and I have heard that it does things may have been a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small for words body\nYeah [noise] well if we think\nWe think it was a female lie and so that part is partially we agree with that yes I don't think it was a person's head so um but we think that was a lie in us there before and the head of the line as was weak carved into a what we see today\nNow um I Know that you tend to be a little reticent to talk about daily injury tee when it comes to ...\nI I leave all doors open myself but this comes in from Lucy in winter\nAnd and and this is I'm just going to have to read this directly as indeed you Janine images it seems like all of the pyramid to Mexico had been alien in this spacecraft depicted somewhere ... any comments\n[noise] yeah I I Know I I remember reading this long time ago and I've found myself in agreement with that uh that's one way you could read it I you know I think I was ... data can invite that originally\nOf agree with that uh that's one way you could read it I you know I think that was fun Dana can invite that originally the eastern she's talking about the\n... yeah or the right the lid off the uh South Africa as a ... right\nI have I have that's our topic is in my studio in the long hair and I have a reproduction of it hanging on the wall right and I stopped and I look at that my new and I don't have any other way to look at that step for\nThe controls hand control an oxygen mask blame coming out of a a rocket motor on the bottom\nI I you know I don't have any problem with that I I think this is a this is one way you can explain it and everything is in this day and age everything is on tables you just said it we're going to Mars\nAre the odds that there is in ... I I Know somebody recently published an article saying that there may not be intelligent life out there but I think I think there is it's a very likely and especially the physics of of a of the universe you know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following this\nBut it you know there is one way that you can explain everything as a projection and if that's the case\nOr vengeance like Robert Duvall proposed in cause big looms is one way you can explain or some of these contacts is there may be a message that gets broadcasts across the universe through you know through um ah through a quantum fields\nAnd that message ends up on our end somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid\nUm I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is but we have to have some proof I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see some solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line Rob Rob in Vancouver Rob really quick before we hit the brake where do you have for a minute\nA absolute owners regard as really critically a notion struck me when you talk to a group structured space lose a look and make it quick couple of quick germs and laundered\nLooking at the idea of a Greek scare the architect from all the trauma ... super big jump starting to turn ... is a frightening old knowledge globally big garbage structures\nOr who's to say I mean you really I mean do you remember I guess people assume that the the ... the ah periods or solid the good thing or maybe just soon as you say is structured speeds who's the Arabs who we filled with ...\nI remember you've learned a lot and\nAh everything arches inside big cavities like Campbell\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's a jak lead the conclusions that my news presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and boy could there be more\nSo I I have to you know I've been a neat I have to mention ... will do so he of course proposed an internal ramp ... years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this is the these on logistics basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and this can from last year business show it but I think the theory isn't dead I think it's possible that the scan was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm seeing that could be theological and shop here who dealt with probably disagree with me or you know he reviewed the paper a but he still thinks it's possible that there are logistics\nOh did you go and shop here will do with probably disagree with me\nOr you know your your paper uh but he still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know beat out of it may so we agree there are probably spaces up there and um I just want to have a quick uh cause\nThe pyramid of course it's it's it's hot spaces inside researches in the sixties what ... pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know what was your amid buddy ... pyramid all we have is bills only chamber\nWell let me jump in I've got to take a break right there but this is something we need to talk about when we come back our gas my new stateside hey this is all the great pyramid on coast to coast I'll be right back stay with us Mm\nZero and see the key word free bottle boys [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOr go back to the coast to coast am on this beautiful Sunday Now Monday morning\nHere in Southern California my new uh the phones have been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to let's go to Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique\nWelcome Monique how are you there\nOkay he didn't do that so let's go right in order to go to Mary in New Jersey Mary Europe next on coast\nAround him how to you and your calf\nI'm kind of something like four years older or younger and somebody of a shiny and man standing there with the sword from the garden of Eden and he gets ... building and they made it to another and they said\nHow feeling that he said I any that I Am in that town now but I think that is a dollar\nA tree of life\nIt seems like off the Bible and the tiny ran into Egypt Abraham ran in the air for fade have found that in their case a man in the air ... air and um the Lyon\nCounty where I'm defeated the woman will crush ahead of them because the evil why not just found like that and could that possibly be the original spot in the garden of the\nUh the dad is the million dollar question Mary and thank you for that uh my new gardening beaten in Egypt\nUm yeah I well first of all I I Want to recommend an author to you a merry I'm a David roles so he's a he's really done some excellent work on a ... a basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt\nUm and so you may find some answers or you know with him so I think he's producing a television series and he's with books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think Timothy Mahoney if I remember this correctly\nUm but yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the uh the early ... um when they were in Egypt um I think\nUh there is for specially Joseph I'm that's what the role is describing Joseph real figure and uh I live in a in a in a place called a virus which is in the delta\nAnd had a palace and was that was basically a A N tuned in the pyramid and he was such an important official at the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know this virus community disappears and does this archaeological evidence at well piece together um and David role is basically saying that\nAh where are you worried historians got it wrong is that they they were looking for the biblical story in a in the new kingdom and it it David role is fighting that it was probably a couple of centuries earlier\nThis or just came in on Twitter this is from Jay and Jay says I heard that surgeon tools were found indeed ... pyramids that doctors use now true or false\nUm I well what was found is that a is a a tool that looks like uh\nLike a fish tell 'em what on I I'm not sure that was a surgeon's tool but of course we don't know um it was found in the I think it was in the northern ... a shaft of the queen chamber by a wait a minute Dixon\nUm and he uh and it's now in the British Museum a with a with a ... with a granted ball um but whether or not that was a surgery ... and ... other than that I don't know of any surgical tools found inside of the games up here and ms\nLet's go to bill in Oregon bill you're up next on goes down to my new\nName on there Hi Jimmy yeah this is a really academic discussion tonight and I've got nothing you know nothing against that I congratulate you on your discovery but my question is um\nSo I just want you to speculate a little bit is that you just chambers or for construction in engineering could they be like for instance\nFor architects to put gold on the Internet or could um if their theological could be you know some sort of burial chambers for for those I'm the king wanted to proceed him into the um afterlife\nYeah great question yeah great question bill I'm Glad I'm Glad you asked that because I Will speculate now I I'm I'm looking for just ...\nI think because there is obviously I'm proposing up to ten chambers I was thinking well what if it's the logical what could that be and I think the answer is the end they add\nSo inherently up all this are they are the ... was known for the center of the worship of the nine major God this kind of like the pantheon of of the ancient Egyptians\nAnd I think ah these chambers are dedicated to each one of these deities and and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one that is the crucial chamber\nOr wherever we may find the kind of things that you just mentioned are but I'm suspecting there could be pirates both in their uh with inscriptions\nI'm so that would be very exciting if that if what if that were ever to be found a but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm all I think I'm with John P o die think this is still on the table that there may have been space is there that\nHelped the workers to pull up the stones or to the top it's possible um and we'll just have to wait for the next scan I think the next county will give us some new information\nNow I Am heard some rumors minute that they have already gotten the inside of the new chamber above the grand gallery and have removed items from there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nYeah I I I'm not I happened to those rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's put it that way\nIt would certainly help the tourism I mean it indoors or less right\nWhich has dropped off I Am heard you know you just got back from Egypt where I Am heard from so many friends that have been going to Egypt for decades and that you can as a tourist because ... years past it was crowded all the buses were there you\nHad to wait in line and there was a you know thousands of people on the ... the plant but today you can ... be the only person there\nYeah that I had there was a couple of days when I felt like that Jimmy I um you know it was not there were there are parts of think he's a plateau where I was the only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders so yeah tourism has been down and they um you know they want to build a new one\nOf course they have to if they discover something they are the are going to show it to the world so that people come and look at it I that's why I'm hopeful that if they have something that they haven't shown us yet that we'll we'll find out about\nThis uh this is from Twitter this is from David I Love this question actually did the Nazis research Egypt shouldn't areas as depicted in the raiders of the Lost Ark\n[laughter] ah that's a good question it is a great question it's a great question the question\nUm [noise] you know I I I don't know I don't know for sure I Know that Germans this was before before Nazi Germany um there there was off course German activity on the ... he's a plot so there was actually a great American German a\nCollaboration on the gave up blood toll or George ... from Harvard and uh and ... from a from the German a slum life sick\nAnd they were excavating them stop us in Iraq but this was more Nineteen you know ten Nineteen twelve and ... into the twenties and then when a Nazi Germany came about uh some of this was halted and there was a big break\n'em but specifically Nazi Germans what they did in Egypt I I don't think I can comment because I don't know\nLet's go to a show out these in the Bronx Joe you're next on goes\nHow ya doing Jimmy and do your job say Hi to my new\n[laughter] Hyman knew how I got to take your\nGood um yeah I wanted to ask you are in the case of the great pyramid is there any evidence that there are any any tunnels or underground passage ways that would connect the
