fact\nYou know they do but how do you look into a crystal ball can make these predictions if you're running a business\n... ... what you do is is the what's the most important question for any business a business you know I I I was a [noise] an opportunity to speak to the chief marketing officer is in the hospitality industry about two years ago\nAnd and everyone was there ... or a sheriff Jim was there he'll turn was there and Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the the hospitality industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and I'm In the ... you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room there was about twelve people into ruin sitting around and round table\nAnd and they eat their answer was you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media and and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation\nY I'm ... you know how they think how they buy and Hilton says it's it's about new products are about making your room smaller and your lobbies bigger you know the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it's all about demographics isn't it\nYeah it is because if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market ... you know ... for about Twenty years they could make their products fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand\nAnd all of a sudden sales started trailing off is was Nineteen\nNinety eight and I and I said I'm\nSo your your sales are ... are are going flat and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues as to the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis and and I said a Hoosier customer and he's got an Eighteen to thirty four year old man or woman Eighteen to thirty four and I said what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he's over ... they don't fit in the product anymore\nI said you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes I said the last baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said there was a pause and he said Nineteen\nNinety eight and I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he said what does that mean is it what that means is you know you're you're laughing gas just checked out of your hotel and their their sales one from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while we're bigger than not paying attention to demographic\nYou know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out\nBut if you want to understand where money came from it came from people ... people and you will understand\nLizard in simple to tend to talk to that demographic you need to go after mentally and find out some of the things they enjoy\nAnd look at those trends you find out that you know if their kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people find out from them what did they do what do they like where do they go do they go to movies do they not and then adjust yourself to that\n[laughter] Georgia too smart [laughter] but but you ... that doesn't that sound like like logic commonsense is not so common ... said that\nYou know I I Do um\nI'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and I said that's the boomers everybody you see that the boomers all sat down and I'll say okay if you are born before Nineteen eighty five sit down\nAnd ... and another large group sits down and ... and I say that's\nAnd I'll say okay if you are born before Nineteen eighty five sit down\nAnd ... and another large groups that kind of ... and I said that's Jenn ... about three people standing and I said this next Gen y that Gen Y or the millennials are born Nineteen eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them\nI said you want to know about the new market you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here and it makes me crazy\nWell it's it's ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening is that what's happening like companies like McDonald's are they on top of things they used to be marketing geniuses something sledding\nBut I Know you're not you know I Want to tell people a sheet McDonald's same store sales are off you know they're they're all their increases are coming from um their overseas operation\nI I I I tell folks I said listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children I sit and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years\nAs I said you ought to three ends up of a food it's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is McDonald's famous for its not nutrition you know it's it's for French fries\nJordan list of what they tried to say heart\nPeople have the impression that it's not nutritional food\nIt's exactly correct and and so that's that's their problem they they are if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food\nOr in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need\nTo sell good food she can't sell you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts [laughter]\nWhat's going on with population trends are these shifting down to\n[noise] yeah it was you know it's funny you say that uh in\nNineteen ... we we have a new generation is called Generation Z and Generation Z started in a\nTwo thousand five and they will they will be a but they will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet [noise]\nBut in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we we we have four million or three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier [noise]\nAh what's happened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies a year\nAnd and so this Generation Z will be smaller yeah\nThat's a big trend can stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next hour you're on coast to coast they\nGet Daily Show up the right to your inbox for free with the coast noon newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com [noise]\nGoes on news tone Ninety five point five [noise]\n[noise]\nThere and welcome back in the run back with us as we talk about trends the incredible trends that the I guess Kim nachos businesses should be using things like this I Would guess anybody who's doing something marketing you name it should be aware of these things should night\nYeah absolutely that there's [noise] it it is mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't think about this because it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\n[noise] well it has to a large degree um\nThe [noise]\nKnow and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that [noise] if people are still people when when you have a\nLarge number of people that are consumer or a specific product at a small number of people are consume ... product the large number of people will consume more though I Know that sounds were imagery but the ... the smartphone has only aged folks and their ability to consume\nSo uh it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint\nBut you have to keep in mind that the thing that drives commerce of the thing that drive you know consumption\nOf people in the market period\nNow that's [noise] that's simple isn't it\n... it almost sounds ridiculous doesn't it ... I mean ... who is out there saying\nWell okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there's ... people consume smaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause they the uh let me give you an example of it you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers are Twenty years ago in in vast quantities\nAnd then the the um [noise] um the automobile companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing departments that it kept on firing their\nTheir chief marketing officers because they couldn't come up with the secret to\nSelling as many SUVs to this\nOther group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation and now you find that make it easy for small\nPoint my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to a couple of days ago and she said pop on you know kids are age and then she called her silver Cuba's young woman now we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and in you know it it's funny 'cause I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born in it and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born uh outside of wedlock and they're they're born outside of a of a marriage um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture a where Seventy five percent of the kids are born outside of the the uh\nUh marriage ... it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nI think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do and right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old [noise] eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back to forty years\nAnd ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies but the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the to a sex drugs and rock and roll what happens in the ... the boomer hippies\nLive became Republicans [laughter]\nIn all cases\n[laughter] no not at all cases but you know if if you if you look at [noise] [noise] [noise] that this this is ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise]\n[noise] ah [noise] between the ages right now I'm thirty four and fifty three we have a diminutive puppy a population of of indigenous people that were born here\nThere were there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five an eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million born between forty five and sixty four [noise]\nWhat does that mean that means that that that particle\nA support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nA superimposed over where the heavy lift or should be with where the with the you know our our strength should be in our population it's actually smaller\nSo the net result is a you know ... ... it's kind of having a you know ... ... and they should have haves and have nots with with the cushion in between\nOf generation X we don't because they were never born\nWe're losing that cushion\nYeah well what we did in ... so ... you have people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have the have nots but middle age\nAnd and um and a middle income uh our\nOccupy exactly the same space so if you're middle ages small and then your middle income as small as well\nBut it's a demographic issue is just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this too I mean let let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got the billions of people on line or they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because of what they do socially\nBut I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to there's becoming a change there were I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting the bank for a dollar a year or uber converting these in the sales\nBecause the market may not be what we really want what's happening with that\n[noise] a Facebook is kind of strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks listen it if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the customer you're the product\nUm as far as I'm concerned and I and I've got a Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry\nThe Internet are um advertising is a bottomless pit you have no idea what your pie none and there's no way to a reference any kind of success except return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet\nAnd and you just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go up your sales go up you you don't know if it's if it's a relative to how much money you spend on the Internet but uh what what's happening with a a ... a enterprise there is is not good it really isn't\nI mean it's huge but there's a trend here and to me the trend is very negative so that it\nIs involved in what's the negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous\nI I don't trust 'em a Facebook at all I I really don't I don't think I I think you have to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can be analyzed\nAnd then the ... and and that analysis put people into categories and those categories uh our sellable and and what the secretary does with that information is sell it to anybody who will pay for it\nSo there there's there's there's no security and anything that you put on Facebook nothing\nAnd well what about you know some of these wacky jobs you know the idiot that killed a loving people in the Jewish synagogue the guy who sends out these bombs these pipe bombs they use social media to kind of spelled their hatred\nPitch them a little sooner\nYou tell me I I really don't know that Robert ... in a a Caesar salad ... than they are they are truly whacked jobs and um I don't know that that's that's more um a\nMore understanding of of a of a psych uh graphics than a demographics as far as I'm concerned\nIn what's happening in the housing market most younger people aren't buying houses they're renting what's gonna happen\nWhile they're renting because they [laughter] a trillion dollars of student\nLoan debt you know\nYeah but don't worry about it now what we're what we're literally facing with um a kids is is you have eighty seven million kids that are between fourteen and thirty three years old the kids are finally moving out of their parents' basements they're throwing loyal as trophies they don't deserve and\nAnd she is less than half\nAs much Native American as your family's European American is\nRussian [noise] new

in by the way I've commented on his tweet into because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that\nBut if he let them smoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that would in their punishment will be [laughter] what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know I I think what he has done is dignify or it in the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows\nBut you know yeah uh you know on one hand you got to defend yourself on the other how much do you hire yourself in it than just move on and say you know folks I already said it I'm done with it and end it like that\nIt exactly George C ... and I respect the the um the criticism I really do of of ... my comment because when I stray outside of demography\nMy position on ... the ... and my ability to forecast what's next based on demography is based on a ... a very macro view a very thirty thousand foot view\nWhen it you know you you asked me a question about the president I'm I made the comment about the president but that was really subjectivity on my part that I mean that's what I feel\nRight no arguing yeah kind of\n... what's what's going to happen going forward if it is it right now we have a polarized country in the country is polarized\nJust like it was in the sixties early seventies because we have a huge population of young people in a huge population of old people and in between there is a small population that does not offer\nThe the a position of of either of those too so uh\nWell what I like about Dana's remarks though is she's she said how she felt without screaming without putting you down for your views and that's what it's all about that's the way it should be\nExactly yeah so so might make a comment today and it would be thank you for your position it's for the yelling at me [laughter]\nThat's good though in Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead I\nCan to questions so it it talked about the wall Street Journal having more hits the patients that are ... and one issue than ... people have that it you know then\nAnd how the ... explosion basically people pick and choose a their information or even at a a professional level what what are the size of the sense that if you look at Japan\nPeople used to like Twenty years ago the people just work twenty four seven almost a year and it just hasn't worked out of them individual level in Japan for people with that high octane a drive to a stay at the office so that in the height or whatever uh\nPeople with that high octane a drive to a stay at the office to hide or whatever [noise] ah so maybe the lacking creative conscious something my second question will be about Amazon or\nI Know they get criticized putting out small for prior to send I can understand that but at the same time the stuff you can find on there that you can find locally even a even under your for example I got I got this great gloves shoveling my neighbors snow\nAnd that's the main thing I Need it but I couldn't find them locally I got 'em on Amazon from like Minnesota\nRight for the first question again [laughter] ... inside just blowing on Long Island hey I'm from Long Island too but what was the first question\nGo ahead and give us an office again Joe Joe\nYou know that it does for example and explosion that video ... you know like half with everything people get on a small and fall and I think of this video based\nJust how should people if they're trying to move ahead or in the world\nJust pick and choose how they consume information what to emphasize because it doesn't necessarily work out to put this grand that's into something one that's just so so much of the nation like you like a kernel of sand on on the ... what good does it though the ... it's just too overwhelming\nBut where's your has your question on of information\nThat we get as it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if I'm a ... a lot of the the the Gen Y kids the millennials are actually tuning it out you you can ask them simple questions about you know what's going on in the world and they can answer is\nBut ... how do you sift through this what you have to do is you have to compare several sources that's and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations I really don't\nCome to any kind of conclusions unless I've compared a variety of sources and that's what helps me with information\nIn terms of Amazon I think Amazon is just you know ... what we did when we open the Internet we opened up the world we we just that was our view to the innards of the world and I think what's what's going down with Amazon is just something that's naturally transpiring and I think if you're just going to get nothing but bigger\nYou're going to see commerce is going to change everything about commerce is going to change\n[noise] we've got a company that shift radios they make radios and they make darn good radio see Korean company and I I used to get my radio from them long before I started doing this show\nAnd it was simple you you go on line you order what you want it's delivered to your house in some cases it's free shipping based on the deal that they've got at any given time\nI mean you don't have to park your car you don't have to spend money and gasoline you don't have to find a crowd it's a it's\nIt's amazing it's amazing I mean\nIt's infinitely easier you know when you look at the boomers what how do you do business with a boomer you save them some time you make their life easy and you don't rip them off this was perfect and so Amazon is is is going to do nothing but a grow\nA you know and that online retail ... will exceed the tempers that where it is now is probably going to twenty percent thirty percent\nI think so too they hurt bricks and mortar but I mean the the the goods are still being manufactured um the Amazon employees zillion people um some of which complain about their job they're\nMore conditions and things like that but I mean there are retired people so there's displacement she so when the bricks and mortar stores go\nIn the get hurt and you know some people are out of work but they can find jobs elsewhere it's the real estate that just sits there what's gonna happen with that stuff\n[noise] that's a good question you know I Know that a a\nCommercial real estate is you know ... you know suffering some issues right now some serious issue\nI mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall right about now but\nNo no no but but but I certainly would buy residential you would I Would buy residential every day of the week yeah it's a seller rent out yes [laughter] yeah no in fact I'm you know I I have a house in the\nButt either Springs Florida and and I and I have a house in in ... Connecticut and I'm In the house and a half of Connecticut's ... thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just rattle around in it than what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it will get we're going to come up with an executive rental forward\nAnd and that's going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't have the ... got to be very big\nWhile he's got that company like ear being beat up the rent outhouse houses and I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and they solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nReally they're very happy very cool\nYeah and I I Would subscribe to that [noise] it ... you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes [noise] one of the things that that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and if that's going to\nRemain in place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that essentially demanded a you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force that we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and just entering the ah the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them can\nOh yeah ... ...

science fit into this Bruce I mean the you know you're you're you're in academia um yeah we were just science in it\n[noise] well\nI I've been doing a lot of reading in a and you know I'm not a scientist but I did I've done a lot of reading and quantum physics and\nAnd I talk a lot to uh I I have communication with folks that have passed on and and that happened randomly before but now I figured out a way to make it more regular but\nSo I've asked all awful lot of questions and I've done a lot of reading and I've met people like dean rating or just you know wonderful and very easy to talk to and explain difficult things in from what I understand what I Believe is that the the paranormal the paranormal world is actually the quantum world\nSo by studying quantum mechanics and how that works I think I have a good idea of how the paranormal world works and I've come up with a model\nA ... how I I fit in what what I understand to be going on\nNow in the mail us with that model might be\nWell the idea is that uh that\nI okay I'll I'll I'll look at it this way so I ... in the morning I take these I I call them a a meditative walks so so when I'm walking my\nOne way of looking at me and said I'm I'm a a a a a particle being I Am a bean physical being but if you see that I'm I'm moving and if you look at uh like in in in fast motion or whatever I Would be like a blur so I'm really I'm a I'm a wave more than I Am a a a a particle being\nAnd I and my my location\nIs is not just in one place so I kind of see that in the in the quantum world that's that's what it is everything is in wave form and we don't see the world that way because you know that some in the ... world but if you take it up to the macroscopic world than you think about\nThat ah that\nI I'm not in any one location and it and uh and and that's kind of how how I see it and\nAnd I think that that helps me understand how how this works and the the other thing is these near death experiences that I've had a like for instance I think we have many forks and what I call forks and the road of time I talk about that in the book\nWhere we experience a maybe a near death experience or a close call and I've had a couple of those\nAnd in one dimension I think is where it comes into you know a different dimensions\nI think that we we might die in that particular thing that that incident and another's we we live on is if that didn't happen or and and sometimes we have knowledge of what the incident might have been or maybe sometimes we don't\nAnd uh and then we can have many of these forks in the road of time throughout our our our lives and keep going from one life to the next\n... but at the same time that we're doing that there's this spiritual part of us so there's actually two part there's a physical form and then there's the spiritual form or that that is eternal and that's where I come up with the uh the title of the book which is timeless that that we don't really\nUh that that is eternal and that's where I come up with the uh the title of the book which is timeless that that we don't really ever die\nAnd in timeless you have documented thirty four ... cases that happened to you have there been more you just didn't put them all in the book\nYeah ah [laughter] there there's a lot more and I have I've already written the second book it'll come out next year I call it timeless deja vu and uh I have twenty eight more experiences and I I I I kind of wanted to test the waters with the first book\nOkay and I said I saved some of the more well I'll just say a little bit more bizarre stuff for the second book based on the reaction of the first one\nWell sounds like we're going to have your back about the same time next year\nAnd I and I yeah I plan to release it about you know the late summer early fall and and then I I also have a third book plan too so I I there's a lot of the incidents the they keep happening\nI I was going to ask you how deja vu because and we'll save a lot of it so the next book but you had mentioned the experiences where you know you may have died in one life but not in another do you think that\nSometimes we might have memory of other existence is in other parallel universes and that's why we have deja vu\nI I I Believe so in fact uh I I remember as a as a kid and this is interesting because I think\nChildren are very open to the spirit world or the paranormal world but third ... that's kind of over the years it's kind of a through our education system or sometimes maybe by their parents are different organizations it's kind of a you know drained out of them but I remember as a kid thinking\nI Wonder if I've already died and I'm somebody else now I think I Am and it's and and I don't necessarily remember a previous life experience from that but I I remember thinking that a lot I mean a lot and uh so I I I think that's interesting that that children have those those ah you know those kinds of\nFeelings but I'll give you an incident that happened just recently with me and my son we were driving here in Southern California on a sub surface streets and I I look down just momentarily I don't know what it was something that dropped onto the floor of money or whatever and I looked\nUp and when I looked up and I thought it was just a split second here I was hurdling through a red light\nOh and it was it was terrible and and how old's your son\nOr he's he's Eighteen okay and he's sitting in the in the passenger seat and freaking out yeah he he is and\nWe're going through the intersection and on either side of us is a car you know two cars coming right at us so what was going to happen that I can see was that we were going to get T bone from both sides and just you know ... a pinch between the two\nUh and uh at that moment everything's slowed down ... everything's slowed down and it was if I had all the time in the world to figure out how I was going to\nManeuver your way around a\nYeah and the next thing I Know I I I maneuvered through and next thing I Know we're on the other side there was honking going on in the cars when everybody was\nSafe and a time got back to normal speed again and I I think that\nI think what what happens is that we had we had glimpse the quantum world at that point and then the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my spirit friends have told me there there is no past there is no future it's all just an eternal now\nAnd and that that's what I felt like and I and then I thought\nIs probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time 'cause then another dimension which we might have had this horrible accident knows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour\nYou know that there could have been people killed\nAnd it's at least seriously injured and uh and we were unscathed and so or the other two cars thank God but um so it so I I I\nThat is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I I uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm\nUp at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception pass in the north end to with the island there is a a\nTo bridge spans that go from the mainland too\nWith the island the north end and there's a middle island called past silent and we always used to stop there when when we went camping and and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you can overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of\nCourse in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak up for the day and age that actually ...\nAnd I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light in the swarm\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling at somebody's watching Uber's there's a there's some helpers out there for you I Want to come back in a moment we'll talk more about some of these others thirty three experiences you

about any demonic situations have you stumbled into that\nYes unfortunately the way that it that is also out there in the paranormal world and the spirit world and sure these things as far as I understand have never been human never will be human but they are very real and very scary out out to a couple of them\nI'm One of them was a ah when I was about Eighteen years old I was in a very low place in my life very uh down I was a not very successful I dropped out of school a out of the University of Washington as living at my brother's garage sleeping on the concrete floor on a mattress\nAnd a ... just ... the night before this incident happened I I had cut across\nYou know I I was Eighteen but I was still acting like I was a little kid I'd still cut across the yards and jump fences and stuff because just to you know 'cause I it it just an old habit yeah anyway I went through the yard of of an old lady who all of us in the in the neighborhood thought she was a witch\nAnd ah she lived alone and there was a story I don't know if it was true that her husband had died and she left him there for a month and told the neighbors complain that you know there was something\nSome kind of odd smell and then uh anyway so she their legend grew by leaps and bounds\nSo I was ... I was cutting through her yard and I saw a candlelight in the window and I just momentarily looked and there she was and she was very scary looking person she had you know this gray hair that was kind of shooting off and all the direction\nYeah she had this she had the old ... syndrome right\nYes she had the ... camp as it turned out cancerous or on her nose or she had me I felt like a deer in headlights I was just frozen and I was just staring at her and she had it was either it was a candle yeah she had a candle in the window\nAnd she was just staring at me and it it just scared me and finally I broke away from her gays and I ran to my brother's garage and I\nAnd I and I you know went in to to I fell asleep well\nLater that probably early in the morning I woke up to a very frightening site or at the foot of my the mattress bad that I was sleeping on the floor there was like a a call him a fire that was coming up out of the floor and I I thought this is the worst during this is a horrible dream\nAnd so I pinch myself I slap myself and no I was awake in this column fire then spread over me in an arc from head from foot over my head you know probably six feet in the air and kind of like an art and like pulsating fire\nAnd it and if that wasn't scary enough there was also this this very dim what I Would classify as the demonic low gravelly voice speaking in in ... just these guttural tones\nAnd I'm not sure how long it lasts it it might have just been a couple of minutes but it seemed like it it took forever\nAnd ah it it was very very frightening and it was it was horrible and and I after it was over I was you know my heart rate was way up I was sweating\nI immediately called my my girlfriend and and uh I told her you know something terrible happened she said well\nYou know why don't you come over in in in the morning and I did and I explained it to her and she looked at me and she said uh well you know uh I think maybe we should call a psychiatrist what do you think and I said well just forget it you know maybe I just made it up but of\nCourse I didn't it did happen and I\nI think it had something to do with this this old lady I think that I had frightened or or made her angry and something had been some and and I it was a terrible terrible thing\nAnd that that that's one of the experiences I've had it's one of the most scary things that's a that's ever happened to me and just as as I remember it as if it would just happened yesterday I could feel the heat\nI could hear that gravelly voice it just seemed to fill the whole room and yeah it was it was\nIt was horrible wouldn't want to go through that again would you know no it was it was it was very real very reel to reel\nAnd uh nothing that it it's like I think what happens is that these kinds of things you know when you're at the lowest point in your life and that's when you're susceptible a and I I think that that that they seize that opportunity\nI think so too I mean they they know when you're down they know when you're on drugs or you're drunk yeah and that's when they get ya and they get you a good time I don't want to dwell too much on the humans but tell us the other story\nWell the other one ah also of a foolish kind of thing a ... there was actually a um I was in Germany I was a soldier in Germany at working at the prison the military prison in Manheim West Germany when it was east and West Germany West Germany\nAnd uh there was a a a counselor at the prison of all people of counsellors like a senior and CEO and he\nWas into a a a witchcraft so he had invited me and my girlfriend to his his room to it 'cause he was bragging about what a you know powerful war locker which or whatever that he wasn't\nAt the time I was kind of I'm kind of interest that kind of you know skeptical but interested so we went in there it into his room and he had this very frightening set up you know very typical Satan worshipping kind of stuff upside down across a like goats had kind of thing going on and candles and\n... and that stuff so that I said well I you know I don't think this has anything that I'm interested in and I got my girlfriend and we left and\nAnd he was being very very spooky and very scary about this whole thing and and uh so I decided that I was going to look into a a you know this kind of thing so I I\nI thought maybe as a defense you know I maybe I should try to one of them you know and try to scare him or something and and uh and I also felt like maybe he was trying to move in on my girlfriend too so I had\nA little bit of that you know kind of thing\nGoing on competitive thing so I I went to the uh you know for soldiers they had a art rooms or like arts and crafts areas and and uh there was a a um an ceramics instructor there and he I asked I'd like to you know do something with some clay and he said gave me some clay and\nI had been looking at a deeper knowledge the book and or or no no he had a demon algae but that's what it was and I was fashioning a a what I thought would be you know some kind of scary\nTo be a demon head north than I Am fashioned\nAnd this was just you know very stupid to be doing this and as I was doing this this guy took notice of made this instructor then he had the steam analogy book\nAnd uh he said you know I'm very interested in this what is this year doing I said well I'm just trying to make this scary looking ahead to scare the sky and he said well that's\nThat's very very interesting you know I'm very interested in in the mineralogy and he started to get really strange you know just like the counselor at the prison he was acting very strange like they were maybe birds of a feather or something\nAnd uh so I finished this demon head and I got out of there and I took it back to the barracks and I took it to my girlfriend's room and she wasn't there at the time but her ... her girlfriend a roommate letting in\nAnd I set it up on her night stand and there was like this mirror behind it and I said okay I'm going to freak her out and then I'm going to freak her out and then we're going to go and freak out this other guy and get them to get you know get away from us\nSo I set up these candles surrounded stupid right\nSo uh I was the was the intent was good right\nIt it was it was maybe a good intent but it was playing with stuff I didn't understand so I'm sitting there looking at it and the girlfriend left I mean the the uh the roommate left and I was just there by myself sitting there staring at the ... all of a sudden it's lips started to move\nAnd it started to say things in that same kind of guttural voice that I had heard uh before I joined the army\nAnd that that other incident that I told you about\nAnd uh it was it was it was pretty scary and I thought at first this isn't real but then it kept happening and then my girlfriend walked in\nAnd she immediately said what are you doing and I said well your roommate Libyan and then she says what does that and she pointed to and I said oh that's the thing I made to scare the you know this councilor guy\nAnd she said you know that's very interesting because when I was in and she was telling me when I was in high school I made something that looked exactly like that and I had to throw it away because it started to interact with me and I and I said well that hey that's what this did you know and she\nShe freaked out she grabbed it she opened up the window and from the third floor she threw it out the window into the dumpster that was down on the in the parking lot and she said you don't ever play around with that kind of stuff and uh\nSo that was the other to kind of demonic a incident that I that I had so that the the big lesson there's don't play around with things you don't understand even if the intention might be somewhat good are these are forces that you you don't want to play around with it and if you are at a low point or you invite them and that's when you can have\nTrouble you think you invite them in with a weed you board\nOh I I don't play around with we do boards at all I think they're very dangerous\nMeat you you you you you hear the nine

off\nAnd I put them back on there and and and then it it kept vibrating again and then I just happened to look out the window\nAnd there was like a Greenbelt behind our apartment behind discussed house this bar and\nThere was a Green Belt and then there was another uh apartment building maybe four stories high much bigger a complex and I looked directly into this window and there was a man standing there it looked like a man and he was very dark and he was a in kind of in the shadows but I could see there was a figure of a man and he was pointing at me\nAnd and I went out with the voting singer I Hope no not a bowling center will just\nIt just seemed like a guy but he was moving in a very strange way so I looked at him as soon as I think he recognized I looked at him the vibration stopped so I I don't know what he was doing or what what reason he would have for doing it or what you know obviously you had some kind of tell the kinetic powers because\nIt was related to what was going on because as soon as he moved away from that window and there was he wasn't there the the the items stopped and I and you know and I didn't have that feeling of somebody pulling me off the bed so it was that was pretty frightening because I didn't know what he was up to whatever it was was not good I can guarantee that and\nI'm going to hinge Bruce that when you went through that red light and you made it through all lives loser reason you still here have you figured out what the reason is yeah\nYeah and uh it's it's related to what the this vision I had two years ago my friend gene who came to me and told me it was time it was time to tell these stories to not be afraid to tell the stories people will come it's kind of like the old you know field of dreams build it and they will come\nA and that's exactly what what has been happening everything that he said uh is that I I I think I Do have a mission I I I I Know that you know I I think the fact that I\nHave all these credentials and stuff maybe that helps people accepted more but it it it's unfortunate that it should be that way but I think it does kind of a you know give people the idea that uh you know maybe he's he's more credible but\nI you know I don't know but I I Do know that I Do have this mission to get these stories out and to help people understand and to support people like a scientist like dean rating and others in trying to figure this out\nYou know and and are you know very chronically under funded because there's you know there is that it's difficult for them to get funding\nIt's out you know in in our ... you know very chronically under funded because there's you know there's that it's difficult for them to get funding and I think this is it's probably one of the most important things that we can we can do in our lives is is try to figure out how this the spiritual world works\nAnd it and it gives great comfort to people when I although I don't I'm not a practicing medium I Do a ... I Am able to to to do it and I I share this with my friends and family members and and people who um you know who asked me\nI don't do it for money or anything just do it because I feel it's a service to my fellow a human beings\nAnd it provides them with comfort and and it doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know there Charlotte thins out there and and then and there are some real people they do\nFor a living and I don't I don't ah you know the grudge them to make a living of it you know fair living as long as they're providing a a a decent service for people but uh it it is it is real it's very real and ah they've tried to that is one of the more difficult things for scientists to research although they've noticed\nThat when people say they're having a spiritual connection that later proves to be you know you know they got some things right about this person's a loved one a there is certain parts of the brain that they can pick up I guess some kind of image and I don't know if they use an MRI or what they do but\nUh so there is there is something that doesn't prove necessarily but it does show that there is something going on\nUh in in there is a a a connection being made 'em and uh so I that I that that is the mission that I'm On the mission I mine is too is to convey what I've found out and what I asked my friend Jean and\nAnd uh there's another lady that passed on three years ago she was a colleague of mine and a good friend and and I also have some contact with her and I've asked them a lot of questions when I go on this walking meditation that I Do quite often\nAnd uh and connect with them and and the things that I've learned are are are are pretty amazing and I I Want to share them with people and I and I I feel uh that I have to do it it I Want to do it but I feel like I have to do it too it's kind of like all the books I've written all the plays that I've written\nI felt compelled to do it it wasn't just something I sat down okay I'm going to write a play or I'm going to write a book it's always I feel compelled to do it I have to do it\nAnd I'm more than happy to to you know to to do this and and help people and I think I I have helped some people\nLet's go to the phones for you if they have a story I'll have you with bell you waited for is Bruce up it's just a question then take it away to them as a lawyer California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call and Bruce wild I miss my question Bruce I'm you spoke about your near accidents in the intersection and job comment and question\nThe comet is angels appear to be non denominational they appear at\nChristianity and Islam Hindu us some Buddhism Taoism and and all of the indigenous traditions around the world whether they're called angels are being supple light whatever my question to you\nSent to metaphorically dodged a bullet in that intersection how can the average man they average woman develop cultivate if you will a close personal relationship\nWith their guardian angels day by day even hour by hour or something that is tangible with absolute certainty\nWell that's that's a that's a very good question and I I Will uh started off by saying that that everybody has these abilities are often they light lie dormant\nSure because of you know ... when we were children we probably had you know\nEqual abilities and there's some people to have a little bit more than others but then through the experiences that people have they they accept it more and more and they're closer to the the spirit world so I'd say doing whatever you can to get a closer to that spirit world some people do it through meditation\nI just let it randomly happen because the door seem to be open since age for so it never quite shut so things kept happening but now I've\nI've learned to through meditation or what I call walking meditation all explain it I I Can't sit still very very long so I I have trouble doing the lotus position you know kind of traditional meditation so I I go on a walk and uh that's when I can get into the I guess what scientists would call an alpha brainwave state\nAnd at that point is when I can I I'll say a prayer\nA and I I I Do believe in God and they say prayers even when I'm not meditating but any way I Will I Will ask my guardian angel or some people practicing a professional uh mediums will say these are your spirit guides you know um and I will ask them to help me\nTo connect to those that are that are passed on and to receive whatever messages they have\nAnd ah and and to help people if they have messages they want me to pass on to their loved ones which is usually what it is\nAnd I I Would say just having a practice of that I Do it almost every day my foot has hurt right now so I haven't been able to do it so I feel kind of stifles but the last couple of days but uh\nMaking a practice of that type of mindful meditation and\nWhat my spirit friends tell me that and what I've they told me to tell my students in the class\nIs to have what they call focused calm\nTo be focused but be very calm and as you were doing this meditation and it will it will happen it might happen slowly it might not be you know like a an immediate you know like an epiphany or are very profound at first it might just come slowly might even think it's your imagination but it's not\nIt'll it'll keep building day by day and before you know it you you have you're more in touch with these things and you can also when you when the door opens\nYou'll ... you'll go back in time and see oh my gosh I've had these experiences before and maybe I didn't I didn't recognize it so it it goes like backwards in time as well once that door has opened\nBruce Lee ... go ahead yeah no that's the best way I can I can explain it I think it's a it's a life\nLifetime journey and and everybody's at their own pace you know like I tell my students you know some people say\nYou know I'm like thirty five years old and these kids are like Twenty years old and I'm way behind you know I've been you know taking care of kids and working and now I'm going back to get my degree and I said everybody has their own

BP's well um yeah so um electronic voice phenomena um I I I I think\nThat they can be very helpfully because the it folks in the spirit world that are residing there we'll we'll try just about any way to get a hold of us especially their loved ones\nUh I hear all I've heard all kinds of stories you know that sometimes they'll uh items will be misplaced for a while and then all of a sudden show up in a very unique location\nTo you know to give you assign a than than through there and that they want to connect with you and I think the voice phenomena could also be a a you know something like that the third that they're trying to reach out and and and that is what I encountered when I Do this walking meditation is\nThat they desperately they desperately want to connect with their loved ones and pass on messages and sometimes it's very sometimes it's kinda sad sometimes it's a you know regrets too which is a very sad thing but are often times it's just messages of love and and you know they're they're okay not to worry about them anymore\nAnd when do you mean by could be said\n[noise] well I had this one experience where I connected with a lady had asked me if I could connect with their father I did\nA and I got some of the things you know you don't get everything right 'cause there's interference you know like with anything else yeah ah and ah I got some of the things right and then he told me and I I sensed in him and sadness and kind of some like he had regrets and I said\nA sense that is that something you'd like to share\nHe said well no and I don't want you to tell her that I have this these feelings either and it was it was very hard for me because this lady was very much wanted to connect with their fathers are on it to tell her but I I couldn't tell her and I am not going to say that the names or whatever but uh it's so\n... sometimes it's not always you know rainbows and lollipops you know\nWas was it emotional for you\nIt was it was very emotional I was sometimes they you know their messages make me you sometimes tears of joy sometimes in this case kind of I felt this man's sadness uh in in the spirit world so I\nYou know it it's kind of a tough one I did not you know relate that and I'm hoping that if I connect with them again that maybe he'll give me permission to help her understand what it is because I'm sure she's probably feeling the same thing and maybe it's an expressed by her\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nDealing with hatred and killers I'm Carmen Robert Fox news President Trump has some words for the Pittsburgh gun and the package

from the writer wrote a book that I read\nAnd it talks about the ... family or the or the the elite Collins blood line\nAnd I thought well this is crazy but that whole Collins group or the college the leader of columns Thirteen or whatever and then of course a one day I met for spring Meyer another a person who writes about the blood lines of the women are the families and\nHe's going up on the ... family and I'm thinking you know okay um what proof do we have and someone said to me as well you know every time\nYou know they write stories about vampires other write stories about you know I'm you know different types of secret societal families that kind of hit the Collins family\nAnd he pointed out dark shadows they pointed out all these other shows that you know you know kept calling would I understand that and you know everything else and so I just kind of let it be and I thought man what someday I'd want to talk about this because I think it's interesting and a\nMic Redfern gave us a call the other day and I told him I said you know I Know you just wrote a book about aliens because he did he ... he wrote this great book about aliens\nAnd I said I'm reading that right now but you know you wrote a book a long time ago about the call and so each and you wrote about how their family they go all the way back to the drew woods and um\nAnd how are you know their names of the yo ... how would you say this ... or ... or it's old cue and actually try that again to OCU I. L. L. E. A. I. N. O. coil in or oh Collins and how they established themselves as ...\nOf Thirteen most powerful bloodlines and you know when you're hearing about it live I live in a conspiracy everybody says well what about the Rockefellers or what about the Rothschild and it's all bloodlines they were talking about okay\nAnd I remember coming to Portland and someone said you need to go to Astoria okay and I said why is because the asteroids we asked your bloodline you know who they are no\nAs I studied all about the asked your bloodline and how you know the Astros were also kind of a band Perry bloodline and all these mysterious families the Bundys and the ... and the do ponds\nAnd I and some of the names like the dupont's for example they were involved wish uh ... let's say on trying to bring forward been council of benign which of course these nine demons or these nine agents that are here they want to bring them forward from the Easter\nAnd I got to thinking about Alister Crowell you and I got to thinking about how he abroad forward a character called lam which was a bold creature they called the monkey was\nAnd then you have jak Parsons now Ron Hubbard and you have the Bible and working and John B and had Kelly and what they did I brought them up during my ground zero lounge or a ground zero Halloween party that I had the other night\nI don't think people really understood I was talking about but the idea of the uh the ritual is um and magic and creating a monkey or at least creating a Gen or a gala or or something\nBut how about the idea of creating a vampire or creating a night stalker which would go out and in order to a\n... in order to satisfy the creator the night stalker has to go from house to house taking people against their will sometimes removing things from their body whether it be their vital organs for their blood and taking it back to some strange group\nSome strange elite group in order for them to\nHave good health you know what I'm saying I mean we were talking about this the other night the ambrosia group but now they've gone forward they said okay well we'll have a clinic in New York down and people volunteer to give blood and people who volunteer to get shots eight thousand dollars gets you a shovel the blood\nOkay\nBut when you're dealing with secret societies okay when you're dealing with the nature of most powerful nature of these secret societies it's hard to pinpoint just where the real uh called power of ancient European bloodlines comes from\nAnd the traditions of the oldest high kings of Ireland\nHad\nAt their disposal the holy ones are the ... the ... the ... the calling snakes in fact the colon ... name again\nMeans coil or also uh what coils in the woods um and then of course leg coy lay\nMeans physician so you have the [noise] the calling physician in the woods or the one who carries mistake on the poll a hundred K. so a combination of probably the most primitive Gaelic words of ... and\nWould render a little something like divine medicine man of the woods or divine holy man or more accurate and likely title for the first drew it's basically snake oil under staffed with the cross bar the blood letters and the blood drinkers who knows [noise]\nA mic read from reports that after he published a book final events he was in contact with the band formally attached to a U.S military group known as the nights doctors\nWho maintained the real purpose behind the cattle mutilation phenomenon was to a piece called based entities with whom elements of the official world we're desperately trying to engage in work with in essence\nHis story is that the removal of vital organs are particularly the blood for mutilated cattle is not the work of aliens but of course these night stocking demons that have been some and and have been some and for well over for many years thousands of years\nThe culprits according to read for his contact with paramilitary groups that take the blood in Oregon's from cattle and humans\nIn order to be utilized an ancient sacrificial appeasement rights to incredibly old ... type that can offer something in return\nSupernatural powers what type of understood and harnessed may even be weaponized\nSounds like a and then when I was was reading about that I it sounds like the gym or it sounds like you know I'm I don't know the idea of just summoning a gym or ... or creating a monster in order to\nAttack a this sort of thing it's uh it's pretty amazing actually go to a\nSchool to leach is that your name leach yeah highly ... doing buddy\n[laughter] you are making my skin crawl St Louis\nHowe so uh I ... ... ... right I Am or what white descended from Collins okay ... ah was on the coast lane\nWhile that's where the majority of\nOr is from ... ah she's\nStill trying to collect my thoughts because there's so many pieces that are kind of slimy together I might add\nUm ever since I was little I have been fascinated ... or ... where the damn hires a it they didn't scare me at all I Do I Want it to be ...\nWill keep in mind is I mean the Collins controlled them okay the comments controlled the vampires so whatever you know you wouldn't want to mess with the ... family\nOr the uh ... because they control the vampires they were the ones that controlled life and death they were the ... where the medicine men they were the a pop that carry a workers they were the ones that were able to\nPromote help or take away health they had the power of life and death and their hands so they all have our older ones that you don't have\nTo I got away from the whole wanting to be a vampire thing yes but I still had white and attraction that was a um\nAnd also the the ... the same way that kind of made me think of ah the old school doctors that would use leeches to way to end or purify you know there's the old are your thing\nMhm they're used by us yes uh-huh\nWell sorry I'm I'm a bit of a jumble its Muslim and I'm like yeah the\nWhole dark shadows staying in Khost Maine and my family is call and say you know like my my dad's mother ... is a colonies and my dad's dad is a week so\nWell you know you know what your your name itself view if you ... you know when you're talking about leeches in blood and and that sort of thing it's just the idea that the name itself bleach okay is actually taken from the water itself\nFeeding that um you know if if your last name as leech a of course I'm it's the it's from the word or a lovely means leach means the what the leeches they use for medical purposes but it's also meaning\nThe word is like taking the boardwalk or law which of course is the\nIs the old word for those who work on the lake or those who work on the water\nSo right um yeah the leach is this thing I take it for ... yeah the leads takes the blood away it's what it is a threat to the doctor applies leeches for medical reasons and then from there it was like whatever or whomever worked on the water also got the name leach says well there's like latch there's which which of course is\nAgain another a strange a ... a creature of which is of course they resurrected a zombie like being a witch and the other way of leads Lou magical\nOne yeah a magical imagine old a ... that does not die um it comes back from the dead village pro I mean it it's interesting and all those named Susan Collins they'll come together deal coil in\nA leach which the connections of you know that which takes the blood did not which uses the blood to live forever it's it's the same origins of a name\nAnd again I'm not sure of all of this just in my head but\nIt seemed like stuff was falling together as you were talking about the colonies and controlling the wise everything else and then you know the whole each Collins families that I Am part of ...\nThe water and English Irish\nYep it's already married and then all coming over to the east coast places like Maine and others are right in Delaware and other places where they came and they and they and they actually settled there that upon settled there are other people came in a lot of the ... a lot of these aluminum bloodline families\nSettled in places like Maine and a Massachusetts and all these places\nSo I was raised in a much skating ... because I don't want to be part of a a little but not ... you started throwing together I'm like oh God no\nWell blame blame that on for it spring Meyer and blame that on a Nick Redford because uh I I read this stuff and I just thought it was interesting because it just made me think of dark shadows on the TV show dark shadows and Barnabas Collins so thinking yeah of course okay so that's why you recall like go to Garrett and Delaware Hi Garret you're on ground zero\nHello Mr Lewis good evening\nI was just calling because I Am from Delaware uh-huh and even though I'm not part of the blood line I actually spent a lot of time out to a woman in the public library which is a monument that you've ... sure how that ... square it's\nWellington Delaware mhm yeah I'm there I was telling the call screener there's a lot of ... still symbols all along this building is like ancient Rome and build them basically with the cause and\nEverything but along the top there is\nYou know I kind of shocked that it's still there there's a swastika and then they do pass the fence was built before Hitler's rise\nTo biased remembered than than swastika and this is something that was interesting I saw something on the Internet the other day I think uh uh I was trying to figure what somebody was showing the swastika and saying this evil similar not the swastika shown with Hitler swastika which of course\nThe reason the difference between the ancient swastika and the Hillary swastika it's very simple\nSwastika alone is an ancient symbol or the Hitler swastika is tilted it's tilted in such a way that it looks like it's marching so if you see a falling out and tilted when it's bent over this it's a bent cross tilted that is the swastika there's the symbol of evil the other swastikas there's engine symbols of peace\nAnd well being but when you take a look at the the the the swastika was provided by the Nazis you will get a swastika ... was killed at just check it out to be the the artist of the swastika they'd been submitted to Hitler\nHe was also the doctor I Believe and all he did is he took the swastika dangerous symbol and he just king that a little bit oh humid that look of a of a vent crosses a bent it is the symbol of been crosses what it is\nI can assure you this one is not built the only other thing is that I Know some people from Philadelphia and they told me some scary stories well into possible with some kind of murder mystery they were involved with where\nOne of the dupont's was killed some people over ... a he said it's because of the wealth of the family that they just will it off I don't know of has any idea what the impact bloodline there was a scary stuff\nThere was actually a ... a movie that\nCame out a while ago it was about a John du pont [noise] uh he was a guy a I guess\nHe coached wrestling [noise] um ... it was kind of a wrestling things out he was a wrestler where he probably is a of a [noise] yeah I Want to be wrestling coach basically and uh there was a movie made about I think it was called a Fox captured and the guy\nBy the name of a Mark Scholz they show or they were they were involved in a\nJohn du pont actually shot [noise] ah one of the guys said the big one coach he shot him yeah the movie's called Fox catcher you may want to

know covering up or invoking lamb they sort of\nAnd it's either that looks slightly like you know today's alien grace\nSo I Do think there are other realms of existence\nAnd these things can come through and cause major havoc but what I don't believe in is a simplistic belief system if this guy wait hold on and so I reminded\nPapal you know find any more than I Believe and the idea of a guy with a long dead and along cloak\nAnd entirely guy Sinclair it's you know that that's what I doubt I doubt believing that Luttrell\nApproach but the problem with a call and say late was that almost all of them were Avon jelly coals and most of them were extremist act I'm either on jelly goes I actually we're looking forward to you know the rapture and judgment by the end of days all that kind of thing\nMight say and cut they basically were encouraging\nThat to happen because from that perspective\nYou know the damons ... to that everyone will go to heaven or at least the ones who believe\nYou know and I ... driven by that belief system um and anything that came that way any day to day ... to go into the paradigm that I believed in um that they say that I had no I'm shy about doing that at all\nWhat do you think about June because I knew that\nYou know you're looking at a that's a different type of a it's not even really a demon you know it's kind of a I guess I don't know what you call to supernatural in deep it's been conjured when we brought forward and that's what I'm thinking a lot of this might be too is that the ... you could be the rival of June perhaps\nWell yeah I mean I think you know I'm ... you know have the the damons and the devil in the in the Christian Bible and and there are multiple other religions around the world have their own diet changes in their own equivalent\nSold most of heaven and hell [noise] um so you know in that sense\nYou know you can you can just look at different cultures and countries and realize that you know that there are belief systems life is\nAll around the world um but for the call insulate\nThe belief system was not a belief system it\nWas an absolute fact\nAnd um and that's one of the things I pointed out in the book was about that um you know they ... they didn't really investigate\nWould there were also indications that perhaps become immune relations was ... and then they were there to piece called these entities much like what the call and we talked about did you get any information about that\nNo not at that theory about pacing no\nOkay but he really needed remove vital organs and they removed the blood for mutilated cattle\nUh but uh you know I just was wondering if there was any a paramilitary units me it'd been involved with you know you've heard of ... labs are my labs where we you know we have you been working would be the military\nAnd uh you know the question is now you know they're they're asking questions about whether or not these aliens we the grave Gore's were uh I guess usually there's synthetic they're not they're not a biological what do you think about that idea well\nI mean it's an interesting theory I mean I'm you know they do kind of come across as sort of a lot almost like we're at drones you know\nI'm so that that's an interesting theory I'm now as far as the College of late was concerned that you wish that they sort of tiles at the rise abducting painful and things like that\nThey came to conclude that it was basically all in the mind by that I mean people have in my dreams they believed that they they demonic end to chase with project may change the minds of painful\nAnd at night and I would believe that I Would have them believe they would take it on board flying saucers UFOs is subject to\nGenetic experiments so when I asked one of the guys why they believe that I did that um and they said it was to encourage the extraterrestrial angle Dame as China I'm encouraged belief in the existence of Iranians that were\nTaken paypal and abducted them and taking that Jane's and day and I at ... at cetera et cetera\nBut I Believe that none of that ever happened they believe it was all like a projection and the human mind to try and and\nBut they believed that none of that ever happened they believed it was all like a projection and the human mind to try and encourage people to believe that failure rate and the more I believed in the extraterrestrial angle it allowed the damons to\nUm do whatever they wanted to do without being exposed to what I really where at least to they they um Collins elites are personal view on all this\nDo we have like a heritage you have to be very the be all these people or these goblins if you will coming out of the woodwork whenever they will with them\nYeah and it's interesting that over the centuries and cultures and countries they change you know um it's ferries each goblins it's damons saying give us you know it's they see that and today Thailand's\nAnd um that's the the ... noted that aspect quite closely and ... that's the reason why there were these different types of entities over the centuries and\nDifferent cultures and countries\nWas because they should they should have you not mine I should stress that but they came to believe that they be entities themselves that paper was saying again where ... images again designed to create an image in the mind of the Paris and all the targeted paypal\nAnd to have them as far away from as possible from the ... the demonic truth is that I saw it and they would you know I'm\nSort of project images of goblins ferries you know I'm ... kind of thing things that you know today we just say as you know and to tighten stories fairy tales but by then\nYou know five hundred years ago those kinds of stories were taken very seriously by the papal those areas\nUm so a lot of that was sort of um compiled into the belief system of the ... um and you know a lot of it was extremely as I said the extremely controversial um\nYou know I never ... I only ever saw one of the guy to beat him at seven right of the guys are ... to various times in the group\nAnd as far as I can tell at one point the number of papers in the great it was just about seven or writes\nAnd edits heights at least at one point it was so my pops in the thirties maybe in the forties but he wasn't like a\nAs I said he wasn't a group that had an agency or a big building a huge funding that you know um [noise] but I Would have made things in sort of you know in a in a way to ruminate arranged for them and I prepared reports and and then handed over to whoever would find it interesting\nButts in ... you know they they were sort of deep into it and I'm a lot of the ferries you know very controversial as I said I'm of the seven or eight people who were in the group\nI'm over various decades I only have a so one of the guys sort of crack a joke or have a smile you know they were totally\nLiving in sort of like a a completely Blake world as I saw a face they saw themselves as sort of a ... of the human race\nUm the human rights could only be saved by having a sort of almost like a slave Dana an old ... I'll I'll testament sort of blood and son to kind of um states if a A N wrath of God\nAnd I felt that the world has to be pushed down that path away because it was the only way to ...\nSome states if a A N wrath of God\nAnd I felt that the world has to be pushed down that path way because it was the only way to save the human race so you know the answer really walk to ideas along those lines you know you've got to do this we've got to push the human rights down this path why wait a minute to save them that was basically that approach\nWould not be the same time about it do they see lately of maybe there are few out there are not necessarily because the leader anyone calling street do would be there to actually nudge gone towards asking do you think that's happening\n[noise] oh yeah I mean the whole issue of eschatology as I pointed out in the book there's an entire chapter on that they the guys in the group where uh you know eschatology end of days judgment day\nThe rapture all of that kind of stuff they were obsessed with that and I felt that they the way to save paypal was not to sort of you know use rockets and missiles to destroy\nMetal UFOs or whatever\nThat belief system was that if we could if they could suck bleep it by ... convince us of you know I bet you you know like an Old Testament and kind of wrath of God a type of situation where we all need to live and\nUh and leaving fair they felt that that would ensure a cells would make sure we went to heaven\nAnd so they felt they were doing the right thing um but you know at the end of the day\nIt comes down to the fact that they used the belief systems on that Paul now as I said I only saw one of the guys crack a joke was so not that was when I actually said you know where did you get the name they call it delayed because as I pointed out in the book\nThe group is not cold they call and say late that was a nickname that they use and I said well why did you used a nickname and the ... and the fact that\nOne of the guys in the group it was one of the uh late papal brought in to the program um was a guy who lived in this little town in New York coal Collins\nAnd if you look up Collins' New York the town for decades the entire town failed the town's population almost everybody would tend to chase factory and I'm actually in the chase factory this one guy\nUm who is working with this group\nYou know hey had sort of it was a lot they viewed him as like the late shift the town everybody else's working in the ... industry had the sacred job looking for damons and so I view it as like the late of Collins of this little town and then it became the call and say late it was just like it was like an ... inside joke\nUm about this one guy and this little town\nWell in in we only ... like I said that's the only time I have a them crack a joke the rest of the time it was just grim um situations you know we have to do something to to prevent this sort of demonic I'm from growing and growing well\nIn in the may have been aware\nOf that and as I said to the program why Collins name itself ... times\nA week we uh the the idea that\nThe original Collins family originally meant the cooling medicine then the men who were there to\nTake the mud and ... pretty much a symbol that drew me to give a servant on you would you ... you know among the vampire religions come from a recall

as I said you know what I'm saying about predicted programming and horror films and one of the biggest horror films to come out one of the scariest horror films come out was hereditary\nI don't know if anybody's seen it yet but one of the things I've noticed about a lot of horror films lately is they come up with these demons that no one has heard of\nAnd in what they do is in the present them as these strange demons that are being worshipped by people when it gets frightening I mean when you're looking at the none of the movie the non it comes from the movie the contract talks about a demon called ...\nAnd I talked about the the ... valley ... ... people you know they don't they're not aware of the demon valid they don't know what it is and what about\nAnd there was another movie remember the name of it but they were actually I'm dealing with another demon there was a a course the minute a demon that was part of horse park man and they released added the demon that was presented was one woman\nThings coming mall where you can't remember the name of the name in the book the ... the movie or something about Mali [noise] and then of course hereditary\nWhere the\nThe the or the demon or the devil or whatever it is but these are the does the secret a is a a demon origin\nThat it's called pine cone and\nYou know people that I go and who the hell is possible and then why should I say why should I be ... because time on this yet another example of a surgeon who if you do what he tells you to do he will grant you whatever you want you to give you whatever you want and this is what worries me is because we we're in a\nTime of supernatural country\nA rose railing guy Lee and Philips\nIn broken wrote a book called the vengeful gin and in the book it's an excellent study of the entire gym phenomena from a historical supernatural cultural perspective\nSo there's one part of the book the focus is on a trip to fill up it broke no made to Saudi Arabia Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd during the course of the visit it broke with no learned of a secret long term there will be secret long term a chance attempt by the special unit the U.S military to conjure and capture Jim\n... it broke no was told by a cousin the prince ... bin ... odd that the purpose of the program was to secure the U.S government aid technologically\nI'm hole which would allow the G and to pass through a dimensional doorway so they get people thinking get their minds taking about perhaps the way computers thinking about um [noise]\nA CERN and what they may be using what they're doing with the way computers\nAnd and how\nPeople like Jody Rosen said we can bring things through and they're not necessarily aliens but they're not necessarily demons you hear the same theme running around with the ... the same thing running around\nSomething is being Concord in brought through the wormhole\nSo what do they could they be June and could they be brought through some ancient ... June\nOr um gosh are so many names are for these creatures I mean but a hundred by mankind something that we cannot they did once they're unleashed they do the bidding of the one who ... who greets them\nShow while visiting Oman this guy this in Broken Arrow guy filled broke no heard a story of the governments of Oman and the United states both knowing about June\nAnd knowing that they have to deal with them because if there were unleashed he creates\nIt creates a blood letting them sort of ... it's like the power to the gym creates a bloodline as far as they can control the whether they can control all kinds of things will be Jim and the thing about ... blend in well with everyone else you don't even know the difference between\nA a real June or a human or in the gym because they they basically occupy the same look in the same space they can begin possessed people okay\nAnd so they have to be a exercised in a special way it's not like the same Satan versus a priest type thing that you're dealing with you're dealing with something else it's kind of like when\nWe talked about the ... box without depicts are a lot different than the men's but they have the same attributes in June too can be good or bad but a lot of them are being used in warfare [noise]\nAnd it can be ... it can be you know [noise] see I I'm just telling you I mean these\nKids were computers and these the way computers and CERN and all these other groups who wish to open a wormhole they wish to open the abyss bring forward these demons of the structural lesion that they can come in to release except for three thirty seven hundred that's ... fix every three thirty seven hundred will be back\nThe binding spells on Donald Trump a binding spell just means that whatever he decides to do won't work out that things you'll find confusion in his presidency\nAnd it seems that may be that spell is working on Donald Trump is just seems that whatever he's doing people tried to undermine\nAnd and so that's working in that respect I don't know if I mean people will disagree or agree whether or not Donald Trump is effective as a president but when they gave him that binding spell it was supposed to bind him so that everything he does is undermine for the difference between the binding straw on Trump and the hurtful spell that they put on Kavanaugh\nKavanaugh was supposed to feel something in this\nAnd Thomas Sheraton who basically as a practitioner himself he warned us he said if they do this to justice cabin on\nThe children will be harmed but he said he said the children will be harmed no sooner did he said is that we had six children die from a dental virus we had all these children became paralyzed with the other virus the internal viruses if he got there there were\nA mimicking polio we had the young girls who plotted to kill their classmates who drink their blood and now we have the shooting going on and from there we have the shooting at the synagogue and we have the bombs being sent out and I don't know if we can\nAttribute that to the spell for all of these things after that one day I'll ... on on on justice Kavanaugh all of these things happened right after that\nCan I say one more thing sure I'm even saying for since I've been listening to you for a couple of years now that they've always got a pen\nOr a fall guy on these things happen because you said when the um ... when they had the bomb was placed last week you said let's wait two or three days to see who takes the fall for it\nAnd they brought out sooner say off as the fall guy and the same thing with ... of a gentleman I think and ... and they came into that they can use the FBI mhm ... the he's the FBI or is a one leading the investigation they put them in control of everything\nTo always spoils terrorists plow guy up by the FBI knows exactly how they're going to come out they know exactly what's going to go on and it's always been that way\nSo yeah they're like playing federal you know\nAnd and you know I Wonder why people ... false flag in the ... the thing is that people people abuse the word false flag because what they forget is is when they say that it's a false flag they forget that real people are dying real people are being harmed by this and so\nThat is is when they say that it's a false flag they forget that real people are dying real people are being harmed by this and so it's not necessarily a false flag a false flag exists when you find out that someone is been pinned as a fall guy for the actions of\nTheir own government so they're thinking that their own governors behind the synagogue shooting\nAnd they think their own governments behind the bombings attempts or they think their own governments around the rice and\nThen it's a false flag but I Would say this I Would say that people are motivated by other reasons not just government\nBut there are motivators and motivations that are deeper and and far more sinister and it's in our interest and arcane type of way\nWhere we're looking at the center core looking at a group that is behind the scenes probably operating without any uh attention from the deep state that are doing these types of things and they are far more sinister and far more dark and have been around for a lot longer time\nThan ah than what we're giving credit for and that's what I'm seeing here in the end it do you\nThink powers and a sigh or have a sole they sold or are they they did see a FBI has found a way it is to control their mind ... I think\nWhat what they've done I think what they've done and it's obvious to me that some of you know when we look at a crises we look at death\nThe government or at least political figures find a way to exploited and one of the things that makes me totally sick and and it's really sad is it after the shooting in the synagogue\nAh where are these these people died it's a horrible thing and it and it's terrible\nWhat they have done do is they have now taken and they've created new speak out of it all such as ah using nationalism and and equating it would not be as them which is something that\nUh once again is is part of a weapon I sing words it's it's a it's a black magic way of weaponized sing words and another way they weaponize words as they're saying\nIf you say anything bad about George Soros and if you say anything bad about globalism it has a dog whistle for anti Semitism and it's never been that way I mean maybe some people hate George Soros because he's a Jew and if that if that's the case and\nThey may have a little anti Semitism going on but George Soros is not\nA good guy neither is Henry Kissinger and there are several other people that they deserve our scorn for what they do but that doesn't mean we're anti Semite see if we pointed out\nAnd and not only that but the idea of globalism being a Jewish conspiracy some people may think that because of designers them\nBut it's all about imperialism and empire building the global list agenda is empire building and if you're against empire building it's the very thing that we're against him World War two and so to say that it's anti Semitism\nHis once again weaponized sing words and that's evil\nI just have a feeling that we're going to ... election that election day\nBy I I agree fully biggest went off\nAnd I agree with rather than as it is building up yeah it is is very scary and so we should be prepared for anything under thank you for your call what a great call a let's go now to go to Brian in Wisconsin Hi Brian you're on ground zero\n... thanks for taking my call you back up you were mentioning the theme an arm on early ... I was a ... I was wondering if you were familiar with a a manuscript called all of a poll yes undergo demons yes\nYeah so it will I happen to know the mom is water up and I think the others that you might as well and the other one that was a art art or mhm because all of them\nIs that you mention where as well uh and uh uh the one that was a part rampart or mhm because all of all of the demon of those all of those do not have a a form that as you know some kind of\nYou know various animals kind of supplies together\nWhile I assume time on my mind is a a gym that rides a he rides a demonic ... strange looking camel\nOr to had a gamble I Believe and uh yeah and yeah he is a one of the experience that same English forgive Solomon when are we going to show a demons but he's also considered a gym in one of the gym that\nOr the other thing is is a I mean the seventies your demons and the gym are kind of the same thing right the uh the the story of a\nYou know the the classical ... story you know of the TV and the layout I mean that comes from the story of Solomon ah you know the\nThe story goes that eat you know had control over these Seventy two demons and made them do that all ... and then afterwards he can have them all in a glass jar and you know sealed it\nHad it thrown in the ocean or the sea or something and\nThey eventually got out somebody released them well you know for the the ... story the ... you know that the glass jar just became a proud to point out that it became one but but in the in the Arabic\nTelling out the Solomon the story and is the work that they used or\nA theme that write a solemn\nAnd a girl who when I read about time on or painting\nOr they say that this is what it is a demon these are the powers he holds\nKnowledge of past and future events he clears up any doubts ... he makes spirits appear ah games people's visions he can acquire and dismiss servant demons\nHe ... the dead he uh he can fly or he can remain under wondering definitely and he can make all kinds of things and all sorts of armor and technology appear\nTo be has to the magician\nSo wherever whatever time on her payment can do for\nThe person who is his a creator if he can\nGive them all the armor and technology necessary to create more of him or to create more of a of what they need for about\n... when I was younger I or you know I experimented with the you know the game or a you know all the different ... ah\nAh you know the system sir contrary envy the man I'm an Alister Crowley I eat out you have this as well and he\nClaimed to have a lot of the vote for the and from reading other people's experience with time frame these [noise] a theme in ...\nI have a feeling that what you're really doing is that the whole uh the whole ritual on the process of ...\nIs really a process of you know focusing the mind [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Billings", "day": "30"}
