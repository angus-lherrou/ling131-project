Halloween festivities that are coming up we'll talk more about that coming up in just a second in will will go around the horn or to a couple of places that are celebrating\nHalloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but uh we'll also talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of the season with the with\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago about uh the Salem witch trials and how historians\nHave been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim in it so it was fascinating go back if you're a member of\nCaused insider and listen for it but coming up next our\nThis is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this [noise] this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a\nA writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen tonight in Los Angeles we are not competing again he\nExtended game that the Dodgers ended up playing last night\nUh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game uh but uh but tonight a little different uh Bo Sox lead the series now three to one the\nDodgers will get another shot at it coming up tomorrow night to send the series back to Boston three to two but\nBut let me just say if it hadn't been for that error [laughter] I'm In the top of the thirteenth the bottom of the thirteenth yeah a ... that this would all be over now the boss it'd be going home with a trophy up at the games over and for those of you that missed the first two hours of last night's show because you are following the game\nAbout [noise] they put a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to the defense insider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada\nUm and what they have recently uncovered but but if they did well then\nYou know they were ... it would become the new Roswell I'm kinda happy with the old Roswell and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nGet evening so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel in and you know as a professional opportunity and people move to Roswell all the time but this is the time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do if if\nIf Ross was kind of Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of aliens and invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] um most people go out to grade arm which is a local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the corn me\nA great family at\nThe coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that were supposedly on a UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven at Eighteen get every single year and it just a great opportunity for people that go out and really try to experience aren't ... hunter\nFeeling of getting our NFL life and you're a\nCrash in Nineteen forty seven other people go out here in my heart or which again has a mystery at bottom layer and\nAnd it is our ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place to argue camp and things like that but again I'm more more of the stars and the telescopes and people get dressed up and they feel that they become one or they may come down and\nUh you know it's just that that there there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with them especially around\nHalloween and during the year after festival in July\n... so I I I'll be traveling through Roswell I'm I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to\nUh my new position I'll be teaching it to Kansas State and my my older my younger son and I was always wanted to go to Roswell right so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to dip hunter Roswell before we come back up again\nAnd it seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there if anybody were interested in in being able to go to the crash site\nOr ... or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crushing Roswell where what can they do\nSo they can go to the Iraq War on international year for me and Research Center which um is that great\nFor a call and the research a part of the crash I'm definitely would check out the library for those who are really the seekers and do you believe\nA in addition to that we have a U.S a tour that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first\nFor over twenty plus years and he will take you to the exact location of the timing of the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year the book or families where the crash occurred allegedly\nThey will take you out to the crash site where a Mac Brazil's rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land and so those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend that people check out\nAnd um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay so ... to use the word allegedly in there which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nUh we you know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that people can talk to you when you go into the UFO museum uh the locals know who the tourists are\nBecause at the sticker and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that one which is a great store\nOr bring your camera take pictures stop in the ... visitor center we have two amazing aliens that we'd decorate a for each holiday especially now for Halloween\n[laughter] and puts on a big fall festival with\nOur police officers and things like that for the community but\nUm these they're about six foot aliens and ah people love to take pictures with them and you'll hear the story of you know are employers the month his name is Bob and ... and\nUh you know people really come here searching for the truth and we as local we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and do the research\nWell that'd be great thank you appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Raj well for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nUm so our population has doubled in size we're we're a town about forty eight thousand and especially on the big anniversary of the festival um you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per year for tourism we see a little over\nTwo hundred and thirty thousand visitors that on the UFO museum and Research Center\nGood ... good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts a into all of bringing our next guest next but thank you want to you know and if I'm if I'm driving through town and get a chance we'll say hello okay\nYes please do thank you\nHoney the Jennings is the ah the ... the director of tourism in the public affairs in a rural New Mexico a season with the which GW Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a J W let me just tell you very funny book you make sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic inside on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this ... this is this is a very unusual place in American but it hasn't even more extraordinary please in the timeline of American history\nThat ... in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\nAbout right there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how it is self it's about a hundred thousand people come um and of course of the month than a quarter million so the massive amount of people for that small city to have to the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this was one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's not a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween in same as the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really important I mean we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize\nThat a ... that\nThere are other places around the world outside of Salem that had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that said on the first ever which wasn't the last one the ... of the biggest one of the strangest for them yeah there are you know the first for trout America you know the victim was in Connecticut and Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims of course yeah injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which is killed\nIt isn't it honestly it's really a problem today even in in um developed countries are still being people being rescued him for being with us but the the strange thing about that to me of course all of the planet that have had this problem and it's pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's Salem, Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween\nOn the way I liked the rub zombie story there in the book to\nSomething amazing ... in which we really don't taste while I was actually a contract almost staggering about this was the thing that you can check that out on top of the kind of way\nTo resolve started coming for\nLike a kind of are caused some hot excuse the pun ...\nNetworks beautifully owner Richard Haass throw here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system which has hailed this gentleman's hot perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies fears this powers to he'll visit\nC. A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com or call\nOne eight six six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five\nNews talk Ninety five point five the bad news and talk and buildings [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo uh Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look at some of those steps that we had mentioned more vaguely two thousand eleven bar do Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt linkage your England\nA long ago turned its ... incident in which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw\nIn Sweden there's a witch memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some of them and not even all that happened\nIn America but its Salem that sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery to the even the big question or a book and I think it's a combination of probably\nTwo dozen different factors obviously they get Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing [laughter] yeah that's a big part of it but I mean\nI'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why I kind of Salem grabbed onto that monitor and kind of held on to it you know over the course of about two centuries\nIt's kind of a you know it's a moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know it's it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually for you to you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home of that crazy serial killer treat the famous worlds exposition right you don't know did he do\nChicago's celebrating the fact that it was the home of that crazy ... the famous worlds exposition right you don't know did he do go on their way to put up signs and it happened here folks\n[laughter] right now they got through and I think to to fight for that one is that you know the tragedy in Salem itself was both basically just to\nThe court happened in Salem right it was a ... part of the trials right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations are around Salem the actual the actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver's was at the time and sailing village\nFor sale itself doesn't really have a ...\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the civic proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim of a witch trials I mean the actual which is I Lived there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... since I was kind of become Halloween town as well so it's a determined which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today and twenty eight team\nYeah it gets ... and this is important in this great distinction can't help but feel do it sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering\nThat this this really is about innocent victims of murder were executed and they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath the underneath their floorboards so to speak\nAnd part of it that's less connected to the tragedy it's more just around you know a city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and and twenty a team\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] it really is so they they don't\nCelebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they felt it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first um but really lead over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year [noise] do you want to visit found that Halloween you're just gonna get pandemonium crowd with a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically\nIt is it really is um your talk again a hundred thousand people packed to the small downtime with the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know\nFive or six blocks and you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes of freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars washed the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras was a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans\nMardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras [noise]\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same ... did you get in Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol consumed during this celebration\nDefinitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know cuts [laughter] how many of them right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween [noise] booze is a part of it but this is within the party\nOkay Joe ... ... you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean Salem known for being hunted either ... ... ...\nYou'd houses were were there are there still visitations from the victims of the originals Zealand trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that is it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting idea of innocent victims you have monsters 'cause of the film which trial didn't just involved which is in the story involves\nDemons and apps and shaped sister's ghost everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass\nSee all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history or up three hundred and Thirty years of history so that is just you know a lot of people over the centuries\nSo yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening in ... um ghost tours their spooky places there's the other five the executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky mythology around the city\nNow you've been there most of these I should say you've been there right you go there to oh yeah all the time out there two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be you'll situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but it's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders things are all kinds of things and I've never had an experience so my interest that that is more in the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience\nMy interest as more just in the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me yeah\nSo that's the best what's the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you captured while you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the one that really creepy ones is one of the Boston trailer victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual store co vent that then I can reverberate and have kind of thought around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape prone to jail they're\nSo all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know the cops kind of events happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trials so all that kinda stuff kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was or somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm curious do wizard attempt to for him to do like most of the same answer something while he was there\n[noise] no no he was a the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was real police station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do what he was\nIn towns are performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know scape\nAs PR move for his next big event so he wasn't down there doing more of a say on busing but who is doing is a is a scape escape routine\nLike ... ... ... you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into this\nIt's great for my favorite elements of the phantom of the city in complete conflict at all times between you know tourists and historians and visitors and residents and the art museum and the witches and the which has had this really strange position where they call themselves which is a ... you know do a sincere religion around it but I have to deal with the baggage of\n\n\n\n\nEleven counts of murder or condo Wolfers Fox News just some of the twenty nine charges Robin powers faces the forty six year old

I I just want to make it clear that real life murder is not a parlor game\nWhenever we speak of murder it's important to remember that the lives lost whether it's one dust whether it's Jack the ripper the Boston Straggler\nThe wages of Salem or the most elusive serial killer in American history about which will be talking to night the lives lost represent children who will never see adulthood adults that will never see their children grow young men and women who had their human protests\nGrow young men and women who had their human potential to offer the world taken away truly innocent people who died at the hands of evil\nIn the words of Clint Eastwood in one of my favorite movies are unforgiving it's a hell of a thing killing them and take away all that he's got an old that he's ever going to have [noise]\nSo even as the author of a true crime book myself in a book about how true crime stories are cold and why I treat the subject of murder personally\nThe woman that was at the center of my true crime book a black night for the bluegrass belt was the first cousin of my grandmother and a beloved character in my mother's southern family history I wrote that book just set the story straight and defend her on her\nBecause I had started to read the book and then I was told but if the red Sox make the series he can't be on with us\nSo I had read about the first three chapters and then when I heard the Bo Sox made it into the series I I packed the book in my boxes that are heading to Kansas 'cause I'm moving to K state understand you live in Lawrence, Kansas a lot of the two\nOf them on\nSo I'm moving to Manhattan meant to be ... will be like almost neighbors and yet\nI wind up in Manhattan I Know very well and I\nOh totally cool so it's so I packed the book and then I got the call like four days and I know he's good to go like uh the\nThey had to overnight me a book and I had it in my hand but unfortunately awesome and I lost a few days reading time so I haven't finished yet and I love nothing more than doing an interview on a book I finished reading especially because I can tell already you're building up to a climax than I Do not want to miss\nWith the true story of the the ah the America's most elusive serial killer demand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your your co author is your wife Rachel McCarthy James\nHow am I call her my daughter read don't or my daughter ... she's a she worked with me on a book [noise]\nOkay it doesn't specify that's what I did make an assumption I'm Sorry I should have a figure that out\nI didn't really say that when I worked\nOut well I'd probably did somewhere but I didn't see it but in any minute I just wanted to say I'm a great book obviously deserves all the accolades that ... that you are getting for it and the fact that you very likely crack this case\nUm is very much to your credit so I I Want to start if I can with the uh by the way to congratulations on the ... of the red Sox win tonight and what a game last night good thing you weren't booked for last night huh\n[laughter] yeah I Would add to capitalize on it I Would have been a torture to keep all the way I have to be going well over here on earth but\nYou and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last uh last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\n[noise] well I wouldn't say so they ah I wrote about the box and I was trying or along with hundreds of other crimes are going to book I wrote maybe six or seven years ago called pocket of crime or a ... I did um\nUh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took him in a box and stronger case and publish some theories about it which might be right or wrong or knows [laughter]\nWell I Love that I ... I may revisited that 'cause I've always been very interested in that as well but the man's on the train is a story it is it speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and ruled the the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said\nIs is there any story too old to be told\nOr when it comes to you know retailing a story about a murder and she said absolutely\nNot she said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said which which best is it's actually\nYou is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that it either been\nIncorrectly adjudicated which we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it but also is true of all the time that that will be of there'll be somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed\nJust isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody has connecting them\nYet but in in one at least in one case a ... a a a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up being killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now these totally innocent\n[noise] they are right there there are two while they're there for people who were actually ... executed\nFor crimes that may have been committed by the man trying to them I Would go so far as I say I'm fairly certain the crime was committed by the man from the train pulled a local person was executed nonetheless\nThe or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure they uh uh but there were also nine people nine black people or\nWho are when I was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by Matt from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight Alaska that we are pretty sure that was him was Nineteen quote all although there was a there was an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say that I can\nSay I looked in the ... I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... Illinois I saw the town where I'm home alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the home alone house\nI'm ... and ... the mayor\nIn around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town\nI'm was murdered along with his wife in their home\nIn a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks\nIs that right yeah and it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of into the sort of thing where I get it and uh and ... the the belief was always that it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them [noise]\nUm but when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of the men from the train\n[noise] the ... it is possible we have we assumed that we did not find every crime that he committed with just we found those er which there were enough signature\nA care sick segment or a characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that they're there for him but they they may well committed and probably did commit other crimes\nThat are we just did not have enough information about it but that that's a new and actually I I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear about Ken scratching because I'm writing down\n[laughter] I wouldn't have to murder about a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't\nUm and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody but it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a a a poke anyway so how many people do we think\nWere murdered along America's railroad tracks by single perpetrator\nDemand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason or ... you know during this period\n[noise] well what Rachel I did was we put the murders and Buckeye\nRight there's a hundred percent ... that is crimes were certain okay I'm a Seventy percent ... percent bucket American ... bucket right and I'm ... total up the numbers of murders and each pocket and multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that ah\nIt was our our criminal and the murder of the tunnel came up with is a hundred and one that actually include the two people who were murdered who were executed by the state\nA lot for crimes they committed and the the or somewhere between four and nine people who were who were murdered by Lynch mob for crimes that he either did commit or it may have committed\nSome germs are the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions\nAs murders because they were innocent um do we say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims his guy okay that's right All right so ... ... tickets\nCrime as you as you see the pattern developing in the late ... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\n[noise] well ... this is a long ... this could be a long answer I'm not a long winded person those could be a long trip because there are a lot of things the tie them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight\nA family is murder most often a family including a young girl is murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small ... at a town too small to have a police department [noise]\nThey live near the intersection of two railroad tracks\nThe I'm a very often bodies are moved their killed with an AK ... is found in the in the yard of the victims are in the yard of a neighbor and they act as a band and at the scene of the crime the\nHandle is washed her fingerprints the house is locked up tight all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with black it so that you can't see it all the doors are all law [noise] the or or something\nIs jammed in the door [noise] ah the head off any move bodies post mortem so the police when they broke and would find a\nA a huge blood stain in one room and then a bloody trail and the bodies and another on the um [noise]\nYou just hated the interrupt you because you were doing such a great job with the explanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I had to cut you off because we had the heartbreaking but the younger layers\nGraduate or after that because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to find\nThe heart of type ... second biggest as like a little bit but yeah\n... ... what's that\nLike thirty four of them aren't there or something or\nSomething like that the um the uh the crime you normally occurred on Sunday night so you just heard on the weekends up until Nineteen ten the crimes almost all occurred in areas in which the primary industry was ballgame or one\nOf the primary understood as was logging the or doors doors and windows ... Jeff shot I think I mentioned that the um [noise] there's all there are clear idea graphic patterns and the murders if one occurs just south of Portland them extra curves just north of Portland\nA so that that would be a link between them the uh\nUh one thing that is odd is that he would he would take a lap from inside the house turn the wick way down low so that you just gave out a little bit of light take the chairman a awful lamp and set it on the floor usually under a table\nA and then carry the lamp around with him as he committed the murders and the other thing is that he would um you'll put poet blankets over the head of a sleeping person or a half a second before you had with an axe or you did that a lot and they probably did that to\nKeep the blood from flying back and hitting hitting him as he was\nOrdering someone the or the coup quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nYeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along\nLogging lines that actually would be consistent with weird this murder happened it's not that the tone that I grew up in the logging town but it was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA new one that was plenty of logging was going on in in Wisconsin it was it was insane for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed ... another\nThing I forgot to mention there all the all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he that he may have ... one of his first crime which was just an outburst of anger and not\nAnd not a plan to vent probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\n[noise] um we're talking about America's most elusive serial killer and Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for the dubious around\nIt yeah it it probably might be but I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I knew I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder and American history or the first or something murder is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is a killing done in secret there because it has done in in secret the facts about it are never\nFully known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed and um you get a lot of different people who claimed to be\nThe worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that disgusting titled than this this person but uh I'd I'd\nAs the reality is we just kept document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody [noise]\nYeah I mean it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely nobody would ever know about it and they could they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims right where John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long so\nBut the demand from the train is is he is he's called\nAny we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you'd be discovered about this in terms of solving the crime a little bit later on almost don't want to 'cause I don't want to ruin them so close to ... you know finishing I was reading all afternoon furiously but then there's a couple of good football games to strengthen the dinner\nSo the ... but this guy he nobody it ... the president does him for us to just assume\nThat there was some national awareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks because there was a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out\nAbout killers alone trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight and nine ten eleven nothing at all the and and that this has to do with the organization of the a wire services at that time and Eighteen Ninety eight the wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little\nUh immigration of this tight have little ability to spread from town to town\nBy Nineteen twelve the national wire services were were organized at a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other a wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years\nAnd ah October of Nineteen eleven all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening so when they went to his most famous crime ... in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is him and this is the latest crime in this\nTerrible series that's been going on right for the first\nMore than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even aware and logically they should have that even though you look at the crimes that there's a case in Virginia West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart\nThe er er and and pounds that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies\nAnd you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year\nSo you would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man our little who was later executed for\nAnd the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate events\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speak to\nThe lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also\nIt speaks to the infancy of\nThe jurisdiction of sharing of police departments and sheriff's departments and there was no national uh investigative a body of like the FBI yet so there was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true and that introduces is also into one of the major themes of the ...\n... what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true and that introduces is also into one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime or a long time I'm [laughter]\nI thought I was fairly knowledgeable about it I was astonished to to realize how backward and ineffective or judicial system was just a hundred years ago it's beyond belief how\nPrimitive the investigative\nProcess that's war at the time of these crimes and what the man from the train did was to\nExploit the peculiar weaknesses of the of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture\nThe uh he knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered\nThere was no no way really to\nTo connect it to him and he knew that if you committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it but if you committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\nAnd syringe ink medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean the the ... and ... this was um and then ... I'll even throw in another piece eaten in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn 'em ... is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science [noise]\nUm yeah and I I wrote about this a little bit in in the I'm In a true crime book and he had written about this murder that happened in my family isn't that the the ... the jury's ... the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nLike telling them this is ... it's it's not science look at all these crazy things they're talking about which we know none of these things are true now of course we look at juries very differently right and they have a very there now they had the CSI effect when the expecting\nThe forensics to be presented to the Lincoln is on a TV show the back then it was exactly the opposite they were they they were resistant to it\nIf there was ever a time to live United it is now\nNow is the time to speak with one voice to build up not tear down it's time to join hands and live United against the problems that keep our communities from thriving\nUnited Way fights for the health education and financial stability of every person in every community will you volunteer or donate now had United Way dot org\nAnd we just as we're much she'd be well am nine Seventy buildings these huge huge ward and you're listening to news ... voice\nRockets out on\nThe chilling sounds of a synagogue shooter in Pittsburgh I'm Del Walters Fox News released releasing the radio calls in the moments of the massacre\n[laughter]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nWhen the shooting stopped eleven people inside the synagogue were dead six wound it\nCan't happen during a baby naming ceremony a gunman reportedly shouting all Jews must die before opening fire at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrels hill neighborhood went to his ... director of the Pittsburgh department of public safety\nIt's a very horrific crimes and that's one of the worst that I've seen and I've been on some plane crashes it's it's very bad\nFor suspect identified as forty six year old Robert Ballard is President Trump says he should face the death penalty ...

starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a ... a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\n[noise] an an item of June nine Nineteen twelve\nOr the lights were out in Alaska due to a um\nA dispute between the voice cause city council and the power company so they had city lights in the street lights but they were out and ... and the town was in complete darkness or this Sunday night there was a church service\nOr a Sunday night church service organized by one of the victims of the woman who was the head of the house\nAfter the ... after the ... I didn't\nInto this in the book but I think it's true I don't believe in divorce can murders what ... what ever happened when they did have the light spin on and the reason that was true is that he had committed another atrocity just six days earlier about a hundred miles away\nBeen on and the reason that was true is that he had committed another atrocity just six days earlier about a hundred miles away and he normally would not have a\nHead another outraged that quickly but because the lights the city was plunged into darkness it was a perfect opportunity for him and he couldn't pass it up anyway ... um\nUh the two little girls named Ida Lena still under went home with a more family the family of Henry More they walked home after the church service and and uh the little girls spent the night with the their friend the little girl was a member of the family\nOn the morning of June ten no one is starting around in the house the um and the uh uh his brother finally comes and breaks into the house finds a couple of bodies and runs out of the house scraping they bring the town marshal and he\nIs his name was it was a tank Horton Mr Horton courageously goes through the house\nYou have to understand he has no reason to believe anything other than that a craze murderer is hiding somewhere in this house here as a dark house\nOr he's holding matches in front of him or with no gun to no form of protection holding matches in front of a in front of his other himself going from room to room finding bodies\nTheir eight dead bodies in the house and in my log house in a small quiet mid western town\nThe um [noise] uh and all of them hit\nIn the head with an axe the access found as it usually is next to the body of a little girl the man from the train was a it was a pervert than he was interested in little little girls and the the little girl was usually found in a\nIn an attitude suggesting that she had been a she had been outraged after that the um [noise] uh\nIn any case the crime was not there was a a great uproar as you can imagine but the crime was not solved\nOr two years later a con man named Jay and walk her son came to Alaska\nAnd realized that he could sustain a phony investigation of the crime\nBy keeping people angry\nHe can keep donations coming in by keeping people angry or ... and he did that by using a a very prominent local citizen Frank Jones of financing the crimes\nThere isn't any chance in the world the Frank Jones was guilty or that he had in any any connection to it but this campaign to prosecute Frank Jones divided pulled us or\nIn a horrible and unprecedented way the city fought over whether or not Jones did or didn't do it for several years\nUh and became a cable badly divided community you know families on one\nSide of the line wouldn't play with families on the other side of the line they wouldn't go that they wouldn't shop at their stores they wouldn't uh wouldn't have anything to do with them that this battle lasted in Alaska for even though\nA Wilkerson was eventually run out of town in Nineteen Seventeen the uh um the battle went on for a long time\nAnd the hard feelings emanating from it persisted in the city I Would I Would say it's just too extent that they presented to the\nDay [noise]\nEddie from it persisted in the city I Would I Would say for two effects that that they are supposed to the present day\n[noise] you know you mentioned the piece about the the person in whipping up sentiment in making a false accusation to profit from it\nAnd even that creates a pattern for all too often how\nUm crime stories unsolved crimes stories are treated\nYet at the same time it it speaks to the fact that there weren't cold case police officers working the the crime still the crimes have been at that time might have been solved by\nAfter that period of time by somebody writing a letter confessing or somebody knowing somebody that\nBut it wasn't it went to almost literally like fall in their lap\nWhich again comes back to the the power of storytelling\nAnd how ... just by keeping my telling a story the beginning middle and end of these events it doesn't matter how old the story is is that it it will get people to listen again into reconsider again and most likely to connect again to that sense of outrage\nAbout what had happened and so\nYou know a a static police report won't necessarily you know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah yeah that's right and and and they do that but also keeps kind of the idea of the murder alive [laughter]\nIt it makes it it gives you a sensation again it that is you know the core of sensationalism\nBut it does it make it make you feel it again the fact that this crime in happened had they had they built it\nYou know any kind of memorial to the family had there been\nAny had there been what had the town done to try to come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this comment coming to town there afterwards\nThe um [noise] uh ... well there\nWas I don't know that there was that Congress found about I don't know that anyone build a memorial to them\n[noise] I I'm for many years of Alaska authority that I Would say that still true today that pay the the chamber of\nCommerce tribes ... was known for something else right right\nThe ah ... there is a house for the crime occurred is still standing of his operated as a kind of of\nMore tourism or it's the it's a shows up on paranormal ... TV shows and people pay to take tours of the house the I'm a ... if\nYou drive around ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors houses but\nThat but ah where the ... ... knowing for is not mentioned anywhere\nUm uh that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial right the um uh I don't know that\nYou raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper\nMemorial to the victims victims were mostly poor people most people without\nA without one and the more family was very well why they are\nAnd the community uh thought well all of them and the\nRigorous efforts to solve the crime wore a kind of memorial to them uh but I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers ... or there's an effort to try to so it doesn't enough to be like a statue but it is interesting how communities will\nOr ... or there's an effort to try to so it doesn't even have to be like a statue\nBut it is interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics piece that explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um one of them abs of trades crimes are the double murder and Colorado Springs it murder to families and whatnot and adjoining how\nThe uh uh but if you if you go to that community where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could show yeah oh that's a house right there um but it still it has not forgotten\nOr many places\nMany places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally I'm absolutely forgotten but in some of the ... still quite well remember [noise]\nSo I Want it you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because [noise]\n\nJames the co author of the men from the train to the research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so so I got the wrong [laughter]\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing or you looked at these ah you looked at these murders\nYou know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that um or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to how many unsolved murders\nWere going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of a an entire family and one of that is a is a rare of that it was then and it is now but uh uh there were many many unsolved murders in that era\nNow that means even as you mentioned they just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't the investigation wouldn't last for long because it wasn't a lot of funding\nBut Joe is let's let's let's go down this path of of the process that you used to try to actually\nYou know narrowed down to a name to a person\nI've I've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper for example for us and including going through ships registries and finding whether or not there was a particular sailor\nThat coincided with the murders in white chapel and or other parts of the world\nThat shared similar characteristics as the the crimes in in England that happened in Central America or happened in in ...\nAnd so they were able to try to find you know well this sailor went from this poor to that port and in each one of these ports there was a murder so it it it just it but if you have to have to START I mean it isn't quite a needle in a haystack but it's\nIt's at least maybe I'm\n... you know to to look at it broadly you're you're you don't even know yet what you don't know when you start doing a search like this so you you don't\nYou know is it even possible that a name could even be found given the scarcity of information about you know people are public registries during that period\n[noise] [noise] ... intervention the Jack the ripper case I Am I read I have read\nProbably twenty bucks saying jak river was this guy or doctor ever was that guy or exactly they are and I and my other book popular crime I made fun of the people who wrote those books um the uh uh because I don't\nI don't have much confidence that you can actually do that and to be Frank almost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are selling the um I never really expected that we would find it convincing argument\nAbout who this who was doing this so I mean we were looking gas and Rachel says that she did expect to find them but I didn't they um [noise] a lot when we walk the crimes backward\nA there is a crime in Massachusetts in Nineteen Ninety eight\nThat Rachel says the moment she saw it she knew it with him\nThe um uh and that was because I had told her that this guy wouldn't make mistakes and in his first crime he did make\nNumerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was the um uh but the number of details that match up in the first crime to let's say Alaska\nIs is just it's beyond anything that you would you would a\nSuspect was a\nCould be calling for them and I'll I'll mentioned just a few things\nPlease do you want me to give you the name or not it doesn't really matter you know we will\nGo through the the similarities first\nWell ... the first crimes that were\nSort of publicly link where crimes in the Portland area and two crimes and the Portland area where we're committed rather obviously by the same man and the the tech the same detectives happen to be investigating him and thought this is the same guy I mean that crime a month ago down\nSouth Portland the um uh\nThat criminal had size six feet the um there's another crime in Maine in Nineteen oh two in which the criminals there were there were a pair of boots prints that were central to the trial\nOr again size six feet this is very uh the the so we we know that this is a small man well it is recorded about man that we found that he did in fact have size six feet\nNot speculation he did\nWe know that we ... it was believed that he was small because I'm the or a ... and in other places\nWhen he swung the acts the ceiling was very low the ceiling is only about seven feet high in the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe over his head he just barely grazed the ceiling if a person of normal size a person of\nA ... a person a large man could not swinging acts over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling\nBecause of that it was believed that he had to be small he was five foot for\nThe uh uh it was suspected if you look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ax you can see clearly rather it's the guy is basically left handed or basically right handed that's a pretty easy thing to see\nIt was believed that the murder and Alaska was left handed\nThe man who committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed\nWe had said that he had to be a well the first stories about him say that he was an experience trap than he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settle down into an area [noise]\nWe had said that he must work as a longer because all the crimes for about ten years occur and logging areas the first story about him first stories about him specifically say that he was an experience the longer\nThe uh uh the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the\nA ... girl a that was there in the first crime in the first cry he always kill the man of the house first and the a and ended with the murder of a young girl that's what he did and first crime\nThe he always used the one side of the X. I never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never killed anyone with a sharp ... backs but it was always his intention to use the blunt side of the acts\nIn this first crime blunt side of the acts and as he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that the uh so the crime just matches up on too many points\nFor you to think that this isn't him\nSilly you started to look for signs or left handed and well ... I didn't even longer axe murderer [laughter] [noise] um ... well how did you begin to narrowly name out of that\nHe it was obvious so he ... when it first crime is obvious who had committed it 'cause he was living with the family which that's a common thing or a cereal murders for crime he often kills people to home he with his directly connected and\nCan be tied so we killed the first family an Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who have done it because he fled the scene and I was so they were looking for is just that all of these other facts about the first about the criminal happened to line up with what we were looking for\nAnd the name that you believe is a ... ... the men on the train\nThe ... the name that he was using there was all Miller the weather that we actually went to Germany immigrant or the or whether that was his actual name or not um there's speculation he could have been using a false name even that however there's no real reason to believe he was\nWe found that I shouldn't say we've found a friend of mine doing research on his own after the book was published found are they the ships record in which you had entered the country about an Eighteen Ninety the I'm a probably a man named Paul Miller had entered the country\nI'm On a ... he was he walked with a sailors gate he you know if\nIt was more like it in there and walk side to side with the uh uh and the uh uh\nUh they they so if he had been in the German army a German Navy so ah they found that ship within which became what came into the country\nDo the sailors gate in reference to lack of

James I think we've covered a lot of things demand from the train\nDiscovering America's most elusive serial killer how he did it Ninety deaths\nUm and yet as he says he's not even sure that they know all of the people that this man Paul Miller\nOr could have killed starting in Eighteen Ninety eight until he was willing to lead stopped um but what we have is we have a name and we have a description\nCurious to see whether that my jogging anybody else's memories of a local story in their community like you did with me earlier in the show we'll find out next uh coast to coast am this is Ian but [noise]\nThe natural habitats the creepy ... is a horror movie that compelled being creepy ... guys who is more can you sing with short imagining it's mindless but when\nAlmost all of the house ... murders\nWere uh were houses burn wood times\nCoal a buddy either water coal use an ax to split the wood or break up the coal right\nHe would he would use the coal actually the boy that would actually whatever you found outside the building\nWell she know that answers actually to my previous question about dropping the act's I wasn't so much thinking in terms of\nBigger print evidence I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he had purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had it in the house that's the one he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten in Nineteen than it was very common for people to have an ax no yeah wouldn't mile outside their house oh yeah ...\nIs why I connect to the story I grew up in a small town in the Nineteen fifties and sixties and that we have an accent what bottle outside our house and I\nI chopped a lot of with with them or to or burning out\nYeah my dad till ... similar story but then he and his brothers you know they would tempt them fight over who's going to be chopping wood and and when we were growing up we had an ax around the house [laughter] we we did a lot of woods jumping then for some reason my dad was attached to it All right so let me bring in Paxton whose in Chicago\nAnd the first time caller line for Bill James author of the men from the train very interesting Paxton\nGuys fascinating law English teacher and naturally I I lean pretty heavily on coal at this time of year and I I wanted to ask your guest village feet if you noticed any ... any parallels between pose a vision you wrote about and that says\nThat the murderer always has a guilty conscience and really tries to get caught and some of the more famous stories like the black cat\nWell ironically the berries and acts and his wife had right that's the way he describes it and and when the least calm he is not going to be caught so\nYou know he will be at war with the cat in the wall and uh you know he tried to get him into the basement and how how the ... but he always tried to giving away\nThe a ... by the way while doing research on the crime book I I happen to find a story in a Paris newspaper in Eighteen forty six or which\nStories from which the cast of ... among the autos his base the uh the poll also of course was it was a avid reader crime choices as I'm sure you know\nThe uh anyway the answer is no ... is he absolutely was not trying to get caught in ... many many many serial murderers are sort of\nPlaying games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it uh but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it but that that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is that he had a very unusual\nOr aversion to being caught he didn't he wasn't he wasn't the absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent\nAnd very well thought out you've ac of action not ever to be caught one reason he never took anything from a crime scene even the you know if there was a hundred dollar setting off the shelf there\nYou wouldn't take it because he knew very well that if he was caught fleeing the crime scene inflating a scene with or something that could be\nTied to that scene you know a lot of people were executed for that the so no he was he was very ... is quite unusual extent yeah had a an aversion to being caught\nSome serious restraint right there I think we're a guy who didn't have any money the the the the Jews and disciplines um beg you mentioned in as good a marine who's in Athens, Georgia until she goes for Bill James Marie\n... high ... in in ...\nUm well I was calling because I I was kinda curious the first of all how you got out talking about the acts and\nUm my my brother and I we were in fact again I'm not going to happen after the civil war in our family um and he was my great however many that grandfather that was he was killed when an act\nAnd then they think that his wife and maybe a fan did that and ended up being a brother in law that was convicted and um he lives right out and I feel I guess they have that same field workers would be blamed for it but anyway and so we were investigating that and then\nMy brother was murdered a year ago\nAnd then his son is in jail for killing a guy about two years ago by now so if there's a lot of it around but um\nBut I was wondering and you may you mentioned earlier about\nIf a person you know if they didn't make a lot of mistakes and that person that we believe that killed my brother he um he seemed to be [noise] he was so far have gotten away with it and say well how do you find out on me about a person if he um\nYou know where that found that\n... see I'm just wondering if maybe he had done this before you know what I mean he was because every little detail he hangs she may have now like killing and\nWhat it was just it seems to perfect for the first time this is what you're saying I certainly\nFeel for you I'm very sorry about go walk through the uh\nUh I Wish there was on the ticket the help that would be helpful to you but I there really isn't I mean I I think as I said in our case we were just very fortunate to uh to find this treasure trove of information about the about the first crime the uh but I I it's not something you can and we if we could ...\nRachel and I were to sit out\nAnd solve a another series of crimes like this we wouldn't it wouldn't happen for us it's because it wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew what we're doing it would just the way\nIt wouldn't happen for us because it wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew what we're doing it just the way the crime set up the way the story's set up that broke for\n'em again with the ... to my ... in New York a poor James and goes to goes\nYes good morning gentlemen and when a delight to uh I see a ... year back in this adolescent\nWere good luck with that Web looking forward to it\nBut I have um a a two part question with some comment and I'll listen I'm over the uh well it's not the ad in New York it's it's over the Internet [laughter]\nFirst part is now we have is that she would already faces at at hand ah people at the FBI or consider that profile is so I like to know\nIf you put this in a more modern contacts how a such a a FBI profile of Mike Mike slash this guy out much for the um also I like to hear more about and whether it's in a book in terms of somebody in a sense that\nGot caught up including the black people who um [noise] wound up but not even going to trial but getting Lynch\nAnd the last part is uh I you mentioned about the state and the police at this time at the turn of the century that saw the um [noise] ah I recently read a book by um you\nKnow ... it's called how the eye which became white this is on the Jacksonian Arab pre civil war\nAnd he actually describe the police besides the fact that you know they had to always looking for a fugitive black folk but they off this glad then as basically competing gangs are basically street gangs wouldn't volunteer fire department\nThat had competing fights and and demonstrations and I like in common that whether he's familiar with the gangs that came up as as a that fall and then the police and I'll listen over and over the Internet thank you so much for\nYour for your most intelligent questions you know I'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse gangs are from New York and pretty civil war because they\nAre I wrote about them in the book popular crime or the war in a there was a woman this gets back to pose there there was a woman named Mary Rogers or who was murdered in a New York and I want to say can\nThey can forty five or thereabouts a poll home fictionalized says the murder Murray rosy but the actual woman's name was very Rogers the ah in the uh\nThere was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her cry for that crime but then it really is an odd thing that there were these fire houses that were really just just a\nA house with his family Joe's of pretty unruly people uh and they and they were kind of terrorizing the city so yeah I I Do the that's an odd story isn't it\n[noise] [noise]\nWe've got callers coast to coast leading to talk with Bill James give us a minute here's we wrap up the last question um we talked about how there were in fact gangs of fire departments and\nAnd I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go to you can watch the movie streets in New York right that Scorsese movie ... there's a lot of them ... stranded in there that's kinda cool though she left it because the question about what it Indiana modern police or FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI have it out and do that because the that would not be in my nature I mean\nYou know what this is my\nBook is written to say this is what I think and if you think something that's up to you I I but I wouldn't ask the uh uh John Douglass modern wellness profile or has spoken and written about Alaska or one of his observations was\nThat uh the um well he had\nSeveral observations about the ... crime that lined up with what we believe for other reasons one was that the murder had to be older because he is extremely organized I mean it off the chart how organized is this burger this guy is\nUnbelievably organize a the a ... and also\nHe um he said that\nHi is unbelievably organized or the or and and also he he um he said that rubber ...

I think the Lizzie Borden pieces interesting I think it was the first thing that came to mind for a lot of people\nAnd and maybe speaks to the idea of going into it it does connect in the sense that it was a family\nIt was a house it was ... and then it was a it may be a crime of opportunity um in in grabbing an axe that was near a hat you know that was that the property that to inside\nAnd the idea that it was in and out really quickly and nothing was stolen which is another piece because you know that was ... you know what why would somebody going to the house\nAnd killed were it not for that that was the part of the motives piece that was presented you know against Lizzie Borden was that she still do inherent property which makes sense\nBut it did it did give me a moment to where I was thinking about the let's go to a dentist is in New York on coast to coast am for Bill James author of demand from the train bill Dennis\n...\nIt's been a wonderful program it's a ... well thank you for taking my call I really appreciate it\nLed to have um\nAnd I'm Glad you're back I root for them to you look for years and I [noise] I Know your way through\nUm and I'm Glad you're back I listen to you for years and I I Know you went through some problems there are little ...

festivities that are coming up we'll talk more about that coming up and just a second and we'll we'll go around the horn 'em to a couple of places that are celebrating\nHalloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but uh we'll also talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of a season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago [noise]\nAbout ah the Salem witch trials and how historians have been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim I mean it ... it was fascinating go back if you're a member of\nCaused insider and listen for it but coming up next our\nThis is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this [noise] this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a\nA writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and

according to a defense insider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada\nUm and what they have recently uncovered but but if they did well then you know they would it would become the new Roswell\nI'm kind of happy with the old role as well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nEvening so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell I'm\nAnd she promotes Roswell as a travel and and you know as a professional opportunity and people move to Roswell all the time but this is the time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do if if\nIf Ross was kind of Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of aliens and invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] um most people go out to grade are which is a local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the corn me\nA great family at at the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that were supposedly on a UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven or they can get every single year and it is a great opportunity or people that go out and really try to experience aren't\nHunter feeling of getting our NFL life and you're a crack in Nineteen forty seven\nOther people go out care bye to my heart I wake up and has a mystery at bottom rare and [noise]\nAnd it is our ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place to argue camp and things like that but again I'm more more of the stars and the telescopes and people get dressed up and\nThey feel that they become one or they may come down and uh you know it's just that that the area where there is something here that land at and\nAnd Halloween and during the UFO festival in July\nSo I I I'll be traveling ... I'm moving coming up them in a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to\nUh my new position will be teaching you to Kansas State and my my older my younger son and I was always wanted to go to Ross will read so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of her way to ... ... well before we come back up again\nAnd it seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there is anybody we're interested in in being able to\nGo to the crash site or or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crushing Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the rival on international year from him and Research Center which um is a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the crash I'm definitely what check out the library for those who are really the seekers and do you believe\nA in addition to that we have a U.S a tour of that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first\nFor over twenty plus years and he will take you to the exact location of the timing of the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year the bulk or families where the crash occurred\nAllegedly they will take you out to the crash site where a knack for themselves rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land\nAnd so those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend that people check out and um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay so ... to use the word allegedly which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nUh we you know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the UFO museum uh the locals know who the tourists\nAre because at the sticker and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that one which is a great story I bring your camera take pictures stop in the ... visitor center we have two amazing aliens that we'd decorate\nA for each holiday especially now for Halloween [laughter] he puts on a big fall festival with our police officers and things like that for the community but\nUm these they're about six foot aliens and uh people love to take pictures with them and\nThey'll hear the story of you know are employers the month his name is Bob and ... and\nUh you know people really come here searching for the truth and we as\nLocal we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you can research\nWell that'd be great thank you appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Raj well for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nUm so our population has doubled in size we're we're account about forty eight thousand and especially on the big anniversaries of the festival um you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per year for tourism we see a little over two hundred\nAll I'm ... ... ... ... ... our our eyes on average per year for Korean family here a little over two hundred and thirty thousand bigger honey then you're you're learning Research Center [noise]\nPretty good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts uh and so I'll I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you honey to and if I'm if I'm driving through time we get a chance they'll say hello okay yeah ... where\nThe money to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a Gemini let me just tell you very funny book you read a great sense of humor I really enjoy all the sort of a comic sides on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline of American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts\nThey do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October is that about right\nAbout right there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people come um and of course of the month than a quarter million so it's a massive amount of people for the small city to have within the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's not it's not a narrow subject but you picked Halloween in same as the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about ... on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views on Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\nA ... that there\nAre other places around the world outside the Salem that had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\n[noise] yeah I always try to tell people that felt wasn't the first ever which trial wasn't the last ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for the you know there are [noise] you know the first for trout America you know the victim was in Connecticut and Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries but\nWe don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nIt is and it's honestly it's really a problem today even in and I'm sort of our country there's still we're being people are being asked you for being with us but the the the strange thing about that to me of course is that all of the planet that I've had this problem and it's pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that Salem, Massachusetts [noise]\nThat's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind\nEnrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go at it won't get unbiased helped to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with our co payments more choices like dental\nAnd vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now our health markets Medicare assistance as freight\nThanks Mike this is Michael method for health markets\nFor your free Medicare assistance coal eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two that's eight hundred six nine for forty five forty to eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two\nAnd the best use in billings news talk Ninety five point five [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo ah Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just tend to look up some of those steps that we had mentioned\nMore vaguely two thousand eleven ... Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt linkage or England\nOr long ago turned its ... incident in which ten people were hanged and sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw\nIn Sweden there's a witch memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just\nIn a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused\nAnd that's just some of them and not even all that happened in America but its Salem that sticks out and so why why do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery to the even that's one of the big questions I had gone to the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing [laughter]\nOh yeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that moniker and kind of held on to it you know over the course of about two centuries\nThen it's kind of a you know you it's a moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that's not usually what it holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of that for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy ... the famous worlds exposition right you don't know did he do go on their way to put up signs of it happening here folks\n[laughter] right through it I think to to fight for that one is that you know the tragedy in Salem itself\nWas basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was the ... part of the trials actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations are around Salem the actual the actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver's was at the time to film village\nFor sale itself doesn't really have a kind of\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the civic proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim of a witch trials I mean the actual which is I live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... than it was kind of become Halloween count as well so it's a determined which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today in twenty eight team\nYeah I guess this is important and I this is great distinction can't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering\nThat this this really is about innocent victims of murder [laughter] that they were executed and they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah not a big dealing with that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath underneath there for board so to speak\nAnd part of it that's left connected to the tragedy with more just around you know a city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and into an Eighteen\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] it really is so they\nCelebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they thought it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first um but really lead over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year during a visit sound Halloween\nUm don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year do you want to visit found that Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowds there's a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras makes you\nIt is it really is um you're talking again a hundred thousand people packed to the small down time of the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know\nFive or six blocks and you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes of freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars washed the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras was a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans\nNo Marta girl you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras [noise]\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same ... did you get in Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol than consumed during this celebration\nDefinitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know cuts how many of them right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween [noise] booze is a part of it but this is within the party\nOkay Joe ... ... you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean Salem known for being hunted either ... or there were a lot of haunted houses were were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial [noise]\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting idea of innocent victims you have monsters 'cause of the film which trial didn't just involved which is in the story involves\nDemons and apps and shaped sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster\nMass see all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history we're up three hundred and Thirty years of history so that is just you know a lot of people over the centuries\nSo yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening in Salem um ghost tours there's spooky places there's the other side of the executions you everything you need to build the kind of spooky mythology around the city\nNow you've been there most of these I should say you've been there right you go there to oh yeah all the time out there to make a deal\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seem to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but this that's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders things are all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest that that is more in the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest is more than the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me yeah\nWhat's the what's the best what's the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you captured while you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the one of the really creepy ones is one of the Boston train the victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual store co vent that then I can reverberate and have kind of all around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape from the jails there\nSo all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know ... kind of events happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch\nTrials it's all that kind of some kind of feed into that kinda cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there somebody to to to mock these people that were created\nSalem yeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm curious do wizard attempt to for him to do like ... or

I I just want to make it clear that real life murder is not a parlor game\nUh whenever we speak of murder it's important to remember that the lives lost whether it's one desk whether it's Jack the ripper the Boston Straggler\nThe witches of Salem or the most elusive serial killer in American history about which will be talking to night the lives lost represent children who will never see adulthood adults that will never see their children grow\nYoung men and women who had their human potential to offer the world taken away truly innocent people who died at the hands of evil\nIn the words of Clint Eastwood in one of my favorite movies uh unforgiving it's a hell of a thing kill the demand take away all that he's got an old that he's ever going to have [noise]\nSo even as the author of a true crime book myself in a book about how true crime stories are cold and why\nI treat the subject of murder personally the woman that was at the center of my true crime book a black night for the bluegrass belt was the first cousin to my grandmother and a beloved character in my mother's southern family history I wrote that book to set the story straight and defend her on her\nBecause I had started to read the book and then I was told but if the red Sox make the series he can't beyond with us\nSo I had read about the first three chapters and then when I heard the Bo Sox made it into the series I I packed the book in my boxes\nThat are heading to Kansas 'cause I'm moving decay state understand you live in Lawrence, Kansas a lot of the\nHarder to operate on\nSo I'm moving to Manhattan meant to be ... will be like almost neighbors and yet\nI wound up in Manhattan I Know very well and I\nGo oh totally cool so so I packed the book and then I got the call like four days later on always good to go like uh the book isn't the head of data overnight me a book that I had it in my hand but unfortunately loves them and I lost a few days reading time so I haven't finished yet and I love nothing more than\nDoing an interview on a book I finished reading especially because I can tell already you're building up to a climax than I Do not want to miss\nWith this true story of the the uh the America's most elusive serial killer demand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your your co author is your wife Rachel McCarthy James\nAbout quarter to my daughter read daughter or my daughter she's a she worked with me on a book [noise]\nOkay it doesn't specify that I did make an assumption I'm Sorry I should have a figure that out and then ... and say that worked\nOut well it probably did similar but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say I'm a great book obviously deserves all the accolades that ... that you are getting for it and the fact that you very likely crack this case\nA ... is very much to your credit so I I Want to start if I can with the uh by the way to congratulations on the ... of the red Sox win tonight and and what a game last night good thing you weren't book for last\nNight huh [laughter] yeah I Would add to capitalize on a little bit of torture [laughter] to keep all the way I have to be going well over here [noise]\n[noise] but you and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last uh last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\n[noise] well I wouldn't say so I wrote about the box next wrangler along with hundreds of other crimes are going to book I wrote maybe\nOh I wouldn't say so they ah I wrote about the bucks on Straggler along with hundreds of other crime cases in a book I wrote maybe six or seven years ago called popular crime or a ... I did um\n[noise] uh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took him some boxing Straggler case and publish some theories about it which might be right or wrong who knows [laughter]\nWell I Love that I think I may revisited that 'cause I've always been very interested in that as well but the mention the train is a story it is it just speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and ruled the queen of true crime and I asked her\nOnce I said is is there any story too old to be told\nA news when it comes to you know retailing a story about a murder and she said absolutely not\nShe said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said which which best is it's actually\nYou is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that has either been\nIncorrectly adjudicated which we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it but also is true for all the time that that will be of the Wii somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed\nJust isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody is connecting them\nYet but in in one at least in one case a ... a a a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up being killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now with these totally innocent\n[noise] they are right there there are two while they're there for people who were extremely executed for crimes that may have been convicted by the man trying to them I Would go so far as to say I'm fairly certain the crime was committed by the man from the train but a local person was executed nonetheless\nThe or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure the uh uh but there there were also nine people nine black people who were murdered by a Lynch mob who are when I was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by men from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight the last year we are pretty sure that ... ... ... although there was a ... there's an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say that it's ...\nSo I looked in the I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... or ... Illinois I saw the town where I'm home alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the home alone house [noise]\nUm and ... the mayor in around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town\nOf was murdered along with his wife in their home\nIn a crime that was never solved then they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah\nAnd it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of into the sort of thing where I get it and uh and ... the the belief was always that it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them [noise]\nUm but ... and when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of demand from the train\n[noise] they ... it is possible we haven't we assumed that we did not find\nIn the in the church of demand from the train\nThe it it is possible we have we assumed that we did not find every crime that he committed we just we found those uh which there were enough signature\nA care sick segment or a characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that they're both with him but they they may well committed and probably did commit other crimes\nThat are we just did not have enough information about it but that's that's a new and actually I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear my pen scratching because I'm writing down\n[laughter] I wouldn't have to worry about a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually find on something this afternoon on it I couldn't\nUm and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody that it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a poke anyway\nSo how many people do we think were murdered along America's railroad tracks by single perpetrator\nDemand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason or ... you know during this period\n[laughter] well what Rachel I did was we\nPut the murders and buckets right there's a hundred percent bucket that his crimes were certain with him a Seventy percent bucket or forty percent bucket ten percent bucket right and I'm way total up the numbers of murders and each bucket and multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that uh\nIt was our our criminal and the murderer the total we came up with as a hundred and one that actually includes the two people who were murdered who were executed by the state\nA lot for crimes they committed and the the or somewhere between four and nine people who were who were murdered by a Lynch mob for crimes that he either did commit or may have committed\nSome germs are the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders or when she would be responsible for putting the executions as murders because they were innocent I'm usually say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims guy\nOkay that's right All right so ... gets through a typical crime as you as you see the pattern developing in the late\nNineteen century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\nWell this is a long this is this could be a long answer I'm not along with the person who could be a long answer because there are a lot of things the tie them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight\nA family is murder most off on a family including a young girl is murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small town at a town too small to have a police department\nThey live near the intersection of two railroad tracks\nThe I'm a very often bodies are moved their killed with an axe they act is found in the in the yard of the victims are in the yard of a neighbor and the acts as a van than at the scene of the crime\nHandle is washed her fingerprints the house is locked up tight to all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with black it so that you can't see it all the doors are all law\nAnd then the door [noise] uh the Albany moves bodies post mortem so the police when they broke and would find the\nA huge blood stain in one room and then a bloody trail and the bodies in another room the um [noise]\nExplanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I I had to cut you off because we had the heartbreaking ... really it was\nGood here that are up there because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to find\nMy services like that's like a little bit for the murder what's that I sort of like thirty four of them aren't there or something or\nSomething like that they um they uh the crime you normally heard on Sunday nights they use the Kurt on the weekends up until Nineteen pan the crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was logging or one of the primary industries was logging\nThe or doors or doors and windows ... shot I think I mentioned the the um\n[noise] there's oh there are clear here graphic pattern and the murders if one occurs just south of Portland them extra curves just north of Portland or so that that would be a link between them the uh\nUh one thing that is odd is that he would he would take a laugh from inside the house turn the ... way way down low so they just gave out a little bit of light take the chairman a awful lap and set it on the floor usually under a table a and then carrying\nA little bit of light take the chairman a awful laugh and set it on the floor usually under a table\nA and then carry the lamp around with him as he committed murders and the other thing is that he would put total blankets over the head of a free person or a half a second before you had with an axe are you there are a lot and they probably did that to\nKeep the blood from flying back and heading heading ham as he was\nOrdering someone there are quite a detailed pattern of behavior\n[noise] uh yeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along logging lines that actually would be consistent with where this murder happened it's not that the\nTown that I grew up in his logging town but he was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started a new and that was plenty of logging was going on in in Wisconsin there was a it was insane for that matter Michigan just around the other side\nOf Chicago so very likely could have could have followed them pollen or another\nThing I forgot to mention there are all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he very may have ... as far as crime which was and just an outburst of anger and not a\nI'm not a planned event probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through cold weather and after that he'd never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\nUm we're talking about the Americans most elusive serial killer and Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for that to be around it\nYeah it it probably might be but I I had this discussion with my with my\nPublisher which I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder in American history or the first or something [noise] murder is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... that it in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is a killing on it secret there because it has done in in secret the facts about it are never\nFully known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed and um you get a lot of different people who claimed to be\nThe worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that disgusting titled than the this person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just can't document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody\nYeah it is it fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely nobody would ever know about it and they could they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without hope much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims rights or John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long so\nBut the demand from the train is is he is he's called ... and we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you'd be discovered about this in terms of solving the crime a little bit later on almost don't want to 'cause I don't want to ruin them so close to ... you know finishing I was reading all afternoon your easily but then there's a couple of good football game [laughter] I got distracted at dinner\nSo the ... but this guy he nobody it it it it would be president isn't for us to just assume that there was some national awareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks\nIt was some national awareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a whole new train tracks now because there is a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out about killers alone trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight nine ten eleven nothing at all the ... and that this has to do with the organization of the wire services at that time in Eighteen Ninety eight the wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little\nInformation of this type had little ability to spread from town to town\nBy Nineteen twelve the national wire services were were organized and a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years\nIn October of Nineteen eleven and all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening so when he went to his most famous crime ... Iowa in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is him and this is the latest crime in this\nTerrible series that's been going on but for the first\nMore than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even when logically they should have that even though you you look at the crimes and there's a case in Virginia in West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart\nThe a ... and and towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies\nAnd you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year\nSo you would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man Howard little who was later executed for and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate events\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speak to\nThe lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also\nIt speaks to the engine seat of\nThe jurisdiction of sharing a police departments in sheriff's departments and there was new national or investigative body like the FBI yet so there was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true and that introduces is also into one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime for a long time ... I'm [laughter]\nI thought I was fairly knowledgeable about it I was astonished to to realize how backward and ineffective our judicial system was just a hundred years ago it's beyond belief how\nPrimitive the investigative\nProcess war at the time of these crimes and what the man from the train did was to\nExploit the peculiar weaknesses of the of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture the uh he knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered there was no no way really to\nTo connect it to him and he knew that if he committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it but if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they did\nMade it a crime in a small town that had no police force first of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\n[noise] and and forensic medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean the the ... and ... this was a ... and then ... I'll even throw in another ... ... even in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn um is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science [noise]\nUm yeah and I I wrote about this a little bit in in the I'm In a true crime book I had written about this murder that happened in my family in that they the ... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nLike telling them this is ... it's it's not science look at all these crazy things they're talking about we know none of these things are true

communities lived a hundred years ago [noise]\nThat it's important in a crime story and that's what crime stories are they're these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf of a or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know I think that brings us You're you're thinking bleach in ...\nIowa and new crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a killer on the real way tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nOn on the night of a gym nine Nineteen twelve\nOh the lights were out in Alaska\nDue to a um a dispute between the ... city council and the power company so they had city lights in the street lights but they were out and ... and the town was in complete darkness this Sunday night there was a church service\nOr a Sunday night church service organized by one of the victims but I've ... the woman who was the head of the house\nAfter the ...\nAfter the ... I didn't\nInto this in the book but I think it's true I don't believe that the voters can murders would ... would ever have happened when they did had the light spin on and the reason that was true is that he had committed another atrocity just six days earlier about a hundred miles away\nAnd he normally would not have\nA had another outraged that quickly but because the lights the city was plunged into darkness it was a perfect opportunity for him and he couldn't pass it up anyway ... um\nUh the two little girls named Ida Lena still under went home with a more family the family of Henry More they walked home after the church service and and uh the little girls spent the night with the their friend the little girl was a member of the family\nOn the morning of June can no one is starting around in the house the um and the last uh\nHis brother finally comes in breaks into the house finds a couple of bodies and runs out of the house scraping they bring the town marshal and he his name was as a tank Horton Mr Horton courageously it goes through the house you have to us\nIt's the same as as um Hank Horton Mr Horton courageously goes through the house you have to understand he has no reason to believe anything other than that uh a craze murderer is hiding somewhere in this house here as a dark house\nOr is holding matches in front of him or with no gun had to know form of protection holding matches in front of a in front of his of themself going from room to room finding bodies\nVery ate their bodies in the house and in my log house in a small quiet Midwestern town\nThe um [noise] uh and all of them hit my head with an axe the access found as it usually is next to the body of a little girl the man from the train was a it was a pervert than he was interested\nIn little little girls and the the little girl was usually found in a in an added to suggesting that she had been\nA she had been outraged after that they um [noise] uh\nIn any case the crime was not there was a a great uproar as you can imagine what the crime was not solved\nA two years later a con man named Jay and walk her son came to Alaska and realized that he could sustain a phony investigation of the crime\nBy keeping people angry he can keep donations coming in by keeping people angry or ... and he did that by using a a very prominent local set of them Frank Jones of finance through the crimes\nThere isn't any chance in the world the Frank Jones was guilty or that he had in any any connection to it but this campaign to prosecute Frank Jones divided pulled us or\nIn a horrible and unprecedented way the city fought over whether or not Jones did or didn't do it for several years\nUh and became a K better badly divided community we have families on one side of the line wouldn't play with\nFamilies on the other side of the line they wouldn't go that they wouldn't shop at their stores they wouldn't uh wouldn't have anything to do with them\nThat this battle lasted in Alaska for even though a Walker soon was eventually run out of town in Nineteen Seventeen the uh um the battle went on for a long time and the hard feelings emanating from it\nPersisted in the city I Would I Would say it's for two extent that they are supposed to the present day\n[noise] you know you mentioned the piece about the the person whipping up sentiment in making a false accusation to profit from it and even that creates a pattern\nFor all too often how\nUm crime stories unsolved stories are treated\nYet you know it's the same time it speaks to the fact that there weren't cold case police officers working the crime still the crimes have been in that time might have been solved by\nAfter that period of time by somebody writing a letter consenting or simply knowing somebody\nBut it wasn't meant to almost literally like fall in their lap would you get into MMS back to the the power of storytelling\nAnd how he just by keeping my telling a story to beginning middle and end of these and then it doesn't matter how old the story is is that it will get people to listen again into reconsider again and most likely to connect again did that since ...\nOh the story is is that it it will get people to listen again into reconsider again and most likely to connect again to that sense of outrage\nAbout what had happened and so you know a static police report won't necessarily you know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah yeah that's right\nAnd and and they do that but also keeps kind of the idea of the murder alive it it makes it it gives you a sensation again it is it that is you know the corn sensationalism\nBut it does it make it shouldn't make you feel it again the fact that this crime in happened had they had they built it you know any kind of memorial to the family had there been\nAny had there been what had the town done to try to come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this con men coming to town or afterwards\nThe um [noise] uh ... well there was I don't know that there was that type of sound about I don't know that anyone build a memorial to them\n[noise] I I'm for many years the Alaska\nAuthority that I Would say that it's still true today that pay the the chamber of commerce tribes pipes invalid co worst of all let's go was known for something else right right the ah ... there is a house for the crime occurred\nIs still standing of his operated as a kind of of more tourism or it's the it's a shows up on paranormal ... TV shows\nAnd people pay to take tours of the house\nThe um [noise] a lot if you drive around ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors houses but that but ah where the ... ... knowing for is not mentioned anywhere\nThe um uh that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial I\nAm a I don't know that you raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper memorial to the victims victims were mostly poor people most people without\nA without one and the more family was very well why they are and the community\nUh thought well all of them and the rigorous efforts to solve the crime wore a kind of memorial to them uh but I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers ... where there is an effort to try to so it doesn't enough to be like a statue\nBut it's interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics peace then explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of done is not an you know\nThe um the one of his rather than maps and trains crimes with the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder two families in what night an adjoining how the uh uh but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it and you're still they they could show yeah oh that's that house right there um but it still has not forgotten\nOr many places\nMany places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally an absolutely forgotten but in some of the ... still quite well remember [noise]\nSo I wanted you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because [noise]\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nUh you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different pockets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nHow many unsolved murders were going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of her family and what about is is that it was then and it is now but uh uh there were many many unsolved murders and that era\nYou know I mean there's even as you mentioned they just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't the investigation wouldn't less for long because there wasn't a lot of funding\nBut Joe is let's let's let's go down this path of of the process that you used to try to actually\nNarrowed down to a name to a person I've I've seen this done a couple of times right there's been\nTo try to actually narrowed down to a name to a person\nI've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper for example is an including going to shift registries and signing whether or not there was a particular sailor\nThat coincided with the murders and white chapel and or other parts of the world\nThat shared similar characteristics as the the crimes in in England but it happened in Central America or happened in in ...\nAnd so they were able to trying to find you know well this sailor went from this poor to that port in each one of these ports there was a murder so it it it took to it but if you have to have to START I mean it's quite a needle in a haystack but it's\nIt's at least maybe um\nYou know to to look at it broadly you're you're you don't even know yet what you don't know when you start doing a search like this so you you don't\nYou know is it even possible that a name could even be found given the scarcity and information about you know people are public registries ... during that period\nYou mentioned the Jack the ripper case I Am I read I have read\nProbably twenty bucks saying jak river was this guy or jak forever was that guy or exactly they are and I and my other book popular crime I made fun of the people who wrote those books um the uh uh because I don't\nI don't have much confidence that you can actually do that and to be Frank almost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are selling the um I never really expected that we would find it convincing argument\nAbout who this who was doing this so I mean we were looking gas and Rachel says she did expect to find them but I didn't they um a lot when we walk the crimes backward\nA there is a crime in Massachusetts and Eighteen Ninety eight\nThat Rachel says the moment she saw it she knew it was him\nThe um uh and that was because I had told her that this guy would make mistakes and in his first crime he did make\nNumerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was the um [noise] uh but the number of details that match up from the first crime to let's say Alaska is is just it's beyond anything that you would that you would a\nSuspect was a could be coincidence and I'll I'll mentioned just a few things\nYeah please do you want me to give you the name or not it doesn't\nMatter the newly will they'll let you go through the coincidence or go through the the similarities first\nWell ... the first crimes that were\nSort of publicly link where crimes in the Portland area and two crimes in the Portland area where we're committed rather obviously by the same man and the the tech the same detectives happen to be investigating him and thought this was the same guy that crime a month ago down\nSouth part of the um uh\nThat criminal had size six feet the um there's another crime in Maine and Nineteen oh two in which the criminals there were there were a pair of boots cramps that were central to the trial\nUm again size six feet is a very uh the the so we we know that this is a small man well it is recorded about\nHave size six feet not speculation he did\nWe know that we ... it was believed that he was small because I'm the or a ... and in other places when he swung the acts the ceiling wasn't very low the ceiling is only about seven feet high\nIn the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe over his head he just barely grazed the ceiling\nIf a person of normal size a person of\nA if a person a large man could not swing an axe over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling\nBecause of that it was believed that he had to be small he was five foot for\nThe uh uh it was suspected if you look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ax you can see clearly whether it's the guy is basically left handed or basically right hand and that's a pretty easy thing to see\nIt was believed that the murder and let's go was left handed\nThe man who committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed\nWe had said that he had to be a well the first stories about him say that he was an experience trap that he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settle down into an area [noise]\nWe had said that he must work as a longer because\nAll of the crimes for about ten years occur and logging areas the first story about him her stories about you know specifically say that he was inexperienced blogger the uh uh the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the\nA ... girl a that was there and the first crime in the first cry he always kill the man of the house first and the a and ended with the murder of a young girl that's what he did in first crime\nThe he always used the blunt side of the X. I never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never killed anyone with a sharp ... but it was always his intention to use the blunt side of the acts\nIn the spurs crime blunt side of the acts and as he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that the uh so the crime just matches up on too many points\nFor you to think that this isn't him\n[noise] silly you started to look for signs for left handed and filed Nick ... I didn't even longer ax murderer or ... ... ... how did you begin to narrowly name out of that\nThe when he committed first crime he it was obviously ... who when he first crime is obvious who had committed this because he was living with the family which that's a common thing that cereal murders first crime he often kills people to whom he ... his directly connected and\nCan be tied so we killed the first family an Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who had done it because he fled the scene and I was so they were looking for is just that all of these other facts about the first about the criminal happened to line up with what we were looking for\nAnd the name that you believe is a new demand on the train\nThe ... the name that he was using their was Paul Miller the weather that we use ... he wouldn't he was a German immigrant the or whether that was his actual name or not um\nThe weather that we actually went to Germany immigrant or the or whether that was his actual name or not um there's speculation he could have been using a false name even that however there's no real reason to believe he was\nWe found that I shouldn't say we found a friend of mine doing research on his own after the book was published found a the the ships record in which you had entered the country about an Eighteen Ninety the I'm a probably a man named Paul Miller had entered the country\nI'm On a ... he was he walked with a sailors gate he you know if\nIt was all like it in there and walk side to side with the uh uh and the uh\nUh uh they they were so if he had been in the German army a German native so ah they found the ship within which became what came into the country", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "28"}
