I'll give you one quick example I was in Newfoundland about ten years ago\nAnd I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking ice birds and part of the reason that I went there was because ah there's been a series of lobsters are the that have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are in the wash up there but uh so I wanted to go investigate some of that and there's also Spring Hill jak citing up there but I thought it was up there I came across um up a place called lake crescent\nHum and it's this little you know new Finland is it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local eight months of there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot a

I'm with you [laughter] that's great stuff okay so\nI'm I'm before I get along you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween so I I\nI'm I'm before I get along you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween science at Google that and then found your article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing you're not there of course\nThat you do a lot of writing for I lied science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too\nBut I saw this great article for Neal and I was like oh my gosh here's the game you know and so it looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody who was writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so\nSo tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just now learning the origins of Willis wean the Gallup the origins of Halloween\nSee there's no ... I I I Want a two hundred years from now when people are researching the orders is will if when they're going to come up\nWith this conversation I'll love it might make grandkids will be be all over it they'll be like that\nKnow I Want one of the things that I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists\nGuests all the the the conservative sometimes you get all touchy about that because they think it's really the the the ... which is not but it's it's it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into and that's why I really love about Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes in candy as a fascinating history\nI'm so basically Halloween a ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of folklore work these events and holidays there is not just one street line back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime but basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first\nA Celtic or deal with festival called a sigh when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much information about just because it was that it was so long ago and there is no the the ... ... records are pretty sparse fragmentary but it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the solstice\nUm and it's a time when I'm you know the the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying um so it had this connection to uh to darkness but it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we ... we think we think of\nThe darkness as being you know something faster but to them there was a very it was not even\nAn analyst point of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons\nUm and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so it wasn't scary it was like yes this is the time to you know to a store grains and to give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this and that [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the uh the the the separation between the world's with especially thin porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry boat or what have you there in their own world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day\nThe the the er the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise] um and so this is why uh the the began talking about how\nSpirits would a would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the uh\nOn this day and people were much more likely to be able to uh the spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world are porous\nUm you know the barrier between them but also I'm In a leader incarnations of Halloween it was also that uh time it's porous and so what you find is that a pool would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it'll be a time when\nI Would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's ... there's other world but it's also the the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so for example in the Eighteen hundreds or they were different customs that would that were involved Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them\nBut there were ideas for example that the that uh for example woman born a Halloween would be able\nTo tell the future um and there would be the prophecy and oftentimes the prophecy\nA was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was often times there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would be would a light a candle in front of a mirror\nA and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection [noise] um and so all these sorts of another one example was a bombing for Apple you know if you're not new apple bobbing and there was there was a particular Halloween tradition\nThat if you cut a pie if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell out the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and past and present coming together\nOn my way man I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night actually I Do I Do it at midnight ride\nOn willfully night that's right will swing in well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to you\nKnow 'cause I I get there are people that\nSay Halloween oh saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that ... that they're cool with it you know um but um\nYou know I always see it as fun I see it as a\nI I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool jak lantern that you get to make I think this fall whether I think in orange and black collars yeah I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins\nAnd very fun fun things that's how I see it\nAnd it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they kicked the fun out of it and the traditions out of that and and uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're going to have to take a break here but what we have in a band rapper with us\nHe is an investigator and and into all the things that were into a as coast the folks here\nThat want to learn everything um but he also you know does a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also goes hunting too so stay with this kind of well let's hear it's Willis wean hanging thee you don't know what you might here tonight\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get state panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff I don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know it it they dress up like you know just a regular kind of\nNormal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nOh you don't see any creativity to go to targeting put on you know a Batman mass can we make make I'm I'm Out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love at all [noise]\nAbsolutely no I mean that that's one of the field that that's really what the course these days um although your Halloween\nAbsolutely you know I mean that's that's one of the you know that that's really what's associate of course these days um although you know Halloween was never really mainly a children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids it wasn't kid centered as it is today a it was more of a community thing are getting sort of you if you go back to\nGo back to solve when and the the the early a Celtic versions of it which were very and the mystic and and again sort of dealing with the the changing of the season and darkness and snow and all that [noise] um but you know so you you have that and then that sort of what happened was that\nUm that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know obviously the next day\nWhich was to honor that the church a church members bleed to gone to heaven and then also got wrapped up to a whole day which is November second which bills are wrong for the soul in purgatory\nAnd so there was this there was it was interesting transition from\nAn early purely pagan um um you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that and then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with all things ...\nAnd and again they were the ringing a bell and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away a demons and scary things could loud noise for such a scare away the evil [noise] um and that sort of transformed a little later on into the modern costumes because what what happened is\nI'm a you know because we were talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that uh it believe that a drink so in the ... leaders would where animals skins I'm there and sometimes the animal heads like antlers whatnot during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise] um but then later on during the late Eighteen ... Seventeen hundreds in\nEngland who was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween preparing for the dead and this again the ties back into all sold day because the idea was that\nUm that on that day ah the soldier weren't purgatory you know they were they were basically trapped between heaven and hell they need to be prayer prayed for\nA and so the the wealthier members of the communities would basically\nA higher out there were ... sub contract the prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called ... which type of bread\nAnd in return for paying for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs and rituals are going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn it of course that would lead or translate into uh the the the the the uh the public and\nUm but the\nCandle at land from the candle in it and the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for\nThe idea was that they would these numbers go as far as to how say you know yes will pray for if you have a member of your family who's a who's passed on I'm new to this you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to think of this light as the the soles but don't you wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the tournament ... sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\nFor you [laughter] that's when the pumpkins came in\nUm the turn of sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me read when that's when the pumpkins came in because the pumpkins associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and associate with the harvest and that's that sort of how the the trick or treating aspect came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn now ... von ... says Munch on little olive oil salt pepper I'm so worried candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in that like right after the ... like you were talking about\nYeah well I mean if it ... it was interesting 'cause because again the it's sort of the things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what would happen is that if you think about it you know again there was the ... the mom and going on this and that\nAnd then uh the the during this time\nOr the the genders had pretty strict social roles and so um and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would would would pining away and with fully think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four of the time who knows\n'cause that's what they did a\nBut you know ... that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like during this time this is when people would go from house to house in the ... the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era\nSo that was typically sort of a young man you know ... a mixture of this young man's project and the the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the prophecy in those sorts of things so so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as the as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory that's that's a little a little a little outlandish for for the little little too much work for these days\nSo that's when this sort of came down to treats and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid or not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a member of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar\nOr are you sometimes you get an apple you're like really\nReally a capital okay and I like\nIt was it wasn't even like it was like some really tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that and like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go I'm a long time ago it was great you remember the good houses together because they were there were years where you get full science candy bars in by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that all\nHaunted house record where you heard the green and then which is right and it was very dark so if you if you risk if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get full size bars you know marathon bar and you get in a handful\nYou're the only perimeter marathon learn that I Love the marathon bars but they were all and chocolate and they they were like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're great harm those I I haven't heard anybody mentioned those in decades\nOh now that's a horrible ... you got a full on you gotta so long as you can't replace a wish I'd been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those any more of those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and we had to kind of far\nAnd the way and you had your son that's when they had those nasty nasty you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time [laughter]\nBut we were there was like one house at all you had homemade popcorn balls they were delicious it was the only time we ever had on they were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people\nAnd then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house that there were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like ... you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nI I should mention that because of all three answers the the the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the classic a poison ... and the reason the and the fact is that that I mean that's that's there's there's\nAlmost no truth to that uh it's it's widely talked about a friend of mine Joel Best wrote a book about that um and and you know so when you actually look at\nAt the cases where somebody who's actually painted these sorts of things [noise] um if it happens very rarely there there was

I found it interesting that you had said to me\nUh that uh people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to a spirit were years back people would go why why would you want to talk to a stranger you know maybe call upon your family member or somebody you know that's true why do you now\nKnow that was that was that was one of the things that I uh when I was researching my book are investigating goes to me though is is basically a survey of of the scientific attempts to to contact\nThe dead I'm ranging from basically pre history a but primarily through the the the Victorian era upper upper today's you know go hunters and all that\nAnd what you find that the the idea that I mean you know people have been talking if it did for millennia I mean that's you know there's references in which of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know your lead to Macbeth banquet though there's there there there there's no shortage of go in and literature and history\nBut you know typically\nGo or or if it's typically if people if you wanted to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you be talking to me your your your great grandfather or your your best friend that that died recently and the the idea that\nSomebody would go into like a haunted house whether the Myrtle plantation or a house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location and\nSome random spirit that happens to be\nAnd what have you go to a hundred location and talk to\nSome random spirit that just happens to be there and say Hi can you give us inside and you don't know me but\nTell me about yourself that that's that's a that's a relatively new phenomena hum and it's it's fast and you know you go back and look at the the the ... that were held in in the Victorian era\nOf upper class uh places and they would have you know a lady they they've Crumpet the tea and the and you know they try to communicate with the ghosts and then you would have the the spiritual era [noise] um and you had people like Harry Houdini trying to research the Marjorie ... and all these\nSpiritual is the you know came to the states and Medicaid Maggie Fox\nAnd and and they're you know their\nTheir stuff and so and then you're Harry uprising has researching all that and then you sort of fast forward to uh the the the ... the idea and you know the electronic voice phenomena and the idea that you can record you communicate with goes\nThrough white noise improve basically a broken radio that switches channels and then you sort of fast\nForward to whom the more modern\nDay ghost wonders with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes inventors and all that and it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of these sorts of things and what sort of techniques have been tried and and you know what works and what doesn't and and how do we know\nYeah I think it's a you know it's already kind of creepy enough or spooky enough or even scary enough when uh you do get some sort of interaction when you are going to try to talk to spirit teaches\nUm it's it's scary when you get somebody talking to you but\nPeople take that step further and they hope in pinch\nAnd you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction and you don't you don't know if that's going to be somebody nice or not and are these things go home with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a hunted how high is the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer going sledding or looking up in the sky lights I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um and you talked about ... and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long and changes like you know folks quick provoking clip provoking you don't know who or what you're talking to\nAnd that's what they were there what's that you're not doing yourself and your favorite thereby ... whatever maybe they're\nRight you don't know what it is if it's evil or not evil or what it is at All right I mean um\nYou you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that scientifically\n... there's a couple of things you know one of the first thing you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes investigations myself\nUm and as I said I I come to a more science based uh someone say skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I just knew everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe\nAnywhere you sound as that goes and so\nFor the first thing that I Do when I go into a case is try to establish a water the false viable claims that is what exactly is being claimed you know if someone saying that there's there's a mysterious sound\nOr a laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is is is going on there and the question is can we tested repeatable right it it\nIs it is the sound that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the ghost hunting you\nThe full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the ghost hunting you see on TV uh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality\nTV and ... the reality\nAnd you know in in scare quotes um and I and I've I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a soft I've done you know on both sides of the camera on this\nAnd you know and my my point of view is always you know I I don't make fun of goes on her because I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do that do it right\nYou know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem that I often see\nIs that go centers on TV you and not actually just across the board is is I you know this applies even you know amateur groups across the country is they typically engage in what's called the anomaly hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know you EMS or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops whatever it is and they're the they're they're sampling the environment and looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around a little ... and the sort of things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we're all look at this at at three oh eight PM am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claims they're the ... the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are you need to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the infrared cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that that in almost all cases they don't\nThey don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample a location\nSo for example you'll see a ghost hundred going to location maybe there's team of them and they'll you know they'll take readings for three hours or six hours or wherever else and then they'll go home and analyze them the problem is that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's\nWhat's what's um paranormal or abnormal you need to know what's normal\nAnd whatever readings you get\nDoes your dog it's scratched tinker shed like crazy

I go into each case um you know trying to figure it out and to help them as best I can\nAnswer one of the things that I encourage them to do and I I Can't always do this myself because you know I I if if someone sends me if a photograph I Can't just drop what I'm doing fly off to you know to Denver\nTo [laughter] to research it goes photos much wine [laughter]\nBecause I haven't trademark Willis wing and gotten rid of that [laughter]\nSplit it with me that's all I ask you know as\nA no but it's um [noise] so so there's a couple of things one of them is that is I went one possible I Try to go to the the location where it was filmed and try and figure it out so you mentioned earlier um one case that I'm known for which the Santa Fe courthouse coast case\nThat happened about I don't know maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital or which is about an hour north of here\nAnd it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was a really strange glowing or the thing that the cross this this railings camera [noise] um\nAnd it was you know it was it was seen by deputy uh so you know that they're probably [laughter]\nThat would that make that gave them credibility right [laughter] it's a deputy on the court no cameras though the likelihood of this\nBeing a hoax was was dropped off considerably at that point [noise] um but what I ended up doing was ... I went to him I said the story a it was made national news and people are you all this weird thing of law\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I I went up there and investigate it and I I went and I went to the courthouse and looked at the camera and I talked to the deputies interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas of what it might be\nUm and I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and you try to figure out what her alternative explanations right so I\nUsually I make a list of three four or five different things you know could be could be an insect going to be a hoax could be a ghost is or is there some I mean so you just basically any anything that he is even remotely possible I tried to list those\nAnd I tried to rank them in terms of what's most likely which which things can I find typically test which things can actually you know investigating falsify\n'em and you just basically you'd go down the list and and that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the important uh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's the the photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know\nAnd you know who knows where the hell that came from [noise] but but when possible it's good to try and replicate it so ... for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know a ... are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was a sort of\nImage does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well again it's it would be I could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back and different state but I said well you know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and tried to replicate it you know take take ... take the photograph\nAt the same place ideally at the same time a day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be might be mistaken for an ... an image of a face or something\nI see so ... and I get that I get that and but you know I guess that\nThat thing whatever that might be in just they're like you said in it might be people might think\nWell I'll give you another example of what\nI was gonna say one of it is um you know if it's on the one question comes up as the other people see it right and so this is right there is often\nThe case of where you know there's there's an extra for example behind standing behind somebody a and actually I was sent me an example this a couple of months back and they said oh this was the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there's this sort of weird goes the image or just behind her to the left\nUm you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of ... you know it's hard to beat conclusive\nAbout it without more information but I noticed that no one else\nAround them noticed it I mean there there are other people who are you or nearby and no one is looking at this strange image to their left and so that suggests that that they probably didn't feed the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya I got you hey you know it's it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see what the eyes some things are picked up from a certain angle and but not another angle um they need and it's just\nYou know there's some things that are seen that it just is the way the shadow is in just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked up at\nThat time I mean it looks like there's no way it could be anything else but something creepy or you know worthy of\nA sane at this place was hunting for sure you talk about uh goes hunting equipment to man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work\nAnd and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking to measure that that we can't measure right now it's all a new science you know\nYeah I mean they you know one of the interesting aspects of ghost investigation is um is the uh you know a ... for example I was I was doing a TV show called the mystery quest a while back and I was there with them a ghost hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and\nAnd they they brought in all this all these are the ghost during the equipment and just you know there's cameras and ... there's always like you know probably Seventy thousand dollars with the gear\nAnd it was all set up when the cameras and lights and I are and all that sort of thing and and I talked to one of the guys who brought all his stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera I mean this was in like a gotcha moment we're just hanging out with were finished\nShooting or going back hotel is it I said why do you think why do you think it is that that we don't we still have good quality\nEven to this day and again this is you know six seven years ago said you know even the the evidence doesn't seem to getting a better it's all these blurry or business and that and he said well I think that I think the problem the basic problem is that ... that we don't have the technology to does that ghost and said\nThat change the world for everyone affected by multiple

traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all been looking at ghosts again all\nRight you know it's like they're like well give me a bit of the ... going to go to the beach and like that's really cool I knew there was a monster there so I'm Wondering over they're interviewing people taking photos and\nSo that that's that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa and elsewhere uh you know I I happen to be there anyway and so I turned into investigation one I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean it just\nIs what it is you just can't help but he is in your mind you that's what you do you you would if you weren't that beach hanging out there with them you would just be dying\nI can relax a little bit the despite you know despite\nWhat my friends will tell you I can relax I can show but you know I'll give you one quick example I was in Newfoundland or about ten years ago\nAnd I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking ice birds and part of the reason that I went there was because ah there's been a series of lobsters are the that have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are in the wash up there but uh so I wanted to go investigate some of that and the oval Spring Hill jak signing up there but I thought it was up there I came across um a a place called lake crescent\nUm and it's this little you know new Finland is it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local eight months of there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot a metal sculpture\nThing for this thing as you enter the town and the town of the population is like three or four or something [laughter]\nI rented a car I'm like I put on the brave I gotta I I Can't pass a lake monstercom on site and you know my friend rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping for the biggest world's biggest ball of yarn or something like that great I'm with you [laughter] that's great stuff okay so\nI'm I'm before I get along you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween science I Googled that ... pounds your article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing your and author of course\nThat you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too but I saw this great article for a meal and I was like\nAnd so it looked into your background so you were ... he worked as somebody who's writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so so tell me about the origins now learning ... we're just learning the Oregon Willis lean the Gallup the origins lean\nSee there's no ... I I I Want a two hundred years from now when people are researching the orders is will if they're going to come up\nWith this conversation I'll love it might make her grandkids will be be all over it they'll be like\nI work with one of the things that I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not\nBig on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists guests all the the the conservative sometimes we get all touchy about that 'cause they think it's really the the the ... which is not but it's it's it's ... basically something that everybody can sort of jump into\nAnd that's why I really love about Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy as a fascinating history\nI'm basically Halloween a ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of folklore work\nThese events and holidays there is not just one street line back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime but basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic or deal it festival called a sigh when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much information about just because it was that it was so long ago and there is no the the ... ... records are pretty sparse fragmentary but it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the solstice\nUm and it's a time when I'm you know the the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying so it had this connection to uh to darkness but it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we ... we think we think of\nThe darkness as being you know something faster but to them a ... there was a very it was much more of an\nAn analyst point of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons\nUm and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so it wasn't scary it was like yes this is the time to you know to a store or grains and to give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this month [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the uh the the the separation between the world's was especially thin porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry folk or what have you there in their own world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day\nThe the the er the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise] um and so this is why uh the the began talking about how\nSpirits would would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us\nAnd it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's were porous\nUm you know the barrier between them but also um in leader incarnations of Halloween it was also that uh time is porous\nAnd so what you find is that a pool would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when it would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's\nIt's really a time when I Would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's ... there's other world but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so for example in the Eighteen hundreds or they were different customs that would that were involved Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them but there were ideas for example that the that uh for example woman born a Halloween would be able\nTo tell the future [noise] um and it would be the profit and often times the prophecy\nA was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was often times there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would uh be with a white a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror and midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection\n[noise] um and so all these sorts of another one example is a body for Apple you know if you're not near the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular holiday tradition\nThat if you cut a pie if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and past and present coming together\nOn my way man I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night actually I Do it at midnight right\nIn our willfully night that's right will swing and [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know 'cause I I get there are people\nThat say Halloween a saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um\nYou know I always see it as fun I see it as a\nI I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think a fall whether I think of orange and black colors I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins\nAnd very fun fun things that's how I see it\nAnd it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it in the traditions out of it and and uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're going to have to take a break here but what we have as a banner Radford with us\nHe is an investigator and an end to all the things that were into a as coast the folks here that want to learn everything\nUm but he also you know does a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also goes hunting too so stay with his county well let's hear it's Willis we hang in there you don't know what you might hear tonight\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis wean talking with Ben Radford been so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get say panic and gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around the time of Halloween or that or the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nOh you don't see any creativity to go to target and put on you know a bad man can we make make I'm I'm Out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin is so cool I Love it love at all\nThat you know I mean that that's one of the the ... that certainly would of course you know days um although you know when I was never really mainly a children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on Capitol Hill about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kit kit centered and it is today a it was more of a community thing again through if you go back to\nGo back to win and the the theory a coping\nAnd again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness and snow and all that [noise] um but you know so you you had that and then that sort of what happened was that\nUm that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know obviously the next day\nWhich was to honor that the church a church members to gone to heaven and then also got wrapped up to a whole day which is November second in which bills are wrong for the soul in purgatory\nAnd so there was this there was it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan\nUm um you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that and then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with ...\nAnd and again they were the ringing a bell and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away a demons and scary things could loud noises we're such a scare away the evil [noise] um and that sort of transformed a little later on into the modern costumes because what what happened is\nI'm a you know because we were talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that uh it believe that a drink so in the ... leaders would where animals skins I'm there and sometimes the animal heads like antlers whatnot during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual is sick thing in terms of honoring\nThe land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen ... Seventy hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween for praying for the dead and this again the ties back into all sold day because the idea was that\nUm that on that day or the soul of the war in purgatory you know there were there were basically trapped between heaven and hell they needed to be prayer prayed for\nA and so the ... the wealthier members of the communities would basically\nA higher out there were ... they were subcontract prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called ... which type of bread\nAnd in return for paying for a for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs and rituals are going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn up of course that would lead or translate into uh the the the the uh the public and\nUm but the\nCandle at the land from the candle in it and the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for the idea was that they were these members go as far as to how say you know yes will pray for if you have a member of your family who's\nA who's passed on I'm with you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to think of this light as the the soles ... to ... wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the turn of some sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\n[laughter] [laughter] that's when the pumpkins came in because the pumpkins associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and their associate with the harvest and that's that sort of how the the trick or treating asked that came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn it no longer [laughter] ... along boil some pepper um candy I guess I guess an alternative candy at one point in that like right after they eat like you were talking about\nYeah well I mean if it was interesting because because again the sort of ...\nFor a long gender lines for a while because what would happen is um that if you think about it you know again that was the the mom and going on this and that\nAnd then uh the the during this time\nOf the the genders had pretty strict social and so um and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween by the time when when young girls would would ah would kind of way and with ... think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four of the time who knows\nWhat they did um but\nYou know that that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like during this time this is when people would go from house to house look into the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era\nSo that was typically sort of a young man you know ... a mysterious young man's project in the the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the prophecy in those sorts of things so [noise] so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as as the as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for a little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory [laughter] that's a little less a little a little outlandish for for a little too much work for these days\nSo that's when this sort of came down to treats or and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid a not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a memory out every now I get to get a silver dollar\nOr are you sometimes you get an apple you're like\nReally really only a capital okay and I like it was it wasn't even that like it was like some really tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that I'm like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go I'm a long time ago it was great you remember the good houses together since they were there were years where you would get fool science candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that'll haunted house record\nWhere you heard the green and then which is right and it was very dark so if you\nIf you risk if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get full size bars you know marathon bar and you get in a handful\nYou're the only perimeter marathoners I Love that I Love the marathon bars but they were all and chocolate and they've they're like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're just great harm does I I haven't heard anybody mentioned those in decades\nOh that's a horrible ... you got a full on you got a phone line is you can't replace a wish I'd been there I Can't believe\nThey don't make those any more of those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and and we had to go kind of far up the hill this way money all the other way and you had your suits and that's when they had those old nasty mass that you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time but we\nWould never say one house at all you had homemade popcorn balls they were delicious it was the only time we ever had on there were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people and then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house\nThat there were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like we don't want to go there you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nI should mention that because of all three answers the the the more modern scares a and\nClassic a poison ... and the reason the\nAnd the fact is that that I mean that's that's there's there's almost no truth to that uh it's it's widely talked about a friend of mine Joel Best wrote a book about that um and and you know so when you actually look at\nAt the cases where somebody who's actually tainted these sorts of things

I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction and you don't you don't know if that's going to be somebody nice or not and are these things go home with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a haunted house side of the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer going ... or looking at the sky lights I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um and you talked about ... and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long and James is like you know folks quick provoking quick provoking you don't know who or what you're talking to\nAnd that's what they were there which that\nYou're not doing yourself in your favor thereby ... whatever maybe they're\nRight you don't know what it is if it's evil or not evil or what it is it All right I mean\nUm you you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that scientifically\n[noise] well there's a couple of things you know one of the first thing you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes investigations myself\nUm and as I said I I come to a more science based a somewhat skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I just miss everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe\nAnywhere you sound as that goes and so for the first thing that I Do want to go into a case is try to establish a water the false viable claims that is what exactly is being claimed you know if someone saying that there's\nThere's a mysterious sound or a laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is is is going on there and the question is can we tested repeatable right is it\nIs it is the sound that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the ghost hunting you see on TV uh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality\nTV in court t._v. reality\nYou know in in scare quotes um\nIt's all of course you know reality t._v. and ... the reality\nAnd you know in in scare quotes um and I and I've I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a so I've I've done you know on both sides of the camera on this\nAnd you know and my my point of view is always you know I I don't make fun of ghost hundred 'cause I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do it than do it right\nYou know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem I often see\nIs that go centers on TV and and not actually just across the board is is are you in this applies even you know amateur groups across the country if they typically engage in what's called the anomaly hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know you EMS or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops whatever it is and they're ... they're they're sampling the environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around we'll try and provoke us and the sort of things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we're all look at it at three oh eight PM am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claims they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are you need to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the infrared cameras on we're going to walk around here and all these sort of things\nAnd and and that that's part part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that\nThat ... in almost all cases they don't they don't have a good grasp of of of a of the amount of data needed\nTo to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see a ghost hundred go into location maybe there's team of them\nAnd they'll they'll take readings for three hours or six hours or wherever else and then they'll go home and analyze them the problem is that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um\nParanormal or abnormal you need to know what's normal\nAnd you know whatever reading as you get\nNo I thought from Geico motorcycle he took Fifteen minutes to purchase the gas station ... [noise]\nEat the gas ... [noise] and regret the gas station ... as you presented numbers to the board\n[noise]\nTo add insult to injury you could've used those Fifteen ... minutes to switch your motorcycle insurance to go and go oh\nGuys go through the minutes good shape you fifty percent or more on motorcycle insurance\nGoes to a um a new tone Ninety five point five [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nIt's coast to coast am county Willis here\nWill is wean is what's going on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator of mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating dose and it's um\nIt's very interesting book it talks about ah well let's let's bring it back on your been we were talking about uh how you investigate and how you first go in to an area where somebody says there's these things happening and I want an here's a question\nThat I Want to know that I I really don't know and a lot of people I don't think they have any clue either but everybody tries to be cool you know um when you look at a picture of\nPhotographs and someone says this is his picture I took a you know some there's a lot of really great people out there that they really had things happening and they have great pictures of possibly something and I love that I mean we all want that but then there are some people out there that want to make things\nSo when you do see a picture how do you\nKnow what his photo shopped what is not photo shop what might just be a glitch ... what might be a maybe a light reflecting off or the difference between an orbit and a piece of\nDust how the analyzing of photos tell us about that\nYeah I Know that that's a good question I have to say that the um you know I've always looked at\nTwo or three hundred and photographs or over the years\nI'm I'm a similar to do a ... on the on the default recipient of\nOf cheaper carpet photos [laughter] usually means the dogs in Texas but I I have to explain that to them afterwards\nAnd I I have to say that I have rarely encountered hoaxes um I have on occasion\nBut I Would say probably Seventy to eighty percent of the the the ghost photos of them sent our our ... by sincere people who just photographed something weird and they yeah they are not lying there not a hoax who mentioned not trying to pull one over on me they're like hey can I flew him\nThey're just like hey this is weird you know can you can you help me figure this out [noise]\nUm and so you know I ... I go in each case um you know trying to figure it out and to help them as best I can answer one of the things that I encourage them to do and I I Can't always do this myself because you know I I if if someone sends me if a photograph I can just drop what I'm doing fly off to you know to Denver\nTo [laughter] go research it goes so much\nBecause I haven't trademark Willis lean and gotten rid of that [laughter]\nSplit it with me that's all I ask you know as\nA no but it's um [noise] so so there's a couple of things one of them is that is I went when possible I Try to go to the the location or was filmed and try and figure it out so you mentioned earlier um one case that I'm known for which the Santa Fe courthouse coast case\nHappened about I don't know maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital or which is about an hour north of here\nAnd it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was a really strange glowing orbit thing that the cross this this real and camera [noise]\nUm and it was you know it was it was seen by deputy uh so you know that they're\nProbably [laughter] that would that make that gave them credibility right it's a deputy on the court no cameras though the likelihood of this\nBeing a hoax was was dropped off considerably at that point [noise] um but what I ended up doing was ... I went to him I said the story a it was made national news and people are all this weird thing over\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I went up there and investigators night I went and I went to the courthouse and looked at the camera and I talk to the deputies interviewing people\nAnd I had some ideas of what it might be\nUm and I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and he tried to figure out what her alternative explanations right so I\nUsually I make a list of three four or five different things you know could be could be an insect could be a hoax could be a ghost is or is there some I mean so you just basically any anything that he is even remotely possible I tried to list those\nAnd I tried to rank them in terms of what most likely which which things can I find typically test things can actually you know investigating falsify\n'em and you just basically you'd go down the list and\nAnd that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the important and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's the photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell that came from [noise]\nBut but when possible it's good to try and replicate it so you know for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know are you are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was just sort of ...\nMirror and I said well again it's it would be I could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back and different state but I said\nYou know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and tried to replicate it you know take take ... take the photograph\nAt the same place ideally at the same time of day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be might be mistaken for an ... an image of a face or something\nI see so ... and I get that I get that and but you know I guess that\nThat thing whatever that might be in just they're like you said in it might be people might think\nWell I'll give you another example of what\nI was gonna say one of it is um you know if it's on the one question comes up as the other people see it right and so this is right there is often the case of where you know there's\nThere's an extra for example behind Sandy behind somebody a and actually I was sent me an example this a couple of months back and they said oh this is the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there was this sort of weird goes the image or just behind her to the left um you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of ... you know it's hard to be conclusive\nAbout it without more information but I noticed that no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who were were nearby\nAnd no one is looking at this strange image to the left and so that suggests that that they probably didn't feed the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya I got ya hey you know it's it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see what the eyes some things are picked up from a certain angle and but not another angle um\nThey just\nYou know there's some things that are seen that it just is the way the shadow is and just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked up\nBy the time I mean it just looks like there's no way it could be anything else but something creepy or you know we're the\nSame at this place was hunting for sure that you talk about uh goes hunting equipment to man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work\nAnd and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking to measure that that we can't measure right now it's all a new science you know\nWell yeah I mean you know one of the interesting aspects of goes investigation is um is the uh you know a ... for example I was I was doing a TV show called the mystery quest a while back and I was there with them a ghost hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and\nAnd they brought in all this all these are the ghost during the equipment and just you know there's cameras and ... there's always like you know probably Seventy thousand dollars with the gear\nAnd it was all set up in the cameras and lights and I are all that sort of thing and and I talk to one of the guys who brought all his stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera ... this was in like a gotcha moment we're just hanging out we were finished shooting or going back to tell us what I said why do you think\nWhy do you think it is that that we don't we still have good quality evidence of goes uh I mean even to this day and again this is you know six seven years ago so you know even\nThe the evidence doesn't seem to getting a better it's all these blurry Orban the night and he said well I think that I think the problem the basic problem is that ... that we don't have the technology to it as that goes\nCause donate Gary Sunnis foundation\nDot org they gave me if I get an after my surgery they didn't know it would be this\nOpioid

long slate summer's evening they were both raised about eleven one of them's passed away now they're the ones still lives who lives in the village\nAnd um [noise] they were played and they would have put on these burial mountains and they said if you know it was a time when you could sort of people that the doors unlocked there was not the crime that there is now in children could play out lights and do something to do what they want to than it was sort of a late summer evening nine up past and they are approaching the burial mound of shop how\nI was a huge tree growing out to the side of the burial ground and they still that today because I Would hope that I did a bit of filming only a few weeks ago [noise]\nAnd they claim that this creature was sort of scripted down on its own shoes [noise] looking at something and it comes and they definitely said homes and their claws\nThey couldn't say out toilet ... ... ... if it to the ... they would have said it was well over six foot so essentially it eats up the head no I'm like ... an ounce stations than than the cover their hair ... so to the features of a of a dog at\nA mixture of both and they're still looking at this thing not very close to the ... they're looking to and they can't believe what they're looking at this at very slowly it lifted his head he will be looking at something and they said he's homes and look to them now they didn't say a glowing red eyes or anything like that\nNow they tuned in run as fast as they couldn't they went off on the heels on the way home now this thing never pursued them now that's another thing that makes me think I mean we've been looking at the apex predator here [noise] and it has that\nKind of [noise] I don't know that that kind of reaction when he sees what would the ultimately be pray and he did nothing now the county ... story\nAll those years they these jobs I mean this guy though now schools relate today\nAnd when I first went round bury it afflicts than in probably ... years ago inquiring about the flexed and where will story in trying to speak to blow close to the area I spoke to these guys make it to the story but we knew nothing about it\nFrom some of the a witness\nTestimonies of what we've seen and we were just talking\nPreviously was all about the uh we're ... we're seeing holding something and if you go to the site you'll see featured a these sketches DePaul did by the way he's an artist as well just just when you see when you see it coming to life\n... someone's you know drawn it it's a it really adds so much to the story from the witnesses\nNow POM Wonderful artist sketch means that you did I Know that you're an artist as well and a former carpenter and so now what you do you like to eat a retired and you enjoy going and checking out all these mysteries correct\nThat's ... that's correct on it yeah it seems to be a passionate about all my life due to my early involvement in things have been annexed by nature shall we

relates a big ... related called elusive which is going to be quite incredible you know for me\nNo no no no no no no ... great but no I'm I Want to know more of those things because it was really tough soon to tell everybody out there that help it was\nThat in meeting on hearing about talking with\nUm that it was really hard to narrow down what should we talk about because I can talk about on and on and not just like you and\nAnd you also like to study all sorts of things and pulling together so it was very difficult to go\nHoly cow what are we going down for a couple of hours and really focus in on so that's where of course you know we are talking about where Wilson is perfect for right now for the time but definitely want to bring you back on with all these other wonderful things so\nYes I'll go ahead and let you get back to where we'll stories of\nThe old old stories of this leak didn't wear will\nYeah that's correct and once again to the location is cake on these these things seem to crop up\nIn in these concentrated areas along with all of a matter of a bind phenomena interesting with his military installations in these areas I'm sure your listeners will have found this in their research because at the top of stocks than world at the side of flicks then we'd go out ... the world which is the oldest operation a lottery of base in the world\nStill operational but you know a a before he was an R. E. F. base or whether it's built on an old whole Roman health for all the lens of sorts of I importance but we've we've still to move from the Nineteen forties and I have a few small accounts from the Nineteen sixties\nOr the or the village of semi which is very close\nAnd fits onto the edge of the the old PRI story like flicks than [noise] there's a fine of walking along a cold the\nFEMA drains now when they said drains these are just lend drainage ditches because there is still waterlogged enough to be such a well dressed for the capital to an another lifestyle to uh to to graze on all of you and he's walking along the same uh trains in the night when it comes to a gate\nA and\nProceed on over the top of the gate to release the class and claims that the lodge\nCalled hands and puts his hand on his\nI've spoke to this guy this is in the Nineteen sixties they stop and he's got no recollection of seeing a way I Will for seeing anything else just they hand that went over the top of his I'm frightened him to death when he could see the hand than they felt the hand so there is a physical presence to whatever we're dealing with didn't harm and\nTerrified and ... didn't harm and then in Nineteen sixty seven of what we know we've got an proximity could have been sixty eight they could've been sixty six but we've got sixty seven and spoken to these guys\nTo men ... home on a motorbike you know ... well after a night out in the seaside town of ... which would be about six miles away\nAnd the only road into place that has the eight ten three nine that's why a lot of the stories of the ... so it seemed to feature the road because of that I suppose the place where everybody's commuting that driving quite late at night and they catch something coming out to the side of a dyke\nAnd they can Satan that I'd like to see the light to this makes conceit is topping ... as they ... they have to pass this thing and he's a lodge had covert man once again it didn't pursue them as we perceive some kinda ribbon moms to to do what they said he had red eyes and it was it was a dot browning\nBleeding very big of a struggle to believe there's a breeding population of these things you know I I I honestly believe that we were seeing a glimpse into some other guy mentioned and wet at times with these scenarios this area allows these things to slip through into our sphere of existence\nOr you know who knows right\nYeah I mean if it's not so we're we're going to use for it funny yeah um yeah\n... you know this this definitely there's got to be some reason because otherwise we wouldn't have such a\nSuch gaps between the science things you would think if you go a lodge predator such as they say we obviously need to feed you would see the carnage that he left even if he was living on wild games which is there and they are plentiful around round these per se\nYou you would still find some kind of evidence seven ... we're not seeing that it's\nA I mean Ben than I did say earlier ... into the talk you know we we are on their own mutilation them symbol ever killing the animals at them and is choosing to remove the eyes isn't skin to face this is not the work of any known predator rhino boats\nFlakes than we know what I'm saying that we're just getting just getting a little cameo of stories cropping up throughout the years throughout the decades and\nI'm In LA\nThat that is correct Tony I should imagine there's a lot more I mean like the old guy in Nineteen forty eight\nHe told me to the story but knew nothing about it when I spoke to him and it was only when he realized that I was taking a serious and I was doing some deep research I did actually said to me said if you lived in this village fifty years we wouldn't even consider yellow peril\nIs it's very easy you know so so a lot of the outsiders I mean they may read about these things I mean I'm In the Nineteen seventies where I mean we've come to that now because there's a story from the Nineteen seventies\nOr any first written about I didn't research they swam a in a book called the ghost ... than they are they talk to the huge ... for a pet dog\nAttacking a timber walking on the eight ten three nine road jumping on to the wind screen this is in the Nineteen seventies and I can't remember the name of the offer\nBut I spoke to people in the village if they actually remember that I went to the there's a song flicks then the police didn't saw mill will you know we're going back for two years a lot of these people won't work there anymore the interesting thing was the the editor of the story but\nThey also knew the ... and like you just alluded to that chronic people know about this thing people see these unusual things and not everybody wants to step forward an older and the purple red above the parapet just because of the ridicule factor but nevertheless he doesn't stop the\nChange the fact that this thing is real family believe it's real war ... real I don't know about is really in some sense of the word\nYou know so this is beginning to these just outside of flexed and county has just another small village would only looking three miles away\nAnd this is
