grabbed me by my arm and they said if you see ... liquid you just thank him he's saved my life so you've helped a lot of people\nGet literally millions they were in fifty countries now George and are so very proud of that we have five thousand products to deal with over nine hundred different diseases and ah it's just that we run into this all over the world and it's just a very gratifying able to help so many people\nDoctors story that I had a couple of weeks ago that I said no one you were going to be on was and you've talked about this but eating foods like bacon and sausages they say may raise the risk of breast cancer what's going on here\nIt's an absolute fact or you know a ... my thesis for my postdoctoral fellowship and the sixties and seventies and twenty thousand autopsies I'm Seventeen thousand of them change over four and four species of animals and three thousand humans are looking for\nA common thread were animals are getting the same\nUm diseases and death from the same pollutants because everybody knew the earth is going to end until he's from Asia as him and and what he found was of course\nThat there were a note from a pollution um but but I did find that when people ate one serving a day with her male or female they once every day of any of his neat things Delhi's ... sandwich meat sauce the ham bacon baloney salami\nFemales they one serving a day of any processed meat things like Delhi slice of the sandwich meat sauce a ham bacon baloney salami pastrami pepperoni dirt ... spam juries are those kinds of things [noise] um then increase their risk many different types of cancers\nAt the same rate as smoking two packs of cigarettes a day I I wrote that up and published in Nineteen Seventy one everybody laughed at me\nWell in two thousand Fifteen\nThe world Health Organization and set it and then just a couple of weeks ago there's big study in England where they said they looked at like five hundred thousand people who are getting these processed meats and sure enough you know men get breast cancer\nYou know the truth is most\nWomen and of course it also have um a cause and effect or in a lung cancer and colorectal cancer and stomach cancer and so on\nAbsolute fact and so I haven't eaten processed meats for fifty years\nTalking I've got a friend of mine who has been\nJust starting the regimen a little late let me tell you why\nShe went to the doctor a couple of months ago and the diagnosed with the uterine cancer okay are you there I guess they're going to give her full hysterectomy she's all upset but ... ... ... what do you do at this stage\nOh Kay has metastasized other words has left the uterus and gone to lymph nodes and the liver and that kind of thing I don't think so\nOkay well I'm your immune system is your best friend when you have cancer or chemotherapy kills cancer cells no doubt about it but it also kills normal cells many people who die probably eighty percent of the people who died when they're getting chemotherapy treatment for cancer\nOr the doctors oh gosh you know we just we got 'em too late and it's so sorry that we weren't able to to stop the cancer but invariably\nIt was the fact that the chemotherapy agents killed all the normal cells that kill the patient's cancer and so that's a a problematic thing a with a treated with chemotherapy but as everybody's choice where they're going to get that are now I ... the antioxidants and immune support is your best friend\nWhen you have any type of cancer any type of cancer and so there's uterine cancer testicular cancer prostate cancer colorectal cancer stomach cancer lung cancer brain cancer I mean we could we could save\nJohn McCain of you to come to us okay ah he had a brain cancer\nOr those actually caused by a deficiency of a single mineral and I'm\nA ... and so but they gave him chemotherapy instead of giving them the nutrients\nIn the end it is it okay to do both\nWell many people do and do they do very well we we have one\nI Would I Would I Would I Would you know because unlike conventional medicine in some cases uh but I Love natural things in all cases but I probably would do if I had my doubts and do a combination\nNothing wrong with that well we have one product I mean we have I'd probably probably two dozen antioxidant products I Would take 'em all that um there's two of them are one of which was a done it big study I'm In I'm a Charlotte North Carolina\nI'm In the medical school and there was a ten year study a hundred and twenty million dollar study was the government's study\nAnd um it's it's on our mosquito dined grape seed extract has a liquid or from our um nature's Pearl division\nAnd it's probably shouldn't treat journals\nAnd it just came out like last year at the end of the study and it was one of the most effective\nUm cancer which I say survival uh uh products and it's a liquid and you take two servings a day for a hundred pounds of body weight\nA survival uh uh products and it's a liquid and you take two servings a day for a hundred pounds of body weight\nAnd um there's nothing like it out there and that so they they were just so excited I'm a hundred and twenty million dollar government study medical school\nIn Charlotte North Carolina published in the medical journals it's liquid extract of of from the mosquito and grape seed and it's just a beautiful product and then of course we have we call her Rosie radical uh eight hundred and fifty university studies in Japan\nOn CSI radical to has the um ... which is an extract from red marine algae that they credit is the reason why they have so few cancer deaths there and they have a a lower rate of cancer than any other nation because they eat so much of this\nRed marine allergy is part of the sushi stuff as part of their standard died and so we have a product called Z radical and few causes either capsules and the radical the liquid and so I take that and of course\nI'd take the mosquitoes and grape seed capsules and they take the most getting grape seed liquid just for prevention I keep my immune system a top and I don't eat the processed meats\nAnd um and and so you get your body than Ninety ascension your chance to sixty minerals sixteen vitamins ... body functions probably including your immune system and you're going to do very well um your quality of life goes up

feeling a sense of the static one and when we compared these signatures when the nearest scientists who work at the doctor said Stephanie Sullivan um we looked at other things like\nUh the work of the

works and doesn't take much effort to make things happen\nWill that was the interesting thing about this\nNo it doesn't I think would it take is meeting regularly it it takes some techniques and you know in my book the power of eight I've got all the techniques that people have to to follow to become a really good in tender\nAnd also to intend well in a group\nBut for me the thing the real key element is creating a little group of eight or so and you asked before they have to be eight no fiber work\nEleven or work you know eight is kind of a Goldilocks figure yeah you know it's like the not too big not too little um but what's really important is meeting week after week after week and I found that after\nI'm putting people in groups in twenty Fifteen I wanted to do my own experiment because I wanted to see if everything in their lives would begin to heal not just their health\nSo I got a group of two hundred and fifty together\nAnd have them you know I taught them for a while and then I put them in groups of eight or so and had the meat every week for a whole year and\nIt was extraordinary of the people who continued to meet regularly you know every week and that was about a hundred and fifty of them pretty much a hundred percent of them had major life changing experience is so it wasn't just their health\nYou know they got financial windfall or they got amazing new careers or they made up with this strange relatives or you know they got a great new house just the one they wanted um just came out of nowhere or they found a new\nLife purpose but it pretty much everybody had extraordinary stories to tell\nOur our ... are you sure that this works uh\nPrimarily from the field or is there\nScience behind\nI'm sure that this works um primarily from CU wars or science\n[noise] well I think there's a science in the sense that um we did that brainwaves study and we found that you know there are major brain changes that go on when you do intention of\nIn a group called ... group prayer in a way I'm In a sense that's what it is it's kind of secular prayer because you have these major changes\nWhich are really very\nVery much similar to somebody having a mystical state you know somebody having a mystical experience people get changed during those kinds of experiences and they allow themselves to be open to a lot of possibilities or they suddenly feel you know\nSomething major has changed all their senses are heightened um they feel really optimistic about their future\nAnd so in a way that starts to pave the way if you want to just look at what happens to the individual that paved the way for major changes\nAnd and possibilities but there's something more there's a bigger piece of this George that\nAnd believe me I'm trying to figure out what is it is it a group of fact you know is it just the power of intention but a big piece of this is the power of altruism\nUm that was the big surprise for me because remember this Sanders we're having amazing affects to healing effects and when I started looking into um\nThe science of altruism it's extraordinary I mean people who do stuff for other people\nNo matter how small live longer are happier are healthier in every regard\nAnd nuts what we found in a lot of our intention groups I mean when I talk about that group and twenty Fifteen and I was studying for a whole year\nI'm One of the people you know there were a couple of people that weren't getting anywhere you know one of them was a woman called Andy and Andy was going through a divorce\nAnd she had two small kids she needed a new job and she was very talented in marketing and coaching and she just couldn't get anything you know young woman just couldn't get anything and she was just trying everything and\nWe talked with her and tried to work with her and this and that are group tried to work with her and finally I was a bit frustrated by it and I just said oh Andy get off of yourself start intending for someone else and she was one of the people who was intending for that young boy Luke\nAnd the moment she did that she gets a coal out of the blue from somebody offering her a dream job so\nCan I tell you any everything about how this works you're absolutely not [laughter] there's a complete X factor here I don't understand\nBut there is something about that power of getting off of yourself and doing for someone else that seems to get a reward for you\nBut you're convinced that word orange\nAm convinced it works I watch it as I say I sort of look at it almost like a scientist I've looked at\nStudying groups over years\nUm you know I run I run these year long mastered classes and I'm I'm actually evaluating what's happening to people they're filling out forms every month to say what's changed in their lives and you know we've done the brain studies were going to do immune systems studies um and just seeing what happens in ...\nAnd you know we've done the brain studies were gonna do immune systems studies um and just seeing what happens in groups right in front of me you know I Know it works\nOr then others summer Lynn that don't get results in the ...\nWell I think it's the people who don't come regularly um sometimes it's nothing to do with skepticism that's the interesting thing too I gave a talk once in in Denver last last year\nAnd there was a woman who had really bad arthritis and she was a total skeptic and she got healed right away right there and um you know we've had people like that who haven't who were a little skeptical really didn't you know sought\nTo themselves yeah right and they had some healing doesn't mean everybody in an audience gets healed but\nA lot of them you know there's enough to say something really interesting is going on here\nAnd are you interested in the human because it's easier to track in terms of the ...\nOh you mean at physical healing well yeah because it is\nIt's easy to ... you know somebody had a condition they don't have the conditions we\nHad a woman with stage ... cancer I talked about earlier and she's now you know down to normal numbers now she was doing other stuff too but the intention pushed it right along somebody else with T. M. J. problems those temporary mandated dealer joint problems in your jaw and uh that she was\nSort of suffering where the pain of eight or nine out of ten and it went immediately down to two and then the pain was gone over days so this kind of thing you know it's kind of this healed in an instant or soon after\nIs the thing that you can as you say really track but then you've got other things we're amazing synchronous AT T's happened you know another woman who was\nTrying to write a book she was a body work um expert Lisa\nAnd she was in one of the year long groups and she was trying to write a book about she figured out a way to treat\nTrauma victims with body work and she wanted to write this book about it she'd never written a book and she was getting no where she had three different editors and just nothing was happening and at the group was intending for nothing was happening and finally once again I simply say\nGet off for yourself and she started ... intending to another member of the group who had some ... serious health issues\nAnd again the next week she has she feels compelled to go into a store and she didn't even need anything at the store and when she gets in there she meets somebody she vaguely\nIn this country and it's become patently obvious to everybody and it's very simple if you are a Democrat and you've engaged in any kind of questionable illegal activity you get a path if you're a Republican you don't people know that we have two systems\nOf justice in Washington and the Democrats are not held accountable the same way Republicans are we have to live the systems that just Rush Limbaugh we do ... news talk Ninety five point five which is where ... ...\nAm nine Seventy buildings these huge huge ward and you're listening to news ...

she wanted to be famous but she just didn't specify how\nAnd so suddenly have consequences and they have consequences right\nAbsolutely absolutely so it's about really telling the universe what you want I mean I Know that you're a a journalist too and so you'll recognize the five W's in age I usually tell people you\nKnow what reporters have to learn is when they write a lead of a story they write in an intro they have to do who what when where and why and how and and that's not a bad thing to do when you're formulating an intention\nIf a story includes all those ingredients you got a pretty good story\nExactly and for an intention it's the same thing you've got to say what do you want\nYou know the number of people on my master class who will do things like I Want to be rich\nAnd you know they don't really want to be rich what they want is usually you know in the sense of having loads and loads of money and more stuff what they want is they don't want the job they are in\nWhat they want is not to worry so much anymore they need a certain amount of money they may not necessarily need to be rich\nUm what they want is more time to spend with their children or grandchildren and so what you have to do is try to figure out first what you want what is that you really want and then tell the universe exactly what you want and\nThe other thing I notice George is oftentimes the universe gives us what we need not necessarily what we're trying to say we need like\nUm I have one group one master class a intention group of eight and they said what were intended for all of us to win the lottery and I\nSaid to them why what do you need and they said well\nGene needs twelve thousand dollars\nI'm for child and Joe needs another Fifteen thousand dollars to get a car and so and so needs this and that and I said well why do you intend for the meat individually and ask for what exactly they need because that's probably what the universe is going to give you you know so it's it's really about\nFirst of all figuring out what you want exactly\nAnd then telling ... yeah exactly what he was an opportunity for you to talk with Lynn Mick Jagger and about intention will start by going to Thomas a mobile you California Tom go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call lamb that's really a pleasure of comment and then a question um I\nAudio watcher programs one called living the fields and the other one called living with\nIntention and boy those audio compact desks are in constant rotation on my CD player I just want you to know that they're just have so much information now you you think about\nRetro causality\nRetro intention and you cite a number of experiments that appear to prove that\nWe can not only in ... for the president but we can chat and for the past that the past is not fixed and stone so to speak that there appears to be with experimental proof you cite a lot of researchers\nThere appears to be a robust cross talk between the past and the future and you cite ... how much met a job up here a group in Princeton and each of the experiments that they did that appear to show\nThat you can influence the past that the past is not fixed my question for you can you utilize retro intention retro causality for healing [noise]\nThat's such a great question thank you um yes the answer is the short answer is yes\nNow I Do this all the time in my master classes in workshop some I just ran a retreat in Italy last week and we were doing a lot of retro intentions one I tend to do though is you can't change the past of what\nOf what happened in the sense of it happened what you can do though is changed your response to it and going forward and in a way that is\nPart of this whole thing of time being really elastic time being one big smeared out now and that's what the studies you're talking about demonstrate is that you know we what they really show is that and this is a weird thing um\nWe don't change the past we changed the president as it unfolds the future affects the present as it unfolds all those studies show but just to answer your question when I tend to do is ask people to go back to a seed moment\nA moment in their health just when something\nJust started before it blew up to full blown disease a moment where they first argument argued with somebody in a relationship and\nEat then deteriorated afterwards just that moment when it started or a moment when somebody told you you weren't good enough as a child or you were\nTerrible at some things were just just did something like that and go back and change your response\nTo that teacher and you say no I'm not used to sit math I just don't understand this now I Will later\nSomething like that or imagine that that\nHealing that that illness doesn't blow up into full blown disease I'm actually had somebody who got ... from an infection go back and imagine that time and I swear to you she told us her skin was starting to re pigment\nIn the workshop it was extraordinary and loads of people\nThey were told something and it's in a sense released it for them going forward to it's an interesting little technique but there's plenty more to mess around with with ritual intention because even standard physicists now are saying to us all um\nYou know time is it what we thought it was it's not just for we're going era that we thought from cradle to grave it's much more as I said like one big smeared out now and one big smeared out here for space\nRich in Monterey, California is with us here rich go ahead\nYeah hey can you hear me don't carry a speaker phone all the good pretty good okay 'cause it's\nKind of hard to hear you I Want to thank you and when I'm your conversation is so right on its almost what you have all the time let me give you a a thing um I grew up kind of Catholic and\nI heard the story that you know some people will never die in a bar Feinstein says energy only changes farm so you know that kind of back me up my whole life so I was a little kid I like to be multiple I'm like I like to karate learned how to teach and\nIt talks about one percent of doubt can get your nose broke ... because your focus is gone I'm so no I'm divorced from the same life twice I have a daughter she's not talk to me all the stuff happens but I'm such a positive person I knew I Would be sixty one years old not working\nBeing taken care of and I am recently I could barely walk three years ago 'cause all the stress\nOf all the stuff now my ex wife still my friend she may even be my third wife again third time [laughter] but I Do not focus\nWell on my intention even though I'm On my third book of poetry and stuff picture of all this stuff but I write in my poetry exactly what I Want but I don't really visualize it I'm such a positive person I Want to have a\nA hippie hard center where people just come and visit and we do this ... thing that you're talking about and that just getting to be happy for a minute or a couple of minutes and go on them right away\nAnd your suggestion that these little groups shouldn't change the world that is how it's going to happen so my question as I have I broke my body working a hammer gun for Thirteen Years\nUm I have ripped the shoulders of ligaments or actually broken so every time I worked out it hurts like how so now I Will not work out again after a year break\nI have to decide to myself that maybe that pain is actually growing and\nI should ignore it or not have to have it again\nWell how does he get rid of bin Lyn tell us when we come back\nA long while you review

A. dot com\nOn line one\n\n\nWe are back with our final segment with ... Mick Jagger limit in the book the power of age what would you say was the most compelling aspect of it that you came across\n[noise] well I think it was the probably that so many instances killings and I think that it was really shocking to me that\nIt wasn't just health that was healing 'cause you know you could almost explain that by saying well it's the big feel good effect on the immune system things like that um but\nFor instance Natalie Lancaster I mean I it was shocking to me cases like this she was one of the receivers in a power of a group\nAnd she wanted her intention to be that her family business expand in all directions and be prosperous an old ways\nAnd then she and her husband had a computer support in business but it had been built on just two major clients and they were you know they ... they had just heard that one of their two clients was about to take their business elsewhere\nAnd they were really worried because they had lost money from a Ponzi scheme about a decade before and they had to file for bankruptcy and so she was really frightened that she was going to have to take a job I'm In real estate again flipping houses in order to survive so she can't\nDuring the group session she kept visualizing both her and mark opening up their car doors and money spilling out and afterward\nHer feeling about it for fear and their depression seemed to lift but what was really interesting is opportunities just started opening up for them they suddenly their business received a steady stream of smaller clients and within a few months\nShe they learn not only did that major client decided to stay with them but they completely diversified their client list\nAnd she and her husband had other big opportunities to um she had kind of a certain offers she paints is a hobby and she was a given offers to do her painting and mark was trying to do a sideline business training for\nPrograms that took off and it was just amazing for her she thought that something about the power of aid group\nNot only perform magic but helped her and her husband trust in self empowerment and the possibility of prosperity and I think that's what's so incredible for me is to watch everything in people's lives begin to heal\nCan you do develop intention in your dreams they\n[laughter] that's a great question I think we are intending in our dream state in a weird way though you know we're intending you know somebody calls up and dreams R B roll you know we've got weird weird stuff going on there and dreams but they are often times\n... cognitive you know they're forecasting all the time I mean I was fascinated to see when I was studying\nYou know time the fact that time is so elastic and not this one way arrow\nI was really interested to find that\nAnd it's so elastic and not this one way arrow I was really interested to find that that um a lot of\nPeople a lot of people ... dreamed that nine eleven\nUm interests that tax\nUm Rupert shelled rate did a study of it and found so many people had dreams of it of\nPlanes going into buildings that ... a high rise buildings\nAnd maybe not even in New York but they had that kind of very very specific\nDream and also they know that the Titanic had a record number of people um cancel their tickets for that maiden voyage the one that sank and the the somehow they knew ahead of time so we're picking up all\nAll kinds of information ahead of time it's not beyond the\nRealm of possibility that we're also sending out what we want to have happened were thinking about it the key though is I think being really specific as I mentioned before and also the power of a group you know we had before our break we had that caller call in about how to fix all of his\nHis illnesses you know his pain\nAnd I really got to say that the one way is to get a power of eight and grouped together because let them in ten for you be very specific about where your pain is that you want to kill\nThe pain in your you know if you've got a pain in your left so I'm left\nBig toe you know focused on that he really he really specific\nAbout it and if you don't have I should say if you don't have seven other good friends to be part of physically we have a place on our Web site limit ... dot com forward slash forum which allows people to just sign up\nAh either advertise that they want a group and their time

anything back fire you\nKnow nothing I mean we've had\nPeople who say they feel worse for a little while you know after they've done the intention maybe they feel a little bit more pain but it usually resolves and it's so much better so I've never had an instance yet where somebody has really got worse\nOver this and nothing you know at wars nothing has happened\nBut in most cases if they persist at it if they keep meeting with their group\nBig things and big changes to start happening\nOkay let's go to the phones was picking up I'm going to correct truck driving in Louisiana first time caller

extraterrestrial intelligence international\nSaid he deals with searching for Methodist from aliens many on the other hand there is science that deals with the creation of messages that they want to send the aliens this Saturday and many proponents have quite different perspective city scientists are in position to address only the question does active search for extraterrestrial intelligence makes sense\nIn other words would it be reasonable for SETI\nSuccessor the search for us to address Joe intelligence success\nWould it be reasonable to transmit with the object of attracting extraterrestrial intelligence the attention well many looks for wasting which we might be able to contact aliens instead of waiting to hear from them like SETI does\nHowever this does not mean that organizations like many international are without ideas on how we might better listen to our potential structural intelligent after all a\nCommunication goes beyond mere messages and also requires the medium exists with which to convey the message they need something to decode or otherwise interpret the messages and so\nYou have the need for multiple methodologies to increase the odds of finding something and there's also the problem knowing what to look for\nBut we've been shown in many Hollywood movies how we should communicate or how we could communicate with extraterrestrial intelligence in the film close encounters of the third kind scientists communicated with music in light they had a music can light Oregon and they played the elites respond in the movie a rival\nScientists had to use linguistics or linguists and a marine biologist to read the ... communications what were called ... they were technical ... and there were technical creatures that are remaining and environmental suited for them and their space pots\nAnd that was amazing show I mean more so it was kind of dry and drag and wasn't really your typical science fiction but it was amazing to see how they came up with the idea how the aliens would communicate it was a special way to communicate how linguist took like years\nMay no they don't necessarily I think demonstrate that but they took years to come up with the idea on how to communicate with the alien\nAnd we've been shown a various ways of the aliens would make contact with us and uh\nMost of what we see in films are like ... you know we see this radar blip you know what is it oh it'd be aliens trying to talk or we have sound signals maybe they can be a decoded by the magic of computer checking mathematics remembering contact\nThey had that scraping noise and when they were able to do\nThat because of scraping noise and sent back a video clip of the Olympics and they saw Hitler and everybody panicked and and uh because uh they didn't know that what they what they were getting was one of the first television\nThere was broadcast and uh this is what they saw and they sent it back but it was saying oh they're not see this based on my God I thought that was pretty I I thought it was pretty scary actually I mean I think that you know the aliens first signals send back to assert or signals from the you know German Olympics the Nineteen thirties\nSo I mean we show in various ways ah the aliens can talk to us through mathematics computer tech as well speaking through a computer ah this is another way that we've always imagined see this is where our imagination is limited especially now with apparently something has happened\nWe're both SETI enmity are beginning to act as though they are located something in space but they're not capable of explaining it to the public I get that feeling I don't know if you get that feeling but I get that feeling I get the feeling\nThat after their ah techno signatures workshop in Texas I get the feeling that after a members of the group like such shows back in and er during the Jill Tarter but he said well you know they bet in Irvine, California and they said we ... we need to rethink\nOur position here as a\nAs astronomers and scientists and those who want to find communication we may have it already\nBut we have it in the form of technological signatures we don't have in fact we don't have aliens chirping at us from another planet we don't have signals coming from the planet we have fast radio bursts that are big flashes of light that come in that could be you know from spaceships they're saying alien spaceship can produce vast radio burst but there's something else though\nOr something else we touched on a few few days ago or maybe in a week ago because ... ah from what I've been reading lately but take notice things your clothes are far more advanced as we've been told\nWe also maybe under the control of some of these techno signatures as a human ear is picked up on the signal that they say maybe ... ... this was creepy okay\nThere are indications I don't want to panic you but there are indications\nThat the aliens have been sending signals and only certain people have picked up on them because they're so faint or they they're they're they're buried in the noise of the cities and sometimes when you went in the mountains or the desert you can hear the signals being sent\nAnd some people are far more acute ... and they're able to hear these sounds and their pulsing sounds\nOkay um [noise]\nAnd this is where it gets weird because it makes you wonder if the aliens have been sending a some sort of a sonic sound you know like those horns those angel horns we've been hearing well yeah they said that they were solar storms and maybe they were the result of the solar storms or maybe kind of a thunder caused by a ... a ... [noise]\nYeah how\nMany of you probably if your Internet a bit to use it probably already heard that song because it's it's making the rounds 'cause it's an amazing sound especially when it's out in the middle of nowhere in in the snow in in northern sweet and\nSo here is that sound it is a pulse wave sound it came from out of nowhere and uh well explain more about this pulse wave sounding what might be going on listen to that so we go\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] in the background what you're hearing is you're hearing snow mobiles going over the snow\nBut if you listen you can hear even sound of a ... that's the window creaky something was humming and bending the area in August it was a reporter but even more annoying pulse that some residents belief is coming from an area near Doug white proving ground\nThat's Utah or that way proving grounds is divided into parts we have the army that operates the northern portion which houses most of the residents there needs to southeast portion is operated by the airport so the runway large enough to lend an aircraft the size of a space shuttle I\nKnow this portion isn't necessarily a talked about all the time she had the secret area of dead weight\n\nIs there has been developed an expanded since two thousand four with increased security build up the additional infrastructure is what many UFO conspiracy theorist you conclude because this is the news site where the government is testing secret military in UFO technology sort of northern\nArm of area fifty one\nI Want to play you this ... this um is even more annoying and scary listen to this\n\n\n\n\nOh\nIt's very low base come and this this is making my ears ring by the way because I had the headphones on and I heard the hummus make my ears ring the other one was a little bit low more PC\nWhen you're on the middle of nowhere you thinking what could be causing that low base tone\nYou know what could we rally my house is low base tone because it's not somebody driving by and they're you know they're low rider you know it's a boom boom boom it's not that I've had that happen before where somebody's like parked underneath my window while I'm sleeping and I can hear the low frequency home I realized oh it's some guy you know\nPlaying is ... is a you know low base listening to either dumped step for something else so you know I have to go wow you know it's a little loud but this is in the middle of nowhere that way is out of the middle of nowhere really it's out of the salt\nFlats um I Believe is in ... county so yeah since I've been there I've been the way I was escorted out of there by ah by the security\nThere I mean the military showed up told me that I needed to leave they were nicer to me\nBut then whack and had showed up and the guy looked like some Nazi with it with a gun and he told me to get off the property ... they actually escorted us we were to care of and we're doing a a\nA TV documentary uh for the ... channel called the unknowns out we were doing it as a pilot never got off the ground but uh we were there and doing the pilot and a were stopped by the military saying get away from the the area where like I said like what five hundred six hundred feet away from the gate\nWhere we're nowhere near the gate but apparently they said that we were looking suspicious they want us out of there and then of course whacking at stepped in and said you know we want you off the property and we're going to escort you out to all the county if you come back we'll bust you\nAnd so they drop out of the great Salt Lake and then that's all she wrote you know they turn around and went the other direction but it's very quiet out that way I mean it's it's it's quiet you're you know you're out in the middle of nowhere and you don't hear birds you do hear radios you don't hear anything out\nThere it's just just damn damn quiet I don't know if anybody\nIf any have you been to area fifty one Rachel I haven't been Rachel, Nevada by here it's also very quiet and Rachel's very quiet in a\nIn the areas near area fifty one because it's on the move a desert so I'm sure you know you pick up on these types of sounds and and like I said the pulse wave in northern Sweden though was in a place where the snow just fallen\nAnd uh once again I Want to play that some this is the sound of it had everybody's attention because you know while it's not all that impressed and not have is I don't think it's as impressive as the one you dug way but it's still got that low frequency fit rattled the house listen to this\n[noise]\n\nNow it's really hot it's uh I actually took my headphones off and the big speakers in the studio ... it was like I could feel my whole body suddenly my a Philly my us buying was tingling or something so yeah it's\nPretty amazing these homes okay alright started on this because we don't get the feedback that was weird okay they feed back when you have a speakers are so to the speakers off a catch ... experiment I own studio in Africa myself out\nSo the question is that good these Homs be connected to the test of secret spacecraft or is it a single is being sent from\nIntelligence in the form of gravity pulses that are picked\nAnd if he remembered yet does anybody remember the the recording I played of\nTwo police officers was a cold morning about four thirty in the morning near saint Helens Oregon\nIt's a well known recording of of two police officers and they record the sound of a of a huge light sitting on the Columbia River and it's a UFO and they they basically key up their CB radio\nAnd it sounds it sounds almost the same right that sounds the same ah but you know they say something it's like a large diesel motor rubbing up and then of course taking off but he said it's just you know so compelling\nHere these officers you know you know talking with one another\nAbout what they're experiencing what they're seeing nothing was said during these two homes because they just wanted everybody to get the feeling of a home I'm sure that you want to say anything I mean there is a\nSequence if you look up the video up on the Internet there is a sequence where you hear a snowmobile go by which I think ruins the mood but I mean uh I'm sure the guy is still a building care is that the guy was doing when he was doing with their own syllables really didn't hear it but in the quiet do you really can't hear that rumble and you'll be hearing\nRumbling in the sky [noise] so ah so this is where you know we have to wonder what are these rumbled we have to know what are these sounds\nYou know these are signals being sent to us from space [noise] are they extraterrestrial aircraft poorly something else I mean but [noise] they ... they were saying ah just recently the aliens can be trying to contact us by other means [noise] and I would\nSay that ah [noise] what's going on right now is the city is setting us up his city in us up to mayor setting us up for a yes ... up on the other day a week they're setting us up I think for disclosure or at least to tell us we have detected something but they do not know how to report it\nNor do they know how to identify it [noise] but yet the sounds are skipping in these little rumbles these horn sounds all this stuff happening makes you wonder if they are all connected Tripoli fix him at three thirty seven hundred will be bad

I mean it's not too far fetched to come to the conclusion that something is being sent to us from out there and that's what SETI is actually\nHaving preparing to tell us that some of these things we're hearing these tones these homes all this that or perhaps a TI he's trying to contact us but see there are other ways to they're talking about something called neutrinos now neutrinos are type of a\n... a ton of particle but it's produced by the decay of radioactive elements in interacts with matter very quickly are very weekly actually\nAnd this allows them to pass through solid mattered also makes it very difficult to detect neutrinos are produced in large quantities by the sun and astronomical sources\nBut they can also be produced by artificially or a maid nuclear reactors or nuclear ships ships run by nuclear power so these neutrinos can be used for the sake of communication\nThey can use the signature to communicate sound like something out of Star Trek follow the cling on bird of prey signature that's what we're talking about maybe ... behind\nBy spacecraft and so we only problem is that looking for neutrinos requires a lot of specialized equipment and currently all these are detected neutrinos involve expensive facilities but after rebuilt either underground\nOr an extremely isolated locations to ensure that they're not subject to any kind of electromagnetic interference okay\nNow this would be I think the the cattle that this will be ... or at least this would be the the you know this will be the thing that would a meta dealmaker right here is if they were fighting these neutrinos and and they're wondering where they're coming from I guess that's like tracking a\nA clean number to pray signature you're looking for leftovers decay radioactive decay from fuel\nShow um there are a number of facilities that are actually set up there is actually the super ... facility which is a one of the largest neutrino detectors or it's in Japan it's on ... uh\nUh amount of Keno in Japan there's also the ice cube neutrino observatory that's in a ... in South of Athens has got south pole station it's in an article and uh the University of Wisconsin is a the group that I uh basically runs that Madison, Wisconsin University of Wisconsin Madison\nAnd then there's the ... brewery neutrino observatory located in the former in a mine complex near Salisbury Ontario and it's operated by a group called snow lab okay so\nWe usually tree no detecting facilities\nExist and they're in in various places around the globe but I find interesting is that they have one in an article called the ice cube\nAnd they're they're they're trying to detect neutrinos but recently there was a story in Scientific American that indicated that something was happening what actually was happening um in in the Antarctica\nBut may see the debate even seal the deal on pop selections restaurant communication or actually a signature left behind by extraterrestrials or there are bizarre particles\nTo keep flying out of an article ... and they may shattered modern physics Caesar neutrinos they are there are special kinds of neutrino and physicists don't know what what\nTo keep flying out of an article size and they may shattered modern physics reserved neutrinos there there are special kinds of neutrino and businesses don't know what what they are exactly but they do know\nIt's uh it it comes about and central cosmic ray high energy particles blasted its way through space in the beer and then back out again\nAnd and so this isn't an article something comes in at the top of the planet comes out of Antarctica but the particles that are coming out\nA physicist are saying this is going to change the standard model of physics if we find out\nOr why these are these particles are doing or somebody they don't normally do I mean see you know when you look at the standard model model of particle physics these nano particles with these neutrinos or whatever they may be\nThey shouldn't be able to do what they do but they're doing so I mean look there are low energy neutrinos that can pierce through miles upon miles of rock and affected but these are high energy neutrinos\nAs weather as well as fighting a detecting other high energy particles\n[noise] they have large cross sections that means they live almost always crashing something soon after zipping into earth and never make it out the other side but [noise] this has been going on since March twenty sixteen [noise] okay [noise] march of twenty six teams [noise]\nAbout ... but he got there he got sick he got a what's called altitude sickness as long as we're filling up with new cars\nAnd they had to fly him out of Antarctica\nSo a Russian religious figure a U.S secretary of state and astronaut president all went to Antarctica after scientists discovered what could be evidence of extraterrestrial I'll be a communication and our life forms that that live off the air there\n\nOkay we talked about the species that they found there from Vostok\nSo uh I mean\nI don't know if you remember back when we talked about they found this new bacterium in Antarctica that can survive solely off the chemicals in the air\nUm they can live off formaldehyde other other things would be toxic in carcinogenic to us are really bad for us but uh these organisms can just survive off hydrogen and carbon monoxide than they can live off carbon dioxide\nWhich makes them extremophiles\nA and these microbes can't survive in some of the most extreme conditions that exist on our planet these organisms are so unique they're opening up the potential for finding alien life because now that we know organisms can exist up only chemicals in the air extraterrestrial life could exist in much wider a and Wilder circumstances\nThan previously thought I mean they ... they reconstructed some of the genomes of twenty three microbes\nAnd they're able to identify two species of previously undiscovered bacteria they are they're known as W PS two in eighty three ah they were living in the soil there in that article and others received these bacteria survive with little sunlight know geothermal energy and extremely limited nutrients\nIs mostly German bacteria these are the first life forms ever discovered that survive by just eating components of the air\nSo I mean and this demonstrates to how life can still exist\nIn physically extreme and nutrient starved environments you don't need all the ... uh the the building blocks we need to survive they found that these things would survive\nAs well so you have neutrinos that could be a signature of perhaps something radioactive or some radioactive exhaust okay that doesn't belong on this planet you've got species of bacteria that live in extreme conditions\nThat wouldn't be able to live in the conditions here on planet earth they may be able to living conditions on his space a moon somewhere you've got a Russian or a Russian a patriarch you got secretary state you got a number of people Buzz Aldrin astronaut going down there to see what's going on\nI Believe something happened something has happened many times over and they're still trying to figure out what they discovered\n\nAnd those sound those Cosby sounds you're hearing is part of it I think part of the equation\nTriple a fix every three thirty seven hundred that's triple eight six Seventy three thirty seven hundred go to Tim and Oregon Hi Tim you're on ground zero\nFive ... doing good man good hey\nThat that second sound the lights are out of Utah I'm I just recently heard us down similar to that when we were hunting lashed wake up in the average Joe national forest outside of ... really [noise]\nYeah and\nI didn't I didn't really put it all together and so I was listening to the show tonight and uh\nAround the same time we heard those noises they sounded a little bit further away they didn't sound as loud as a as what your play on the radio right but um right after we heard those cells there was military aircraft in the area\nEach time it was a single flyby and that was that was it\nOh we're part about it was\nA lot of animals there or not we didn't we didn't see any ... year there was no there that we normally see\n... you know would you know it would be in that area they were doing any kind of electromagnetic experiments 'cause I Know in the Olympic Peninsula\nOr in Washington Olympia they're doing electro they're doing electromagnetic testing in warfare a beer in in the forest so I mean it would be put in so\nI have no idea\n... so it was quiet where you were and you heard that sound\nYeah yeah it was it was a lot worse fate that that what you were played on the radio it almost sounded like it was kind of far off in the distance but it was really recognizable\nWas it in the sky you think it was up in the sky or was it somewhere at down below\nIt kind of sound like it was coming from all around okay it was really kind of hard to place it we're we're way up on top of them out so it it you know the the sounds kind of plays tricks on your ears up there but it's super silent I mean there's there's nothing around up there for awhile\nSo you're talking about the Doug way sound the sound that sounded the more\nElectronic yes okay\nWell the other one does too it's kind of a rumble rumble when you listen to it just depends on I guess your speakers what it sounds like but uh I was I was wondering you know I Would come over on the radio but I Know that a ... who is definitely a home near Doug way\nUh is pretty amazing it did sound to it just sounds like you did you have you heard it for too long a period of time it would be an earworm you know what I'm saying\nThis was further off it was it was a lot more fate but actually the first time I heard it I thought that maybe there was a vehicle close by and I sat and I listen I realized it wasn't a vehicle it was that humming kind of ...\nLet me play one more time so people can get the idea of a vote what you're talking about here to Tim said he heard a noise he said he heard it was when he was out hunting and this is the new easier\n\nAnd that's that was the noise Tim right that was the one you ... and ... and where were you again what what forests mountains range where are you in\nOr out of ... where you're at ... national forest it's a kind of south east of pride Oregon\nPine bill painful Oregon okay um what what county is that and do you know a lot\nTo say that's probably still Cook County\nOkay All right well just trying to figure out I'm I'm also trying to pinpoint this this uh media or the ... blew up but in a\nIn a ... a day out last night and a number of people said that they saw it but nobody reported it so\nHe was doing a lot of uh you know just from my own you know places where did I got to figure out what happened but yeah the sounds and the the explosions and and then the other one was in Norway so that's another thing in a mountainous area Norway too so it makes me wonder what this all is\nRight right ... thank you so much for your call thank you thank you\nBye bye John calling in from Texas tonight I John you're on ground zero\nOkay war during this to the show so we'll learn she she bought the school for a little space ship\nYou mean like your ship the troubles you think\nYeah like a shift is Lisa ... not sure\nThe okay look what you're talking about the neutrinos there that scientists are saying that the neutrinos are coming from\nSpace and they're entering on a in the north pole and coming out the south pole so they it's a what it is is it some sort of a a nuclear I guess you could call it a lot of particles that are being\nIt never been seen on this planet their their neutrinos that are basically are not the typical model so they're thinking that they're thinking that this may be some sort of a exhaust signature or decay signature and that it's been left by something they don't know yet what\nAll I I was just yes\nNo I mean it's a good guess I'm just trying to figure out though if if there was a ship or something above the planet\nWho's leaving behind these neutrinos it could be a distress call could be help us you know we're down and uh or or something you see that's the thing is that Saturday and many right now are trying to figure out how they're going to determine what counts as an extraterrestrial signal and I think they got so many they don't know how to they don't know how to interpret them\nAt all\nIf you're a stress low all over the long haul all\nRight you know all but anyway [noise] Charlie that will allow space and all the all you\nKnow they're originating in space but coming out in an article on the planet\nHe's somehow being used as a transmitter\nBeyond the model neutrinos that are coming out [noise]\nPlanet the south and which is kind of funny to think about so John thanks for the call [noise] of something's going in coming out the other side\nAnd uh they're saying this could be a segment signature of some kind of [noise]\nFrom extraterrestrial intelligence [noise]\nIt does not fit the model of a [noise]\nYou know some of the things we and then I'm I'm also thinking maybe certain has something to do with this but then again you know [noise]\nYou know I like to join the aliens put certain can be responsible as well I mean we could be really stop [noise]\nHeat of the planet that could be coming out reading [noise]\nNeutrinos that we've never seen before\nBecause of the experiments were done I don't know what do you
