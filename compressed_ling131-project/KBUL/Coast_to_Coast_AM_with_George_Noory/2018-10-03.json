climate we would just wrapped up in New York well what do they do anyway\n[noise] well they they had a lot of people there are a lot of dignitaries or their goals from the website where that they were run into a race ambition reduced climate change and accelerate climate action or some big notable Tony Blair former prime minister England spoke up on the moon from the United nations\nUm actor Hugh Jackman\nWho the man no Wolverine\nSpoken a so quite a quite a big group also a big public relations steel claim a five hundred thirty five million people were reached and three hundred and news articles written\nSo a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would er and and a lot of folks there I think believe that if they change a light\nBulbs they can save polar bears ... if we all drive electric\nCars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe and George we live in a in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo there are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they they are no I've never been a fan of that because you know I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there's no question about that and we need to fix that\nThere's ... million to fix that is\nCorrect but I don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles a I think this this planet or has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbons in the atmosphere and anything like that\nAre at least for periods of the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago and we've been gently cooling since then although the temperatures go up and they go down\nAnd ah you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were ah many people are conflicting what are called real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment\nYou know the other thing about pollution as you say we were so many people are conflicting with a cold real air pollution that can harm people\nOr harm the environment things like carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide mercury particulates with\nCarbon dioxide which is a odorless harmless invisible gas and when I speak to groups I like to say to him what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents man made climate change\n[noise] well it it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress and they it was on a very hot summer day and he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that the earth was warming in humans were causing that he was a computer model or\nAnd or within a year and a half the United nations form the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change\nAnd just three years later we had forty one nations in the European Community signed a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases so in my opinion of the first thing is that uh the world kind of jumped to a conclusion quickly on this\nBut uh you know for the last uh the thirty years or so the computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears doing fine and then the second factor though is I think a much of this is being driven forward by momentum by money\nUh we have a\nWind and solar and biofuel industries we have deans of sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations\nAnd there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year spent every year on renewables to try and stop the planet from warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days I've been talking about here's a one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nWell you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee a governor of Washington state\nJust a post an article and CNN quote how to show Trump you care about climate change and he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer and that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had that one degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree\nYet and I think it came from the sun well I thought so too\nBut that come straight from the climate research unit at East Anglia in England the the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade we've had a tenth of a degree in ... in Washington for a son to say that all these forest fires that caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work\nUm the way we take care of our forests are for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved today eighty percent of the world's wastewater is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago and Brazil the swimmers didn't want to swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down in Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve\nWe have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nSo that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nA a electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease yet we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming\nAnd the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun it's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things they're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that the you know the the the groups that are pro or con what's\nHappening with climate change keep butting heads but I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to feel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\n[noise] well if you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about uh um what\nWas Hurricane Florence mhm and last\nYear we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas ah we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida but if you look back at history this has happened before we've had\nA twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states and these are this is really nothing new\nA hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century other ... and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see that's storms are either getting more frequent are stronger\nOr the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we had more droughts in the Nineteen thirties [noise] we have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never show data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green blocks Steve ... linked up the coast to coast am dot com spell it for you first name Steve G. O. R. E. H. A. M. dot ... dot com\n... the new version of the coast to coast am map is now will be ... in now enjoyed ... on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded to the [noise]\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether the global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box tell me about the title first double\nSure well that's a ... this is a book or that tells you what your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase years over and over his think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there\nThey are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation\nThe idea that humans are growing too fast and and are populating the planet too fast\nOr the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction\nUh and the fourth is a resource depletion\nThose for fears are really at the basis of all of a our state and federal laws about energy\nI'm a and they're taught in the universities and taught in a high schools but if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so\nI discuss the horsemen and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries\nOr energy materials agriculture or et cetera but it's a fun to read it say a color paperback and a lot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also but uh uh eight hundred notes on the back so people can go deeper\nWhile the way for its size it's a heavy book\n[laughter] well I don't know about that but in lots of reasons and put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which kind of summarize with some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\nMore with climate change you with what's happening I'm a I'm told that the United states today is the world\n... with climate change with what's happening I'm a I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you know\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago amazed that\nIs going to be temporary because Saudi Arabia's ... talking about turning out a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse [noise] and ah yeah we're the biggest producer of crude no\nNo I Believe in Thomas schools theory of abiotic oil that the planet is got in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\nI tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time but we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including a you know camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I saw I think there's probably a combination of of some that his fossilized fuel but others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase the phrase fossil fuels I like to use the commercial hydrocarbons instead\nOn who you know one of my simple theories on why the ... theory is the probable theory is because most of the oil that has pumped on this planet he's way way down there oh yeah oddly glancing dead animals get down there\nThey're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you got to kind of wonder\nThe other thing is that a lot of it has been you know found in the polar regions too and in those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but I Know we have shipped shifting to the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a it probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the ... of the earth\nWhat is the argument about overpopulation and then it's a major problem for all of us yeah\nSo Nineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world and up and until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy ... the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality we had a declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems\nAnd so a bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death and the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nBut they didn't uh first we had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled or by two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output but the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping\nThe fertility rate the number of of ah children a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average is having five\nDuring her lifetime will today that has dropped down to two and a half\nThat said dropped in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological\nA sort of a state we have more women entering the worst workforce there waiting to have children they're having smaller families so all none of this was for seen it all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get to global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years\nAnd so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nZero population growth within about fifty or seven years and so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nAnd the benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles or the red cross and or affiliate can't fly in a as we were driving to get to the venue I saw things that I haven't seen in years you know because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in John Stewart strewn all over the place\nWhere his dad was in ... in Los Angeles yeah I you know looking at the homeless\nPeople in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so that really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call waste dump them everywhere pollution [noise]\nUh it certainly is that it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though that if I might if I might comment the government to California keeps making housing more expensive you know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand they're they're gonna twang everything they have a electric car plug in\nSo you just add about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California this isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right more would you recommend that people start doing personally to combat the situation\n[noise] ... ... people and businesses or you know actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going into land fills\nA that piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United States Senate is now starting to trend down we're doing more recycling um but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we've touched on before\nUm nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide articulates et cetera are not carbon dioxide um so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide is what they're pumping into greenhouses in California to make their cannabis crop grow\nA bigger and faster its its plant food\nThat's right or the idea that ah that C. O. two as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these\nPictures that where you have this dirty looking air over China\nIf you can see the error that's not causing global warming all of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gases number one is water vapor that's the biggest greenhouse gas to his carbon dioxide three has a methane those are all invisible\nSo if you can if you can see the air you got to clean that up but the greenhouse gases are are really not causing air pollution or so we need we need to get our our uh aimed at the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nSteve you talked about in people coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of ... is this\nYeah well we've had a basically a rate payer revolts now in Australia just this last summer in Australia um we had a\nA Scott Morris and take over as the uh the new a minister\nOf Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out\nAnd leading the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is called for withdraw from the Paris accords [noise]\nUm the prime minister Morrison says is number one priority is to reduce power prices why we keep the lights on wait a similar thing up and Ontario by the way both Australia and Ontario electric rates have gone through the roof more than doubled at the last ten years up\nWell the thing up in Ontario by the way both Australia and Ontario electric rates have gone through the roof more than doubled over the last ten years [noise]\nUp in Ontario a premier Doug Ford took over and within a month he had cancelled more than a hundred wind and solar a contracts they eliminated I'm a ... the fourteen thousand dollar Canadian electric car credits\nDot org rush into systems adjusted in this country and it's become patently obvious to everybody and it's very simple if you are a Democrat and you've been gauge than any kind of questionable illegal activity you get a pass and if you're a Republican you don't people know that we have two systems of justice in Washington\nAnd the Democrats are not held accountable the same way Republicans are\nWe have to smuggle limbic systems that just\nRush Limbaugh we do tend to hand him on the um news talk Ninety five point five we ... we're Montana she'd be you will am nine Seventy buildings these huge each word and you're listening to news talk Ninety five boys\n[noise]\nThe FBI investigation maybe nearly done object\nBut Capitol could be completed by the end of the day Wednesday with a confirmation vote possible over the weekend Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell says it will happen in soon what I can tell you what she was certainly as well I have an FBI report this week McConnell\nSays the results will be available to all senators democratic leader Chuck Schumer says\nThere ought to be adequate time for people to review the report before they're called on to vote\nRepublican leaders accused Democrats of moving the goalpost to the lake confirmation\nThat Jared helper and President Trump repeating that theme in a Tuesday night campaign rally in Mississippi\nIs in tatters a man's life is shattered his wife is shattered his daughters are beautiful incredible\nYoung kids\nThey destroyed before they want to destroy these are really evil people\nPresident in Mississippi to campaign for the re election of senators Cindy Hyde Smith the White House is dismissing a report in the New York times the claims President Trump and his family years ago avoided millions of dollars in taxes more than one billion dollars in gifts from their parents\nTime says the state of New York is investigating an attorney representing the president says the story is one hundred percent falls and highly defamatory\nIt's all over the national league wildcard game on a strike out [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] call on\nESPN the Rockies advance to the national league division series they'll play the Milwaukee Brewers Fox News ...

other sorts of things that would help those economies to grow and you know the good news is that\nA those are those are people are growing a we have about a\nAbout a I think it's about six hundred million people now that are under nourished across the world uh uh that's uh that's about the little less than ten percent of the world's population used to be thirty percent of Thirty years ago\nSo are people are are getting more nourishment uh they're getting more food famine has been basically eliminated\nUm it used to be that every decade twenty million people across the world would die from famine that was in the early Nineteen hundreds now every decade it's less than a million people died so we are making a lot of progress but I didn't want to suggest that we just ship them money [laughter] uh you're right on that\nLet's go to another caller barbers in Los Angeles have marble come to the program good to have you with us\nI have a few things taken tasked with the again that's fine you could just\nFirst of all and there's a lot of work being done with a tentative Danny king and you have the fake it frequent guest on your head David move them less alcohol gas and ... um\n... takes with that and then secondly Oklahoma has more earthquakes in way dealing California from oil drilling fracking primarily handlers\nActually that is true they are having more earthquakes but it isn't really fracking it is the it's the injection of the wastewater from fracking that is causing those are like well that's what I mean by the ... yeah well you're right indirectly it is\nBut uh they're working other other places where we can inject water all all day it's that's a really a problem to be solved by geologist or they need to tell us where we can safely inject water where we can't and then ah and then will reduce the possibility\nOf quakes sure plus\nAre they need to tell us where we can safely inject water where we can't and then uh and then will reduce the possibility of quakes\nSure possibility Steve that this entire planets should just have some horrendous catastrophe that something could happen just shattered the planet to\n... it could you know I I Hope that never happens and\nAnd you know all we can do though with with these things is adapt that's what we that's what we do with the storms that's we do with the sea level rise we've been doing that for a thousands of years\nUh there's really no evidence that we can control the climate we can do something locally with temperatures and locally but ... with weather but not on a global scale\nI'm very unlikely that we can control the climate at this point\nHow to British Columbia Canada we go to the first time caller Terri Hi Terry thanks for calling\nFellow man it's a good night to be having this discussion I most appreciate it a ... we had knowledge first than if the current ages the information age use or are the cutting edge and you'd have my total respect thank you Mr Gura them I say I am\nThe Lone Ranger [laughter] I have lost most of my credibility\nAnd I'm a killer researcher but people think I'm Crazy or heated and bringing up these these arguments that you do it means nothing ... there's [laughter]\nIt it it's a boom warming is a very sexy\nPosition because people feel smart and that if I just you know say my balls or do whatever I'll save the planet and [laughter]\nI'm sure you've heard it before but now the big thing that I Love to bring up in this totally discredited like Mr going to address this or the Ninety thousand cargo ships at sea they're pumping [noise]\nSulphur into the air\nThat must have a profound effect on 'em\nWell there is there there is an issue right now I'm cargo ships use fairly high sulfur fuel fairly furry dirty fuel um and I think the uh I Can't remember which organization is but the but the international organization I shipping\nHas actually agreed to go move to some different a lower so for fuel types\nAnd a lot of folks in the industry think that it's going to be a problem it's probably a good step though so I'm generally in favor of moving to lower so for fuel overtime [noise] um there's a lot of people also talking about cutting greenhouse gases from ships though it primarily carbon dioxide I think that probably is not such a good idea\nBut that is one of those real real pollution problems we need to clean up we also need to do a little or improve uh the problem with the litter of plastic and the oceans that's another issue\nThat we need to work in the organization was the international maritime organization thank you\nThat's [laughter] that's it and then they're predicting that the the increase is going to be huge uh in the next several years my twenty fifty you've no action is taken the increased by up to two hundred and fifty percent that's a big jump the sulfur yeah [noise]\nUh possibly so yeah I I couldn't really comment on that but I think so I think that's probably a good step\nLet's go to the roots in Portland, Oregon Hi Ruth go ahead\n[noise] [noise] Hi how you and your you and thank you for failing my blank faces I have no control\nOver their hands [laughter] okay now I'm very I'm\nBegging is I think it will be out of here oh lord I'm right now and if they can have a I have a plan that they can make our world\nYou give it some kind of a of a plan that they can make our world more free I'm\nA slant paying it forward now putting our technology and in in a place where we can\nBring our energy to where it can be free for everybody that would be great and I think they can do it and that might be here that that you are here donate you making our our uh\nDams in a ecosystem better and I've done that we're looking at\nIt even even the little people out here like me and ... is bigger than I can pay it forward right now I think that we all can live free I mean without anything\nThat would be great but Steven they're going to want to make money on this some aren't they\nI mean one of the great points that I talk about in the uh the second chapter of outside the green boxes the rise of democracy or the United states basically was the first modern democracy now we have\nUh just about I think it's almost Ninety nations set of ... that have a form of democratic government so it's going from zero to Ninety nations\nAnd with that you know we get the benefits of legal equality and freedom of speech religion rule of law lemonade show slavery women's suffrage personal property rights a lot of other things so the world is getting freer\nOh that's a very positive thing and it's all part of this idea that everybody is better off there's a lot of people going around saying the world's gonna collapse and we've got overpopulation we've got pollution we've read all these terrible things\nBut people are healthier lives and and one aspect of that is the rise of democracy\n... what do we do with people's cars this to me is one of the most heartbreaking situations people who cannot afford electricity or their gas or let's say it's the dead of winter and it's going to get shut off because they can't afford it\nWhat do we do with those kinds of folks I mean it's it's sad\nYeah that's a tough situation actually the United states is in better shape than many European places because\nUh we have very low cost electricity um a price us here in the United states I often put up a graph comparing Europe almost all the ... the nations in Europe have higher or electricity prices and we have here in the United states we have the lowest cost natural gas in the world\nAre right now where the biggest petroleum pollute the producer\nSo should we said though that nobody nobody gets shut off during implement weather or can we say that\nI Am not going to get into that I Do think many of the the uh the utilities have that sort of policy that they're\nEither not allowed to do that by law they have a policy where they're not going to do that during implement weather and they tend to postpone things in the summer I think\nHold on Steve we've got a break and come back we'll talk more takes on cold snacks\nGhost insiders the new version

what seems to be the question that most people want answered\n[noise] well um there are many um [noise]\nYou know I speak a lot to businesses and one of the things I I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the choir [laughter] yeah but the funny thing is though they don't realize that the majority of us business\nThinks that the climate was on the energy laws are foolish in many ways\nThe headlines are grip by a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and uh the political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of of American business um thinks a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in a majority [noise]\nAh so it's a little bit of a strange situation [noise]\nUm [noise]\nThey're in the majority are so it's a little bit of a strange situation\n[noise] um [noise]\nLet's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong is some is uh something that people come up with and that has to do with some of the assumptions\nI'm concerned about anything [noise] [noise] well they you know back in Nineteen Ninety the United nations in the inter governmental panel on climate change predicted that ah temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade\nOr with a mix of five tense and the low of too tense and if you put those on the church\nThose rice pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we we fed much less than that so we're\nWe're below the estimates of the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing the the rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions of the climate models are wrong and natural factors dominate global temperatures\nWill to Joe in Long Island New York to the Rockies going\nHey Steve interesting show uh actually I Want climate change I wanted to be warmer but students\nA and a comment a got a quick uh my first question what they are we just had a and in fact in Indonesia unfortunately and they said that they weren't really warned that that was supposed to be a week and that was working with the people could have got on this thing\nSo I I relate this to a ocean temperatures how well monitored all ocean temperatures and the satellites come into play with anything to do with that a second question what the\nAh the political climate you know ... all I talk about the last couple of weeks twenty four seven as the uh you know Brett Kavanaugh are in his shoes and a and a\n... you know it does make me think that the senators\nDon't have time to study science never or the tourist and really don't have a good grasp of science maybe they took one course thirty forty fifty years ago and science and never really updated themselves on their own\nUh and uh you know I don't want to pick on trial but he's already got and blame for the recent hurricane or in the Washington Post\nAnd then my comment would be uh you said the nuclear ... or a industry or was traditional\nAnd I think it's a like a lot of people are a potential disaster waiting to happen and I know it doesn't contribute to climate uh increase C. O. two but if you look at Chanel ball\nThat's still only buried at still active it's now the bank contained nobody can go within fifty miles of the place all these years later\nSo ah you take New York for example you got to the point right near them or this big metro area or something that happened with that then what happens in New York City\nSo you got a whole bunch of things that are I think there were three of them one was what are we doing with ocean temperature measurements the uh\nThe national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has I think they are the ones who put out these diving\nUm a measuring devices I forget the name of them again but they have thousands of them out there now but\nUh they've only been deployed for about a twelve to Fifteen Years so we really only have data on the ocean temperatures are from measurements are over the last twelve to Fifteen Years before that it was just you know people take 'em and ships and kind of ...\nPretty accurate as he um\nAnd then you said about ... uh what's um let's see ... the third one was the nuclear plants I think one of the big issues with nuclear plants that they need to solve is I Need to be able to shut down automatically\nWe still have plants so most of the ones that are on the world that are relying on cooling systems and if the cooling systems failed failed\nLike happened with the Saddam in Japan then we have a chance for a big melt down so that problem needs to be solved um the other big problem with no clear is is just frankly natural gas is so darn cheap right now nobody will build a nuclear plant\nAnd I think the third one was\nUm satellites\nWell you said something about governments and\nWhat's going on\nDuring the during do I I think you know I haven't been eight or nine defeated about five times in the U.S Congress I think the majority of er and arguably more than half of the United states so members of Congress right now do not think global warming is a dangerous problem or most of those around the Republican side of course\nAnd as I mentioned we have we have we now have a climate revolts if you will and Australia and Ontario so I think I think political leaders are starting to get it uh this has been a disaster crisis for more than Twenty years now and we're really not seeing the disaster so\nI'm hopefully I've covered most of your issues\nI think she's the biggest problem we got as an ex clear from the sun that could wipe out our power grid in a rigorous useless forever that\nThat's possible probably a big explosion there again if the if all those ... go off in Antarctica and melt a big bunch of ... the south of the of the peninsula down there that could be there there's many many things that could occur\nUm again we need to adapt as well we scan and the biggest one is an ice age boy I like this warm weather folks I Do not want to see the start of the studies that\nWe've got we've got a guess Robert Felix who believes were in the early stage of an ice age\n...\nWho knows Walter in Pennsylvania taken away well go ahead\nBy Georgia needless to say great to talk to you once again George thank you water\nShortages out with all due respect Mr Gore I'm sounds a lot like a doctor Tim ball ...\nGeorge with all due respect to ...

when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and\nAnd ah he was lining up some trout on Iraq near him as he was catching them was camping on the side of the creek and his plan of course being the cook 'em up\nFor dinner so he had caught a few brook trout late I'm On a rock and\nWhen he turned over Detroit we're gone now\nHis first instinct was the raccoon took more

side of the river [noise]\nAh I see a raccoon tickets\nLeft and right grabbed it and went back into the grass so I Know this happens and that's what he thought show a little later on he was putting more fish up there when he saw a long arm extend out at all most ground level\nAnd the huge hand grasp the pile of fish and not just one fish in one school grip numerous fish\nAnd retract it back into the weeds\nAnd that when he saw that it was game over because he knew this was something in the woods said he hadn't bargain for and the problem was that\nWhere it had reached out at ground level his tent was set up about fifty feet away from them so shortly thereafter that he\nGot the guts to go over there and repack up his tent and started to make its way out\n[noise] so shortly thereafter that

there to get the fish and retreat back into the woods without being seen but according to him when he saw the first group of British missing he was actually sitting on a rock smoking is pipe\nAnd he had his peripheral vision looking out towards the rock now now being mindful he wanted to catch the raccoons and the act what he was not a raccoon at all and uh he was pretty he was pretty frightened off by that\nAnd and tell us with these reports hotter people describe the creature in terms of tight neural big how big\nYeah well it it really varies I Would say a minimum you're talking a seven feet tall a\nAnd I had a ... point he had\nA lot of people say the comical shape to there's varieties of ah a hair for coloration ranging from like salt and pepper\nChew a lot of people use the term or burned or read a and then of course brown and black so that seems to be a variety and then we have two different basically physique\nUh it seems that you either have these kind of almost cylinder ... very early\nA beer like for lack of a better term\nAnd then there's the other one that appears again and again and it's described as being like a weightlifter\nOr a this you know Arnold Schwarzenegger or to the tenth degree type of body extremely muscular a veto chest you know Bolger size you know just like a a real monster\nSo these these are the things that people are seeing and then it just varies a I had one\nI'm a\nOne story called the tree stand a incident I named it with this fellow claimed that his trees stand who is twenty five feet in the tree which put his feet at something like twenty feet and this sasquatch and a group of other sized watches\nIt seemed that the group was distracting him making our own noises in the woods while he was both hunting and he couldn't see because of the density of the trees and the fog that was laying in this valley in the early morning\nBut he had said he recognized as a hunter that these our noises one not real in other words they were being mimicked\nAnd as he was kind of paying attention to this and sorting out the pieces a sasquatch snuck up on him from the rear and jet Li grabbed the heel of his boo\nThink about how big this thing\nAnd jet Li grab the heel of his boo [laughter] think about how big this thing had to be even if he was wrong and this measurement\nNobody ... trees stand ten feet off the ground I mean he said twenty five feet so what if he was at twenty feet and his feet or ... I don't know Seventeen something had to have tremendous height and reach but the amazing thing about that story was\nThe way he said that the creature gently grabbed his boots\nAnd he jumped to the point where he almost fell out of the stand and when he looked down this thing was looking up at him and he commented how he almost or what that is just wanted him to know that they can do that that they could sneak up on him and grab is blue\nAnd then it left the scene and everything went quiet again\nGeez now maybe you're born big food here in the woods tell us about the terror portion what what's going on out there\nWell I mean first of all when we talk about terra\nOr when we used the word bizarre uh in regards to big foot\nI ... I take the stand as to what is more terrifying\n[noise] is it ... is it not enough terrifying to see a ten foot tall monster walking across the shoulder of the road or is it more terrifying to have one flunking you in the woods or when you're hiking with your girlfriend\nThese things are out there they're frightening people a lot of the encounters a somewhat\nCasual wear this scene from afar and then the people exit hastily but then there's other ... encounters where it's my opinion these things don't want the people to be where they are\nAnd they seem to exhibit behavior that in my opinion they're chasing the people out\nThey want some of the region for some they they\nDon't want them there and I think if you push the envelope\nA\nYou're going to be in the sorry state of affairs or when you talk about this gentleman that said he had to fish and the the big foot walked over and he gave him to be gay but one\nBack [laughter] telling you right now George that big foot if I see that big

I don't even know what to say about that you know and yet this is something that was passed on\nYou talked about would knocking that the people are hearing what's going on with that which that's well\nYou know this is one of the things that we we see on the television or relative to a big foot people running around knocking on trees with bats and sticks\nOr they apparently believes that this is some type of communication uh between big foot you knock knock back on the signaling each other in the woods but this is really odd this account came to me and to me if you believe this\nIt really disapproves of the board knocked\nBecause according to this couple a this guy's name was ... he was a a semi pro landscape photographer [noise] uh and he and his wife were in an area called lower Crabtree meadows in twenty Seventeen July so this was fairly recent\nThe two of them will walking into this area to take some panoramic pictures now some of this guy's pictures are actually on line for sale so he says uh so he he also commented that I don't know when somebody is touted to be a professional\nBut he had been doing this for twenty five years and never considered themselves to be a professional\nAt any rate there in the valley taking pictures and there was nothing in the valley they hadn't seen any animals and then know el ... there was nothing around and they heard a loud knock\nEmanates through the valley so he's got his cameras set up on the tripod the wife has a pair of binoculars\nAnd many through the valley\nSo he's got his cameras set up under tripod the wife has a pair of binoculars and she starts scanning around and sit through a husband I see something pacing around over there on the hill fried\nAnd he says what do you mean you see something pacing she says I see something there's something on two legs over their pacing around on the hillside\nTo learn to like show he swings this time around using a telephoto lens he's trying to look through there she's got it now he sees it\nHe says even though it was so small in his land at the distance he was looking\nHe knew it was a big foot there was nothing else around there and he says he described it as looking like a a nervous man waiting for a bus this thing was just like pacing back and forth swimming in the arms up in the uh [noise] I'm like you said the nervous man waiting for a bus\nSeem very alert to\nYeah well a show then they're watching this thing it stand still raises its head up into the air like a howling wolf\nPuts his hands by it so I just like you will I Would do [noise] push our voice forward and then they hear the knock you know what I I Can't even do it but you know like if you click your tongue against through your mouth\nYou gotta Georgia's like only like you know a ...\nShow he said it wasn't a knock at all but it was more vocalization\nThat the creature was able to do somehow with the its role it's tongue its mouth who knows you can ask them questions but he said it was\nNot a knock at all so then\nThat was really you know interesting that somebody had caught such a thing you know\nIs it in your opinion is is it a blight gr man like\n[noise] I don't know George I you know ... aren't you here it's ... it's its own thing you know\nIt's all you know like in in a blue walked on Ford's very rarely will and he walked just standing up right it uses its arms and its knuckles on a move along as a chimpanzee does too mhm this seems to stand up right all the time\nOr not so really yeah uh I mean people have encountered them uh hitting all fours\nWould look like a beer to me did that\n[noise] yeah but a little different or I'll give you this is this is really a strange encounter a this was called the balloon is citing the balloons citing this guy had been given a gift certificate by his new wife for his birthday for balloon\nRod you always wanted one I got a\nHe was afraid of heights and his wife didn't know it [laughter] so the\n... [laughter] that they came one day when a to meet up with this balloon is out in the field\nAnd uh he was scared out of his wit split the he fought through it and they went for a ride and here's the guy or to try to keep the balloon as low as possible and the guy kind of way to them and said you let me know when you get really uncomfortable\nAnd he said they were about five hundred feet drifting over this uh farmland and more land but\nHe is what happens which is really a unusual they got to a point in their flight they were all the people in the ... with them by the way it was like just him and his wife to probably five or six people in there\nIf like there were other people in the ... with them by the way it wasn't like just to him and his wife to probably five or six people and now they got to a point where the pilot or the balloon\nLowered the balloon over a wooded area so that the ... was scraping the branches\nAnd they came down and did that and everybody was cheering and everything you know ... trying to grab a leaf off the tree and all of this\nThen he lifted it back up again as they made it across the next to the old\nHe did it once again he lowered it down and they just moving slowly along scraping the tree up and they all started cheering now he said you'd think they won the lottery the way the people put carrying on and it's gone Bola [noise]\nBut here in with their big foot comes in\nWhen they're scraping over the second series of trees that was bordering a field\nBusting out at the tree line as the balloon is guided along gliding along comes this big foot he starts out walking quickly looking over his shoulder and the guy said I Swear he was looking directly at me\nAnd everybody said look at that and one lady snapped a picture of the thing\nThey kept quiet and you can't control the balloon this fellow said that after this thing think took several you know very long and fast strides walking\nIt hit the deck on all fours and took off he said it looked like a racehorse at the Belmont raise you see that's unusual isn't it\n[noise] well I I mean you know I've heard of this I I have a story and one of the books that cold along came a spider where these guys were hog hunting so here we go back I told you I had some accounts of ... feral hog on these guys were hog hunting and they were sitting\nIn a field or coming up on dusk waiting for the songs to come down the trees that were already some out in the field they were in the tall grass\nAnd the grass was sporadically patch and all the words there were clear areas and areas of high glass of grass working away around this field they saw what he described as a furry army homemade\nSticking above the grass that's what they were looking at all these shows like this dome all black for they\nWere watching this thing moving through the grass in spurts similar to like a spy to want to move quickly in stops moved quickly and stopped\nFinally they catch this thing coursing and opening between two patches and it's heading towards the hogs that they were looking at which we still far away\nWhen this thing came into the opening he said it looked like a ten or twelve foot long spider on four legs with the head sticking up what they saw was the head\nIt's scurried into the bushes or the or the grass on the other side making its way towards the hogs and as they were watching this thing it's going up and one that stood up they knew it was a big foot\nAnd this thing made a lunging leap like Superman dive on to one of the harms some type of quick moving on and on the ground and left the field\nWith the hog under its on more than a bizarre story William we're going to come back and take promise phone calls next on those details\nOf the perks you ... you were just being in

photo of a tool or makes laws were captured and killed in Pennsylvania and around two Seventy Michael this is thing really looks like the real McCoy\nThis was in Pennsylvania now in a circle Eighteen Seventy and this one may caught up in the other big foot they have them and [noise]\nAnd the second question I as you mentioned that you knew some men that\nShot a big foot what happened after the ... was shot why would you go down like they should have what kind of weapons are they a well\nHere's an answer your first question no a month familiar with the uh two big foot in Pennsylvania [noise] uh but I have a number of historical accounts one of them was quite an interesting\nUh that came from a photograph taken from a a grandparents' house after the ... final grandparents had died in which was depicted a work camp in Virginia at the time uh that was set up a\nAfter Roosevelt had established a uh the protection of the parks\nAre they they needed to start making eat grass and and access to these parks and structures so people could go in there and stay in a bathroom facilities and rangers stations so they had assembled this civilian core of workers\nAnd these guys were in there basically roughing it in the wilderness\nIn these newly protected uh a wooded areas that but to become a national parks and they were regularly having encounters with what they called the hairy men\nAre in fact in the one in ... account in a one of my books called the hairy men\nOne of these things came into the camp and tried dragging wanted the men off of this caught any other men attacked it throwing a handout taxes and grabbing guns shooting at the thing as it ran\nA out of their uh encampment now the odd thing is about these things [noise]\nIt seems that shocked gunfire has almost no effect on them are in fact in one account called defense in hunters\nThis guy hit this thing at twenty twenty five yards with both barrels of a seven and a half lead shot and he said the thing didn't even flinch and kept running through a briar patch\nOr in answer to your second question\nAbout a big what's being shot\nOr in my account called the fifth bullet this guy was hunting and um I think it was Idaho at any rate he came to an air\nThey wanted with a mountains in a ridge line on three sides in front of him and he ran across what he described as a corn to taught me that sticks he said this thing did not randomly form there in fact there was nothing about this pine forests that lent itself\nTo having this quantity of sticks and branch Paulos oh bows and branches formed in this type of thing any inside had about a two foot deep layer of branches as well as well for me what he thought was like betting\nSo his initial thought was that\nHunters had built this thing as like a shelter when they were out there but that was shown that change on this line that he had initially seen coming into the place he was now seeing a dark figure standing at the ridge which started to charge in his direction down the hill\nNow he estimated that this ridge line was about a Fifteen hundred feet\nAbove the valley that he was standing in and he said that the rate that this thing was running down the hill was impossible for a man to do when this thing broke to the base of the ridge\nHe estimated now than it was about six to nine hundred yards away from his position and at the time he was a hunting with a vintage Korean War vintage am one car being\nAs it got closer he leveled the site on it and pumped around over its head\nThinking he would scare it it kept running he described this thing as looking like the cop in the Terminator movies when that that the cyborg or whatever the heck they called the Terminator robot was\nA posing as the police officer and how he was running relentlessly with the arms pumping and like nothing could stop them\nEven load is gone fired a second round added he sure\nHe hid it it had no effect on them and they kept broadening he fired a third and fourth round and this thing kept coming at him now was closing in he's squeeze the trigger on the fifth bullet which is why it named a story the bullet and it finally drop\nAnd when he walked up on it he got closer we shot it with another round\nHe got even closer to and he realized the thing was was not moving in that it was gone\nAnd he left it where it was now here's the thing George\nFirst of all this guy shooting this thing in self defense he's in imminent danger or this things coming at him like about a hell he's shooting at this thing and the bullet seem to be having having no effect on them and yet when he's short lying on the ground he conceded that had been wanting to do was multiple blood\nPatches where these bullets had actually hit it but why these\nThings can go now we all know if you go hunting\nIf you don't have a moose ... or in Al Gore deer if you don't get a good long shot or heart shot some type of solid organs shot\nThese things can run and hunters to lose their a quarry not being able to find it because they can go for miles or you know they could just disappear on you if you don't get a good shot\nBut these creatures it seems like to me if you are going to take one of these things down it's got to be a head shot it's got to be in the neck or the ... or\nSomething ... much sadly then you have to take them now well I mean what are you going to do George rhino R. by the way I looked at the picture seventies series\nThey have to take them now well I mean what are you going to do Georgia\nRhino R. by the way I looked at the

some of them was directly to the president [noise] Ted Cruz's office [noise] also received\nA mail that contained\nIt which is a a a poison that can be made in the kitchen it's easy to make real good Breaking Bad fans you probably remember the Breaking Bad um\nIt was a it was actually used um many times of the show there was also show now can be cooked through the kitchen with a simple things like a castor beans and other ... and stuff you can buy a hardware store\n[noise] so it didn't it wouldn't take much for someone to put all this stuff together and mail it out I mean the thing is\nWhen these things are used and American citizens to target especially when it comes to leaders um ... it's basically a having me question a lot of things right now it is I had a I spoke recently at ground zero lounge and I'm\nAt the ground zero lounge we have a discussion about the test that supposed to be happening tomorrow with the bones or this is the world but the U.S nationwide chest\nAnd they're going to send a message about an emergency ah this is a a a fake emergency rather to drill a test to see if your Bones Are going to be working and a sea of ah you're you're going to be able to pick up on an emergency broadcast\nNow when I was in the ground zero lounge\nWe were talking about the cabinet Ford affair and we weren't talking about he said she said he was right who's wrong cast yeah ... exactly uh we um my uh British just always rate from ...\nWe were at the ground zero lounge in and we were talking about I was talking to my audience about the cabinet Ford situation\nWe were at the ground zero lounge and and we were talking about I was talking to my audience without the Kavanaugh Ford situation\nAnd I said to them I told him I said you know\nI said and I said on a few occasions that it was going to be some sort of an attack in the attack would happen and if you remember we did a show about\nThe rush these pure and in Oregon and for those that have seen the TV show wild wild country you'll know that the reason we're actually ... the Russian each cold actually tried to poison\n[noise] a Washington County authorities because they wanted to be able to win the election they had their people running for office and they figured if they can make people sick\nThey wouldn't come out and vote okay they wouldn't be able to vote\nAnd so they when they put salmonella and the salad bars around the area so those who get sick wouldn't be able to go out and vote\nAnd it would reduce it reduced the voter turnout and so this happening right now is this a rice and attack\nNot only happening the day before we're supposed to do this nation wide tests but it's happening during a major investigation into a chief justice being um\nConfirmed and\nIn a nation in the time of the nation when we're very divided okay\nAnd what I what do what I'm thinking about tonight and and if you can hear the ... and you know I'm really kind of nervous about the show tonight mainly because of the fact of how close we've come and how and how it's all happening here and what's going on is is real okay and uh\nAnd I'm trying to assess just how everything comes together it's ... it's like a puzzle\nAnd all the pieces are coming together in a in some way but once again I asked the question you know is there any investigation right I'm not seeing actually put on network news on my monitors right now we're having some sort of debate with our governor or our governor speaking or or or something that I Know what's going on\nBut has nothing to do with the matter at hand today and I really don't think the mainstream news cares or are they even investigating or even trying to investigate who may have been responsible for sending this rice and powder\nTo the president\nAnd whether or not this is an assassination attempt or whether or not it could have been some sort of a\nA a mini\nTrial for decapitation exercise or if it's something that is keeping us aware of what's about to happen with the phones tomorrow and whether or not\nKavanaugh\nWill be affirmed while you realize that if the FBI Files that report to more and more than likely they will be if they don't need till friday okay\nThey don't need to friday to make their assessment and they probably won't take until friday everybody's waiting for friday they oh wait till friday no\nThey'll probably give the report tomorrow and this is the thing is that that I'm I'm the arising here they're going to give the report tomorrow\nAnd when they do they're not going to let the American people know the results\nThey don't have to [noise] they don't have to tell the American people the results of that frightening [noise]\nAll we'll hear about is the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh [noise]\n\nBecause if he were joy inhaled rice and I mean sure he could be treated he could have a you know flu symptoms or whatever but you know if it didn't get treated his lungs can fill up that could've killed\nChain same with the Ted Cruz you know same with mad at the same with all the other people that were targeted today\nAnd I said and as I said before you know you go down the list of what happened when the anthrax was released during the time in nine eleven\nPeople became infected in September they were in fact in October and they were infected November three months of infection and\nThere were gaps in preparedness biological attack but the difference between this attack\nIn in in nine eleven in two thousand one and the attack that happened today\nWe knew\nThat something was happening we knew that something was going to go down and why do we know ... ... was talking about this very thing the possibility of something getting released\n[noise]\nWe have the gain a function exercises that took place with the aircraft and boy I have some news about this it's really good for you\n[noise] and\nHad many bio drills and now we have the emergency\nOwn report tomorrow we have the test tomorrow and tomorrow we could see the wrapping up of the FBI report on the cabinet or for case\nAnd they don't have to give us the information they can just say well we did our investigation it satisfies everybody put it to a vote and we've confirmed everybody said well what what did happen nudity or didn't make you won't know\nHe won't know\nAnd I'm sure there'll be you know people screaming injustice here and injustice there'll be a fight going on and all kinds of crazy so go on this is a pattern\n\nAnd warned you okay I'm warned you I saw it I I can see it and I and I'm very nervous tonight the little bit because I said some things to the ground zero lounge\nWith the the video it's up yet and I and I don't know when it's going to go up of the recording of of the presentation but uh you can hear the audience I were talking about this and they and somebody had piped up in the audience is I'll bet they'll ever wrapped up by Wednesday and then I was reading something that the FBI is Betty ... ready to uh\n... basically summarizing put together a report released Wednesday and we won't know\nWe all know anything about it and they delayed talking about until friday but apparently from what I gather tomorrow's the day\nAnd we won't know because they they don't have to tell us anything\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's Tripoli except for three three Cisco Tony in Indiana Hi Tony you're on ground zero\nFake lied I tell you what that sits right into the pattern they uh uh\nUsed by you know there's a bio a drill all of a sudden it's alive they uh\nHave been some ... you know they've been talking about since the ... report about a biological attack\nAnd your hair and how to Europe how the Europeans are worried about Europe because sources banker friends are saying that they're playing for the collapse so this is something that's been coming for a while it just you know it may be the curing time for the rice and was as a ready on the Eighteenth so they've pushed it off as a third\nOh it was ready I mean a happy and let me let me just a you know and and I'm gonna have to repeat myself in the next door I'm kind of holding things up but I won't hold things up for much so um you anything about what rice and does to people when they inhale it\n[noise] yeah it's it causes a a massive influx of food into the lungs and you're just drowned\nWell yeah you can drown in your lungs but it just depends on the frequency and what's in it and\nAnd you know it's worse if you swallow it it's worse if you injected because it can get you on a a a DNA level and the blood if you put it in the blood\nBut here's the deal ... here's the deal I was reading that if rice and is it gets into a human being and all of a sudden they start coughing and they started sneezing\nAnd the part of everyone goes airborne okay yes and then people around you if you are around that they also get some of it in them and what they are showing these aren't showing signs of flu they start showing signs of sneezing coughing\nNacho watery eyes a fever feeling and it happens it happens within seconds there is no inclination period it happens within seconds or maybe even\nA just a little bit of time but anybody who is exposed to it you have a lot of people around you you start seeing all of them getting sick too so we went to the last time it off when was the last time\nWe heard about this happening you remember right after nine eleven no more recent than that uh that I'm sure you know remember the Emirates plane landed a JFK\nOh absolutely yeah they have three of them there were three planes they held I think they were only recorded onto though\nThere was a plane that landed in Emirates and they said that people do\nAnd there were two or three people that were acting like they're sick and then the whole lower level of the people they all came down with the same thing\nRight and then they then they released into the public and just let them do say\nSo you know that would explain why they didn't even care they release people in the past year okay you didn't get exposed all that bad for the rest of you were gonna hospitalized no reports of deaths but still for the function exercise if we released rice in the plane or we put somebody on was exposed to rice and\nHow would the plane react coming into JFK yet ride your time New York times that right you know what time that Emirates plane landed at JFK\nProbably three thirty three\nNo nine eleven Arab that's\nNot a shock I tell you what the the that the way they use ... and the way they planned it just it's just amazing how when you start analyzing it how it is so true to form\nYou know what time they're going to do that test on your phone tomorrow wired to Eighteen\nTo Eighteen eastern time you know what I mean one is lying and what is nine and two\nEleven died in there yeah there is diverse yeah they do they do I went on ... [laughter] yeah it's all going to All right well let's see if I keep telling the truth\nI I Try thank you for calling take their hair All right Bye bye let's go to a really quickly in Texas I Will you're on ground zero\nOh gosh she just last night we can listen to your program and I'm not sure where ongoing others and I believe that what you're saying tonight this is a major distraction to what is happening politically in our country is that right\nNo it's a major distraction instead attempt it was an attempt to try and block votes and confirmation of cabinet and I think er or to the lady investigation\nBecause what you have the FBI chasing after who tried to kill the president who tried to kill people the Pentagon and they seem to agree with the same modus operandi or the or rush beach pure and did in Oregon in Nineteen eighty four\nOkay what's your takeaway for this and I I\nYou know I'll tell you what it takes away from this be prepared because there could be something even bigger coming tomorrow okay now I don't know what it is I don't want to panic anybody\nBut I think that if we find out tomorrow the FBI is wrapped up this investigation which I hear they have they don't have to report or give us any information about what they what they concluded in fact\nThey could put this to a vote and say we voted and that's the way they can report if they want but if they don't I'm sure there'll be a lot of people screaming vengeance\nAbout what has gone down depending on which way it goes\nFast case scenario or ... ... s case scenario\nNothing nothing oh that OK\nBest case scenario nothing but the thing is it's already happened I mean the balls wrong I mean what you we are but attempted attack on the president's where we have we ever attempted attack in the Pentagon women attempted to the attack on Ted\nCruz and his people now why Ted Cruz I have no idea\n[laughter] I well I think it's a major just as trying to distract us from what is really happening which is very significant in our world about abuse of women that I bet so minor compared to what may have I don't\nKnow how it's distracting is from the abuse of women the problems there and we know the problem exists it's okay I don't know how that is what this does is it it's basically\nIt's terrorism to change the political direction is what it is\nAnd I believe that it's domestic terrorists [noise] okay All right so\nThe political direction is what it is\nAnd I believe that it's domestic terrorists [noise] okay All right so\nReally uh be prepared for anything tomorrow so I got in fact I told my staff tomorrow [noise] I said tomorrow will be prepared we may be coming in early may be doing a bunch of things early because of the ah [noise] ...

I mean where's it gonna stop\nAnd then the rice and being sent to the president okay why are we not talking about this is an assassination attempt on our president why why not why aren't we\nWhy are we still talking about cabin on Ford when that investigation's underway and I don't know of or any of the mainstream news organizations will tell you the FBI does not have to tell you\nThe results of that investigation\nAnd of course the rice and it's been sent out to people hospitalized with rice and attacks the Ted Cruz's operas and what's interesting too is it all this happened like this you know in a October November December right after the nine eleven attacks\nSo you know if anyone is exposed to rice and then you know the first clue\nLarge number of people who'd been close to each other rapidly develop a fever cop and he accepts the fluid in their lungs\nNo first of all come as a sudden flu and then there would be the sudden breathing problems shared by everyone within the vicinity of exposure and eventually they get all die but no you don't have to die and and it just it just a reminder does anybody remember what happened on the Emirates plane landed the JFK Airport\nIt was white two or three from Dubai Atlanta JFK to prosper nine eleven AM after declaring a medical emergency prompting a huge response from police in paramedics\nMembers from the Centers for Disease Control and prevention and screened approximately five hundred and Twenty one people on board the plane\nSymptoms were like I just mentioned the CDC to prosecute a said one hundred passengers and crew can play the flu like symptoms including coughing fever total Nineteen people were sick Ken we're taking a Jamaica hospital and nine refuse medical attention\nAnd I remember the question on everyone's mind was hobbies so many people become so violently ill so quickly on an aircraft there was no information jury for flu and no one in close proximity to a flu patients will get the symptoms of copyright and chills in that short a period of time\nSo now we have a compelling argument for getting a punctured exercise rice and for a low dose of rice and he had been used on that plane and brass disease we investigated again by officials even though rice was not the most deadly portion of the world is intact that category be average security risk aided by the CDC\nHit it could be considered a biological weapon since it's so easy to extract by a by product in the preparation of castor oil and what is more it is extremely easy to purchase\nVeggie stream of easy to make you can go on Google they'll have the recipe and you can make it into\n\nWhere do you watch Breaking Bad well that's that was the uh that is a that is the ah I guess the poison of choice for Libya\nYou [laughter] and several other people too so um anyway [noise]\nTripoli six up at three thirty [laughter] poison up towards Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six seven three\nThirty seven oh and a reminder tomorrow is the day where they're going to do that telephone exercise where you're going to be alerted [noise] on your bones in an emergency aphasia emergency is going down [noise]\nTiming is everything right [noise] what do you think Tripoli fixing and three thirty seven hundred ... Seventy three thirty seven hundred will be riding [noise]\nI think that it would give them a reason and we're going to stop this right now\nAnd we're going to investigate who was involved with sending the rice and but it's not going to stop the FBI the FBI is already made the decision\nAnd and I know they've already made the decision because you know uh actually we were to ground zero allows discussing this and somebody said to me they said well\nThey're going wrap this up by Wednesday they don't have to wait till friday and he said well a week's time they don't have to wait all they have to do is go back over some existing papers you know their ducks in a row dot the I's properties comeback give their decision the vote goes down he gets confirmed the American people were dumbfounded they don't know what's going on\nPeople who don't like the idea get angry and he started harassing people even more and maybe even worse than that\nAbsolutely and and the other thing is it's it's just um\nIt it it's interesting that the whole I mean you know ... you are are definitely you know obviously you try to stay out of the political game yeah and I you know I tend to lean right or whatever you want to call out I mean nowadays that's totally got a horrible\nThing to even align yourself with any side of the team [noise]\nBut um I Do think it's interesting um that I Do a Google Search like a like a traitor so on today I'm listening and I'm I'm kinda just good when this whole thing and nothing is really coming up it's like sticking out I mean no I mean literally when I Googled race in poisoning this the whole thing\nFox News comes up a couple of times which right wing whatever I mean you can see the parallels are those are the you know the\nThe patterns but it just it just kind of weird that nobody's really you know having a big a media discussion about this\nAnd and right now the breaking news on CNN Trump attacks cabinet ... or just days after calling her a very credible witness\nSo they're still maintaining ah this this sexual um he said she said division that they've been doing not only with Stormy Daniels and the president now they're doing it with a doctor for in a red cabinet so yeah you know they they seem to be this scandal channel\nThey don't want to talk about you know uh what is going on behind the scenes the rice in the tax\nThings that we've been talking about that we were preparing you all for good now happened and uh you know most of the American people I I really don't think even knew that ... or even know now it's been going on\nOn that it's happening and it's because we told you be prepared for the final blow and part of it now we see is some attempted biological attack on the Pentagon\nSo do you do you think though that they're they're trying to shove this aside I mean it's I mean and again not to get to political but do you do you think that if there was a Democrat that with the president and this was happening do you think because again you\nKnow I Know a primary goal I've got a rice in attack once ah so I I wrote about it I saw\nThat now I don't even remember that though I mean I mean so I I don't know yeah I guess maybe maybe a ... a drawl inclusion that's out there I mean\nIt really isn't always leaning left\nSo I I don't know well and remember who all got attacked after nine eleven it was people like Tom Daschle who was a Democrat\nI mean these terrorists want to push a political agenda they don't care or or the target certain people because there are about to make certain decisions and so there are getting the president of course they're talking to president for what reason Ted Cruz\nStill or we'll let the or the other guys I mean this this is something I put together today I mean first of all I came into work that I wasn't feeling well I haven't been fully mob and dealing with\nSome sort of a respiratory thing\nWe don't have a right to avoid that rice boiled thing but it's just going to be very hard today and I was in the middle of writing a brilliant brilliant piece you're going to be here this sometime this week\nAbout a a more and more and drama and aliens and pride and a planet X. so I'm I'm hinting at something that I was working on today a masterpiece I'm hoping but ah they're all in this came up uh I I saw this and a couple of news director said well you're talking about this because you called it\nAnd says well I ... but you know I don't know I I don't know if this is really it they said well you said biological attack and rice it as a biological a poison is derived from a castor beans and I said oh yeah when it comes from is Kathy Castor oil he says yeah they'll accident and I said okay\nSo I said OK yeah with this and then Alex Jones is on the phone with us and he was saying well maybe we could talk about this and then he got sick so that I'm supposed to go on his show later on this week so it's just that it can massive confusion\nBut see that's the way it is when something like this happens and you don't have a mainstream consensus that you can play from your plane from the the information you got and all the information that we've been reporting before the event\nSo what you're saying yeah you're seeing a ... you saw the event before the cause and now here we have a a retro causality happening\nWhere you're finally hearing that yes there was an attack it was a biological attack on certain members of certain leaders and leadership a military presidential and also a Senator Cruz so there we go\nAnd and and the race in that I mean when I was reading on ... which you know or or whatever other sources CDC I saw on line I mean that this actually I'm surprised they haven't tried this a little more I mean it sounds that sounds scarier than the anthrax thing\nIt it it does if it's a big does it it can kill you but sometimes when it was not a big enough doses it doesn't have to kill you you can go through the um the sick feeling in the in the flu and then what they do is they have to give you drugs to comfort is it gets through your system\nAnd I'm I'm beginning to wonder if what happened on that Emirates plane was exactly a rice and test to see what our how our ... yeah well I mean it was the same I mean think about it if you're on a plane and everybody is complaining of flu symptoms fever chills sneezing coughing a pneumonia like symptoms or whatever\nAnd you're wondering how is this maybe one or two people on the plane may have been sick and then a whole level of a plane gets sick and then a whole level or doesn't get sick\nAnd you're wondering how is this maybe one or two people in the play may have been sick and then a whole level of a plane gets sick and then a whole level or doesn't get sick how did that happen happen because of a direct Dina function exercise\nBecause they were doing below below deck and and all those people were infected or at least affected by rice and maybe are socialized putting to the point\nRight yeah I mean it wouldn't take much putting the ventilation system that'd be it I mean\nThat'd be a small amount small droplets getting in there just to see if we are capable above you know getting a few people\nAffected by it and then uh whether or not they sneezing coughing spread it that would be another reason why some of the people were allowed to walk out of a hospital and ah and not have to face any treatment that would mean that they did not have the flu because they wouldn't have the people were contagious they wouldn't release them into the public\nRight yeah I mean the CDC stance I guess is that it's not I mean I guess people are asking that question is apparently because ... they were very clear on the CDC website that uh it's not contagious from person to person right um\nI ... the only other determination we can make with the symptoms that they showed\nWas that it was some sort of poisoning that happened to them would it be food poisoning or some other point being that ah everybody got it once but it gave them I mean I'm norovirus meet everybody would be nauseous and having the diary of perhaps\nBut this was copying sneezing watery eyes a you know a lungs feeling heavy tightness in the chest all the symptoms of rice and exposure\nWell ... ... ... you know it's fascinating but the thing is that you were talking about castor oil I I just it's so fascinating to me that I mean a lot of Canada so I'm not a medical professional as electrician or how long the hell is dead you can have\nA castor oil which you're basically for what I read real quick you press beans and you get this oil but you can you can drink the oil as a as a lax it is but right don't get the rights of poisoning but I just get it from eating the mash\nYeah well that's ... that's the beauty of chemistry right now tested or do you you can you can have a big old spoonful of castor oil to put you in the bathroom for the whole day or you can uh you can have a you know the powder they'll put you in the hospital for maybe a month so\nThere you go [laughter] beauty of chemicals raise it any way been thank you for the call which I Do daycare ... except for three thirty seven hundred ... six seven three thirty seven hundred isn't this just bizarre the way all this goes down\nAnd how the timing is everything in how we were talking about this what for months weeks

that happened it was around the September eleventh my socks with Alex Jones and then behind that and all that things went down ... back to clay decks if you want\nEven listen to the show arrows play

Bush had a huge ...\nI don't know how like cause they say\nOh yeah he's ... he's been making calls because he knows cabin on his vouchers for cabinet [noise] I I think that maybe you could make a difference in Washington but as far as the court of public opinion I think that we're so we're so I'm uninformed about all of it\nAnd ah and we're in our party lines are are mesmerizing us in and creating this this ah this bias situation where whatever happens no one will be happy and you will certainly see probably the repercussions of this over time if not the same day or days afterwards for protests will be having there will be some fighting going on I'm sure\n\nYou bet thank you I mean yeah I'm well I'm used to it I mean you've probably sell Clyde you're overreacting now I mean when you get on a train you know with a bunch of women wearing pink cats one morning and wondering what's going on\nOr when you have to plan your day around riots or when Ron and I have to get hotel rooms in the middle of the night because the whole city smells of tear gas uh yeah you get pretty used to it and the and the bombs bursting in air I mean we're like on the sixth floor I mean yeah Ron can tell you the story about hamburger runs\nYou know so here we are we're late at night were told by the bus or we're gonna have to report on the riots in downtown Portland and all the staff is hungry and I said well we could order pizza no not going to order pizza because the delivery guys won't come to the right areas\nSo what does Ron do he knows of a place he does have a food cart nearby that sells burgers he goes down to get burgers he's coming up and he has a whole bag and burgers within our officers stops him and says to him what the hell are you do what he says I got a talk show host\nIt's up to St Louis the cop knows who I Am because I got to get the burgers have declined the staff because they're all hungry so just what Ron walks past the cop caught fire as a flash bang into the air and an almost that brings the poor guy I mean you're yeah port run you know getting everybody hamburgers and he's happy 'cause he's\nThe gunfire and the bombs and then some ... decide they're gonna blow something up over his head and we're right\nThe window is like six four so whatever was shot up ... heard here so I got the the less of it but he got the most of it\nAnd so you know yeah we we're we're right in the middle of it that's why I guess you do you call the show ground zero 'cause we're right in the middle of it at all when it goes down\nAnd then we see how you know the crowds act and how they react so anyway ah\nYou know be be ready for anything tomorrow and I'm not saying they're you know the world is going to blow up I'm not saying the world's going to end tomorrow or asteroids looks like a ... going to hit us no I'm not saying that I'm not declaring the world ending but what I'm saying is be prepared for anything be prepared for detours in traffic be prepared\nYou know just be prepared to deal with anything that may come down even if that that test tomorrow to Eighteen ... pm eastern time sends a message of hey we're in the middle of something\nYou know take some time to evaluate the truthfulness and awareness of what they said and know\nThat you've been prepared for this you are prepared for whatever's coming you're prepared to shelter in place if you need to you're prepared to make your plans but if you're going to be separated from your family in the middle of the city you know to prepare yourself no where you can go where you can save it to wait for the
