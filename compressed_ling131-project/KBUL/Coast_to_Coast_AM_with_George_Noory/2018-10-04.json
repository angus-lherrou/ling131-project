I met a lot of really beautiful people from Arkansas\nAnd it always it always strikes me as somebody who is a free wing neither blue or red and my ah in my tribal political identity that seems to be polarizing the country as your report\nSaid worse than ever before um but when I actually go out of mind blue range into the red range of Americans I meet really decent beautiful people who and I listened to them and I can see\nSo much potential if people would just stop listening to this ratings the rating the horrors of of a mainstream news\nAnd just wouldn't talk to each other\nThey don't talk anymore John that's no problem nobody touch screen they argue but I've\nActually found the people in the red states more willing to talk than I Do the people around me who call themselves progressive [noise]\nAnd I live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington state and uh it's uh it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together a\nA this forecast which is the main s\nBut the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together a\nA this forecast which is the main essay at the end of ten predictions twenty eight team that you just mentioned and uh I was just reading it again after many months\nAnd I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put in is a that was basically is happening is\nA a level of if you're gonna defined it in planets there's two major planets and astrology and political strategy either play right now one is a is Iran is and just recently come into tours\nAnd then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn Saturn long story short it's a struggle Iran is finds itself in the ... sign which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations whereas\nThe the earth the sign of Capricorn Saturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short it's it it favors\nThe establishment ... more than it favors those who are resisting the establishment\nUm because Iran has in horses in its fall and it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least\nComfortable sign that it's translating through now last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into tourists it did two major changes in political astrology it brought the German Third Reich into being under adult Hitler\nAnd it also uh aged Franklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to\nDestabilize established a banking ideas and things that were restructured that in in a positive sense created a this this longest a profitable wealth a period of the ... in history [noise]\nAh that happened because of the reforms of the banks those reforms have slowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms and Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same kind of demographics of the of the separation between the fuel all the and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth\nIs almost exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nAnd so we are repeating a cycle and uh so the the issue is their Iran as if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in Iran is in the fall the revolutionary the innovator the person with the original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the current situation in the White House and it is a it is expressing itself with great passion and unpredictability button\nIts negative it's about destroying from getting the house by\nGetting the Senate back but for what it's not really defined itself\nIs what we know what the resistance is against when I hear it all every day here because I live in the very heart of it sure uh but but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if and if you follow this pattern with much more energy\nI remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said don't go a Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six I was on a show in Portland [noise]\nFive hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man who had a meltdown said you're absolutely crazy that can happen and of course four years later I said well no it will happen because if you're ... anybody\nBut Bill Clinton you're you're you're you're\nFundamentally a you don't have anything to replace him except your one term down and then\nAnd it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before at least at least and and it's being I mean it's being the people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media news\nThat it is really quite and this classic um Iran is confusion and its fall and\nTourists you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud or something it's a muddy place a swamp the muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come and save you from yourselves\nAnd you know I've been how long long time first with art and then with the huge orange I've been\nTalking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it is really at hand now it's um\nIt's not going to be when I look at when I look at the situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where Iran is this going retro grades it's back going backwards in in the sky which means that it's a time to recollect where you've been and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world [noise]\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving tourists around or just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day and starts backtracking into aries\nNow what that means is that if if red voters threat American voters go to the polls early especially in other areas which will be in early times\nOn hold on for a second John already at the break we'll come back and we'll talk more about this will get into some of his top ten forecasts for this year\nShe how close she's coming and uh also march twenty third you're living in Everett, Washington just circled on dates for two thousand Nineteen will tell you about that later to [noise]\nDot com and since by now that the U.S all the all access if it's not ... it's just a hoax\nThe backyard looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding adept to no one could contractors why don't you just ask comb

and you get a number of different vendors and names and ah they're all qualified and pick the one you want but\nSuperb workers by the way John ... with us as we talk about prophecy predictions John we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen productions how many have come true already\n[noise] well uh there have been a number of the more the most shocking and then my my ate proxy what I did is is basically short um chapters that takes a theme and then look at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines of of of the ten real quick\nYes they they were the the definition of the year being the year of acceleration\nUh definitely things have intensified that way the second prophecy was ah Iran is in the last ... style that looked at a play between Iran and Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground\nBut that petered out by may ...\nAnd that seemed [laughter] and in a way where there was also the third prophecy Wiltshire\nUh not in twenty eight team and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise] uh I've always said that both candidates and twenty sixteen were afflicted a astrological early both\nHad the danger of not or if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means leave office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this but that they could leave and scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January [noise]\nSo uh it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before that the first half of the day goes to the red states and the red voters say get out early vote early\nIndeed is really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house of representatives\nWill uh see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon\nSo it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see an eleventh hour or close to the polls a turnaround so with that um you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I was simply say about President Trump that\nIf he survives this um these two years he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president ... what's what's so hard for the polarized people\nIn my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly watching this and try and taking notes yeah taking off and it's like I mean literally is a large family members and other things are are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm\nGoing well [noise] um every everybody watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in the fall and tourists uh they're they're they're just watching the news and there's assuming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both\nSides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the little blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats that really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until sixth year if he's a two term president according to my interpretation of the strategy they're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge\nAlso the other thing that uh once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical vote I said\n... million strong you know I said ten months before Trump was elected I said\nThe the big upset could happen through their um and so it's it's my sense is that there will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving it's almost like it's it's a musical chairs that we've had before where\nIt's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats the same number of seats just switching back and forth\nIs to create any significant legislative advance so it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more this functional than anything we've seen before\n... units almost unbearable no well it's\nI I hate to say it to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not the end of this this this crisis that's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states and the world\nIs just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually think of a way to get out of this merge and it's going to have to get much worse and frankly astrology are saying that\nThey're not going to see a a tide shift until the middle of the next decade when we're\nWe're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this prevail\nYet we're not even close it's going to get much worse in what's going to happen and it was kind of brings me to the issue of Kavanaugh and all this all the fighting about that [noise]\nIs it I said very clearly in my back in August eleventh in my article send that Kavanaugh would be picked\nThat um [noise] I I think people are stabbed pushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not the thing they should be looking at according to their needs [noise]\nIf you look at cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think really the way it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme\nCourt no I don't think so why a lot but I\nTell you these this time with the Iran is and Saturn the defining planet so next year and into twenty twenty\nThese these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two major corporate establishment will power that\nYou're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote a hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see this creeping coup d'etat of corporate uh hedging money which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's or sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent citizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened\nAnd so it's possible that after twenty twenty with the American people or more of the working people people start really starting to get riled up about situation a there will be basically in a completely corporate control the United states [noise] and so that's\nThat's my call I Hope I'm wrong I Wish I was more [laughter]\nRecently were on the History Channel really you know the so called the last poll the Catholic Church of course has been under fire for all kinds of atrocities leading ...\nHe and uh it was um [noise]\nIt was a unique experience and and it's put me in a position that that show [noise] uh I mean to you have to kind of talk about something that happened uh for my own sake of credibility I I'm Sorry I even\nThis show [noise] uh shook you're talking about the last poll that young you know\nThe the the the show basically circled in the second

is as worse as bad as the gift shop all in Germany and terrorize the people as one of the reasons why the Islamic\nThat's why they turn the shah revenge really\nYes and so so this bad karma here and we're basically blindsided to our side uh in this and we need to take a look at how we kind of gotten here comic ally\nNow so so we have a situation with ... which really got me concerned in August where it's the last province where fifty thousand al ... affiliates who we've been supporting\nCity in Syria for\nSyria yeah we're going to make their last stand against the Syrian Arab Army and the Russian air force and the Turks were also involved what happened in eleventh hour just before it started\nIs um ... organ of turkey the president of turkey and ladder improved and\nGot together and made a pact to not do the offensive to create a buffer zone a demilitarized zone and take the time to do something to help the people the three million people half of which are are are\nAre refugees all crowd that area\nPeople the three million people half of which are are are are refugees all crowd that area ... ... what's good about that is it's it's an attempt to not to have this thing happened\nI Know from my sources that there were a lot of uh the ... film the White Helmets into our basically al ... is a A R [noise]\nUh had already taken children and use them and some gassing attack that's the story I'm trying to track down\nAnd they were going to be broadcast is still as he started as a once again another false flag that Syrian regime had chemically weaponized them and that would have caused ah [noise] you know we have thirty Russian warships says this time around\nAnd the uh near equal number of American ships crowding the eastern Mediterranean long story short we have a lot of military potential in a tight area that if a miscalculation happen it could get serious\nAnd and so and then one thing can lead to another into a nuclear confrontation I mean the missiles of\nThe missiles of October in sixty two can become the missiles of October twenty Eighteen or twenty Nineteen\nThis strategy kind of points to and some of the deadlines Nostradamus gave to along in a short deadline if if we kind of move up what maybe the official start of the Cold War\nWhen the Russians announce they achieved a parity in March first this year they delayed they're putting delayed his address to the nation Russia and then he so he could see what was the military changes the rules of engagement was going to happen with the Americans\nHe I I actually quoted a lot of this speech and it shows it's very interesting look at how we've been in an arms race again with Russia because we pulled out of the ab a missile treaty\nAnd which was a seriously destabilizing move to unilaterally do it for a long story short they had to create a new system of of weapons that could be a deterrent to us surrounding Russia's steadily with a anti ballistic missile batteries\nTo basically be able to shoot down their missiles so they couldn't defend themselves\nA very very destabilizing move a Harley report and\nSo the Russians declared in March first is pretty much we're in this Cold War and they have now made a parity you know interestingly enough fruit and drops ten billion dollars off the eighty billion dollar budget of the Russian defense\nThe same time Trump adds another thirty seven billion to something that's past seven hundred billion if you add the other sides to it were really spending one point one trillion dollars [noise]\nUh on defense spending in our military ironically it's half of what the US people produce monetary lead GDP every year which is exactly what happened at the same time when the Soviet Union collapsed\nIt was paying half of its money into its big military and they collapsed we're doing the same thing so\nUh it's it it reminds me of prophecies of ... to the spirit was channeled by studio ... who was considered the Swedish Edgar Casey in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd um because he channeled similarly in France and he ... he would say things like guy you'll see the one side you know the Cold War over there and Russia have become more free in America would become more like the Soviet Union\nIt cannot accent [noise] that's true ah with more censorship it's happening to alternative voices you know the that's also I Would say from my own experience with journalism that we're definitely looking more and more like Soviet Union I grew up with than the country I grew up with\nNo that's not true in in ... in the last minutes we before the break them will take final calls next half hour you're writing a book about celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain who committed suicide and that this this intrigues me why are you doing this\n[noise] well I've been watching\n... since two thousand five I've learned so much about his unique rebellious but really an\nUnorthodox way of kind of\nDragging me along to see

we'll get to your calls in just a second I just have one more area to talk with John about it and he's writing a book about the lead celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and\nBoy you sparked my interest John because it sounds like you had a very a similar situation what happened\nI did it's really a a tale of two suicide a and both of us committed suicide the reason I Am speaking to you is because\nMy experience with suicide was a spiritual suicide rather than the usual what I call mundane suicide most people encounter\nUm basically in the mundane suicide I contend that you end up with your pain destroying the body mind the journal that you're mystery of Seoul is living in but in the suicide that\nHappened to me rather than the one that I was in the mundane league going to do [noise] I saw my misery and my pain commit suicide and I remained\nAnd so this is one of my most intimate autobiographical tales of the whole other dimensions of my life\nOf all these years I've never known this way I was I was I was walking\nCalifornia I just come back from India and I was still in the tender opening kind of broke out of my shell of\nMany lives being with my my teacher in India for the first time and when I came back in the world the world that was not a place that supported this kind of individual flowering and it was having a very bad day\nAnd so I was walking down this beautiful beautiful a golf course adjacent to the trailer park I Lived in\nA overlooking Santa Catalina island in San Pedro cliffs and that's what I was walking it just dawned on me as I could just keep walking a beyond these cliffs and plummet down three hundred feet into the rocks and I was going to do it because suddenly\nIce had this amazing unexpected experience of life and death suddenly being very tangible unclear I have to see how they're really one there really there are plenty of compliment trees or in our fear they're a play of terror and opposites\nBut what was happening to me the feeling was that try to describe it but it's beyond words really beyond belief\nIndeed it was like um it was descending on me faster than myself and I thought okay this is happening because I have made the decision to throw myself walk over this cliff\nIf I turn away from this I'm going to lose this amazing experiences overtaking me this mystery of life meeting death\nSo I saw this little eucalyptus tree and I sat\nUp against and I said okay for throwing myself over I just wanted to feel this\nAnd take this with me over the edge and so I sat there just going inside and feeling it at some point I felt this electrical energy just rise above the ground through the roots of the tree and throw me forward face down into the crab grass or I just began sobbing sobbing and suddenly\nAll of that thank God all of that yes all of that otherwise I wouldn't be killing ... no not at all and uh\nAnd and there was this moment after I cried it all out I turned and there was a little eucalyptus trees and it was just shivering it sleeves and the Santa Ana wind and it was just this moment where I realized the sky the earth tree existence love me existence sees\nEverything that's created out of it as a phenomenal creation rising and falling as something absolutely integral significant [noise]\nAnd I had this feeling that so much of what society does to make us feel insignificant when you go in even at that moment of life meeting death insignificant becomes in significant\nI it's so the story is really an ... it's a it's a jump from what I usually right about but it's a whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did the ... is a book back in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSometimes my these books you see I I don't write these books they right they use me to write themselves and\nI had no idea until Anthony Bourdain died\nHow deeply he his his suicide how much he was loved and how many many people were shocked in the story I talk about the moment that inspired me to write this book I'm In a cashiers line\nAnd there's this old lady and she's doing something looks like she's never done before she's pulled actually a magazine out of Iraq and looks at it and it's a little people magazine of an seaboard Dane and I watched how she touched his cheek on that\nWas so intimate and beautiful and that's when I realized yeah I Love him just as much and I think I think I understand what he was going through he was not a man to believe or in fairy tales and imaginary stuff and that\nSanta Claus is going to save him from his sons and all that it's really pretty practice and and and and people like that when they die and I always feel there's a person that has the potential to become a an awakening one\nAnd I as I have been in my private life which I'm sharing more and more now in this period especially now when there's so much turmoil when there's so much\nUm Hangst and polarity\nMy inner life now as a meditate or is now coming more and more into my work because it is is still ...\nPoint this center of silence in peace in the cycle of life that's becoming stronger and stronger that is what I can share with all of you as meditation the science\nOf self observation\nIs is what what more and more I always thought my my work with evil more and more and it's still prophetic but it's going to have more of my own authority through my own experiences\nSo huge on let's take some calls here in the ten minutes we got left Thomas in Iran with John Home Tom\nHi George thank you for taking my call and John while it's hard to follow your sharing of your experience on that but my question John yes for our person don't walk in the world to be a participant in the world\nHow can they develop their own centered ness so to speak such that they are not enough for dead on a dead on touch my personal and planetary astrology\nWell what I can only suggests and I think only anyone who's honest and heart to heart with anybody is all I can suggest as my own experiences the meditation techniques that I've been using since Nineteen eighty [noise]\nAnd uh so my answer to that is if any of you listening to this resonate with what I've been saying [noise]\nEspecially with the issue of suicide in life meeting to [noise] um I Am on a path where I can say there is a way to look\nBeyond and not be touched you can be passionate and deeply into life but you're not overwhelmed ... you can be a Buddha and the market place but not of the marketplace of the world\nAnd that was what my teacher taught oh show and that is

kills everything from the inside the building that left standing perfectly damage at all and I believe that's how these demons wanted destruction in any form to any human I mean ... I mean look at every single country hate each other out there they're ready to bomb each other for almost nothing but anyway real quick towards my dad moved to New Jersey\nI think in my career as a special ed teacher\nOr ice that work with kids who didn't have any qualities attributes of characteristics that normal people\nHave this war began to feel like I was blessed George ... or you had to work with these kids who appreciate that that's when I started trying to pay back but just being\nThey feel like I was blessed George ... ah you had to work with these\nKids who appreciate that that is when I started trying to pay back\nFor just being normal so I started a prayer life I always had a prayer life but I saw it apparently this is a prerequisite for white had this ...\nI mean it's for kids that had nothing going from I even had some kids in my classes\nHad these terrible Kansas and I would draw for them and they always they want the joy so that would give them like coloring books in crayon and they would try so hard to keep those those those are ... that the ... in in the lines are with the numbers more but some of them has says terrible if your Kansas say they would\nRule follow insurance or coloring they withdrew their mouth is rule of law was in school you were at\nWell I was I was ... yeah I mean the special ed teacher had different classes you know and just happened to be in these classes it was yeah children like that okay\nI but I Will be cleaned it up for them it was nothing to rule because they did that all day long so that didn't mean anything to them er and er so yeah the anti but you know where they were learning the skills that they were never going to use or you know there was no real cure for them back to and even today just really no cure\nSo as a special ed teacher had a lot of time in my hand and the kids need to two hours for lunch with the teacher said would help feed them uh there's no papers to correct the bigger kids that had in the ... in the room\nUsed to move back as long as I enrolled us you know when you see a tractor trailer pull up to a warehouse and they put out there was a sign role is when you put the boxes on him to shut them down and you know there's a lot of them don't you know\nYeah so this is me this go supplied I enrolled lives in my class sideline up the kids I take to\nTell the kid get it box put it on the island world he was flooded down to the next kid they because they would open it up to slow down to the next year they put something in and fly down to the next ... tape and you know so that's what they did so I had plenty of time\nSo George I know how to Boston so I said\nBought tend to the nightclubs and I believe this is a real prerequisite of what why they steam and came to this house we doing\nTwo jobs John\nYeah I mean it is that thing especially that they didn't take up much of my time at a two hour lines I didn't have papers to correct you know so I decided you know it gets going to do this too so um\nYeah so uh uh ... you know people at night and then look at\nAll I Know a lot of um real estate and the people but there was a certain percent of people out in the dark side of things these people are like little wicked have looking for a cause\nTo alcohol or drugs or commit adultery looking for anything they can get their hands on and a good portion of these people were atheists they went to the coast a little bit\nMe George I can get along with anybody I can relate to anybody and this type of behavior didn't even bother me factor but she went over the years I noticed that a lot of these people die from\nAccidents like car accidents overdoses suicide Kansas and ... and I bought it with these people in ... and I knew them you know\nBut I felt that these people like ships in the night without a rider anyway\nI Would take him to do with the wind was blowing that was fine with them and they died in the state that I thought nobody should die\nWho were the last rings unusually high\nYeah unbelievable and so um yeah I just didn't think\nThey knew how to live I mean that's another thing this book is going to the teacher has it teaches you the nose I self you know knows I sell me says I'm not trying to be somebody else knowing their self means do you the truth about you you are what they do look at what you'd do analyze what you do it and analyze what you believe about yourself you may find that it's completely different person here\nI mean I had one friend I tried to get through this quick because I Know we want to get into the ah his name is Chris he was a boss and he worked right alongside and he was an atheist and the used to make fun of God used to make fun as you just used to make fun of the Virgin Mary\nI smoke and drank every night seven nights a week\nHe didn't feel well\nWent to visit a doctor and he found you're already had four states can't oh so he couldn't work anymore so I tried to visit in between my you know going from the school\nAre we work together I mean it was like a friend you know I Know you had all these problems but you didn't know what I Know he had this for about forty years in a\nIn a few months and he died within a few months but I like to visit them and I would try to talk to him about God but he wasn't interested at all and he was even more vision now George because if a diagnosis\nHe had died he died and such a terrible state he died in a state no one should die and uh I I felt like helpless form now\nIn my relationships were told that people fall into hell like snowflakes from the sky especially there's no one to pray for them\nSo I started praying for him and all these other people that I knew in bonded with and they felt they were friends of mine and they would ask Scott you know don't send these cells to hell that unless you go to hell until I finished praying for them no matter how long ago it gives me on this planet no matter how many grains of sand they still got less than an hour glass that's what I was going to do\nAnd I believe now that was the prerequisite of why this demon creature this compelled to possess my house and a bill that mosaic fill your piece by piece right down there every single detail\nNo when we get really into will let me ask you this little John do this demon follow you to the house basically or was it already there\nAbsolutely not you know the audience absolutely not I've never had like a and I've never you know I never ... invited to speak to here I never had to say on I never use a week he bought more and I never use terror card I mean I I Believe that opens the door for creature like this to come in and then also just anybody\nDoes that because I now I think\nIf you allowed to speak to to come in hill to harm I think he's permit him to do was worse you know the only other time it has\nNo there's no doubt if you view invited in each coming\nYeah that's what I Believe now but you did in my mind which is\nAbsolutely not true as I've learned a lot from it I learned that it is and has a methodology will ... will discuss that too but the only other really other time [noise] ah well you know I felt that I worked at night so that's why I wrote that book anyhow that's the best selling book and then if you're interested in any of that do have some funny stories about the rapid Chris\nBrown that's that's the topic we don't touch me down what we we don't we don't get into that topic oh okay [laughter] so anyway\nPeople in only one who to was basically what you've seen on the outside but go ahead\nYeah okay so the only other time that I ever\nKnew about a person who encountered the demon that I Believe it was because my brother my brother Paul he we had this a rare a if a blood disease that runs in the family and my my dad was unfortunate to get it and it kills them very early in the sixties had a heart attack and died at the same\nDay I'd rather it was unfortunate for you to get it\nAre you OK gets that she has me are you are right yeah what was the blood disease\nOh I haven't I I've been checked with that yeah oh yeah or the doctor who well let me tell you what happened to pull you and I'll tell you so poorly wakes up and he has the same symptoms my dad had chest than say dollars nine one one they ... they come and they take 'em to the hospital\nAnd at the hospital he died in a hospital bed and when I went to visit them later on he says to me John ... you know and I heard that he died on hospital bed that's what the doctors told me sit down and when I died on a hospital that I left my body he said I left my body and I watched that doctors\nFrantically and then there are at least trying to get me back to life again specific belated not uncommon needles and\nAnd the alarms going off and he said like when I talk about that fifth fifth dimension that spiritual dimension he stepped into that for him and he was still so he's still thought he was in a hospital room because he could see what was going on with his body they said isn't that hospitable he said to me\nHe was still so he still thought he was in a hospital room because he could see what was going on with his body\nIsn't that hospitable to make it\nAnd it and then there was a dark side of that Rami said and Davis came from a small team is not like big ones like three for for for ... to me and it was grabbed me and was starting to pull me into that dark area of the room which I which I say to because they are they all left them type and I believe that's where we overlap him\nJust imagine and ah they were dragging him into that talks romance and I finally got back to life he was able to get back into his body\nAnd he said to me Johnny why didn't seem to come on that's really the fate of a person that you know I don't understand ... why would even call me and I was like boy I really don't know\nUh I don't know if anybody would no I Know that you know all of us are right at the same way like I said you know got religion ... confirmed in our religion\nHe was too but he dropped out and okay I have to go to church anymore okay he met a woman he didn't really married what okay again I tell them you know you got kids or you never get them or religion could anyone of your kids even recite one one prayer\nMaybe it's probably not\nWell I well I don't know

really a bad person I mean okay he left his religion like we talked and then he he lived at home he didn't get married for any rate has kids they didn't have a religion so\nUh you know I felt that

nurses running back and forth sticking things my aunt and they could hear the alarms going off ...\nBut he wasn't that like that they mentioned that overlapping dimension I guess and he said there was like a duck part of that room which probably never was there when he was in the hospital but when he was in that overlapping to mention there he said they came for him and he asks me well why didn't even count man I was like for [laughter] I really don't know why\nWhy you know I just don't know how to explain that either I I never had this problem I never had a problem like this before uh before I had to say I've ever seen in my house\nBut um I Wonder about it a lot but he's a a like a completely one hundred and eighty degrees turn man he's a very religious man now\nLose experience scared the heck on every move in\nA can of it but I Believe it I mean to actually\nBe dying dying and then\nYou know leave your body that something is going to remember how may still young guy only like forty years old he's got a lot of life ahead of her but he now has a very religious person\nBut uh he encountered this statement but the one that I can deal with a very different like I tell you the ...\nYou know what was the first episode for huge on the ... demon showed up what\nThey okay so let me explain to I live in New Jersey like the middle of New Jersey right in the ... area I have a house that sounded like an acre\nFarm Hoboken argue\nAbout forty five of them that's a good hour though oh are you from Hoboken\nEnough no she's not sure what to do [laughter]\nOh yeah well I was born in Brooklyn I thought that far from home\nBut now I live in New Jersey so oh yeah so I just wanted to say because I had a best selling book I was able to retire and I didn't have to work with those I Love those kids believe me but I ... I I stopped working but may not have to wear\nJust wanted to say because I had a best selling book I was able to retire and I didn't have to work with those I Love those kids believe me but I ... I I stopped working but may not have to work at ... I guess you just stop\nAnd I stopped ... bartending at night and I love bartending at night but er and that but I stopped but I still know about those people and they still pray for those people and that's a big ... big prerequisite of why I had to separate Russia so now I'm In New Jersey now so I'm doing fine I have a very uh elaborate prayer life\nUh I I retired from my by my job as a special ed teacher retires that not working at\nNight and I miss those people a lot too and I have this nice house and it's on like ... okay\nAbout a hundred and fifty feet from the street is on a hill you come in to the house and yet the the garages are under the house and you fill your car and to the left and you go into the garage descendants the back door the as you come into the garage\nAnd in between the garage George and the basement is this big indoor\nAnd other ... I had three boys here growing up and I think a little bit bigger they wanted to a little more room so I had the basements finished and uh I cut it in half and I had the apartment bills down near so my first wife that's all he wants to more space he moves down there yeah you have your own interest\nYou pull your own spawn come and go as you want to say yes yes it was\nNice so then he goes to college and he moves out second boy wants to parliament and so he takes it he goes to college and moved out my third boy he wants at a farm and he ... he was in there he he was he had this whole time so he's a U.S and when I had\nThe he was smart one free room [laughter]\nYeah well I didn't mind you believe that we have this big house and then like when he he he went to college he moves out but he got a job\nAnd then he said you know can I moved back home I just want to start my own business as they come back home because I mean we get it's a big house and my wife has this empty nest syndrome sure you know what I mean so I like having to a company to you know these somebody to come upstairs and have dinner with you once in a while and when he was telling me wasn't home that much but he's moved out since then you've got a great often he took his but anyway he's here the whole time\nSo that the upstairs and so in the basement\nYou come in that that ... that go up to the kitchen\nWas a big kitchen the okay if you're in the kitchen you can almost hear that door open and close and then next to the kitchen is living ... most of the time George and uh that's what I like I\nI go to the gym in the morning then I meditate in the afternoon I meditate in at night and meditate so I have a pretty long for a life that I took I did get back to my artwork because I Am good as as as a small little town that God gave me you know so uh I'm doing that and everything's fine to it for years and I've been praying for the last cells that I felt will last cells\nEvery day for years and I like I said I'm going to do that until whatever time I have left here so everything's fine\nYeah and then a bank yeah\nSo then yeah I'm saying I'm sitting in the liver and that I into a downstairs by myself and I hear that I enjoy like slam lucky\nYou normally wouldn't even hear it from in the in the living room but I hear it's slim like it never was slammed before and I'm thinking to myself\nAnd you know somebody's open\nOh absolutely you in the house to twenty five years you know every noise in the house you know\nSo I'm thinking I said what what did I say I don't think my wife could even if she came home and ... like I don't even think getting slammed the door that hard and maybe my son can I don't know why he would do that unless you had a car accident or with the girlfriend broke up with them or something like that so I'm thinking what is that I get up I go to\nThe kitchen I looked downstairs usually when somebody comes in down near the puts up with the lights on so still talk to you so I go into the boys\nI have a a surveillance system here I said look into the cameras and they roll back the cameras ten Fifteen twenty minutes I said nobody was on the property I look at the cameras that face the garage doors nobody nobody open those garage doors and look at the camera the faces that store in the back nobody went through the backdoor\nAnd er which you don't you just heard it open\nNo like slant I didn't know what at the time there was ever going to discuss this this creature was using as a methodology army and had a method it wasn't it was telling me that wasn't here for the social call that wasn't passed them through with\nNo explain that in a minute so I go I look in the cameras nobody was on a property in the basement I got\nI got bars on the windows but you can get out as a you know if there was a fire in a house or you just on lock them and jump out do so I Know he couldn't get anybody if somebody was trespassing I couldn't see them so I go I turn the lights on in the basement I go down to the basement and it's not looking everywhere\nYou you're pretty convince you think somebody's in the house don't you\nOh absolutely absolutely\nBut I the only problem is but when I'm looking around I feel like I've been in the past twenty five years I feel if menacing sinister I'm In is like the only word to describe this like evil like an\nEvil then I ...\nYeah I'm looking everywhere I look down the steps and like any where somebody could squeezed himself into behind a washer and dryer in my son's room underneath his bed in his closet you know and the furnace who am I look I look at my frantic look and I still have this horrible feeling [noise]\nSo I'm thinking well I I Know I looked at from satisfy looking to the cameras nobody came and nobody broken but I still have this really menacing finished the feeling that come upstairs and I sit down\nAnd I'm thinking about it and then I you know and then all of a sudden I hear\nThis wedding steps between the basement and and and and the kitchen and here's something that really heavy because like I\nCan hear when my wife comes up to ... a hundred and twenty pounds my son comes up to ... hundred and Seventy found I Know what those steps down like\nWhere I guess something very silly crossing those steps and thinking to myself I just shut down you know nothing was here ... coming up\nYeah I feel something very heavy slowly coming up the staff I get up again I go over that I look there's nobody there so I'm thinking\nWe were you harmed her own armed at this time\nI I have I have a a registered gun you know you do okay [laughter]\nBut I but I didn't see anything so you know what I mean I looked in the cameras that looked through the cameras if I were to fill us something then I I I didn't feel like a you know\nBut I don't think I kind of I was wondering if that had that feeling of something very menacing sinister and I think it is but could this possibly see but then I tried to shake it off to us because he like I'm just the guy I don't think that's you know the skin\nAnd ... were you convinced that there was this creature demon in the house\nOr when it actually I actually had the ... but I Want to try to build up to that before actually tell\nMe we're running out of the time we get to really you know\nOh ... or do we have another hour though you were to ... an hour\nOh okay so okay so my wife comes home he said if it's the first thing she says she comes in is like a a\nJustice to this country and it's become patently obvious to everybody and it's very

back John ... with us between loving hate Israel talked about the double our final segment of calls you on Long Island New York's with us Hey Joe go ahead\nYeah Hi John uh that sounds like the description of the devil you are that great issue a ... it's almost similar to something in the book of revelation\nThe devil you are that great issue a ... is almost similar to something in the book of revelation but I Want to a rope eight proverbs chapter seven to this\nUh it's it's really using its it's talking about two won an improper chapter seven it's talking about\nA ... woman\nUh it says make wisdom your tense woman and understanding wisdom and understanding and light the wisdom on the tablet of the hall marked the wisdom on a tablet of the hard\nNow to me this is the anecdotes for the mark of the devil and the book of revelation or the beast\nYou know the six six six the anecdote for this is the wisdom of the lord\nA and it goes on to describe a strange woman now the strange woman is not really a strange woman it's just a metaphor for temptation and the devil and it talks about this woman\nSaid do sing men in the Knight ball her husband's away and uh and pricing them and then forcing them what flattering lips\nSo I think this is a vice a ... of the\nDevil where the initial lore is\nLike an enticement the devil is not gonna is gonna address the thing up as where it's not obvious that it's the devil and that as you get lord then it changes to a force play you're\nKind of in the jaw ... yeah yeah\nSo only later on this the devil revealed the true intentions what's going to really happen and forces that upon you so if you look at the\nBook of proverbs that directly were lights too I think what you're saying and I wonder John if your previous work in the bars somehow you picked up\nSome of these demonic entities\nWell that's an interesting possibility that have happened to your other ... your job as a bartender\nThat's possible I mean who who who really

talking about and that yeah that's it that's good advice and and uh who knows if this thing came out of it could be there I mean it could it could exist there and you know and like I said there are wicked people there and if someone were into the cold light of ... the U.S and uh hey who knows\nThem on the air John where do you get your book between loved indeed\nYeah between love and hey you go to John ... da da and that time\nOr to three hundred and fifty paid a a book\nI pressed the few buttons that we get it ah you know ... you'll understand your life purpose and it will transform your life ah as the ... you know if you really want to give you the gift of understanding of the unknown John de ... dot com or there's so many\nSo many things in this book if you if you really want a no no they sell it teaches you how to know that I saw this many other spiritual\nStories in this book that people say cry when they read them\nWell I'm just glad you got rid of the ... heart like Edgar Allan Poe\nTrue nervous very very dreadfully nervous I had been in them but why we see than I Am mad the disease had sharp and my sense is not destroyed the old though ... was the sense of hearing you\nI heard many things in hell how an MRI mad hearken and observe how helplessly how calmly I can tell you the whole story\nIt is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain but one's conceived\nIt haunted me day and night object there was none passion there was no one I Love the old man he had never wrong me he had never given me an insult for his gold I had no desire I think it was his eyes yes it was this\nHe had the eye of a vulture\nA pale blue eye with a film over it\nWhenever it fell upon me my blood Rand cold and so by degrees very gradually I made up my mind to take the life of the old man and PSAs\nWritten myself of the pie forever now this is the point you fancy me mad Mad Men no nothing but you should have seen me you should have seen how wisely I proceeded with what caution with what foresight with what the simulation I went to work\nI was never kinder to the old man during the week before I killed him at every night about midnight\nI turn the lack of his door and opened it oh so gently and then when I had made an opening sufficient for my head\nI put in a dark line through\nAll close close step no light show now\nAnd then I rushed in my head or you would have left to see how commonly I trusted in\nI moved slowly very very slowly so that I might not disturb the old man sleep\nIt took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed oh what a madman events so why is this and then when my head was well in the room\nI ended the lantern cautiously old so cautiously cautiously for the hinges creek\nI ended it just so much that a single than race fell upon the vulture by\nAnd this I did for seven long nights every night just at midnight but I found the ... always closed and so it was impossible to do the work\nFort was not the old man who ... me but he is evil lie and every morning when the day broke I went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him calling him by name and a hearty tone and inquiring how he has passed the night\nSo you see he would have been a very profound old man indeed to suspect that every night just at twelve I looked in upon him wildly slept\nUpon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious opening the door a watches emitted hand moves more quickly than did mine never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers of

tobacco buddies saw bad why they're setting up for the vote\nOn friday instead of Saturday So obviously we got the permission today\nBecause they have to have at least one ... to tell everybody was going to happen and so\nThe good thing is we haven't had anything bad happen today because of any decision but we did get the information said by the president on the phone as I said I'm as they said prepare for anything so this is what has happened basically uh I get the feeling that the FBI sent the information is as I said they would\nAnd then they're sitting up for a vote on friday and Saturday So I was wrong about Saturday or\nFriday yeah and ah I guess I'll have to look into whether or not they got the information also they found the guy\nWho actually sent the rice and which they now say was basically a castor beans or be sent caster beans\nThe Pentagon the guy was from Logan, Utah and uh\nOr send caster beans to the Pentagon and the guy was from Logan, Utah\nAnd a ... or actually he was in I think it was of Idaho but he sent them from Logan I'm not sure I'd say they're a lot of stuff has come in\nBut uh of course ah you know their redirecting\nEverything now everything was like panic the White House is under attack panic is a biological attack panic and then they turn around and said well it's now just caster beans\nSo it's not rice and its rice and beans it's ah\nIf hits\nWell cats are beans make rice and so yeah they got rice and it and say hey this is a way they can they\nTreated about they say president was attacked then they turn around and say well the president was attacked but it was with rice and beans and rice and then they say but we arrested someone who sent the rice and the they don't even know they didn't have the story straight\nThey don't have their story straight so that this is how you know if I'm reporting something in the in the mainstream media says well nothing happened today absolutely nothing happened today um but somebody did after they arrested the guy who allegedly set the rice and beans\nTo the presidents of the rest of the guy um he looks like McConnell Mitch McConnell is now setting up for the vote

stand on my Facebook page some documents that I got from the Senate Judiciary committee and they already had sent that message out yesterday that they were going to have a decision the FBI was going to the decision today so that's why I was able to tell you but there was also a Fox News report that said otherwise so they said that it was going to be a report today\nSo um you know take it for what it's worth information is information but it just seems like you know right now everything\nIs is there is like this intensity\nJust so you know putting putting you in that world for a minute because I just got this information and then a lot of people are like clamoring and calling and saying well ah oil was something that happened when they all alarm went off the phone well no not really I was at my friend when that happened\nUm [noise]\nAnd uh and and I got mine and he got his like about a minute after me and then runs that he didn't get his so be weren't getting their message is but I just thought it was kind of weird and it was scary actually to have this thing loudly beeping\nOr in the car with me today and uh it was ... it was the presidential emergency broadcast so we said it was going to happen but see\nJust because it doesn't happen on the same day doesn't mean that this isn't a trial run for what may happen and that's what I'm waiting for I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop I I'm waiting for as I say the final blow I'm waiting for because I sat on Alex Jones show I said you know it's going to be some sort of a\nI'm a terrorist\nOr or some sort of a a biological attack of some kind of what we had the biological attack but it wasn't as much as I thought it would be\nSomething new and it may be just a precursor to something bigger who knows maybe we'll have that discussion on that 'cause I discovered some things and as I said last night I had been writing\nThe most amazing show about [noise]\nWhat uh what's going on when NASA what's going on with a ... a city search for extraterrestrial intelligence [noise] this is putting us on the verge disappointing is right there were were on the verge close enough to be looking right at\n\nAnd of course everybody has a different opinion an idea of what the aliens wondering what they are from the new age to their demons to whatever and this is something that is not good because here's the deal\nWe appear to be interacting with an exceptionally\nPatient intelligence which despite its advantages over terrestrial science seems limited by a steadfast refusal to make it self widely known to everybody\nNow why is that\nWhy is it that if these aliens have any care whatsoever by the way I Would say well why do they intervene why don't they come to us why don't they make themselves known on the white has passed one\nWell there's a reason much like what we're doing with the other worlds that we explore when we go to Mars or when we spent Cassini out and do the job being system and when we do a number of things do we reveal ourselves\nYou reveal ourselves or do we send our robots to work for us we send our robots to do the work for us unless of course we decide\nYou reveal ourselves or do we send our robots to work for us we send our robots to do the work for us unless of course we decide for you know for reasons or to show up the Russians we decided to put man on the moon\nKnowing full well there's not bring up there or maybe there is something up there and we just haven't told anybody at right now so we don't know\nBecause they don't say\nExclude and we include\n\nBut yet we still see a half a century and stonewalling with regards to this topic\n\nAnd it seems we are interacting with a patient intelligent\nExceptionally patient and television\nRealized extraterrestrial intelligence chanting of their existence were trickled down or graduate forms of contact and this is evidence by theatrics sightings of large UFOs bright lights you name it\nThe majority of Americans and a lot of people around the world believe that something is out there many people\nHave seen and identified flying objects not necessarily objects that are piloted by aliens but objects they cannot identify\nStrange lights and this guy triangular craft platforms\nOther things that are just phenomenal is that no one can really put their finger on\nMany will agree\nThat we are still searching for answers and they're more information is needed especially beyond NASA scope and we can also agree with the Brookings Report is antiquated and you're either be dismissed or at least updated to include some of the more compelling findings\nDealing with extraterrestrial life\n\nWith the latest updates from NASA's Kepler Mission showing\nPotentially habitable worlds screw in a cross the gallery all knows where\n\nIt's becoming harder and harder to assert that we were alone in the universe and if and when we do encounter intelligent life forms we don't want to communicate with them which means we'll need some ... you know basis for understanding their cognition\nWe need to learn\nLinguistic contact or we need to learn mathematics or some sort of a like like in close encounters a third time they had a special no no no no no ... they had a special tone\nAnd in toning with a hand crap hand class for a hand wave or you know in contact or there were the um the strange creatures the spoken ...\nSee the study of biological life\nElsewhere in the solar system it's not the same as identifying anthropomorphic dealing grays or even ... versions of extraterrestrials we have to take into consideration that much of what\nWe speculated about extraterrestrial intelligence may not be fact\n\nLet me say that again we have to take into consideration that much of what\nWe've talked about all these years what we've been speculating about what has been exaggerated what has been a spike has met all these things concerning us Detroit will intelligence it may not be fact\n\nEspecially one analysis is that take human supernatural out of the equation new analysis\nI mean alien\nIt was people but now it's becoming more parents and they're not all that supernatural\n\nSo that takes the demon out of everything there is not supernatural then there's no reason to believe that any spiritual overtones or even comes with the alien equation something different something we've never even thought of maybe something's just obvious\nRight in front of it I mean it's not an argument as to whether or not these beings or demons or angels ... it's the practical approach of deciding that perhaps they are opposed biological and we explored this a\nStory for the concept in another show\nI mean it was um\nIt was the Vulcan show maybe we're talking about Vulcan\nNow the study is that of course we're you know where to like getting bread crumbs thrown out as oh here's a little tiny here's a little time to be a planet peace plan little puzzle pieces all come in and get a little bread crumbs little things that are throwing towards\nYou know NASA throws as a bone every once in a while there was a Red Cross a red crime or a scrap of meat\nAnd from there we can say oh man this little

may be a actually that post biological I may be may have been responsible for the reports of alien graves have been responsible actually for a various accounts of human abductions\nThere are so many new things that scientists of hypothesize regarding the advances being made in determining whether or not we're alone in the universe and it's too bad\nIt's too bad that there is still a huge percentage of people that are unaware of what has transpired\nIn the nearly fifty decades of denial and it's too bad if there are some people even in the UFO community those who go to these UFO conventions and do their presentation is too bad but they let their own dogma getting away with what science is saying\nBecause in the past science as the enemy and they may still be to a certain degree because they're not going to give you everything they're going to they're not going to give you the whole uh you know the whole whole course meal\nAnd NASA certainly isn't going to do that I

they had\n\n\n\nSomebody in science that you have the series called the great soldiers theory and that is you know some scientists say well the reason why we haven't had contact\nWith any alien civilization is because they've reached a wall [noise]\nThey reached a filter or in some cases God has told them ... you can't get any further in your science you go you stop here okay so there's a point\nWhere we do hit a wall there's a point where we can only go so far and then we go another direction because that's how we are it's or humans are that's how um you know elite they suspect\nAliens railing civilizations or even extraterrestrial civilizations react\nAnd so they take very paradox and they take drinks equation\nBut he throw it all together and we started saying well here's the reasons why we're not getting contractor here's the reasons why they're not trying to contact us or if we did this we may get more results or we already have the results\nWe've got to figure out how we have to change everything we think\nEverything we suspected about alien life in space wretch trust your life he could enact in October twenty Seventeen something unexpected happened a weird interstellar object game or more and more was discovered\nAnd there's been speculation about the possibility of this object was an alien spaceship or some sort of mother ship\nSo much speculation so much a you know questioning a foreign people every scientist what is that they didn't know it had everybody show confused\nEverybody's so excited that everybody has a lot of anxiety going on the official name of this mother ship they were going to call it wrong K\nThey were going to call it of course that's a reference to the elite spacecraft discovered under similar circumstances in Arthur see quarks Nineteen Seventy three science fiction\nBook called rendezvous with drama when a more and more first came on the scene I said this sounds like it's directly taken out of Arthur C Clark's run to be with rama in fact I think I wanted to call it ... they called it a more more which means scout that brings information from our past\nA Hawaiian name or more and more\nShow since October of Nineteen ah like I I have two thousand Seventeen okay there's been a lot of speculation it's cooled off a little bit someone else\nStrangely it was it was basically the strange in lung gated mostly ... comet traveling a huge speeds due to its origin beyond our solar system somewhere in interstellar space but\nHere's the thing that's interesting about a more and more rama that scientists did not stop\nLooking into this so called alien spaceship in fact city investigators Jill Tarter incest shows that\nThey were conducting a study investigating whether they're any radio signals being emitted from a mom or however now here's what's interesting President Trump\nWas notified that scientists were following this craft\nAnd the rumor has it that this event came close to being a disclosure event and why is that well because it just seemed that everything was falling into play a more and more was the closest thing we've got to disclosure\n\nThis is what the these are new findings these are things I was reading an in science and science daily\nBut more and more rama they were gonna call around but they called them or that long thin or that long needle like asteroid common or whatever it was\nScientists were tracking it President Trump was aware of it and after hearing about the remote possibility of this long gated object being an alien spacecraft he started pushing harder for the establishment of the space force\n\nAfter we were informed that the Pentagon was investigating the threat assessment of but identified flying objects are meeting was called by the national Academy of sciences committee on astrobiology science strategy for the surge of life in the universe the meeting was held at the University of California Irvine\n\nVS citing prompted a meeting this all of this prompted a meeting okay and it was this meeting it was it was worth Jill Tarter\nThe woman who was interested in a more and more and it and it's moving through space she's one of the world's best known leaders in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence she stated that Saturday the search for extraterrestrial intelligence should change its name\nAnd and what's harder said she she explained that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence generates an incorrect perception of what scientists in this field of study we're actually doing she said a more appropriate title for the field she said would be the search for techno signatures\nOr signs of technology created by intelligent alien civilizations not to me this man is secretly these scientists you scan space for space it goes Russian dressing civilizations mayor stumbled upon something that may be a signal for an extraterrestrial technology rather than direct conversations between biological entities\nAre more and more sent a signal or more and more was\nAn alien space craft they didn't tell us but it was enough to prompt meetings there was nothing if President Trump to consider the space worse it was enough to release the information about the threat assessment of UFOs that\nOne little citing obvious big one hundred foot long [noise] whatever it was a scientist will say it was a comet [noise] some scientists say it's a comment but now\nThose who are searching for signals in space said that something [noise] something\nIs prompting us to have to rethink everything we thought we knew about the possibility of aliens and how we communicate with him or if we even try to communicate with them [noise]\nYou know that space force idea I think we should go with the space for site that you know we're in for him to the Pentagon was also investigating for twelve years\nThe threat of extraterrestrials or the ... a threat of UFOs and then of course we go back to Jill Tarter who decided that it was time to organize scientists get together and the meeting\nWas called by the national Academy of sciences committee on astrobiology astrobiology\nScience strategy for the surge of life in the universe and that's where they did they they are they met\nAt the University of California Irvine because at this meeting that Jill Tarter who's laughter physicist she's got many years of study many years with NASA got together and said guys you know the search for extraterrestrial intelligence same that we'd given to our our group of people studying the cosmos it needs to be changed\n\nTurner explains that phrase search for extraterrestrial intelligence generates an incorrect perception of what the scientists in his field are doing\nThey're not searching for extra ingest ... extra terrestrial intelligence they're merely searching for techno signatures signatures\nOf extra terrestrial technology and to me you know which means to me that secretly\nSingles from extraterrestrial civilizations may have stumbled on to something they may have a signal techno signature from extraterrestrial technology and it has something to do with the more and more or rama\nEavesdropping on a conversation between alien civilizations would be fascinating but detecting an alien signal when the technological sick or the technological signature may be forthcoming this may be the thing they're going to tell us\nBut there would have to be a staff putting in place that would be capable of of interpreting the signal and its signature\nSo\nYou have a technological signal was detected who would be there to detect or learn the nuances of what the signal means well here's your answer this week\nNASA is hosting a conference and guess what they're going to do they are hosting a conference dedicating and rethinking their quest NASA wants\nScientists to evaluate how far the search for techno signatures has come and what the most promising possibilities are for ... future use and future study and perhaps even disclosure\nYou heard me they are meeting together\nAnd they're having a conference dedicated to rethinking the quest NASA wants scientists to evaluate how far the search for techno signatures has come and what the most promising possibilities are for the future\nPresentations will include discussions of different types on techno signatures\nOf different types of technology can pick them up and what other developments like the rise of big data offered to the field of searching the cosmos for a few terrestrial technology or techno\nSignatures\nWorkshop includes many speakers who have been leading the search for extraterrestrial intelligence for decades so while we have not received confirmed reports of contact with extraterrestrial intelligence one would assume that something or some civilization may have sent a techno signature several signatures\nIt could also be assumed that perhaps a more and more\nAre rama\nDid send a techno signature\nAnd that this anomaly is being assessed for possible direct hit by being by direct set meaning I've directed they had a direct communication\nAnd ah\nYou know there are other things that contribute to the possibility I don't know last year or the last no one last year as I mean June we were reporting here on ground zero there was something that happened\nWith more and more that again had scientists rethinking their decisions to that and that was a an international science team was analyzing a space space observations have been more and more\nAnd and they were tracking it and they found something strange its arc\nThe arc of the\nOf the movement of the object couldn't solely be explained by the effect of gravity that would be pushing it you know the sun would be pushing on it because it's a it's a comet right so the object appeared to accelerate on its own it was reported in some circles of the anomaly accelerated again\nAnd again and again\nA celebration of the object was not caused by commentary out gassing when the object group to the Jodie in system Saturn or Jupiter\nAccelerate as if it was intelligently piloted in in ... in another four years are saying that it will pass ... orbit on its way back to interstellar space\n\nSo now you know the secret now you know what's going on\n\nNow you know what triggered the idea for the space force now you know why they're rethinking their position on aliens being of the aliens that we experience being biological but they are\nNow you know why\nThey're rethinking their position aliens being the aliens that we have experienced being biological but\nThey are they're synthetic and that\nThere are no longer looking for extraterrestrial intelligence they're looking for extra terrestrial techno signatures made by extraterrestrial intelligence\nGood appalling Kentucky Hi Paul you're on ground zero in ... show as usual thank you\nIt was just talking about the the wall of technology oh can you know a scientist speculate to reach a certain level of technology into the further uh today I was reading a science a guide dot org\nAnd they're talking about Anita the aerial or I Can't remember the spelling of it but it's a it's a satellite that goes over the Antarctic poll not old and it registered new particles so this is the fourth time it's still fly over for now\nAre you talking about the discovery they made about uh gosh they said that something is transmitting out of Antarctica it's some sort of a particle that goes uh that that they say it's come through the planet outside the end of Antarctica and I guess\nYeah yes and they could change physics as we know\nIt's called the ... it's going to be a let me think it's called the Antarctic impulse transit antenna\nYes sir Yes sir I Need to set it and it could change\nPhysics as we know it according to the scientist because there's this new type of particles yeah it's not a brand new particle but it's a particle acting in a way that it shouldn't be which is what they're confused about what I understand article\nThis is a ... talking about the wall right let me let me a part of all\nLet me site what you were talking about is in Scientific American writer readings and Scientific American Yes sir okay uh this is what it says quickly and we'll have to go to break\nTheir something mysterious coming up from the frozen ground in an article and it would break the laws of physics as we know what physicists don't know what it is exactly what they do know it's some sort of Cosby gray\nA high energy particle that blast its way through space into earth and then back out again for the particle physicist know about the collection of particles that make up what the scientists called the standard model of particle physics shouldn't be able to do that\nOkay so what's going on here shouldn't be going on yes\nThere's some sort of a particle beam or a number of particles unknown to earth going into the earth and coming out the end of Antarctica going out into space again\nYeah blasting out according to the article you know this being fit whatever is going on\nI Will have to crash into something out there are at least hit something and say hello to something or you know re meet wall wall meat re\nMay need space craft store\nThat's that's what they're saying would that's right that's what I'm getting the [noise]\nYeah that's what I took from and also in God what an amazing thing to bring up to my ball thank you so much I'm Glad you're reading make you fly into the market and you're getting that information that's great great place like where do you feel my God what a great great call yeah can you imagine that there is some sort of a [noise]\nAn unknown particle beams going from one end of the earth out to the other side and it's supposed to go out into space and it's going out and no one knows where it's headed\nBut it's going to hit something right [noise] so what is this thing is that traveling through the earth out the other end and it's trying to pick up on somebody some sort of transmission remember when Saturn tried to communicate with the moon\nAnd we didn't know what it was it was amazing to hear the communication [noise]\nWell now the earth is doing it with something else in science students did not know what they say it's not supposed to be happening [noise]\nWell now the earth is doing something else in science you did not know if it if not supposed to be happening [noise]\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred extra believes except for three thirty
