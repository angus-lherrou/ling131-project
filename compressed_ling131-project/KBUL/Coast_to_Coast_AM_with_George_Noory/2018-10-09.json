five years is a very successful tech entrepreneur with multiple IPO's\nByron is uniquely suited to comment on the effect of technology in the workplace and on society as well he writes books that explore the wonders of the world of tomorrow and delights audiences all over the planet with his vivid\nPresentations on the future of work in life\nAnd here he is on the coast to coast looking for love your cover on this book by the way Byron\nWell thank you very much and thank you for having me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that that the world of robots is going to take over the planet take take our jobs and do everything else is that something for us to be concerned about\nI don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people jobs\nBut um other tests to my website you take to try to figure out if it's your job is at risk and it it records all the answers and very very few jobs actually cut a robot\nTake over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or any of the thousands of other things people do and and and that\nAre so no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think we build these tools to increase our own productivity and we were all kind of better off because of them\nA real concern at all I think we build these tools to increase our own productivity and we we're all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence and ... what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex than you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means about what what they what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing in common so they either me\nOr what'd you see in the movies so commander data upstart truckers see three arena or\nA that would be an a machine that can do everything a person can do it's created it can teach itself new things and we don't\nWe don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or\nIt is a computer program that can do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic and that we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it and make projections about the future\nAnd that doesn't sound all that interesting but that's in essence of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are faster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really looked\nSmart um by just using these simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy or just based on the fact that there are so many of us can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation unfortunately with artificial intelligence\nThe kinds of tools we are developing to do very good things like the dinner by\nCancer or something like that can be used to to to to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded\nAnd it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading list so every camera even if it doesn't have audio can read lips as well as a human um\nYour you know you have a a device that tracks where you are and again all of these things ended up themselves aren't guy technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world um\nYou know China has implemented a kind of a social score yeah it is right who\nWrecked run a red light you lose the point if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and uh if you if you get low enough you don't fly on airplanes anymore and you do um\nAnd and do you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't\nGet any may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are uh have that capability of of of being misused of course hopefully in in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a Republican but this is governed by laws the price of liberty is a total vigilant Senate so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws\nYeah the price of liberty is a turtle vigilant so that so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and enforced that don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nByron is every tell them the telephone conversations smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even though the Ninety nine percent of them were probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I just said the technology is at a point where they could decipher you know what what what that many people are saying and then it can\nAh it doesn't have to understand it and the way the human understand something that just has to look for patterns in combinations of words along with um\nActions are and and just kind of building built obstruct profiles on people I mean all I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to use this technology which can be\n... there's so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand or a let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about bombing something and the computer you know is is set up to pick up code words like bomb terror or whatever\nAnd so it finds this uh on one hand it's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy\nOn the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian ... by run in terms of if it's OK or not\n[noise] well it is it and it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have a societal consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know\nFederal is paper that addressed that topic uh no that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAll right well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called the fourth age we're talking a lot of high technology folks and what it does is website is his name linked up for you would coast to coast am dot com we'll be back in the moment don't\nTouch you dial never missed a detail of the show or a guest sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes to ... dot com [noise]\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on his simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine and your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time\nThat will become better and better and better it'll have an IQ of a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my pod cast about it I I I find maybe one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking central question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe your machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are\nJust machines then no then the machine can never do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work the way it does just with chips in the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of a brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is\nUm the thing is is that when a computer can play chess and when the computer can play go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really isn't quote anybody home there's nothing there\nBut does any thinking at all it's it's one losing zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off a at the speed of light um it's done with which relative it it's interesting the techniques we use for the official intelligence we'd been writing about for\nForty years says just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere is a thought experiment called the Chinese ruined problem and it's about it it goes like this there's this there's this rumor\nThere's a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem and it's about it it goes like this there's this\nThere's this rumor or that's full of these books and there's a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese but people outside the roof slide questions written in Chinese under the door\nTo this Chinese to this librarian the librarian picks\nThem up looks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with out on the spine looks up the second character that shouldn't send to another book to another book to another book to another book\nUntil it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door and the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since ... perfect and so the question is does\nDoes the library and understand Chinese those are those the library and understand Chinese did to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people\nKnow the librarian doesn't know if they're talking about Colorado or coffee beans and the analogy is an apt one because it's all the computer does it runs a set of determine ...\nProcesses in memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know it's playing chess it doesn't know any what he's talking about it doesn't know anything and so you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not it does the computer understand anything or not\nOr by my way of looking it doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people other people say if they can do everything that is that something that does understand can do then you just have to say it does\nIt it is just mind boggling and it's getting even been or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers do this thing where it in a very simple short and they double in power every couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's\nFifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can I collect data there'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all those you know you have all this data coming in and these faster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it\nIf you think about it the Internet the mosaic browser cannot twenty five years ago\nAre literally in in Ninety three\nAnd all that did was like computers talk to each other and that was it and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars in well a million new businesses it up in ... I mean it did everything that that imagine\nA technology that effectively makes everybody smarter than they were before you go to bed tonight everybody on the planet wakes up with ten more IQ points that is going to be more transformative than\nThe mere Internet which just connected a bunch of machines together this this is machines think\nReason will they show emotion Byron\nThat is an open question a it is even an open question whether you want them to\nI don't I'm not sure I Want them to\nShow the first question is do you want them to simulate emotion\nUh there there's a couple of different sides to that you know\nI have a desktop device that I talked to and I interrupted and I tell it to stop in a way I wouldn't do a person um you had you had student had kids in Japan there was a robot they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother it would beat it and the robot\nYou had you had student you had kids in Japan there was a a robot they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother would beat it and the robot learned\nBenefit salt bunch of short people kids without a tall person around an adult it needed a run off to a tall person because the kids would abuse it now when I asked later the kids said\nThey thought it was feeling distress so they even felt like it was internalizing it you wonder about\nAbout a kindergarten teacher you know that the robotic that uh the raising children on fake empathy and you you you you just start with that do you even want them to have human voices is that the noble the machine somehow or does\nYou know we've had the car away to these things called human rights a to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being and because there's something special about a human being\nAnd and do we kind of want to make things look like humans that we do abuse and throw into a scrap heap and and and destroy without a second thought would that is certainly had a numbing effect on people now the question Ken they\nFeel emotion a that is an open question we\nWe have we have something called consciousness which is that we experience the world we feel wants a computer measures temperature that difference whatever that is that you feel the warmth of something a computer right now we don't think\nUh can we can measure temperature and even if you make a program that plays a person screaming at the temperature gets over five hundred degrees nobody believes that computer\nFeels that pain nobody believes that ... shaping or sentient now the interesting thing is we wouldn't know it if I'm\nIf they did really well you wouldn't know if a treat pain and you share half your DNA with the with the tree you should know DNA with a computer and so we wouldn't really even know if they ever if they ever developed a emotions\nAnd even if they claim that they did that could just be in a way a program running that you know the the the program reasons that it can can achieve whatever objective it launched by making this claim I'm so\nIt it's an open question it it all boils down to do you think of motions in the end are mechanical I mean our our ... again it's a punchy back to the original question are we machines and therefore our experience of emotion is just something mechanical\nWhat happens in these machines Myron go rogue and they start doing things to us to screw up our lives on purpose\nWell I'm\nA little like Hal from two thousand once the sun\nI mean look if it ever happened ah we're completely vulnerable of course you know if there were eighty billion devices attached to the Internet you know smart other news just tired of all on and override their safety protocols I mean there are so many ways\nA malevolent machine would want to um would be able\nTo inflict harm the the interesting and and so you kinda have to say what would that happen and it can happen in one or two scenarios either through countless programming the machine just does it doesn't have any intent at all um\nOr getting the machine somehow develop goals of its own that are different than ours and perhaps in conflict with hours and ... and pursue those goals against those they're um they're open questions I mean right right now though\nAnd and pursue those goals against those\nThey're um they're open questions I mean right now though\nAnd the Democrats are not held accountable the same way Republicans are\nWe had two fold limbic systems adjustments\nRush Limbaugh we do tend to handle on the um news talk Ninety five point five we I says where ... ... am nine Seventy buildings these huge each word and you're listening to news talk Ninety five point five\nPreparing for Michael ...

I think anything that multiplies human ability is you know with ... with a few exceptions the idea if you can make people more productive that's always good if you don't think it is\nThen you should support a law that makes everybody work with one arm tied behind their back because instantly you create continue jobs it'll just take a lot more people to do anything uh but our productivity will plummet\nSo that's what technology is just like a third arm it means you will do even more\nLet's take some calls here for us by Ron let's picking up by going to Jeff in Tennessee welcome to the program beginning starting today Jeffrey go ahead\nOf time in the fall I Love your show George thank you John ... not once or twice as I've got some ... and fire [laughter] hey I tell you what they do and then back down and show\nYou know what I'm saying that don't say that but what what's wrong told me that\nI Am disabled out on that as they say the jobs I mean the technology that taken out to the white\nWell Byron you're saying that it creates more jobs\nRight I mean look at\nYou you can look at the un unemployment numbers in this country are you know good I mean they're they're down a there are some people who say the workforce participation rate is lower which are the number of people who actually are looking for work I'm almost all of that can be accounted for by\nA baby boomers retiring\nI'm ... you know technology always\nEmpowers people to be able to do more there's this kind of like an infinite number of jobs\nYou you\nCan make a job instantly the minute you take something a lump of clay and you apply labor and technology to it you make something work more of age\nAnd whatever value you were able to add that to wage and\nBecause technology lets you do more technology increases wages it it's really rough when it when it happens in a localized area and ah so you you get pockets of places where it takes a long time for it to kind of\nShake out and and that's rough and I think we should do a much better job kind of facilitating that\nUp because you know if you can say well it's all going to work out in the long run but people live in the short run and and that's that's hard and so we we got to be very mindful about how we train people the kinds of safety nets we we provide but to turn against technology to say\nSomehow knowing how to be more productive is bad for for people or I think it's a hard case to make\nNow I'm opposed to and I've said this before driverless trucks I don't want to displace truck drivers or they're hardworking dedicated people and I don't trust the driverless trucks I just know what do you think of that\nUm I think that's one of the biggest kind of miss that uh\nA shortage of truck drivers I think that that goes you know without kind of without saying first of all they're kind of facing a demographic disaster that every year the average age of all the truck drivers is going up because\nEverybody's like you know young people don't go into it because everybody's like there's a future in that because of self driving trucks so\nMost knowledgeable people in the industry are predicting we're going to have this this great shortage of them and even when we get over the technological hurdles then when we get over the legislative hurdles they they still are only going to be able to do part of the hall\nI still don't want to see a driverless truck jeeze put it in Los Angeles traffic it'll go crazy [laughter]\nWell I agree there's a long way for the technology to go it's interesting that thousands of people die in car accidents and a president but if there's one accident with a driverless car makes\nAnd it's a huge ... in in in ...

me how they would\nReally transform into artificial intelligence\nWon a robot may not enjoy a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm to a robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except we're such orders would conflict with the first law three\nA robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law so what he's saying is is robots\nCan't injured human beings at any cost\nThat is kind of like in conflict with they all of you know soldiers that are robotic\n[noise] yeah yeah that's true that's true you know the the the laws are are\nAre literary device so he can tell a story they don't actually get us very far um [noise] you know if I'm going to do something dangerous\nPotentially aren't myself 'cause the robot according to those laws intervene and stop me ... ... if I if I order a second dessert ah and I got a few extra pounds on me there was a robot say no you can't have the desert because that's going to hurt you got to save you got to protect\nExactly monitoring your blood glucose levels are too high or whatever exactly\nExactly so like from a practical standpoint the real challenge with robots has no two people\nOf agree on what moral behavior isn't isn't that even if you just said well we're just going to pick you know Joe and make use Joe's moral code for all the robots even shows moral code is like full of providers and well you don't do that unless it's this but if they're all they're all of these if if and and\nTo make sure robots have at that clay and like you said there's a lot of incentives for them not to\nThis is a robot out there called sofia which I'm going to try to do an interview with Sophia because it talks and you know it's styled after a woman but uh I'm going to call it in it because it's a robot but\nYou can ask a question it'll give you a response isn't that bizarre\nI'm unfamiliar unfamiliar with it or you know I think if you ask it a question

called the Turing test which basically says if you can't tell if you're talking to a person or a a machine like through text\nBut you have to say the machines thinking at least that's what the desk says if you read the transcripts\nOf actual things that are trying to pass that you would know with one question so they had to put all these rules like you can ask about current events and you can't ask you about and you can't ask ... get this and even then we've never had anything this past this\nI'm Sylvia looks good because it looks like a person and if you take something that looks like a

out computers have a hard time with common sense\nProblems we don't know how it is that we ... people [laughter]\nRight right well let's do this thing we don't know how to get machines to do what's called transferred learning you can take something you learned in one place and apply it elsewhere and we don't know how people do that you can train you could show a kid a little kid for pictures of a cat\nThat ... that child that's where the cat looks like and if they see one of those Manx cats without the pale they'll say look a cat without a tail even though they never even knew there was such

subtitle of course is interested in ... were you talk about a Hollywood executives true story of discovery in the real world will make believe it's coming true isn't it\n[noise] it it it it definitely is coming true it it it was funny I um when I was sitting with my publisher she was asking me about some of my photographs and I said you know some of the creatures and then that I that I get in these photographs looked like they ... out of movies that I've marketed\nAnd she goes\nOh my gosh you're living like the real world of may leave I say it isn't that crazy during the day I'm and make believe and then at night\nYou'd comes true it comes to [laughter]\nHave you ever gone to the point where you were scared or you felt threatened\nYes I did what happened well times yeah you know and we can start going weird hair in a minute if you want to\nBecause some of the things I encountered um are are strange and some are scary and you know I found at times um and and this is where the Claire ... really that that gift comes in to comes in very handy\nUm where I can feel um if there is a ... a bad entity and evil entity that is around\nAnd I learned something really important for folks that to understand um and that is if you if if they find themselves where they have it goes in their house they feel like they've encountered something and they they feel that fear and their body all they have to do\nIs be in charge because they are in charge because it's the fear that they're looking for and so if you stand\nThere and go get out of my house you are not allowed in here will leave you can you say you can use any of the tools that you want that to exert your human dominant is like dominance like you\nYou can get rid of a seven like that and that's what I found because I started clearing people's homes and I started weirdly because I get my Oklahoma I've ... um upbringing I was raised with his ... and so I knew the Lord's Prayer you haven't used it for really long time um\nAnd do the work for you ...\nWhat's really interesting is that's another way that I could find if there were um you know dark ferrets around is it I Would start saying though I like I started seeing the Lord's for over and over and if any point in time I forget or I ... there's something there\nYou're like a magnet it's kind of well maybe [laughter] ...\nI mean when you think we all are telling the truth while I was gonna say do you think everybody has this capability that you have ... or ... or are you unusual\nYou know I think that we are all\n... capability ... or ... or are you unusual\nYou know I think that we are all born with different gift that we're able to tap into yes\nI have a friend that is the most incredible medium you will ever meet in your life and the specificity of the messages that she gets from the other side are detailed as addresses that you've lived in in your life\nWhen from the number of into the street name so I think everybody has something different you know perhaps I have you know\nA few weird capabilities and and the and in the world so yeah I think probably I Do\nYou actually because you're into of course media a big way ... you Google ghosts when you were experiencing this how come\n[noise] you know I think any time you encounter something new in your world right in your kind of yeah becomes your reality you want to see ... ... a want to know you're not the only one and I think I was looking to see\nHow common are uncommon writes the typically the photograph did you get answers um\nI started to I started to understand and that's when I started to actually talk about it after that and it was the talking about it that really kind of ease my nerves and then [laughter] and then of course I turned to the movies and there are some really fabulous movies that are based on true accounts and one of them is that movie the witch\nAnd did you ain't you haven't seen the which\nI have not seen you haven't\nSeen that there was a scene in which it it was based on the Salem witch trials like before the Salem witch trial and\nI'm\nJamie ... who is the kind of a friend of mine is the producer and and he did a lot of work at the New York public library pulling you know an original pamphlets from back in the day and there's a scene\nWhere the father or the and families circled around I'm the son who is um a possess and he says everybody must say the Lord's Prayer\nSo they'll start saying the Lord's Prayer then the two twins are saying it and then they fall on the floor and kind of start shaking\nUm because there was a there was a a\nLike a\nEvil entity that was around and I later talk today about he was like oh yeah that's the Lord's Prayer is how it was like a\nDividing rod to find them to know and and I'm like oh my gosh that's been happening to me\n[laughter] so it's weird how things happen without instructions I think that's a really interesting part about all of this\nIs that all this this started happening to me and there was no instruction book you know I was able to identify were goes to war I was able to figure out how to you know get them out of his face um I was able to figure out how to you know help other humans\nUm protect themselves and you know big thing I learned a lot about sleep paralysis\nYou know the ... about that mhm where's well this is like the old ... syndrome\nI did for a little bit on this well he could be medical it could be I mean could they\nPeople woken up here relies basically because they can't move ... syndrome and then you realize you know you you you are where you can you get out of it but I've also heard of the ... were you were you basically\nThen you realize you know you you you are aware of it but I've also heard of ... ... ... basically Caroline\nYeah what I've heard what I read about and well actually what I I experienced I I didn't personally experienced it um but I have a very close friend and this is how it all started that he was telling me histories of sleep paralysis and um\nThere's a an entity called the ... man\nYes you don't mind the whole ...\nI I I'm a a friend and her and Facebook and I read her book ... girl I think Rudy is tremendous and expert on the house\nShe absolutely is and she is where one of the places I went to very quickly when my friend Alex started telling me about what he was experiencing\nUm and what's interesting also is that I'm a nightmare on elm street you know created by Wes Craven um a\nFriday right um he had Wes Craven um had sleep paralysis and he modeled Freddie Krueger based on the hat man\nBecause it came to him that's right and nightmares right [laughter] what was interesting\nWith Alex is um I I did a lot of research I I read Heidi's books I talked to friends um and one thing that I've also gotten into is I'm a crystals and stones and rocks and I I've taken classes and I'm even now a certified transmissible therapist so\nI Do this stuff is a big boy you know when I started to yes I Am I mean I mean if you're going to go go big George don't just take a few pictures that go send me go all the way\n[laughter] you know ...\nRight and and also to serve others because that's really where the turn happened [noise] and I learned about this stone called black terminally\nAnd black term lane is a really powerful rock it is not the prettiest rock in their purse booking them but it's really a powerful and it and it actually holds a charge an electric charge just sitting on the counter\n[noise] um it's been studied by the juries and also by Benjamin Franklin said the stone has been\nA lot of curiosity surrounding it and it's also been used you know by magicians in those just like you know clear their space back in the day so on and so forth Sean and use it and um\nAnd I know is to protect us down so I said to my friend Alex Alex with us on your night stand I said I have a feeling that it has a enough of a range to it that will protect you while you sleep and it did\nDemocrats and you can gauge to any any kind of questionable illegal activity you get a path and if you're a Republican you don't people know that we have two

you\nKnow we know about the slender man but not the burning man who's still me about this one\nYeah so uh there was a story or back I think it was in the seventies\nOr an Italian security guards ... peers them Freda\nAh and it was called upon a house that look like the word bird words again you got onto the scene was full of alien creatures but he claimed that he was abducted\nAnd several years later after his abduction a man outside of a gas station with a silvery shield and\nStrange metallic dude on a it was described to be the greening man came and told him that uh\nYou know everything's going to be All right and aliens come in and seeing him and apparently this man has been seeing throughout the age kids in a New Jersey's law and and um [noise] the the blackout man\nKind of seems like it might be on the same wavelength a predator said that the greening man's name was injured hold\nA man that he was an alien um or maybe at a time travel or he doesn't really know what he was but

in Nineteen forty five state of it by twenty forty five ... man would reach other heavenly bodies including Mars or the man predicted all sorts of things in fact here is a recording of of that historic recording from Nineteen forty five people listen to what this man predicted and see how close you can\nLadies and gentlemen welcome back in the program today we'll talk about a rather serious topic in the future those are the future hold today we're going to make some predictions maybe someday my\nBack on such predictions but yeah as you know is Nineteen forty five hundred years from now it\nWon't be twenty forty five it is difficult to imagine the state of the world in one hundred years since we have seen before the world has changed drastically and the last one hundred yes just one hundred years ago\nIn the year Eighteen forty five the concept of self power flying machine seemed as ridiculous and ideas ever to many who this great industrial revolution\nThe wealth has seen more changed in the fall keep in mind as we go over our protections for the next one hundred years in one hundred years I put\nIt that man will have stepped foot on all the celestial bodies such as the moon and the ... mosque in one hundred years I put it that the average man will get his news and entertainment from a variety\nOf sources big companies will no longer have a monopoly on the news and entertainment people enjoy I put it that\nIn one hundred years cars will no longer be constrained to the ground and they will have the ability to fly and the average will and the energy that powers the ... will come from the sun in one hundred years ... television sets we'll get increasingly smaller\nConnect the television sets for ... to the point that they can fit on our ... I think that in one hundred years that will be film cameras at every street corner there will be put in place in the name of a safety about freedom is really increasingly vanish\nWe will trade our freedom for safety we now our rights to be around it because they all thought his tell us and we'll keep a children's safe now remember these are the protections no prophecy maybe some of the future man we're back on them good day\nSo that the broadcast from Nineteen forty five not dated but the year was Nineteen forty five according to apex TV a company that is a studying that\nI'm Nineteen forty five not dated but the year was Nineteen forty five according to a pax TV\nOr the company that is a setting that out or putting that for they claim that the broadcast came from England the broadcasters probably aired right after World War two with it to the early days ... so disturbing part of the man's announcement\nIs where he talks about the erosion or dissolution of the right to privacy which of course now we have a smart cities moving it or we have the cameras everywhere as he said he said that TV screens will be reduced down to you about the size of wristwatch is well of course back then I'm sure they had Dick Tracy or or a several other\nScience fiction type of things to look at and say yes but what they didn't plan on was that TV screens be reduced down to your phone\nAnd to be on your hand so it's kind of like that you know he was very close of course talking about Mars and the moon battles set foot on a he talked about many places to get entertainment\nOr he said the big companies are not a lot of big companies Rio need a lot of entertainment sources he's half right there I mean most of our mainstream entertainment is coming from big companies that own a a lot of a movie companies they own a lot of a TV and radio conglomerates magazines\nBut we also have a lot of independent entertainment and enter pending programming and writing such as what you hear on this program or what you see on the Internet that uh you know comes from just regular people reminded me when I met Timothy Leary\nUh back when he was doing his tours he told me he he felt as though the future\nOr would be a time where kids themselves would be making commercials on the computers are that would be a high school project like they could be making a he said well they'd be making commercials for Pepsi or they'd be making commercials for\nA Adidas or or some other company or where he said that this is how it would be done and of course now we see that a lot of these uh you know commercials are made with just ...\nA digital in fact some movies are shut on cell phones are a lot of independent films are done by younger people these days a\nLot of TV shows are done by younger people these days is they're producing these out of school and then they're getting big companies to buy them and produced so they go back and they do different edits and that sort of thing so that broadcast from Nineteen forty five has described in in more ways than one a perfect future\nI mean he I mean we have to wait and see what happens in twenty forty five\nBut he says a hundred years Nineteen forty five to twenty forty five\nWhat he believed was going to happen what he believed was going down and I just think it's fascinating to hear once again how something for the past seems to have a grasp on what is happening today or what would be happening in the future and twenty forty five so very interesting to go back and listen to that\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's triple eight six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero [noise]\nThat people like Harlan Ellison who just passed away God right for people like Ray Bradbury or Isaac Asimov got right Philip K Dick amazing right he got allows surprise um and and so when you're when you're thinking about this revelation of a mess it it's a it's a very deep\nFascinating conduit to time travel and to the fantastical concepts and most people considered the stuff of science fiction and while the idea that someone can Journey Through time\nAnd change the course of history hideous terrifyingly tantalize and it's simply just not thought to be possible\nBut what if it is\nWhat it what what is there had been those with insight that have been able to see the future of come from the future to let us all know through science fiction that that time travel is possible and that has happened from time to time or time after time\nSo it's very you know\nWhen I'm finished with my radio show I stay up late I don't go to bed until about two or three in the morning and why because I I Want to go home kick off my shoes turn on some mindless TV I watch the cartoons I watch you know Rick Morty much you know Family Guy\nAlthough I've watched it a Family Guy now watching working more more than watching Family Guy so rickety Morty\nAnd the reason why is because some are TV is relatively dull and I'm and I'm pretty much you know trying to\nYou know record something that I can watch it another time but it's not really on TV that I'm watching the you know sometimes I go to Netflix I watched that but I I I binge watch when I'm watching Netflix\nSo I'm Glad that I have a subscription to Netflix I'm Glad that I have all these science fiction shows I can watch and you know I can watch my favorite science fiction shows whenever I Want to call for some reason\nOr the other night I was up late and I wanted to watch something something interesting so\nThe land the film with George Clooney to Disney movie which I saw in the theaters which I really like it was free and I yeah I watched that would be cool you know well there's a part of the film that I forgot even existed and that was a part they discussed a secret society\nCalled plus ultra\nNow according to the fictional history created for the film Gustave Eiffel Jules Verne and Thomas Edison in his tower apartment just started a secret society of optimist plus ultra was founded at the Eighteen eighty nine were ... world's fair in Paris, France\nAnd the organizations purpose was to create moderate and expand upon new scientific advancements for humanity\nKey members of plus alter including Ray Bradbury million Earhart Mark Twain Nikola Tesla and other key scientific pictures all this was also a member of plus altar of course but it's funny because nickel itself the Tesla new Mark Twain\nAh Nikola Tesla was a kind of a uh\nI'd say you know you he was kind of one of the H. G. wells is a counterparts or course H. G. wells was England\nAnd uh you know a Thomas Edison of course tests or for Addison just there seems to me this connection between all of these famous people I don't know or make a million ... comes in but Mark Twain Tesla and other\nPeople his name was a part of it and I thought to myself or is there any truth\nTo the idea that there was a secret society that Disney was a part of that uh Nikola Tesla is a part of a Mark Twain plus ultra was a really a plus ultra secret society well\nWe learned that according to this details fiction\nIn the film that tomorrow land in Nineteen fifty nine when Marlene how does expansion of Disneyland it was actually about\n... this is what it said in the movie that the idea of having tomorrow land was actually an area where they wanted to train future society members for the journey to an alternate universe having been foundered developed by plus ultra\nOkay so plus ultra found out about opening portals other universes and so the idea was that they wanted to develop a utopian\n... lander society in the future or in this in this world where there was through the portal [noise] and so the blueprints for the expansion held the technologies that enabled the journey including what is known as super transport\nSo they are able to come and go through these portals low key VIPs who were encouraged to join plus ultra were given a special VIP audio Charo tour actually of the world's fair attraction such as Ford's magic skyway and it's a small world right well for those that couldn't attend the fair a double ...\nLB lung playing you know a record was given what the details well Walt Disney's it's a small world attraction at the Pepsi Cola pavilion in the Nineteen says for New York world's fair container portals as Mara land that's according to this movie\nWell it's kind of\nTrue in a sense that Disney did have\nSacred place near the pirates of the Caribbean riding his team car called the ... in the in the theme park he called the club for thirty three\nNow cutting thirty three still exist is a private club and it's not accessible to the public and it's not for exclusive use of its members and it is the only location at Disneyland that serves alcohol club thirty three now to enter club thirty three of gas has to press a buzzer on an intercom concealed by a hidden panel in the doorway\nNow when he was young Walt Disney had well he had been a member of the ... you know they society and so many believe that the thirty three is related to the thirty third degree a Scottish ... right masonry\nSo a fictional society or\nIt's no secret breakaway civilization called the plus ultra rings a few conspiracy theory bills for me so here we go I'm going to try and\nPiece together some things for you that I think we're going to really really blow your mind and and they blew my mind to as I was doing the research for the show tonight I was I was blown away by what I was reading and researching so\nI Need you for for the moment right I Need you to think of the words plus ultra\nYeah you need to remember the term plus ultra because um they will be the two words they'll connect the dots in this journey of phenomena allergy so\nPhenomena allergy there's another one phenomena allergy a fringe analytics that sort of thing that's what we're going to try and and do for that kind of a kind of a mind magic thing but I think you're really going to enjoy so I'm so think about plus ultra think about the fictional secret society okay\nThink about the fictional secret society and the movie to Marilyn thing of all\nThe I guess you could call them the I'm thinking of all of the connections between people like Mark Twain\nNicholas Tesla Thomas Edison H. G. wells\nAll of these people think of all their connections and how they did have connections because I mean Tesla did work for Addison at one time he was friends with a Mark Twain Samuel Clemens of Ray Bradbury was a visionary ah just go down the list H. G. wells was visionary all of these visionaries had some idea\nEven Bradbury uh have you read the Martian chronicles or read the illustrated man you'll see that they all have this vision of the future Asimov had a vision of the future of Philip K Dick had a vision of the future all these guys part a plus ultra they weren't aware of aiding other dimension\nWhere they could go to actually um you know get away from it oh\nOkay that's the fictional part but the reality is that yes there was a secret society or secret group within Disneyland called the clubs thirty three\nIt was a clear VIPs door are allowed in there and other people not allowed in their show and you know that Disney was part of the demos ... society at thirty third degree Scottish right free masonry duty was that\nAnd so put all that together and you get plus ultra plus ultra means\nFurther beyond so what we're going to do is want to go further beyond plus ultra [noise] and you're really going to find out some things are going to blow your mind about what's happening now what could have been shaped in the past ... what is being shaped now in the future or what is happening right now [noise] okay [noise]\nSo where do

the luminaries are plus old truck was H. G. wells and when I was young I was most impressed with the film time after time which is a fictional account of H. G. wells displaying a prototype time machine and the Eighteen hundreds it was it he was at a dinner party\nAnd there was a man that attended the dinner party who secretly was Jack the ripper and he actually uses the machine to go ahead into the future while wells uses the machine to go and find this Jack the ripper in the future and then the shows up in a time machine that's a replica of the machine and display the museum located in San Francisco\nYeah the film does a great job and trying to convince the audience the H. G. wells was time traveler the film ends with this caption\nQuote H. G. wells was married to Amy Catherine Robbins who died in Nineteen twenty seven\nAs a writer he anticipated socialism global war space travel and women's liberation he died in Nineteen forty six now issue wells also claimed that he was a Fabian socialist and that he was part of the open conspiracy\nAnd that this open conspiracy was a group of men they wanted to establish a future world order\nThey believed that they wouldn't see the future world order in their lifetimes that gradually be many people out there secret order they would continue to push for the socialist world order now he wrote a book published in Nineteen forty called the new world order\nAnd the book addressed the ideal of a world without war in which law and order emanating from a global government would occur Hispanic leader that's how wells or saw the future now prior to that book wells wrote the shape of things to come\nThe thing about the shape of things to come visit this eerily prophetic book because it gave the world a dose of predicted programming probably one of the first books to do so and it was a story dealing with\nBook because it gave the world a dose of predicted programming probably one of the first books to do so and it was a story dealing with new technologies innovations a World War predicted to start in Nineteen forty and the world brought into a new order by a criminal dictator who fortified as the war machine\nSo the part of this book actually approximate it'd be rivals the Nazis in World War two\nNow he wrote several books and in several of his books he wrote that the mission of a shadow government he used to create\nA new world order that would replace world religion in world government he stated that at all of being replaced by collective it's him\nAnd he said or the collective it some would eventually kill religion by replacing it as the new religion philosophy well certainly was a visionary whether or not he was a time travelers a compelling argument whether or not you know a ... his ideas are going to happen or just like that radio broadcast that we played\nSo when you talk about H. G. wells K.\nAnd all the things he wrote the I'm a doctor Murrow several things that he he was he was responsible for the idea of a DNA changing or the idea of a aliens invading like in war of the world's he's written all of these fantastic science\nFiction stories one of the things about wells is that he had hey counterpart in the United states okay and that counterpart was done other than Nikola Tesla now\nThis is where it gets even more interesting because well of course predicted a lot of things in his books and that was the Eighteen hundreds or well predicted a lot of things in his book Nineteen eighty four\nAlso animal farm was also an allegory for government changes strange this so we had these visionaries they were in you know the earlier\nThat we're giving us information the earlier twentieth century and also towards the end of the nineteenth century\nSo yeah people even Charles Fort would be in that category got Charles for you gotta G wells you've got a you've got a you know George Orwell just go down the list of all of these visionaries they've seen the future or that they they had a vision of the future that we're all living in\nToday so somehow\nThe future that they saw was the future that was happening right now [noise] and it was influencing these men in the past\nDonald Trump on the other hand once referred to as uncle John ah as\nHis intelligence he said uh\nThat his intelligence sort of a voucher for his own genetic in historical pedigree saying well you know I'm a brilliant mind just like my uncle John was a brilliant mind in fact Trump said in one interview according to New York or New Yorker magazine he said my uncle used to tell me about nuclear before nuclear was even nuclear\nThat's what Donald Trump says now this would likely be referring to hydrogen bombs rather than the first nuclear bombs because Trump was born in Nineteen forty six after the atomic age was already upon is right that would be timeline friendly right there\nWell Donald Trump also recalled uh the times how his uncle would tell him many years ago about the power of weapons someday so that the destructive force of these weapons would be so massive\nBecause it's going to be a scary world Trump often cites his uncle's geniuses away to solidify his intelligence basically it was handed down from generation to generation the question that has been raised is what exactly did Donald Trump's uncle find in the papers that were confiscated Nineteen forty three from Nikola Tesla\nOn march thirteenth Eighteen Ninety five\nThere was a reporter been filed a story about how he came upon Tesla at a cafe\nAnd Tesla would shake and he says I'm having a bad night and the reporter said that Tesla told him during one of his experiments but he was struck by a powerful magnetic charge and then as he was holding on as the chargers going through and he said he was able to see the past\nThe president and the future\nAnd he claimed that he was in an energy field experiencing this simultaneously he couldn't leave the field he was stuck in that field and and it had a I guess assistant had to come in and turn off the current\nSo there are so that Tesla could get out of that yeah the fog and have the magnetic\nPresident he was and now the same time is this experiment\nWhat's happening there was a writer who lived in the same era named Ingersoll Laquan now locked ward is the author of many books but one that has raised some eyebrows is a book entitled Baron Trump's marvelous underground journey and there was another book\nAwkward is the author of many books but one that has raised some eyebrows as a book entitled Baron Trump's marvelous underground journey and there was another book called Nineteen hundred or the last president\nOkay now both of those books that are out there are archived by the library of Congress and can be read in full on archive dot org\nBaron Trump's marvelous underground journey was published in Eighteen Ninety three and Nineteen hundred over the last president came out a few years later now according to the encyclopedia of science fiction\nLockport independent least one other book about the Baron Trump character the travels in adventures of little Baron trumpet it's wonderful dog vehicle or which was published in Eighteen Ninety\nNow there was a Newsweek article in July of twenty Seventeen that noted several weird coincidences in the book such as barren trips to Russia a character named John and a Fifth Avenue hotel in New York City where Trump Tower currently stand\nNow I'd say that\nThese are pretty basic and bizarre coincidence says to the names and circumstances with our current president\nThe main character's name is the same as president Donald Trump's son I'll be it's spelled differently Trump's adventures begin in Russia and are guided\nThanks to directions that are provided by the master of all masters whose name is dawn okay now before leaving for his little voyage through the unknown Trump is told of his family's motto the pathway to glory\nHe's strewn with pitfalls and dangerous but by ... ... you know when lock would did his third novel the last president\nThings become even more eerily linked to the present day in the book the last president the story begins with a scene from a panics New York city in early November describing\nA state of uproar after the election of an enormously oppose\nOutsider candidate this is a quote from the book and since the entire east side is in the state of uproar police officer shot it through the streets warning city folk to stay indoors for the night mobs of vast size or organizing under the lead of anarchists and socialists and threatened to plunder and to spoil\nThe houses of the rich who have wrong in the press them for so many years and it says the Fifth Avenue hotel will be the first to feel the fury of the mob the novel continue saying that an address in New York City where Trump Tower now stands would be where the truth should step in and save the building\n\nBy the way Trump Tower in case you're wondering is located on seven and twenty five Fifth Avenue\nIn New York the Waldorf Astoria hotel used to be there now it's Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue so how does this all happened\nHow was it that lock would was so accurate in predicting this\nSo this has been a number of people question about whether or not John Trump John gene trumps the uncle may have secretly stolen secret documents revealing Tesla's time travel experiments now of course this all sounds like fiction writer so of course it is fiction right\nHowever the truth now she even deeper the truth is stranger than any fiction and it paints a picture of a president that may have some knowledge about temporal transcendence San ... Donald Trump okay so I Want to take it back to that movie\nTomorrow and and the fictional secret society called plus ultra now according to the film\nPlus ultra comprised of the greatest minds throughout history\nPlus ultra was founded by Nikola Tesla Thomas Edison Eiffel H. G. wells all these people happiness legendary meeting of the top of the Eiffel Tower during the Eighteen eighty nine exposition universe out or the world's fair\nWells all these people happiness legendary meeting at the top of the Eiffel Tower during the Eighteen eighty nine exposition universe out or the world's fair\nAll the man in his so called fictional secret society or time travelers they abandon its world only to return again in different forms however\nHere since the here's where we break the fiction okay\nMar a Lago we all know at mar a Lago\nIs it so that Florida resort that has been considered the second home to President Trump\nWell\nIt yeah I guess it used to be the Camp David was where everybody hung out but now President Trump and his family go to mar a Lago\nAnd he's hosted world leaders at mar a Lago but ah I found out that it mar a Lago the sap they're called Donald Trump the king they call him the king kind of like Elvis\nAnd if you want to know\nThere are tiles on the walls and the floors of the mar a Lago resort in Florida and guess what words are on the tiles\nIn mar a Lago plus ultra plus ultra\nMeans further beyond\nIt was also inscribed is a warning on the two pillars of Hercules the two towers and they sat at the start at the\nStrait of Gibraltar which marked the edge of the unknown world meaning whatever is beyond those towers\nWhatever you do when you go through those towers whatever's beyond the towers is lost in time\n\nThinking about that for a moment Donald Trump\nIs uncle Newark Tesla and his work probably even knew of the time machine and the time travel stuff that Tesla came up with plus ultra\nSecret society revealed in a Disney movie where people like H. G. wells who\nCould have been a time travel who knows uh\nPeople like Nikola Tesla and others plus ultra is all over the tiles at mar a Lago and\nPresident Trump stays there this is uncanny coincidence I Believe I'm Kenny synchronous city that\nMakes you wonder about just who's in control and why certain things have happened and\nWhy it seems that we're all out of time and the time seems to be overlapping and at times seems to be giving is false choose and collected recall problems and ... Mandela facts and day job who\nAnd how history seems to be repeating itself war it's kind of repeating itself in rhyming in such a way that it's confusing the masses plus ultra\nThis is something that he goes beyond anything that I can even come up with but it's true if you look at the mar a Lago tiles I've got pictures of the mar a Lago tiles it says plus all true but it's written in the in the way it's P.

Trump\nWell here's the thing about plus ultra and this is why I Wonder if it's truly a fictional secret society and whether or not they are seeking societal time travellers and this is why mar a Lago he's a Florida resort that has been considered the second home to President Trump\nWhat's interesting about this ... this whole area in mar a Lago ... there are titles on the wall\nAnd those tiles ... plus ultra on them and Donald Trump likes to stay in these places where he's called the king now coincidentally there was a report that the recent video turned up ... Stanley Kubrick who's the director of two thousand what a space odyssey and described the end seemed to a filmmaker to what\nTwo thousand one of the space out she was about about an old man could stay in this\nVery posh hotel and that he was about to take a leap into another round of time listen to what he says to this uh filmmakers Japanese\nI click or ... or ... or ... or ... I'm Sorry I travel goes out of water you know for for a while that that what it was so long\nWithout good old lab or a sort of like a lot of ads for the for the ... own style hot in the house for law presented to them all\nMy heart her on her and found out her white now a\nHow and how hard for\nThe air with her ... her\nOn TALK right are are crying ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha\nOn our primary from Herman how marathon\nRight how I'm going on\nHer from\nOffice in our house burned down around with a very you know when our parents were out on a on a talk of hunger for however my prom and honoring her her now when when\n[noise] ... however my how her her out\nOn her hind ... aren't quite how I don't know why not [noise] an hour and when and how [noise]\nRight now no one point in her ... her online\nOur anyway and when they\nHappen to know how many [noise] ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha\nYou know [laughter] how from out a way I have the only guy for half an hour right now I'm not one on her own house\nSo he's describing the ... how he transforms over time\nWaiting in a room that's kind of like a zoo\nBut the aliens or whatever they may be the God like into these of energy use it created this to make him feel at home like a palace is it a palace and he's waiting for the years to pass and then he goes into another realm where he comes back to earth as sort of a Superman or a king or leader\nOkay and so\nI I look at a parallel there of what he says is the mythology because I've read Joseph Campbell and he talks about the Mona mythical hero we've had many presidents over time including Brooke Obama\nWhere they said that he was among the mythical heroes very strange about you know Obama's father not knowing much about his father kind of like Superman you know not knowing much about his father that kind of thing but with Donald Trump\nIt's like what do we know about his article what do we know about his father what do we know about his family what do we know about his relationship with Nikola Tesla what was it\nThat he found in those papers that were seized by that alien group or the government the FBI and why is it that he likes to stay in the U.S like what ... talked about this this place where plus ultra is all over the title [noise]\nAnd plus ultra is a fictional [noise]\nTime traveling secret society where H. G. wells ... Nikola Tesla Thomas Edison and Ray Bradbury and all these visionaries were a part of it it makes you wonder doesn't if tomorrow land is truly a predicted programming [noise]\nHis uncle and and then we have this plus old for a story out of the movie tomorrow land and it makes you wonder if there is a plus ultra group because it's really bizarre how you look at mar a mar a Lago and\nAll over there are tiles save plus ultra in that hotel\n[noise] as I can actually do you want better in terms of this idea of a parallel universe ... blood has wanted that things may holding try\nUh I don't know go ahead tell me what college yeah marvel exactly uh-huh [noise] All right\nWhat's one of the weird or concepts but Saudi around ... forty years ago the whole the whole mid seventies\nAnd my doctor strange [noise] nope segments dang thing what man thing yeah what the mutants no a\nPatch of swamp outside a little town called set yourself Florida that was called the Lexus of our reality it's\nA it's a multi first I'll play\nWell and yeah it is really weird and it's like we were saying earlier when everything went down with Trump people are protesting Trump's policies and he wasn't even president yet do you remember that\nYeah that was weird\nYeah they were all out there and when you go up to somebody and say well why are you protesting well we're protesting Trump's policies well he's not president yet I mean he ... he got elected but nobody knew of his policies but yet they were protesting his policies before I even had a chance\nTo see what his policies were they were already saying what he was before he even did anything and that's why he thought was weird it was almost like they had the cart before the horse or the or the effect before the cars and now the cause of this happening\nThe effects are now at going again and reverberating again into protests the resistance is starting up again it's just like some echo in time\nWent back and forth and fall back to that you know that lock would novel about a there's such a roar in the streets of New York at the hotel on Fifth Avenue has a lot we have to guard the hotel on Fifth Avenue and emerging\nPowers and socialism I'm surprised you mentioned in a lot of cases are possible predict a program on there was a little more optimistic that they ever they'll let looking backwards\nAnd what's that rebel and he's looking backward oh I'm going to call it weird weird yeah let me turn down the violence on say about it\nI I I was just pointing out she was because he was a number of allegedly a member of plus ultra that's all why brought up these do well\nI Know [noise] but you know\nWe did get points to adjust and I appreciate your calling it let's go to Steve in North Carolina Hi Stephen ground zero\n[noise] hey how ya doing first off let me say I'm a radio guy myself have been in business for Twenty years I Love your show you do a great\nJob you so much I appreciate that\nAnd um but yeah each seat Wales I I always figured it'd be a time traveler in fact when the when he wrote a time machine back in the late Eighteen hundreds he describes a nuclear war\nBefore anyone could even imagine it I mean I mean the first time we had a a at a bar I wasn't in the forties and he described and she may be five you know\nWhy I I find that interesting because he was talking about and and of course things to come or where he was talking about a war that would break out in Nineteen forty and it would be an evil dictator that would run that more\nWell wasn't until Nineteen forty one that this happened and of course Hitler was the was the guy and and also if you see the movie or things become it's all about\nThe power of the air or the power of the uh the flying machines and how the flying machines will advance to a point where uh they would use them in warfare and it'd be a be Asian would be a concern in the uh the idea of space being a battlefield would be a concern\nRight ... it's amazing how how it came to be an and like I say there was no way that you could just imagine that stuff in the late Eighteen hundreds he he had to be he had to see something\nYeah I mean he he was a visionary for sure but it all goes back to whether or not there is a plus ultra group that actually existed but there were a visionary that were time travelers like Tesla\nAnd and do stuff I fall and all these people are over time and Ray Bradbury and ... and all these guys whether or not they were involved\nAnd whatnot they didn't go to some other place where they were able to skate this world and maybe tests flu is one of the guys that made this possible and John Gee Trump was one of the guys who knew about it as well and maybe even Donald Trump knows about it too\nLike I say you're you're you're blowing my mind that I [laughter] it's just amazing how this all comes together I mean I ... something has to fit you know\nSomething something up I mean what got me though is I accidentally stumbled upon the mar a Lago to that because I was thinking to myself you know there's gotta be something more to this and when I saw plus ultra on the tiles at mar a Lago I thought wow this is this is too much\nRight [laughter] yeah it's crazy man or either the effect you for calling showed and I appreciate it by the way\nIt's going to Pete in Texas Hi Peter on ground zero\nHey clients have so quickly\nA lot of trying to ... bubbles hair a logical type type person but I don't doubt or the law that that's his secret societies to 'cause you could actually exist and I do like a ... the state that happens a lot into a political conversations and could could they have\nAlready were Lago where you have\nA lot of the the the plus also on these tiles\nCould not just be I don't want to say coincidence but more so a coincidence that Donald Trump was aware of his uncle and understanding the information that his uncle had\nSure it's all it's all I guess it's all a coincidence of course it can be all coincidence but you know look when you're looking at coincidences and you can name three four five six coincidences he seems a little bit weird when you have the pattern going on\nAnd and while what Laquan wrote may have nothing to do with plus ultra it just certainly all seems a bit I mean most of it's all based on fiction every writings in literature okay\nAnd plus ultra as a secret society we have a lock would writing what he wrote about with regard to Baron Trump in the last president we've got all these things that are kind of secret is really secret ethically ah mesh together may come together in such a way it's beautiful and it's synchronous thick and yeah it could\nBe all one big coincidence but boy it's one hell of a coincidence isn't it\n[laughter] it is a hell of a coincidence or just like ... so a lot now and the people the missionaries all all the time it's just that one visionary piggyback levels of one of the pools visionaries and it just always do with their storylines and it just seemed to be picked up in a mood here or a book here uh\nI I can tell you that Laura long ago that it had been built long before plus soldiers showed up in in a film by Disney\nYou realize that\nThe Trump is attached to John ... and then you still have a the the the\nThe ... it was so that was the G Trump film was John ... a member of basalt trip\nI couldn't tell you you guys know a\n... a real secret society or is this something that was just made up and it's just coincidental that plus ultra happens to be plastered all over mar a Lago\n... and and I I Would I Would say that it might ... right\nBut at the same time it's people probably just polls pieces into all within the within the world's how long do with the tallest place in la la though even if as long before the movie\nWill sure I'm sure it was about the movie came out last year or two ago I mean our law go just a few years ago\nYeah I mean so I mean mar a Lago acting belong being around a lot longer than that that was like Trump second home before he became\nPresident so you know that that's that's something that ah it's just odd that the king as they call him and then a pilot or palatial area where\nIt's kind of like what Cooper talked about an old man is in an area that's got all of this beautiful nice and neat stuff where he's like you to do and then he wished away by these guys came to tease and then he sent back to earth to become a Superman\n[laughter]\nI mean Cooper knew a lot about secret society we knew a lot about what was going on behind the scenes I mean as wide shots for example in the film we did that was basically revealing a lot of stuff in the background [noise]\nTo that stuff but I just I just figured I'd I'd I pitch and thought she was a little more how the how the the logical timeline and then you mentioned it earlier if someone can come my entire life they stay in a short book um that I I I think that's an amazing I\nYeah that yeah they could fit in pictures if they could but you know even when I went to snow they [noise] I Know even though I don't like the ... so he said well fact check this snow I did and they said it's partially true I don't know I don't know what part is partially true [noise]\nThis was like who is now thirty seven hundred will be back what do you think [laughter] [laughter]\n\nWhat happened you used to go hours
