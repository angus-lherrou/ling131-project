A. W. land air and water and it's jam packed with odd spooky raise the hair on the back of your neck true life stories of people who simply vanished as if into thin air\nThe circumstances in each of these cases are very specific to a pattern that was discovered by Dave and up by now\nHe's looked at thousands of these disappearances and some patterns have emerged on land around where water and as we will hear tonight in the air as well so this evening we will hear the latest including a few cases that are ongoing at this moment\nFresh mysteries that maybe you can help solve a David joins me and just a few minutes and we will jump right into it but those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with a refresher on the characteristics that make these particular cases stand out from a standard case of somebody who just gets lost in the woods or wilderness goes way beyond that\nAnd we will spend the next three hours talking about new evidence in cases he uncovered and then the last hour tonight I'm not sure what we're going to do I I think I'd like to hear from listeners your ideas about what's going on here why some people are seemingly taken a by whom\nAnd whether we will ever be able to resolve this so put your thinking caps on and be ready to jump into the discussion in our for also tried to save some time for you to interact with Dave as well in our three\nOne news out here in Las Vegas we're on the eve of a somber remembrance one year ago October first\nBut worst mass murder incident in American history unfold fifty eight people were gunned down that an outdoor concert on the strip hundreds were wounded or injured\nYou know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nThis appearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered them didn't make sense when they tried to find information that couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background ought to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal lead train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training they're smart people they understand what should be done\nAnd I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any less and they don't have any list of missing people in their parks and jurisdictions and uh we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues to ... refiled and they came back an attorney called this time it's like why do you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that as a determining factor in for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said well research\nAnd then he came back and he said well we don't have any listened missing people I said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol and you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are to the detectives\nSo somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or accumulate list at headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it\nAnd said no we don't have any less so years ago somebody said well David you ought to just file a request and see how many rolls of toilet paper it Yosemite National park I bet they have that inventory list\n[laughter] and of course they would but as it happened they came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my authors status\nAs an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough libraries to qualify there's no such thing qualifier are just some arbitrary thing they said\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together the lesser I Want to list from Yosemite and I want to was from the national Park Service\nAnd they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system and I can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting to us from their entire system because they still say they don't have it\nAnd I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll say it right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets\nAnd we'll put a clip boards at every park and every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating the list and they could hire an intern during the summer that can screen the monthly reports to come in the Park Service\nScratch doing it now of course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it but as you've stated and many others after you nobody believes them they say that the list exists\nWell a ... if they're gonna charge one point four million more than a list exist um you know it's it's pretty clear they don't want to cooperate on this that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it and\nWe're going to explore and maybe some of the reasons behind it up for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the ... points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books and the kinds of things that you look for\nSome people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people\nYou're not going to get a lot when you read a thousand certain things started jumping out at you and when I went through my third three hundred four hundred five hundred read reports started making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four or five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that's about a Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine search and rescue they can't I Can't find a set and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked at a canine unit on the SWAT Team for a number of years our dogs had about a Ninety nine percent capture rate\nAnd probably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be [noise]\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time to train a dog a lot\nThere might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the scent isn't there I've had reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person who was last seen they walk a foot they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out like they don't want to search or they have no interest\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change of weather event\nIf the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times\nThe time of the disappearance a high high percentage of the time is three four five PM many of the victims have some type of disability illness or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can explain what happened to him water plays a key role in this either the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water\nBoulders and granted play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world to Seventy national park\nWell that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but granted place much more of a role as I have explained in many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation\nYou're walking down the trail with your friend your loved one\nAnd they walk ahead of you you fall behind them at that point of separation something happens and that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that and interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's when it happens\nIt's almost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family\nThat's when they move in yeah\nAuction and this is a this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and ...\nThere was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with the searches and then people talk about other equipment their car other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this [noise]\nAnd then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and I've never been found\nIt's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared but isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a\nMedical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in the specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there's a this geographical crushed during that I figured out why after I started putting Ken's at a U.S map when I started to track this years ago\nAnd right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada\nNow there are other locations in Lebanon other countries of the world where these this exact same sort of thing happening a lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book struggle to get rolling and people are different parts of the world read them\nThey say hey you know I live in New Zealand we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing UK same thing Canada same thing in Spain in the eighties worse I mean you'd be surprised how this fits into this little niche\nUm\nAnd it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred and thirty five cases and its men women there's four to one ratio direct\nAny idea why why so many more men than women maybe more men are up in the outdoors and out there alone\nYeah yeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women I\nGuess\nWe're talking with David ... about his latest work missing for one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they raised the hair on the back of your neck of the Beatles take us into the break we'll be right back\nParameters because that that information becomes key you picking the cases that usually ruin on I mean there are metrics there are there's data um for search and rescue 'em\nYeah how how they proceed and in a huge database and I would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times times they want there is a case from eighty six\nI'm an era the girl's name was ... she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody's looked at the case in Twenty years in a special agent there told me I'll never see that case it's a standard missing persons case\nThere's no suspect there's no crime why can't I see it um and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal uh everything else in the law enforcement world is criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against the law to go missing if you want to fall out of society you can and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's gonna emanates from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle years somebody\nWith these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lot of times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good and I don't understand why there and want us to see it but there's this\nI called territorial behavior and many of the times they won't grant you access now in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to be disposed to the public tunnel crust Colorado has that laws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law but\nYou have to be disposed to the public upon the crust Colorado has outlaws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states don't and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything um so the first thing is you got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say this George you really can't trust the media\nBecause I Would say eighty percent of the time when I finally get a copy of the report\nThe news reports are totally completely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened\nAnd I like to think back Thirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's this superficial job of collecting information\nBecause it's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that um you know reporters just regular beat reporters who get assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case\nYou know like outside of Las Vegas and then a couple that you and I've talked to him up before it's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement if there's a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of this scene um who tells you specifics here the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take it further you you've heard of them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they really don't want to tell the story of what's going on 'cause it's too weird to explain\nYou know makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether they don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or they don't want to give me the information because they have in a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know they don't want to have to answer questions about what do you think\nI think that the people the front line people that you see when you go into the parks heart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on\nIt's the people at the top tier in the government that are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed and communicated\nAnd it's those individuals that have this\nThey exude this belief that if their stuff\nIt's not yours and you're not going to get it\nAnd I don't understand it I Can't explain it and every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports\nWhen a sheriff's office help on a search and they had some of the report from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything and so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and I got ... I wasn't supposed to get that but\nThen it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare\nLet's talk about a couple of current cases uh you you sent me some information about one Samantha Sayers what's the deal there\n[noise] so twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete came from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle She liked to go to this a location a call ... ... per ... V. E. S. P. E. R.\nAnd she went there in August first this year it's about six thousand two hundred and twenty feet elevation two miles northeast a spate of lake twenty five ... five miles east of the ocean port is Suzanne\nIf you know they shouldn't two miles northeast a spade a lake twenty five ... five miles east of the ocean Puerto Suzanne [noise] round trip hike up about seven eight miles twenty seven hundred foot gain going up\nAnd a Thirteen hundred foot scrambled to the top so I live in Colorado I can tell you that that really isn't much here but in in Washington that's a pretty good hike and the mountains there it just sixty two hundred feet look a lot like the mountains here fourteen thousand feet\nWell\nSamantha did a lot right she told her boyfriend where she was going when she'd be back and he was the kind of guy that kept track of her well when she didn't check in with him\nHe reacted the right way he wouldn't go he went out and look for her while the investigation showed that she made some at some time to in between two and three in the afternoon and some other individual man saw her at the ... summit in communicated with her\nWell that was the subsequent investigation her boyfriend Kevin arrived at them out and about ten pm started running the trails yelling for screaming for\nEventually published in the homeless county sheriff and the search was on so that was on August first well that search went on for about twenty two days three hundred and fifty seven air operations that is extraordinary that's locked\nHundred and five hours of drone time a three hundred and twenty nine hours of difference our personnel the\nFamily was on the scene everyday when you look at the area the majority of the time she was above what looked to be Timberline there isn't much up at the top of desperate to pretty wide open area\nAnd for them not to be able to find her under these circumstances is really really unusual they had cadaver dogs they had sent tracking dogs that everything you can imagine there to help\nWell eventually when the sheriff and the search and rescue personnel pulled out I mean that's that's a check on reality time if you're the family because you're looking at going back to Pennsylvania without your daughter and basically just checking it in with no more assistance\nBut his family had a lot of gumption they start pushing harder or they did some Kickstarter campaigns\nAre trying to pay for food and things for friends that were just staying on site and searching day and night will eventually and I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom and the mom and I communicated and that kind of gave them this road map\nAnd it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports otherwise you're just going to be replicating that exact same effort that search and rescue stung before that a lot of instances that may turn some results because\nPeople are found in areas that have been previously search that's true but if they have a lot of area where they say that they haven't searched it very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do not Syria you really want to give it a big push [noise]\nBut the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff the sheriff wouldn't get many reports the search and rescue people weren't given him any reports and they were getting frustrated now this is the same thing I tell every family and if there's one listening out there is is what you have to do\nYou don't go to the local news media and so you you understand this church\nIs the local news media has to deal with the sheriff in that county day in and day out for the rest of their lives they can't burn a bridge they can't here and get 'em irritated they have to live with them but they national bureaus Fox CBS NBC CBS\nIrritated they have to live with them but they national bureaus Fox CBS NBC CBS the national bureaus you want to get one of those people in there and you want them to start stirring it up and then you want to send a family member down to the congressman or the senator's office\nAre you among the millions of Americans living with chronic pain you're still ... you may think prescription opioids are the solution a\nTruce is opioids only ... the pain\nAnd they come with serious side effects from ... to withdrawal symptoms to overdose there is another choice physical therapy physical therapists treat me through movement and exercise shoes physical therapy visit move forward P.

year going into his third year he took his first vacation in eight years\nAnd he traveled to Oregon to check into some possible residency and so he was kind of mixing business with pleasure you told the family wanted to see some wildlife mother told her son at the time never to hike alone please don't do that Steven\nOn June nineteenth you flew into Portland international airport got a vehicle from run Iraq a Chevrolet Cavalier drove to Portland youth hostels checked in and paid cash for Thirteen nights I'm sort of paid Thirteen nights with his credit card\nNow law enforcement reports state on June twentieth Steven called his parents on their on his borrowed cell phone from them said he had arrived all was well checked in things were great manager of the hotel said Steven usually left before the others will look he was last seen on June twenty second or the twenty third\nAnd he was seen at night and a suit saying that the residency interviews had gone really well and he was happy\nOn June twenty second he drove his vehicle from the hostile to the salmon Huckleberry wilderness twenty five miles southeast to Portland and completed the trail permit to enter the same in the wilderness\nAnd they stop people here right now and tell you that you may think that when you complete those trail permits and put them in that little metal box that somebody's reading those and it's going to follow up and make sure that you come out\nThose trail permits are never reviewed and they're only used to see the load of people on the trail there never checked to see if you came out there ... worthless some don't ever count on those\nBut on June twenty third a pair of hikers ... Stevens card the trail had early in the morning and believed it had to be a day hiker but they were there really early\nWell they exit the trail later that day and they still solve the\nAnd believed it had to be a day hiker but they were there really early\nWell they executed the trail later that day and they still solve the car there and it bothered them and they felt so strongly that something was wrong that they called the sheriff and a deputy came out Rand registration on the rent Iraq and the vehicle came back register to a family\nAnd the registration hadn't been turned over to rent a wreck yet so the deputy left a message on the machine of the family who still owned the car on the registration system and he left well\nSteven was return was supposed to return to Detroit on July second and parents were at the airport and he didn't arrive\nWell they called the Portland police tried to file a missing persons report and they were told that you couldn't file a missing persons report unless you were there in person you know so the next day hope and Larry got on a plane and flew to Portland\nAnd the ... the search and rescue finally get down the trail and it seemed that some assistance from the national guard Keenan since our teams\nSearchers faced rain and wet conditions for many of the days but again the searched and searched for days after he really went missing and are hoping Larry praised the attitude of the volunteer searchers but stated that they were highly disappointed in the deputies\nThey said that the search didn't last long and was terminated without finding anything endeavor dogs were later put into that area I never picked up ... percent\nThey uh they had a psychic approach them and the psyche went with them and some for service people down the trail the Cambridge switched back look down the cliff they saw little T. P. structure made a little trees lying on the ground\nAnd they said that down there you'll find Stevens glasses and that's where he died search and rescue went down there but they didn't bring their medical metal detector and it's like you said you needed that defined it but they never found it nothing was ever from there and\nThey are hoping they said that they are now any communications with the sheriff in years none never with the forest service Stevens never been found\nStarting a surgeon was two weeks after the disappearance is a very very difficult task and right here I'll say that Carol turned her when she disappeared in her park she at least left left a message on the inside of her car indicating when she was going to be out\nNow I see this every conference and I said on every time on among with you people need to carry a purse to locate or be can cost about two hundred and two hundred and fifty bucks there is no monthly service fee you can get them on Amazon\nYou activated it sends a signal to a satellite that someone needs help immediately they'll find you within eight feet they dispatched search and rescue I carry one every time I go out\nAnd I I Would say that probably Ninety five percent of these cases could be quickly remedied if everyone carried one of these\n... whole lot of things went wrong in this game a just a comedy of errors it's not very comedic though I mean but I you know search it starts that late you don't have much of a chance of succeeding you\nI don't think you do um first of all he wasn't real acclimated to the area didn't understand the dangers probably wasn't dressed for success probably didn't have a backpack with them I doubt if he even had a Geological Survey map of the region\nBut when you go in an area like this there's so many things that can happen yeah I mean I tell people that you could go down this trail and if it's a trail that isn't very active you could be on the trail five or six miles\nYeah I mean I tell people that you could go down the trail and if it's a trail that isn't very active you could be on the trail five or six miles down and break your leg on the trail and die on the trail\nAnd that doesn't that hasn't happened because it has and something very simple like this can ruin your life when you could just have this little device that could save your wife\nYou mentioned about the psychic that got involved in this case have you ever employed disturbances of a psychic or have you ever in the end of the cage where it's like it was used and they provided information that turned out to be accurate\nTell your story is um there's a remote viewer who's on coast to coast fairly frequently he will go unnamed but he he claimed he contacted me that he could find missing people and I asked him if he had ever found anybody and it gave me the name of this person\nAnd I listen to 'em and I said okay I'll I'll give you a case and during that week that I didn't talk to them I contacted this victims wife I said hey did this person to help you in finding your husband\nShe goes she didn't do anything he never found him he never gave me any valuable information my husband was found on other means by other searchers doing other things blah blah blah on and on\nGeorge I'm a guy that has really open mind and I will use anybody when somebody lies to me I won't use them ever again and that person blatantly lied to me and in other remote viewing cases there was one guy at a conference with a ... a couple of years ago really nice guy\nAnd the information he gave me wasn't even coast in the realm of possible\nNow there's another guy who's a remote viewer that I'm trying to work with right now hopefully he's better but as far psychics I did a conference in LA about two years ago and there were seven or eight psychics own this row at a this outside area at the conference and\nTowards the end I walked down this road introduced myself to every one of the psychic said what I did what I could use their services for and each one of them said yeah yeah yeah we want to help you want to help for sure yeah we could do this I email each one of them the next week\nWhen I got back and

it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that the person who told me that in D.C had brought them your books and and your subject matter\nI Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are gonna want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs can you summarize that one\nSure I'd separate twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy five nine thirty occurred on the island of mall if an island in Scotland fifty five years old a Gibbs was a war hero he was an intellect and he was a pilot spit fires and the battle of Britain in Nineteen forty\nHe was staying at a place called the Glenn force a hotel and it sat right on the ocean northeast side of the island them all and there was a graph airstrip there and the rooms were right next to the airfield looking at the water [noise]\nHe arrived at the hotel on December twenty if on December twenty thirty contacted the owner of a Cessna one fifty parked at the stripped and asked if he could fly it\nIn Hamilton was the attorney negotiated a price to fly the two seater and on Christmas Eve Nineteen Seventy five at nine thirty Gibbs walked out to the plane with a hotel guests named ... city Granger\nAnd she thought she was going to go with him on a flight but he told her no she had to lay out the torches suit can fly and land so she exits the plane places the torches out in the field and he or she sees him taking off the plane flying out over the water\nNow some reports say that after he took off they saw strange lights on the water some people said and it might have been a fishing boat but they could never identified the boat and they could never see where the lights went\nWill make a long story short Gibbs didn't return on the plane and there was a major search on and off the island for days and they found nothing and they found a sheep herders and ranchers that search all their property they got nothing\nWell on April twenty first Nineteen Seventy six is about four months after the disappearance\nGives his body is found on an oil\nAnd this is an amount and it's like an oil near the airfield and he has a small scratch on his chin nothing else and a shepherd took part in the\nLike an oil near the airfield and he has a small scratch on his chin nothing else and a shepherd took part in the original search and he walked by the spot where the body was found multiple times and never saw it\nNow if given the jump from the airplane there should have been more injuries and broken bones\nAnd they never found the plane [noise] nothing physically was wrong with him so he could walk back to the hotel the best everyone could tell\nThe corners David the cause of death was exposure meaning hypothermia and you get that he probably died two hours after take off or they examine his clothing and there was no salt or marine organisms on the body that means he didn't go into the ocean and crawl out\nUnanswered questions were is what were the lights on the water\nReally how did you get there\nReally how long has he been dead where was the plane\nAnd then my notes on this I write down GHB again because there's no reason for a man to die of exposure on the top of a mountain when people get cold they get up and they walk you don't lay down and die\nObviously the top of a mountainous colder than the bottom or where you could see humanity from the top of this mountain strange case\nYou know I've seen a some people respond to some of your cases that the weird ones where the clothing is missing and I've seen people trying to explain in a way of saying people do weird things when hypothermia sense and they'll take off their clothes and ... and walk into snow and and do things that seem logical um\nBut how would you respond to those kinds of ah remarks and would sit here doesn't seem to\nWell one of the things is I work for cases that are insurmountable meaning that explanation doesn't fit I have several cases where somebody leaves the house and within a hundred yards of the house they find a pile of clothes\nAnd the person left the house and it was Seventy degrees or yeah later that night to get down to fifty but the person left the house and they're in a hundred yards all their clothes is gone and they're in a\nStack in this field is is happened multiple times also I've had other cases where a parent says might they be couldn't take off their clothes so if somebody saying they remove their clothes and they died hypothermia good luck with that because the kid couldn't take off their clothes\nSo the cases I Try to include try I Try to explain this rationally\nNow there's a group out there that don't want to understand this and they want to explain it away with the boogie kind of stuff and that's fine but the reality of it is is that there's there's usually no rational explanation for why this stuff happens\nYou know in the alien abductions field I don't know if you've read any of that there are some cases that are almost humorous that word there'll be somebody who's taken\nBy some entities and they come back in their clothes Ron backwards or she was missing or I'm against somebody else's underwear on a or they're rare cases where multiple people say they're taken and their clothing is switched when they wake up in the morning\nI'm no there can be all kinds of explanations for why people take their clothes off\nA that don't involve aliens but it it reminded me of some of the cases that you have in your books where\nPeople's clothing is found its kinda folded up it's a it's neatly placed somewhere away from people and um it's not torn up as a by bears or something it's just weird\nI've written of cases in this book\nSpecial notes were made that the clothing and the body was impeccably clean like it just came out of a laundromat and the body just came out of a shower and they couldn't explain why everything was so clean\nAnd you have cases where bodies or kids are found they'd been missing for a couple of days they'd been in the wilderness no food or water and there's not they're not really they they're not whether there is not like they've they've been out in the in the open up for very long at all\nCorrect so where are they where do they go well the same thing applies to the water\nRelated cases when when the bodies of water it just certain things that we know certain things to the hair loss of hair rink ring of body fingernails things like that and when these bodies were pulled out\nQuarters that made statements that well the person disappeared on Monday but they've only been in the water for twenty four hours but they've been gone for six days so worthy wherever they been for all this time\nAnd that's important to behind finding a body especially of water\nBecause it shows things that it wouldn't show otherwise\nIt's almost like it's a ... or a harvesting that whoever whomever or or whatever\nIs taking people it needs something from them unless it's just malicious it needs something from 'em and and some\n... some of these people never come back at all and some are just discarded or when they're not needed anymore um I mean I I Know you're reluctant to go that far but it it's sort of what it feels like\nOne of the questions I get all the time is are these people ever found to be abused sexually abused things missing from the body if not the case\nIf they are found there are some pretty much intact without a lot of injury to him I mean one of the things that people have said a lot is that what they what they're doing is they're taking the sole\nWell I mean I don't know how you measure that\nYeah I don't either\nBut I've heard those kinds of allegations of uh what some other intelligence ... what their interest in us might be and it's it's a tough one to prove I don't know what it would take for you\nWhat kind of evidence that would take for you to reach a conclusion I guess it would take maybe film or video of of one of these um incidence underway\n... when we first started this trip together years ago people said oh he knows what it is you know it right it's got to be something mundane it may be some crypto topic that he just doesn't want to talk about\nWe've come a long ways and I think if you start shutting the door to early you can't see really what may be obvious years later\nAnd that's one of the reasons I've been reluctant to say anything that\nYou know may be a possibility 'cause it may close that door for me\nI mean I was thinking where we are today versus where I was six years ago in a huge difference\nWe're talking with Dave ... missing for one one land air water in a moment I'm an open up the phone lines you can ask David a couple of questions yourself we'll be right back\n[noise] anyhow um when we went um Mm came back out of the mountain um we met up with a couple of other um searchers and I'm One gentleman had found some future pansies\n'em and they tried calling the nine one one non emergency number and they tell search and rescue and they never called back um and another lady um they were and that generally smell decaying flesh at certain points I'm In there and they they tracked down their phones they could give it the end of\nUm you know I I don't know ... and it was three payments on her cell phone into an excuse me one of them didn't make any sense with way off to the left or the or where you park your car it's not even with the trail is um\nAnyhow I'm I'm just kind of thinking you know I've thought of what could be and I said hey maybe portals to another dimension\nUm big foot big for my the guy was within his brother had seen big for a couple of times up in their family and I've seen a shift is twenty five feet above me\nAnd it also an underground\nSecret naval base on their own land strange enough um it's\nOn the back side of the mountain

leave your information with a with a Donna our call screener tonight and I'm David might want to talk to you but I appreciate calling in and sharing that with us\nWe're going west of the Rockies Roger in Bellevue, Washington Hi Roger\nAnd it's a thank you George a mission that um\nI Want it to a related story to or Mr polite is uh\nAbout a missing people are in the uh Bellingham uh area of a Washington state\nUh that are over several years at least a recent and in the past uh have turned up missing a and a later on some of their body part and mainly their feet have shown up in the uh\nIn a water are in different areas and uh [noise] and since the during that time period or my wife and I had a\nHad the misfortune of happening in a missing son and uh he was a very well trained a boy scout and uh we figured that uh you know that uh since it's been two years now\nThat uh you know it's a well nothing ... nothing has turned up in terms of evidence or anything like that so the uh the local law enforcement closed the case and ah and because he's an adult we can't go forward with it because of this a wife\nAnd a and so we're we've been kind of stuck with that but I wanted to find out if I'm Mr a polite says are being aware of this a phenomenon of uh\nOf defeat a issue and uh it's it's been a well publicized and newspapers and hand over there\nKnow what I mean I'm sure you've heard of that and ah you know if you wanted to try to contact them we have a we have links on that close to ... his website is can am missing dot com that's where you reach\nYou try to contact and we have a we have links on the coast to coast website his website is can am missing dot com that's where you reach a Dave I I Know he knows about the ... the story because it was a widely publicized but your son um what are the circumstances where did that happen and when\n[noise] okay uh if it happened in Bellingham in it happened or just on the outskirts of town and uh he basically what happened a bit and this happened two years ago October uh\nHe uh he\nHad left home and uh we believe that maybe there may have been uh\nSome friction at home but uh he had left home and he got into this vehicle and evidently it ran out of gas in a can didn't have any money to get gas so he took up walking\nAnd it was nightfall at the time and he tried to call him and his wife back in a that was the last that they had heard from him a ... when he had stated that his phone was dying and he was lost and lost in the woods somewhere and couldn't find its way out\nAnd uh and and then we had a a massive search uh for the next two days in a row with uh with uh the law enforcement we also had a\nHad helicopters they had dogs they had a drones uh I'm In their cupboard a area over ten mile stretch and nothing at all showed up period and ah we were just show\nA broken over that uh and uh\nAnd since then uh I have actually personally myself I have called in and talked to a few times to some of the people that actually investigated on it\nAnd they just basically told me that uh that they were a a ... ... they were basically are held by the laws of the state in and of course the\nThe wife uh uh that uh any information given out the would be specifically only given to her and uh and that the parents couldn't find out anything you know after that so\nWell under that reason why\nYeah I'd like to try to uh maybe a get a shot at a you know talking to David I'm his brightest and she would uh see what he thinks\nI I Would just you try that website or that okay but that is but also you can leave your name and number with Donna and uh I'll pass on to Dave I'm that's a\nThat's a rough story due to uh tell on the radio I'm sure I thank you for sharing it with us and you know I can imagine that that's a whole that never goes you right in the fact that you just don't know it was just a is brutal\nThank you Roger thanks for calling in would try to get one more call in before we go to a break a Joe in Long Island on the east of the Rockies Bonnie Hi Joe Hi\nGeorge ah I did a couple of seasonal gigs to national parks a glacier in the valley in Alaska and one thing I Would say uh especially looking at an alley the infrastructure of the park is very limited\nUh they have like a road that goes to mount McKinley that ... is winding mountain road that bus it can take a bus no real hiking trails\nAnd if you go off the uh those roads like the flooding would be bad for hiking so\nI I I Would say it and I will correlate to slip glacier are they really on the play just how treacherous a trail\nIt would be on latches on actual trials that are like twenty miles trails for like two three four miles\nSo I I think a lot can go wrong uh and uh you know if someone was like say by themselves and they hurt their ankle and cutting for feed\nA that I don't know anything could happen with the wild animals that would be one thing now I don't think\nUh what's happening as some sort of Charles Manson group that are looking to just five isolated hikers and do something\nWith them I never really got the impression although I read that like criminals with hideout Yellowstone for example I don't think that people go to those parks to like\nA just a pounce on someone that's an isolated hiker so I I I I Would speculate that that's not what ... what is happening uh but uh I I think what David Sanger about the national parks is very little supervision people are\nAre you know there are just off on their own toward the gray and I've done that including myself a at a number of times where something happened on the trail\nUh nobody would have no where I was at one more thing on that is my ... theory is what you said about the birds\nA swooping down I did see a Glacier National park like these tiny birds but they almost right on the ground I forget what it says it looked like something from Jurassic Park for like do wander effects or a moat right there is some sort of\n... historic bird that might be out there but that's my coast to coast theory [noise]\nUm you know the idea that they're criminals in the national parks national forest I think that's probably true you know they're criminals pretty much everywhere that humans go uh in addition you have a lot of people who are ... grow weed out there in in the\nWilderness places and uh and would do anything to protect it and um\nYou know but those kinds of cases are generally weeded out of the day but database if we're talking about people who vanished I'm under very strange and specific kinds of circumstances\nAnd there is no tracks there was no indication that people are around uh that they can vanish within a few feet of their family members or the people or hiking with so it's very weird and I don't think that the criminals being out there could explain\nPretty much any of the cases that are a boiled down and David books but a appreciate that thought or we're gonna take a break now and there's a lot of folks on the phone lines of we'll get to do as many of your calls as we can I noticed a couple of folks have their own stories with the encounters strange and counters in the woods and\nYou know it's been a while since I've been a hiking out in in the wilderness areas but um when I can understand how the elements can ah can sort of close in on you a little bit and uh it it gets pretty creepy out there sometimes the we're going to go to the break the ... take us into the break and we'll be right back\nOf fate and it was just walking on a plane and then both parts later on a couple of weeks later or if you got to there's a company\nAnd it never was never nothing was ever said about it every year you know anything about that or\nI don't know anything about that specific a creature or creature report but I Do know that the the ... I'm a I'm area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff for a very long time\nOr the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena Utah spend some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories rumble locals including the tribe\nAnd had reported the number of different kinds of creatures it's always been a UFO hotspot or at least for the last fifty or so years so there's a lot of weird stuff concentrated in the area you're discussing uh but no I hadn't heard the story about the\nThe um things pulling people out of their sleeping bags at ... like thanks for sharing that do appreciate it we're going to go east to the Rockies to Roy in Youngstown, Ohio morning Roy\nDoing All right what's on your mind\nA um I remember um this evening a you guys were talking about a day but part of the city are you were talking about ... right and uh\nAnd I literally stood up and said that and I pointed at the radio because I read all the books I've read all the full on what books I've read the skin ... book\nAnd I've been calling this thing for some time for several years or ... warfare\nAt all kinds of things to come to mind a rich lived a certain number of disappearances\nAre a lot of disappearances happened on or near rich line and I just couldn't walk her ranch that's on a ridge line\nUh let's see uh a hundred percent success rate every time an individual is taking no one ever sees him being taken\nOver the skin Walker ranch we're dealing with with with something that is highly intelligent and it knows when ... somebody's on the property or on around I mean it's just to me I I'm just saying to me a ad in my opinion I think that you know the the skin Walker ranch uh\nIs very close to uh the the phenomenon around and go for one one\n[noise] well I you know I think there are some similarities in it then it is whatever it is it seems to be intelligent and it seems to know what people are doing before they do it themselves and it's still the that's for sure the only difference is there at skin Walker to my knowledge no one has disappeared animals they're here but not people you\nKnow there has not been any people missing but there's been a you know yeah I mean that's the other side that we have had animals missing but then we've also had mutilation to\nYou know the thing that doesn't fit there would be that ah when people have gone missing there's been no explanation of a gouge marks on them either than scrapes and things like that no no kind of like probing or or something of an alien and would do when you read a function stories and things like that\nBut that that doesn't fit but as far as rich lines go um and uh and the high intelligent or is it a hundred percent success rate or no one ever sees sees it ah that that to me is uh some good strong march there\nBut thanks thanks for sharing your impressions with is that a lot to chew on ... you calling in we're going to go to a wildcard line Mario in San Antonio Texas a he has a ... he wants to tell us about welcome\nWelcome George I have a ticket for taking my call I wanted to be my\nExperience or this year at a park in San Antonio which they added another ... miles up bike trail connect a couple of parks\nAnd found is wooded area where even do was daylight at the time almost literally mean my wife were using all by slowing down the trail of course I was a little ahead of her and uh we've got that is one area where it got kind of dark even though it was daylight split it was sold would is that it was\nThe sun sunlight shining through as much as I start kinda got kind of dark in that area and when I stopped to see what my wife was that I noticed some kind of something just staring at it and it was that going on the stump they look more like a bird\nOut but ah you know you never know I mean they kind of felt like it was like seven feet tall Dixie\nAnd just that and then on the stump just a staring at me and my wife when she approached a mean looking at something she's ... and we kind of look kind of stunned that each other and I said did you see that and she's like yeah\nSo when they saw was just awesome we just saw it back a bit flying away but the wingspan was so large that wasn't um\nIt was like a regular bird you know I mean we have ducks and I'm ... and all kinds of stuff and not spend a park nearby but this is a real heavy area would it\nBetween parks where they had made a bike trail and that's all it is and so I just want to share my story 'cause I Know we didn't report it to know pastor or any park rangers anything but why don't we didn't have no way\nAnd so I just wanted to share my story 'cause I Know we didn't record it to know cops are are in the park rangers and said well why don't we didn't have no evidence is too it's kinda hard to believe that ... could be that big and we were just two people just riding bikes than a a\n[noise] a lie down some kind of record about something that we just saw\nSo a ... you said this thing is seven feet tall did it have just like a regular bird's face or or do you remember what coloring on animals\nAll you saw was kind of like a maybe something ... his eyes kind of like blowing just like if you just see a beer in the dark Cold War or something like that you knew staring at you but you you could just see us up like a form of shape\nBut you couldn't really chilling exact details especially when there was an that this that and I think the first thing you know I Know what it was a sense that something was staring at me and that's why that's so it made me ...\nAnd ... when I looked at my wife and I'm looking at it and I look at that point so a close second\nShe turned around and just try and fly away so I could ever really feel bad like handle arms of the detail all I knew it was huge because we used to have chickens and and do stuff like that it was nothing like that\nA Mario thanks for sharing that story and that's the amount of uh that's kinda creepy stuff for she ate the specific detail that you had on that a while that's quite an experience uh Jason in Portland, Oregon as inexperienced are here with us decent welcome\nFlow George it's an honor to talk to you I'm always nervous when I call in [laughter] no need your you're among friends what's on your mind\nThank you very much um I had an encounter way up in the woods and I've had a lot of strange encounters in my life and I have a very rational go analytical brain that overrides things and so it wasn't until years later I started putting\nAll the facts together [laughter] and so the facts are I'm going I'm hiking into one of my favorite little fishing lakes\n[noise] that's basically off of an old logging road\nWell when the forest service closes a logging road what they do and this logging road had been closed for a long time they bring in a major excavator and they dig a huge trench on both ends of the logging road\nAnd pile up a big mountain of the debris and boulders and things like that so it's impossible to drive a car or any vehicle down that road again\nYou can kinda hike around it and even at times on your own two feet that can be very difficult because it's heavily wooded dishes in the coast range and it's basically rain forest a terrain [noise]\nSo I'm walking down the trail and I ...

A. W. land air and water and it's jam packed with odd spooky raised the hair on the back of your neck true life stories of people who simply vanished as if into thin air\nThe circumstances in each of these cases are very specific to a pattern that was discovered by Dave and up by now\nHe's looked at thousands of these disappearances and some patterns have emerged on land around ... water and as we will hear tonight in the air as well so this evening we will hear the latest including a few cases that are ongoing at this moment fresh mysteries that maybe you can help solve\nA David joins me and just a few minutes and we will jump right into it but those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with a refresher on the characteristics that make these particular cases stand out from a standard case of somebody who just gets lost in the woods or wilderness goes way beyond that\nAnd we will spend the next three hours talking about new evidence in cases he uncovered and then the last hour tonight I'm not sure what we're going to do I I think I'd like to hear from listeners your ideas about what's going on here why some people are seemingly taken a by whom\nAnd whether we will ever be able to resolve this so put your thinking caps on and be ready to jump into the discussion in our for also tried to save some time for you to interact with Dave as well in our three\nOne news note here in Las Vegas we're on the eve of a somber remembrance one year ago October first\nBut worst mass murder incident in American history unfolded fifty eight people were gunned down that an outdoor concert on the strip hundreds were wounded or injured\nYou know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information that couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it [noise]\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal lead train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training they're smart people they understand what should be done\nAnd I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any list and they don't have any list of missing people in their parks and jurisdictions and ah we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues ... refiled and they came back an attorney called this time it's like why do you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that as a determining factor in for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said wow research\nAnd then it came back and he said well you don't have any of us and missing people I said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol and you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are to the detectives\nSo somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or accumulate list at headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it\nAnd said no we don't have any less so years ago somebody said well they are just file a request and see how many rules of toilet paper at Yosemite National park I bet they have that inventory list\n[laughter] and of course they would but as it happened they came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my author status\nAs an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough libraries to qualify there's no such qualifiers just some arbitrary thing they said [noise]\nThen I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together the lists I Want to list from Yosemite and I want to list from the national Park Service\nAnd they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system and I can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago have [noise]\nBut nobody's ever been successful in getting the list from their entire system because they still say they don't have it and I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll say it right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets\nAnd we'll put a clip boards at every park and every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating the list\nAnd they could hire an intern during the summer that can screen the monthly reports to come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now of course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it\nBut as you've stated in many others after you nobody believes them they say that there's a list exists\nWell a ... if they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exist um\nYou know it's it's pretty clear they don't want\nTo cooperate on this that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it and I'm so night we're going to explore maybe some of the reasons behind it up for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the ... points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books and the kinds of things that you look for\nSome people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people\nYou're not going to get a lot when you read a thousand certain things start jumping out at you and when I went through my third three hundred four hundred and five hundred read reports started making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that's about a Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine strip search and rescue the canine ths can't find a set and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked in a canine unit on the SWAT Team for a number of years our dogs had about a Ninety nine percent\nRate and probably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be [noise]\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time the train a dog a lot\nThere might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the scent isn't there a bad reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person was last seen they walk a foot they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out like they don't want to search or they have no interest [noise]\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change of weather event\nIf the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times\nThe time of the disappearance a high high percentage of the time is three four five PM many of the victims have some type of disability illness or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can't explain what happened to them water plays a key role in this either the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water\nBoulders and granted play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world she was Seventy national park\nWell that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but granted plays much more of a role as I explained and many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation\nIt plays much more of a role as I explained in many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation you're walking down the trail with your friends your loved one and they walk ahead of you you fall behind them that point of separation something happens\nAnd that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that and interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's when it happens\nIt's almost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family that's when they move in\nYeah equipment malfunction and this is a this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prior books\nThere was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with the searches and then people talk about other equipment their car other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this [noise]\nAnd then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and I've never been found\nIt's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared but isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a\nMedical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in the specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there's a this geographical clustering that I figured out why after I started putting pins in a U.S map when I started to track this years ago\nAnd right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada\nNow there are other locations in Lebanon other countries of the world where these this exact same sort of thing happening a lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book started to get rolling and people are different parts of the world right um [noise]\nThey say hey you know I live in New Zealand we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing UK same thing Canada same thing in Spain in the eighties worse I mean\nYou'd be surprised how this fits into this little niche\nUm\nAnd it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cases and its men women as four to one ratio direct\nI any idea why why so many more men than women maybe more men are out in the outdoors ... out there alone\nYeah yeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women I\nWe're talking with David Blaine is about his latest work missing for one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they raised the hair on the back of your neck at the Beatles take us into the break we'll be right back\nAll right I'm a ... for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key you picking the cases that use euro in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I a huge database and I would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times times they want [noise] there's a case from eighty six\nI'm an era the girl's name was ... she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody looked at the case in Twenty years in a special agent there told me I'll never see that case it's a standard missing persons case\nThere's no suspect there's no crime why can't I see it um and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal uh everything else in the law enforcement world is criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against the law to go missing if you want to fall out of society and you can and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's going to emanates from\nCan and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's gonna emanates from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you're somebody that these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lotta times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good and I don't understand why there and want us to see it\nBut there's this I called territorial behavior and many of the times they won't grant you access\nNow in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to be disposed to the public upon the crust\nColorado has outlaws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states don't and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything um so the first thing is you got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say this George you can't trust the media\nBecause I Would say eighty percent of the time when I finally get a copy of the report\nThe news reports are totally completely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened and I like to think back\nThirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's this superficial job of collecting information because it's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that um you know reporters just regular beat reporters who get assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case\nYou know like outside of Las Vegas and then a couple that you and I've talked about before it's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement if there's a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of this scene um who tells you specifics here the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take it further you you've heard of them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they really don't want to tell the story of what's going on 'cause it's too weird to explain\nYou know makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether they don't want to give me this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or they don't want to give me the information because they have in a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know they don't want to have to answer questions about what do you think\nI think that the people the front line people that you see when you go into the parks heart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on\nIt's the people at the top tier in the government that are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed and communicated\nAnd it's those individuals that have this\nBig zoo this belief that it's their stuff it's not yours and you're not going to get it\nAnd I don't understand it I Can't explain it and every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports when a sheriff's office help on a search\nAnd they had some of the reports from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything and so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and I got ... I wasn't supposed to get that but\nBut it's rare\nLet's talk about a couple of cases uh you you sent me some information about one Samantha Sayers what's the deal there\n[noise] so twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete came from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle She liked to go to this a location a call ... ... V. E. S. P. E. R.\nAnd she went there in August first this year it's about six thousand two hundred and twenty feet elevation two miles northeast a spade a lake twenty five ... five miles east of the ocean Puerto Suzanne\n[noise] round trip hike up about seven eight miles twenty seven hundred foot gain going up\nAnd a Thirteen hundred foot scrambled to the top so I live in Colorado I can tell you that that really isn't much here but in in Washington that's a pretty good hike and the mountains there and just sixty two hundred feet look a lot like the mountains here fourteen thousand feet\nWell\nSamantha did a lot right she told her boyfriend where she was going when she'd be back and he was the kind of guy that kept track of her well when she didn't check in with him\nHe reacted the right way he wouldn't go he went out and look for her while the investigation showed that she made some at some time to in between two and three in the afternoon and some other individual man saw her at the ... summit in communicated with her well\nThat was the subsequent investigation her boyfriend Kevin arrived at them out and about ten pm started running the trails yelling for screaming for\nEventually published in the homeless county sheriff and the search was on so that was on August first well that search went on for about twenty two days three hundred and fifty seven air operations that is extraordinary that's locked\nHundred and five hours of drones time\nA three hundred and twenty nine hours of difference our personnel the family was on the scene everyday when you look at the area the majority of the time she was above what looked to be Timberline there isn't much up at the top of desperate to pretty wide open area\nAnd for them not to be able to find her under these circumstances is really really unusual dad cadaver dogs they had sent tracking dogs that everything you can imagine there to help\nWell eventually when the sheriff and the search and rescue personnel pulled out I mean that's that's a check on reality time if you're the family because you're looking at going back to Pennsylvania without your daughter and basically just checking it in with no more assistance but his family had a lot of gumption they\nStart pushing harder they did some Kickstarter campaigns\nAre trying to pay for food and things for friends that were just staying on site and search and day and night will eventually and I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom and the mom and I communicated and I kinda gave them this road map\nAnd it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports otherwise you're just going to be replicating that exact same effort that search and rescue stung before that a lot of instances that may turn some results because\nPeople are found in areas that have been previously search that's true but if they have a lot of area where they say that they haven't searched it very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do then that Syria you really want to give it a big push [noise]\nBut the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff the share of\nWeren't given him any reports and they were getting frustrated now this is the same thing I tell every family and if there's one listening out there is this what you have to do [noise]\nYou don't go to the local news media and ... you'll understand this church\nIs the local news media has to deal with the sheriff in that county day in and day out for the rest of their lives they can't burn a bridge they can't get 'em irritated they have to live with them but they national bureaus Fox CBS NBC CBS\nThe national bureaus you want to get one of those people in there and you want them to start stirring it up\nAnd then you want to send a family member down to the congressman or the senator's office and demand that they get more assistance and more help for you and you stay there until they realize you're going to be

this is the one time out of the thousands of times where I read this case and I said you know\nI'm going to go against my own protocol I'm going to call the parents and I'm Glad I did\nBut Steven read missing June twenty third Nineteen Ninety nine salmon be trail head outside of Sandy, Oregon about seven miles southwest of Mount Hood and for people who don't know a lot of disappearances amount ...

they were there really early\nWell they exit the trail later that day and they still saw the car there and it bothered them and they felt so strongly that something was wrong that they called the sheriff and a deputy came out random registration on the rent Iraq in the vehicle came back registered to a family\nAnd the registration hadn't been turned over to rent a wreck yet so the deputy left a message on the machine of the family who still owned the car on the registration system and he left\nWell Steven was return was supposed to return to Detroit on July second and parents were at the airport and he didn't arrive\nThey called the Portland police tried to file a missing persons report and they were told that you couldn't file a missing persons report unless you were there in person [noise] [noise] so the next day hope and Larry got on a plane and flew to Portland\nAnd the ... the search and rescue finally get down the trail and a theme that some assistance from the national guard Cain ends and search teams\nSearchers face rain and wet conditions for many other days but again the searched and searched for days after he really went missing and are hoping Larry praise the attitude of the volunteer searchers but stated that they were highly disappointed in the deputies\nThey say that the search didn't last long and was terminated without finding anything endeavor dogs were later put into that area never picked up ... percent\nThey uh they had a psychic approach them and the psyche went with them and some for service people down the trail that came to switch back look down the cliff they saw little TPP structure made a little trees lying on the ground\nAnd they said that down there you'll find Stevens glasses and that's where he died\nSearch and rescue went down there but they didn't bring their medical metal detector and it's like you said you needed that to find it but they never found it nothing was ever found there and they are hoping they said that they are now any communications with the sheriff in years none never with the forest service Stevens never been found\nStarting search them was two weeks after the disappearance is a very very difficult task and right here I'll say that Carol turned her when she disappeared in her park she at least less left a message on the inside of her car indicating when she was going to be out\nNow I see this every conference and I said on every time on I'm On with you people need to carry a personal located or be can cost about two hundred two hundred and fifty bucks there is no monthly service fee you can get 'em on Amazon\nYou activated it sends a signal to a satellite that someone needs help immediately they'll find you within eight feet they dispatched search and rescue I carry one every time I go out\nAnd I I Would say that probably Ninety five percent of these cases could be quickly remedied if everyone carry one of these\nWell whole lotta things went wrong in this game a just a comedy of errors not married to meet you know I mean but I you know search that ... that late you don't have much of a chance of succeeding you\nI don't think you do um first of all he wasn't real acclimated to the area didn't understand the dangers probably wasn't dress for success\nUm first of all he wasn't real acclimated to the area didn't understand the dangers probably wasn't dressed for success probably didn't have a backpack with them I doubt if he even had a Geological Survey map of the region\nBut when you go in an area like this there's so many things that can happen or I mean I tell people that you could go down this trail and if it's a trail that isn't very active you could be on the trail five or six miles down and break your leg on the trail and die on the trail\nAnd that doesn't that hasn't happened because it has and something very simple like this can ruin your life when you could just have this little device that could save your life\nYou mentioned about the psychic they've got involved in this case have you ever employed disturbances of a psychic or have you ever invest the end of the cage where it's like it was used and they provided information that turned out to be accurate\nTell your story is um is remote your roof on coast to coast fairly frequently he will go unnamed\nBut he he claimed he contacted me that he could find missing people\nAnd I asked him if he had ever found anybody and it gave me the name of this person and I listen to 'em and I said okay I'll give you a case and during that week that I didn't talk to them I contacted this victims wife I said hey that this person to help you in finding your husband\nShe goes she didn't do anything he never found him he never gave me any valuable information my husband was found on other means by other searchers doing other things blah blah blah on and on George I'm a guy that has really open mind\nAnd I will use anybody when somebody lies to me I won't use them ever again and that person blatantly lied to me and and other remote viewing cases there was one guy did a conference with the ... a couple of years ago really nice guy\nAnd the information he gave me wasn't even close in the realm of possible now there's another guy who's a remote fewer that I'm trying to work with right now hopefully he's better\nBut as far as psychics I did a conference in LA about two years ago and there were seven or eight psychics own this row at a this outside area at the conference and\nTowards the end I walked down this row introduced myself to every one of these psychic said what I did what I could use their services for and each one of them said yeah yeah yeah we want to help you want to help for sure yeah we can do this I email each one of them the next week\nWhen I got back and I never got a response from one of [noise]\nWe're talking with ... just about his newest book missing for one one land air or water Marty Allan a\nYou had a great job he was an auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue\nOn September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California and it was a planned vacation well on that Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend he was a very diligent guy always on time very respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the club early they laugh early on that Monday morning and refer in states that he dropped him off at a location and friendly at the super gas station or a Seventy third avenue\nAt two twenty three am Henry phone appears trap pocket dial this wife while she was asleep and California and left\nThe link the voicemail strange sound screaming pains growls\nEt cetera and it's hard to determine when you listen to it if they're all human found or their animal sounds or what are they\nWe we have a recording of a news report that was done based on this and then includes um some of the clips from that phone call so maybe we could play that right now and then on the other side you can tell me a little bit more about it\n[laughter] it's only now unlike anything you've ever heard before [noise]\nYou're going to be worth it [noise] [noise]\nVery little actual talking I said what are you concerned that disturbing neither one of the night called inside Henry McCain Celso it with Labor Day timber Seventeen to twenty eight in the morning nicknames worry why her in domestic ...\nHell for

[noise]\n\n... silent then someone either Henry or another person that I think I Try to show and he was\nBorn at night and I went back in ... when it made him sound like that\nNow is it dark content to other articulate recordings of McCain speaking at an event state auditor new\nDimension is one of the evidence now you'd police are reviewing its elite you tell me even the FBI is analyzing the recording and boy did for clues and she said the investigation did get here on Tuesday [noise]\n'cause I see her which borders right now you and certainly all areas where McCain was reporting scene or a cell phone ... unity waters control search they came up and ...\nSo that's a news report from a Minneapolis television station she the reporter mentioned in that report the the uh the FBI was analyzing it the police were trying to make some sense of ... have you ever seen any of that analysis or reports or did they come doing any kind of conclusion what the heck that was\nNever it climbed up so tight but one thing I've written about and pass books is that the FBI follows these cases there's no reason for the F the FBI to be involved in this it's a local jurisdiction missing person that's it\nWhy is the FBI sticking their noses and mess\nUnless they are interested in it for some other reason now\nLast tower that they think that phone was near Silverlake road and Mississippi street new Brighton one mile east or the Mississippi River\nAnd many other cases I've written about in the past and missing for one and want a sobering coincidence dealt with men very healthy man that were found and bodies of water many times in the Mississippi when this happened I thought he was going to be found in the Mississippi or something else really close\nWell the location where he was eventually found was searched multiple multiple times canines helicopters ground teams everything\nOn November second this is almost two months after he disappeared for twenty in the afternoon a kayaker was on rush wake\nOne mile south east of the last time they can that phone and they saw body in the water and they recovered it\nThere was no violence at all to the body according to the corner which termination on the count on a cause of death was freshwater drowning Syria had been search multiple times and the FBI had that recording for analysis why was Henry McCabe in the water\nNow one of the things that I presented and sobering coincidence about all of these young healthy men\nWas that many times to families did not accept the determination quite a corner on the cause of death\nAnd they paid for secondary autopsy several times when they did the second autopsy they found very high levels of G. H. B. in the system of the victim\nAnd they were in level so high it didn't make sense so GHB is ...\nDrug people get it they pass out they realize that they're awake but they can't move and they can't react and if you think about this\nMany of the times that these people have disappeared never has any of their friends relatives et cetera seen the point where they disappeared sometime they disappeared amongst friends\nThey couldn't explain how they got from point a to point B canines couldn't track point to point a lotta times that happened in the winter and there was no marks in the snow point the point\nAnd if you think what GHB does to you it puts you in that state were you realize what's happening to you but you can't react so if they lead lead you say in a a bank of snow\nYou would die from hypothermia\nYou wouldn't die from GHB intoxication\nIf the police chew on the water you would die by drowning not from G. H. B. and C. G. H. B. is not one of the twenty six drugs that are screened routinely by corners across the United states\nIt's only caught if you pay an extra amount to do this much more advanced screening for drugs\nAnd so it's a very very rarely if ever found in systems because most people can't afford a second autopsy and I'm not saying that that is what is in all of these cases but it showed up too many times to be ignored\nThat they're recording it certainly seems like a he realizes he's in trouble or painter agony\nAnd then as the reporter mentioned it sounds like there's somebody on there that says something that's um that's ah that's difficult to get your head around\nIt is in in many of the other cases I've written about that are related to these water unbelievably the victim is on the phone as they are going through this transition of disappearing\nOne time not far from where this incident happened a college kids walking down the street he's on the phone with a girlfriend has and says where are you I Need you here and now I Need you here now phone cuts off you sound days later in the Mississippi River another time a kid in east a western Minnesota\nIs missing and his parents are trying to find him and he's on the phone with him and he goes I don't know where I Am blah blah blah blah blah blah boom phone goes dead he was never found yet his car was found\nSo these incidents that happened were there on their cell phone is something new and different but when you listen to the incident as it evolves it's very uncomfortable\nI mean it seems like they're being abducted kidnapped um and sometimes the bodies are bound and sometimes they aren't and\nThey're they're just like snatched by persons are known by things unknown almost like no gigantic bird is sweeping down in matching them up\nUm you know so many\n... agrees is calling me all the time and saying well you know we talked about this earlier I\nYou on the YouTube say this this is I don't say that and I want people to understand that this is not a conspiracy theory topic\nBecause I'm a given you any theories I'm giving you All Facts and that's the way I Want people to understand this is that it's an unusual topic that's tied together the way an FBI profile or will ...\nWe're linking together a series of facts to show that there's continuity here\n\nThat there are patterns say and um

who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things and that sort but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway and so it it was a it struck me as a significant that the person who told me that indeed the had the brunt of your books and and your subject matter\nI Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are going to want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs can you summarize that one\nSure I'd separate twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy five nine thirty occurred on the island of mall it's an island in Scotland fifty five years old a Gibbs was a war hero he was an intellect and he was a pilot we spit fires in the battle of Britain in Nineteen forty\nHe was staying at a place called the Glenn force the hotel and it sat right on the ocean northeast side of the island a mall and there was a grass airstrip there and the rooms were right next to the airfield looking at the water [noise]\nHe arrived at the hotel on December twenty if on December twenty thirty contacted the owner of a Cessna one fifty parked at the script and asked if he could fly it\nIn Hamilton was the attorney negotiated a price to fly the two seater and on Christmas Eve Nineteen Seventy five at nine thirty Gibbs walked out to the plane with a hotel guests named Felicity Granger\nAnd she thought she was going to go with him on a flight but he told her no she had to lay off the torch assume you could fly inland so she exits the plane places the torches out in the field and he she sees him taking off the plane flying out over the water\nNow some reports say that after he took off they saw strange lights on the water some people said it might have been a fishing boat but they could never identified the boat and they can never see where the lights went\nWill make a long story short gives didn't return on the plane and there was a major search on and off the island for days and they found nothing and they found a sheep herders and ranchers that search all their property they got nothing\nWell on April twenty first Nineteen Seventy six is about four months after it the disappearance\nGifts his body is found on an oil\nAnd this isn't amount and it's like an oil near the airfield and he has a small scratch on his chin nothing else and a shepherd took part in the original search and he walked by the spot where the body was found multiple times and never saw it\nNow if given the jumped from the airplane there should have been more injuries and broken bones\nAnd they never found the plane [noise] nothing physically was wrong with him so he could walk back to the hotel the best everyone could tell\nThe quarter stated the cause of death was exposure meaning hypothermia and I guess that he probably died two hours after takeoff will they examine his clothing and there was no salt\nThat means he didn't go into the ocean and crawl out unanswered questions were is what were the lights on the water\nReally how did you get there\nReally how wrong Eddie been dead where was the plane\nAnd then my notes on this I write down GHB again because there's no reason for a man to die of exposure on the top of a mountain when people get cold they get up and they walk you don't lay down and die\nObviously the top of a mountainous colder than the bottom or where you could see humanity from the top of this mountain strange case\nYou know I've seen a some people respond to some of your cases that the weird ones where the clothing is missing and I've seen people trying to explain it away as saying people do weird things when hypothermia sense and they'll take off their clothes and and walk into snow and and do things that seem logical um\nBut how would you respond to those kinds of ah remarks and would fit here doesn't seem to\nOne of the things is I work for cases that are insurmountable meaning that explanation doesn't fit I have several cases where somebody leaves the house and within a hundred yards of the house they find a pile of close\nAnd personal left the house and it was Seventy degrees or yeah later that night it got down to fifty but the personal left the house and in a hundred yards all their clothes is gone in there in a\nStack in the field has happened multiple times also I've had other cases where a parent says my baby couldn't take off their clothes so if somebody saying they remove their clothes and they died hypothermia good luck with that because the kid couldn't take off their clothes\nSo the cases I Try to include tried I tried to explain this rationally\nNow there's a group out there that don't want to understand this and they want to explain it away with the boogie kind of stuff and that's fine but the reality of it is is that there's there's usually no rational explanation for why this stuff happens\nYou know in the alien abductions deal I don't know if you've read any of that there are some cases that are almost humorous or that or there'll be somebody who's taken\nBy some entities and they come back in their clothes ruined backwards or she was missing or um they got somebody else's underwear on a or they're rare cases where multiple people say they're taking and their clothing as switched when they wake up in the morning\nI'm now there can be all kinds of explanations for why people take their clothes off\nA that don't involve aliens but it it reminded me of some of the cases that you have in your books where\nPeople's clothing is found it's kind of folded up it's a it's neatly placed somewhere away from people and um it's not torn up as a by bears or something it's just weird\nI've written of cases in this book and other books were special notes were made that the clothing and the body was impeccably clean like it just came out of a laundromat and the body just came out of a shower\nAnd they couldn't explain why everything was so clean\nAnd you have cases where bodies or kids are found they'd been missing for a couple of days they've been in the wilderness no food or water and there's not they're not really they they're not whether there is not like they've they've been out in the in the open up for very long at all\nCorrect so where are they where did they go well the same thing applies to the water related\nWater is just certain things that we know certain things to the hair loss of hair recording of body fingernails things like that and when these bodies were pulled out corners of made statements that well the person disappeared on Monday but they've only been in the water for twenty four hours but they've been gone for six days\nFor worthy wherever they been for all this time\nAnd that's important about ... finding a body especially water\nBecause it shows things that it wouldn't show otherwise\nIt's almost like it's a ... or a harvesting that whoever whomever or or whatever\nIs taking people it needs something from them unless it's just malicious it needs something from 'em and and some\n... some of these people never come back at all and some are just discarded or when they're not needed anymore um I mean I I Know you're reluctant to go that far but it ... what it feels like\nOne of the questions I get all the time is are these people ever found to be abused sexually abused things missing from the body that's not the case\nIf they are found there are some pretty much intact without a lot of injury to him I mean one of the things that people have said a lot is that what they what they're doing is they're taking the sole\nWell I mean I don't know how you measure that yeah I don't either\nBut I've heard those kinds of allegations of uh what some other intelligence ... what their interest in us might be and it's it's a tough one to prove I don't know what it would take for you\nWhat kind of evidence that would take for you to reach a conclusion I guess it it would take maybe film or video of of one of these um incidence underway\n... when we first started this trip together years ago people said oh he knows what it is you know it right it's got to be something mundane it may be some\nCrypto topic that he just doesn't want to talk about we've come a long ways and I think if you start shutting the door to early you can't see me really ... may be obvious years later\nAnd that's one of the reasons I've been reluctant to say anything that\nYou know may be a possibility 'cause it may close that door for me\nI mean I think even where we are today versus where it was six years ago and huge distance\nWe're talking with Dave ... missing for one one land air water in a moment I'm an open up the phone lines and you can ask David couple of questions yourself we'll be right back [noise]\nUm [noise] anyhow um when we went um he came back out of the mountain um he met up with a couple of other searchers and I'm One gentleman had found some future panties\n'em and they tried calling the nine one one non emergency number and they tell search and rescue and they never called back\nUm and another lady um they were and that generally ... became flash at certain points I'm In there and they they tracked it down their phones they could give it and\nUm you know I I don't know ... years three teams on his cell phone into an excuse me one of them didn't make any sense it was way off to the left or the or where you park your car it's not even with the trail is um\nAnyhow um and just kind of thinking you know I've started what this could be and I was thinking maybe portals to another dimension\nUm big foot big for my the guy was within his brother had seen big for a couple of times up in their family and I've seen a shift it's twenty five feet above me\nAnd he is also an underground\nSecret naval base on their own land strange enough um it's\nOn the back side it is now in the gym creek 'em at all I can and I don't know any of it could have anything to do in this case or not but it's just they're all kind of strange things that I might even mentioning that phone call you guys had sounded like it but it was like a big place before\nWell do you know we're going to get Dave to ah react to you dropped a lot of stuff on there and we'll get themes reaction to some of that I mean all those ideas have been proposed before I I'm I suspect that he's going to tell us that we don't have enough information to ah to assign it to any one of them but they you can speak for yourself\nOr or or hit on one of those things are the cell phone hanging over to about a case in Michigan\nSeveral years ago and they cracked the skies for a long over this area\nAnd according to the kings and according to where it hit\nHe would've had to have crossed a road multiple multiple times in this pattern that he was supposedly tracked him and there was never any evidence he was in any of these areas and he was found deceased\nIn an area probably where he should have been and where they were originally looking but it just like the lady said the kings didn't make any sense it's probably more often\nShould have been and where they were originally looking but it just like this lady said the kings didn't make any sense it's probably more often than you are here and everyone kind of just ... off and says well you know maybe it's just the technology we don't know maybe it's not that good there's some reason we're getting these paintings in these areas\nAnd it's disconcerting that they happen because in out any only throws off the search there's never an adequate explanation as to how it got their\nFirst time caller Brent in Redding, California Hi Brent welcome to the program\n[noise] thank you very much for taking my call was on your mind\nTo questions for David ... you've talked about how uh people when they have come back\nThey haven't remembered anything that's happened to them so I Wonder if you've looked into perhaps there are people witnessing is it that but there's something about having their memory a race that also you've talked about East German connection so I wondered if you've ever looked into mysterious just the parents that Germany if
