I mean I don't know if I classify shining this last year um but it's\nCertainly a horror film and and and and ... and ... and a and a good one and I think it's what I mean forty years old or something now right you know these these are these modern horror films are pretty how are you know the ring is Twenty years old she you know\nSo um [noise] you know it's a ... you know a lot of 'em are are are ah you know whoa hold up pretty well um with age and I I really I think a Halloween but first Pauline\nIs really a a pretty suspenseful movie and Donald pleasant this really excellent as kind of like the captain Ahab trying to stop this uh you know maniacal a killer actually not even maniacal\nThat someone from Nineteen Seventy eight man\nNineteen Seventy eight is a forty year anniversary of the original Halloween blue magic and it's been that long my\nGosh [noise] uh\nAnd John Carpenter who of course ah gave us a the remake of the thing and less came from New York and a bunch of other uh [noise]\nOr films a science fiction a heat on the original concept was that it was going to be an anthology is that every Halloween they would do a different theme or different type of scary\nMovie and the first story was called the babysitter killers and and the babysitter killer a and that was the ... that was the Michael Meyers story ... story [laughter] kicked in and uh the character became so popular\nDuring that we're trying to come up with a scary math and and and what they ended up doing was taking a William Shatner Star Trek math and spray painting it white\n[laughter]\nSo that's what William Shatner math Larry I'm I Wonder bill feels about that yeah I don't know uh but uh you know ... and so it you know it's the fact that it\nFor ... blank you know expression on the mask and and and not deliberately scary face\nA you know I think that that made it more uh more scary you know I think a lot of times they are newer movies they tried to heart you're talking about the conjuring and some of 'em there was a family of failed there's ... which uh\nKnow the original dog with the war and uh having their a basement full of a an object\nIs Iraq at the end all we all know what raggedy and looks like and the one that they hand ended up doing in the movie they tried to make it look scary a it looks like something out of your Halloween you know and a and and it's just\nIt's it's a you know it no one would trust the stall ... to ... you know there are like oh what a beautiful dog with the horrific looking right off the bat you know a much scarier when it's something you least expect you know no one would think that that their little raggedy and all is going to [noise]\nGonna try to possess them or ... birthday\nComing up on fifty years Rosemary's Baby can you believe that star in the early that either a ... to she was just almost a kid when she started in that movie\nShe was she was you know and that was kind of seen as she got kind of a controversial sort of a mob look with a short\nHair right she Frank Frank Sinatra protege\nAnd that is true that didn't last too long but you're right\nYou know and and uh you know a William Castle wanted to make that little piano William Castle was the producer\nOf course in the fifties was famous for his gimmicks you know like emerge Joe and uh you know I always feel with the buzzer is in the states and the uh uh you know all of these are moving gimmicks\nOf a house on the hill and ah I'm straight jak classics\nHold on for a second Mr Lovell we're at a break we'll come back with more next our phone calls you will share your movie experience with Mr ... later on on the coast to coast they\nDo have a photo that you think would interest that goes to ... we're always on the hunt for unique an unusual images for a photo gallery to submit your image simply go to ... am dot com and most over the media button on the upper navigation bar you'll see the submission options [noise]\nIn my Spiderman pajamas a you know just sweating under the coffee table\nShaking with fear I'd have to go into the other room I was the kind of kid that when the skipper with yell at Gilligan during Gilligan's Island I Would have to get out of the world you know it was a little too little too hot when skipper with ... Gilligan whether it's ... you know\nAnd we were watching a movie with my dad and I I think with a lot of movies that bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind of on the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching these movies to kind of be with my dad and he would be in the recliner watching creature features and I'd be next to him or hiding behind the recliner sometimes and you know it ... I think it was maybe\nI don't know if it was crawling hand or just the hand but they have this very convincing hand to crawl ... different body hand crawling by itself\nAnd I and I'm ... I'm ... and it bothered me so much to my dad you know if the rubber hand that face filled with great jelly and you know are manipulating with liars them and I'm sure his explanation was dead wrong but but it put it into this perspective a wait\nThere this is fun time they're playing this is a show this is this is this is this is a game you know this is something can make a ... this isn't something that just the torture me this is this is something for fun\nAnd I think it was kind of an a ha kind of moment and I think from that point forward\nOr I couldn't get enough you know I was a highway or if it were ... and not just for all of your horror I feel is is that under horror an five five I think are under the ... of fantasy though uh\nI think the horror is an offshoot of fantasy and so it's ... I like all of that I like uh I like John or movies I like ah you know monsters and\nThen the robots and injured and pirates and all\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid I remember him taking me to see the ... when I was seven years old Mr loan oh yeah and then of course the scary one for me I was nine years old the house on the haunted hill then when the original one with Vincent Price\nI mean how hard it was a blast\nAnd I thought he would really to all these movies you know I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go for [laughter] well when you just wanted me around but\nI mean all these all these movies he would bring me too yeah and then the the TV shows he would love to see\nScience fiction theater in in ... in those kinds of shows right you know you'd have them on all the time I I think he's one of the reasons why my mother is one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting and I'm you know indoor UFOs and the paranormal\nBut my dad got me into these movies and all these science fiction shows he loved those things\nWill assure you know and all of those and I think it all ties together you know because I think that curiosity you know I'm just the fact like just like a like a show like Star Trek my you know kind of brought us the cell phones and and ah you know all sorts of thing\nYou know I think that the curiosity for this a cult in a supernatural you know I think it is probably the genesis or the speed of a lot of um your your guests on your show who started watching these uh\nMovies in and decided to go hey let's dig deeper what you know are there goes let's find out\nI think so too what do you think of the Texas Chainsaw massacre Nineteen Seventy four Russian\n[noise] you know the the Texas Chainsaw massacre gifts has had the heaviest wrap everyone was trying to do the Texas Chainsaw massacre [laughter] there is hardly a drop of blood in that whole movie\nYou'd think there is you think there is I think the area is why you know and you could go back and watch it and you know it's all filmed murky sixteen millimeter and it's the chainsaw and how weird\nTheir house was with all the the mode mobiles made out of bones and you know the the psychological aspect is really what clicked with that movie and I think that everyone that what came after it those were really I think they're really sloppy slap dash\nYou know a bunch of teenagers waiting to get slaughtered kind of movies but really as the original Texas Chainsaw as they were they were they were heartbroken when they got an R rating they were trying to get a PG E because there was no one was going to go see it\nThe Nineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho Lou shower scene you would think yeah you were looking at ... moons every second not one to ... did you see in that shower saying\nNo no no point does the knife a entered Janet Leigh body at any point\nUh you you are you there you know it's happening but you don't see\nThe sounds I think out a lot of that and there were a bunch of other ... there were a bunch of ... Mellon that they had laid out and they were stabbing different types of melons and Hitchcock is standing there ... channel watching the sound guy you know making all these weird hollow strange down stabbing all these different fruits and vegetables [laughter]\n... let's say a word and happy to walk out the door he just says\nChristopher [laughter] Blair Witch project started with pennies but that was a scary one to\nWitch project is really interesting because you know a a you know they were uh unfortunately I had a friend who was ushered when a when that movie came out and he was cleaning up vomit every single night his job he couldn't handle it because ... and it wasn't because it was scary it was because\nPeople had had a become accustomed to the ... found footage\nFirst person you know just a just a handy cam or a camcorder filming a whole movie\nUm you know so uh you know that was kind of first of all sort of found footage type films and an independent film that went really big and you know and it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but you know that in that movie was uh\nAnd an independent film that went really big and you know and it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but\nYou know that in that movie was a that was the director have final cut and they made the movie they way the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania not far from a where the Blair Witch supposed to happen and people still\nDrive in they're looking to uncover this thing that never happened so they really really great job of not only are making of a a found footage film but but creating a a a a story that people wanted to believe in and uh you know it's so nowadays I think that'd be hard to do\nBecause of the Internet it gives you can't keep a secret for twenty second but in Nineteen Ninety nine\nA fool with everybody everyone thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhen did you think of Freddie Krueger the nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally uh you know it just it was kinda just greedy and\nCame out in Nineteen eighty four right\nAny for but you know I I've gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and it's very marriage that said you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams\nUh which I think they pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dream skate which I think came the year before which is an excellent movie that people should seek out where someone is trying to assassinate the president inside of his dream right ah but ah yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and and uh\nAny on any of them were never they go five six seven equals yet they're getting pretty bad\nWho's a movie out two thousand fourteen I never saw it's got a weird movie it shows up as one of the horror films have you ever heard of the bottle do [noise]\n[noise] yes I have you know and I did not like the bottom do pretty much do the ... it's Australian film I Believe uh it's about a a mother and a her child [noise] and uh they are basically kind of dealing with the grief a of a loss of of a spouse\nOr whatever and the father um and I think it man is tested in this\nIn this creature that kind of comes alive from a children's storybook which kind of looks like London after midnight you know you've got like the top hat and kind of ... kind of hair\nAnd he's a cartoon out of a children's book uh I didn't really I mean it it didn't I never really believed that Bob but that wasn't the part of it they didn't like\nI didn't like that it seemed like a two hours they'll walk commercial where it was just running [laughter] this this allegory for their depression and their Greece and that you you don't ever really escape your grief you just have to feed it [noise]\nWhat is it about horror and creepy films that people generally like to be scared\nUm you know I think if you use or even one I think there's two there's two aspects of the roller coaster you know there's two kinds of roller coasters you want to get you get on it right you get on a roller coaster and you'd have so much fun but you want to get back on her to get\nThe other kind of a roller coaster is when you get off your kissing the ground [laughter] in a for effort want to get on a roller coaster it yeah and they're both fought\nA and I think that you know you you you you ear safe you know you get to put yourself in a kind of a mock a mock danger you know and and but really you're safe and then you feel like you've overcome something and I think that it's just that that Russia I think it's just that thrill\nAnd and again I think it's it for a moment there it makes you forget all the really thing we'll things in real life that really do terrified and I think that that that's worth the price of admission by it so\nNone of those things I just cited which after additionally Ben magic getting on

offered an either or a ... percent of the take or or just a nominal salary he took the salary he said I ... in in ...\nI can do that one better I he ... he he got paid with a painting of Michael Jackson [laughter]\nThat was probably worth something [laughter]\nNext up let's go to chip peas in North Carolina forty nine years old chip you\nGo to movies I'm Sorry you go to movies\nI did yesterday yesterday I just saw the nine\nTo first of all we got him and uh\nOn my list that I haven't seen it yet oh it's awesome it's part of the uh uh because during their response movies so far I'm the one of those yes to great\nUm what I called you about is uh uh what's your thoughts on the fog and Santa has them which are two of my favorite a horror movies from the early eighties and\nAh I ... I absolutely love fan has 'em a fan's has them was a made on the weekends or the ... the kids who made fan passive smoke dope all week and then on the weekends they shot band has them and um and when they when a cost to rally or you know took him almost a\nReally long schedule I think it took them almost the whole year\nShoot all the footage for the film and um but when they put it all together a it was a great blend aside by and we're\nAnd imitate it a lot throughout the eighties I think it kind of hearken that sort of blend of fantasy side by and horror that you see in a lotta later a Haiti's films in the tall man stands as one of the most memorable screened villains of all time\nUh and the fog is truly creepy great film great atmosphere Adrian Barbaro great ghost story about um the lepers or\nA Nineteen eighty of them come\nBack but the goal but through the fog uh it's just a so good you know are still many great performances how whole workers the priest which I think was originally supposed to be um Donald pleasant but I I don't know what he was doing at that time but you know it it just a John Carpenter again we've mentioned several of John Carpenter so\nHalloween being one of them are they live being one of them the fog ... one of them so I mean\nJohn John Carpenter you know next to Steven King I mean John Carpenter dominated the eighties or with a lot of really wonderful imagine if they felt\nWere these inexpensive movies to make\nA comparatively I mean we weren't like Star Wars movies you know I'm I think the great thing about a horror film um the beauty of a horror film is that you know you can scare some even take sixty thousand dollars and make fourteen million dollars from\nYou know you have the right distribution absolutely\nSo so that I think that that's why it's such a ...\nCheap usually the darker you make it and the more interesting it is um the more the mind uh takes over you know the lesser the shark you see them more effective jobs was the last of the alien the scarier the alien was so you know there is a lot\nTo uh the flight I think it's very easy to over produced ... I think it's a horror movie has too much money at it\nIt seems protected you know you look at the second Terminator movie you know it it it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one 'cause there's just too much money and it feels like a franchise\nSo um you know a horror film you know you almost need to cap the budget because if you put too much money and do it\nIt's thought plume like a surprise and and if you if you can eat the train coming down the track no one is going to knowing shouting blue is going to scare you you know so you it has to kind of be a slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why a lot of low budget horror films like neither the living dead\n... grand a are incredibly scary [noise] and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell have made a living doing lower budget horror films like\nAbsolutely yeah he's like the Olivier [laughter] really is\n[laughter] and uh you know and and I you know I got to interview him and he's charming guy and uh you know he uh\nHe loves ah you know he pretends he doesn't like it but he he he likes it he likes the attention than he likes to check [laughter] he likes the paycheck absolutely you know and ah I'm evil dead\nIs a is a great uh a film for an actor I mean he pretty much just carrying the whole movie on his back he's putting himself through\nA you know all of these ... it's almost like a chaplain where it's\nJust it's you just following through all of these tap blows that they've created for him so it it you know ... not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books that all seemed to have that feeling for in a cemetery in things like\nThat yeah yeah I mean I I like Stephen king's films a lot more than the books I mean but I mean I'm a film guy\nYou know people always say oh well the book was better it's like they're not exchange of commodities you know I mean a dance is different than a sculpture you know ... book is different than a movie or just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you you you're not in the mood to read a book and vice versa and uh\nYou know what works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I I I think that a lot of my favorites Stephen King stuff is all the short stories\nI think his novels or to a padded too long winded you know\nWhat I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man but you know he doesn't know where the story ends when he starts he just he just keeps writing he he's just as surprised as we are because he just keeps writing a and drinking\nAnd writing and ... finished you know and and then uh you know five hundred pages later it's done so there's NO PLAN going in\nA ... which I think allows for him to the ... you know again it there there was no formula so I think that I think that that's why his books are so surprising\nBut I think at the same time [noise] you know a good director can kind of oil back down to it asked him you know he hated the film the shining and the film is shining I think stands as one of the best pieces of art you know the twentieth century so I you know I don't know\nWhat about TV shows that are dealing with like the walking dead and things like that\nYeah it's interesting because you know I mean the walking dead I definitely I feel like oh these everything to night of the living dead yes and you know now it's kind of come down to the name\nYou know you go into the Walmart when you see the you know\nOr the rubber ears that you hang around your neck or the you know the whatever get inside the signs and you know it\nIt's all um it's a very commercial\nUm you know I think that uh you know to sell 'em and I think it's kind of cowboys and Indians to smoke but um yeah modern zombie movies you know I Know ... is the enemy that you can shoot and not feel so out of and we don't have you know we're\nWe're in the world of you

life after death does not continue when we die each schools what do you say\nWell I'm very respectful that people have various different perspectives different world views and my inclination is to think that what we really believe is probably what we're gonna end up and\nUh so those people who believe in reincarnation may well reincarnate and those people who believe in sort of the Buddhist journey of enlightenment um may end up through in a\nYou know maybe in a black hole somewhere you know alternating at the the threshold of some event horizon I mean I think all of those things that seemed completely far fetched in the past\nAre now something that we can really start to grapple with when I made the film I interviewed a Michael ... who is\nIn the ...\nThe well known skeptic he's also you know a really smart guy very interesting\nAnd and I use a nice guy\nYeah I Would say so and I had a really great time interviewing him and what was fascinating there were two things first of all I he acknowledged that one has mom died he heard her voice\nAnd I ... you know with a little surprised that he was telling me this on film and I said well really lets you know go back to that and he said oh well you know it was really nothing but yeah I heard her voice\nAnd I thought well that's an interesting acknowledge Mitt and he had a good psychological justification that was just some kind of hitting the gods ... experience right at that threshold of of sleep and dreaming\nBut it was interesting that he acknowledged it and then the second thing that I I really loved was that um he got married shortly after my interviewing him\nAnd I guess they got married in either his house or his uh now White House and her father grandfather I Can't remember the details exactly but had left her a radio\nAnd uh it didn't work and Michael had tried and tried to fix it and eventually in frustration he stuck to the radio in a drawer and didn't think about it anymore and then months later\nThey were having their wedding ceremony and in the middle of the ceremony all of a sudden they start hearing music playing\nAnd they proceeded to complete the ceremony and went in\nRetracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of entrenched position it's got the says\nWell what's important to as a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic wants proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it went that document tests were the people who really understood and new and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning it wasn't like they deny the existence of the things that they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than a bunker\nI think so too and it's a ... I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism is the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulse\nYou got it Marilyn stay with us we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work\nIn our final our next hour we'll take phone calls about this but I

next dollar with Dr Merrill Lynch ... does makes life possible also consciousness and healing as well and the Marilyn would you tell us the story of the reincarnation of the little child\nWell there's so many stories let's um\nJust want him to step Bruce march or something like\nThat right well in Stevenson was a very unusual psychiatrist who developed a very strong interest and trying to document cases of reincarnation\nAnd he collected about a thousand case studies of young children who had had a some experience in the past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical report\nAnd in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they had some kind of unusual birth mark a so it's not a typical mould but some kind of unusual birth mark\nAnd it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remembered\nSo there were numerous examples where for a for instance one child remembered being a man from a different village\nOr in Asia and he um [noise] in Stevens and then went and investigated the biography of this person that the child remembered being\nAnd it turns out that that person was shot through the chest in the same place\nEntry and exit a where the bullet ostensibly went through the body and so that becomes a kind of biological sources evidence for reincarnation and these young people you know it's not absolutely evidence but\nAre evidence shawl but it's still compelling\nOur in our film we interviewed Jim Tucker who now works in the same Institute at the University of Virginia that in Stephenson had found it and he tells the story of a young boy who uh you know very early just about the time he learned to speak\nRemembered being his grandfather and he would tell his dad when his dad was changing his diapers a I used to change your diapers\nAll and\nIt was kind of shocking for these parents and other sure and then this kid's started remembering other things\nTo drive and so as a little test the ah parents got a bunch of pictures from\nThe dad and the first of all they had a class picture when he was in elementary school and so this would be the child grandfather and they asked him to pick out which one was him and he had no problem finding himself in the line up\nAnd then uh they were going through some of the other snapshots and he saw his car\nAnd he said that's my car that's my car I used to drive a car and so again it's not definitive evidence that there is the kind of um survival of consciousness or identity after ... death\nBut these instances give us really compelling\nIdeas about what is possible\nIt does it's truly remarkable in the remember the study of the little boy who claimed that he was a World War two pilots\nAnd he knew things are both the plane landed too hard the tires would blow up and really nobody knew the other than the crew and the pilot\nAnd he was telling his parents ... and they and they got them to verify it and uh they took him to a reunion or a World War two veterans and uh she she knew several of the people from his unit it was an amazing story you remember the case\nI'm I'm vaguely remembering it I don't remember the details of it but I think you're right these things are phenomenally intriguing and it's very exciting I Know that the University of Virginia right now is hiring a post doc to work part time with them and part time at the Monroe Institute\nTo do some psycho physiological research on this\nAh we're right now setting up a lab here at Sophia to look at the cycle mantey um um this was a a technique that was used by the ancient or colds and greets\nAnd say I'm ... ostensibly were able to identify and communicate with spirits\nBy looking at are gazing upon a reflective surface and Raymond Moody developed this protocol where he put people in a darkened room\nPut a mirror on the wall illuminated the mirror and such a way that you couldn't see your own reflection but because here kind of going into a trance state people start to see things and hear things and experience things\nAnd uh you know there's been a number of experiments looking at people's ability to make contact with their departed loved ones and they have those kind of conversations that they never had a chance to have\nAnd it has been shown to be extremely useful for a brief moment counseling so people have an opportunity they have the conversation they can see it\nThey can see there's the spirits and so what we're doing now is bringing that idea into a virtual reality environment so we'll have people sitting with the virtual reality goggles\nUh looking at a mirror in a sensory deprivation procedure and we're going to record and try to understand what it is that people are experiencing when they enter that state\nOne of her very special guests author and researcher Rosemarie Ellen ... uses black mirror image to do a lot of those\nThat's right and that's really really strange uh-huh what do I would be interested in talking to her yeah\nJust to deal with the charm if you were the Maryland and would you get you in touch with her on her website is visionary living dot com you might be more humid was straight through there okay\nTitle for a website is really not so much about what happens after but how those ideas and beliefs inform how we live now\nAnd you know we know that people believe different things even within a common culture a all we have to do is look at the political debate that's happening right now to know that people justify their beliefs based on different kinds of evidence\nAnd while in our culture we tend to\nUm hold in esteem the idea of rationed rationality about reason about the idea of objectivity we we make appeals that if we have good objective data that that then is the evidence it's going to shape our beliefs\nBut what we see is that it's most often something else it's most often a personal direct experience something emotional or transformative and that's what really Shapes Our belief and then we just rationalize the rest of it in the name of objective data\nAbsolutely or special guest Dr Marilyn ... we're talking about the really things dealing with ... how many people who believe in a life after death also believe in God what do you think the percentage Maryland\nI think it's a tricky question I'm of course when when one [laughter]\nI don't know that about you George I'm I think that it really depends on what people believe going into it and what they define God to be\nFor example in um the Christian tradition there can be a lot of fear of you know the afterlife because it can be met with you know I'm\n... while as long as you know if you've ... of course right hell and damnation can be very very scary whereas if you're coming from a Buddhist tradition where there isn't\nA God per se but there's this idea of\nYou know consciousness as the ground of all being so in a certain sense consciousness become God a that can be a much more\nUm a beautiful journey towards something that allows us a sense of safety and hope\nOptimism so I think you know those preconditions that shape what our culture tells us is true can very much influence how we think about the afterlife and how we hold our relationship to the divine\nIn this country and it's become patently obvious to everybody and it's very simple if you are a Democrat and you can gauge to any any kind of questionable illegal activity you get a path and if you're a Republican you don't people know that we have two systems of justice in Washington and the Democrats are not held accountable the same way Republicans are\nWe have to limit coal systems that justice\nRush Limbaugh weekdays ... news talk Ninety

believe or it was a good Christian but doesn't believe in spirits and things\nI haven't been listening to you know all the programs from way back when a bell was on and his wife and you yes and\nI had this experience and I don't know who tell them to sometimes you know my husband of course who is a known believer I'm sure he passed away about just three days [noise] um [noise] but before this happened on the service\nBurial service on film\nJust says he was going down into the ground yeah the storm came up\nAnd view was wild win and everything it just happened so fast and then it stopped it took only a few minutes it was very odd Noah ... as we were leaving the cemetery\nMy son and the oldest one said mom when we were getting into the car to go home\nDad came home with us wow I said what do you mean he got in the car also\nBecause I could just smell him call was filled with his body odor and my husband was very me person but she had this sense about him he didn't wasn't a smoker

the skill later\nAnd um I was on and so you know I've called\nI'm In the air and it was my husband at the end of the bed lifting my left foot\nWhile you could see him oh\nBeautiful yes yes yeah he always wore a white T shirt but it'd be neck and short yeah the ten short dog and he passed away before he couldn't hit Ninety four\nSo sorry for Ramon was\nOh he was in perfect specimen doctors always asked what do you\nDo for him that he was Seventeen year old man in Ninety\nThree is a little I said nothing she does it all he exercises you know and walk and he watches his diet my husband

care of this for it\nYou see the doctor again\nHe dropped it and that was it it was very upset that I wasn't going to the dark\nYes I have been but the thing is George my mother also came to visit him I mean you know he was a non believers as I Do with you but they are able to church gorge\nGood Christian participants but they even taught Sunday school is sit in the dumpster in but the thing is he told me after seven years this happened he says Alice\nMother came to visit me I said when when we lived on them you know I won't mention the street but I says why didn't you tell me up to seven years you're telling me he said I didn't want to tell you this I said well what is it all about what she stood at the end of our dead and\nAnd he got up and there she was standing at the end of the bed\nAnd mom what what is it you know and she says well Tom I Want to know how else isn't doing 'cause I was six months pregnant when she\nPassed away and she was\nConcerned how might help but snowing she passed away much first she was only fifty\nFor something to how will be you know I'm not in Cuba for Ninety four good for you\nAnd I'm the senior George I haven't been wanting to call it several times because we listen to you every night my son and I and he's a believer and now like you know\nIf it wasn't a believer five days ago but he's been listening to your program and he has changed and full of wonderful he believes in an afterlife and so he's not afraid of that thing on just like me but I have ... ... you know\nOther\nChildren who are did not believe was just to go to church all the time but they\nDon't believe in the afterlife but the thing is George I have been having just first attack when I was seven years old I was going I Love to be a Catholic but I'm not Catholic I'm everything as my dad says it's just you know\nHow were you what were you raised\n... we were raised as just from a hard case in your church is right here right in your heart\nNo no no\nYou have to go to a certain church never my dad was my dad was a Roman Catholic my grandma Nelson was also and they were the Catholic they restrict much he became a politician and and um\nAnd in his late seventies say what it can become a focus as I said dad what happened he says because the British people don't go to war they don't seem to be fighting all the time was\nWhen you read the Bible you know it's always fighting on George you know the Bible I I have read the Bible to into law school and everything but\nThe thing is this happened to me when I was seven years old cut like two girlfriends were Catholic they went to the Sacred Heart church and um\nWell when I was in a Catholic so I went to go with them seven o'clock mass on Sunday and I wouldn't have breakfast too because you get neglect to confession and I didn't eat also but there are lot while they were getting dark confession done\nAnd I'm I was sitting there at the computer and I tell you about\nYour passion I passed out my neck fell on the back of the few you know yeah so I my breathing was cut off you know you could have died I yeah\nI was that's why the messages I mean this is something that Joe this day you know and even the priest when they came to get me the two of them they saw that with a goner I'm but\nYou've been through a lot last may\nWhen it went by two girlfriends but right yeah and they came up to me when they came back they said oh this is and you know what Jesus was already outstretched hands and angel behind him\nYou know and George I have never seen anything so beautiful [laughter] my life and we never had color t._v. or you know we had was a radio at home they should back into thirty\nWorse than those news that's all you\nKnow search and no I tell you what I got it all and colors and when I hear your caller called in to say they they ... they had\nBeen up and came back I find it very difficult to believe some of the story because my visit with stuff like that I Know what it looks like\nYours was a good business is beautiful\nGeorge and Jesus is so true\n[laughter] I Love it and we're going to take a quick break in a moment Marilyn that was recalled Ninety four years old\nSo inspiring Alice thank you and also one of the things a couple of things one is\nA lot of people do feel lonely when they have these experiences because our culture isn't more supportive and so I think what else is saying is um it really helps they have programs like yours\nWhere people can hear from others and know that they're not you know isolated they're not crazy they had these experiences and there's something to add\nThere's no doubt about that Marilyn we're going to come back and take final phone calls with you just a moment in Dallas you keep calling us from want you to get the Ninety

P. A. C. E. two three seven nine one three\nOne for news talk Ninety five five [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back our final segment with Dr Merrill Lynch ... Maryland where do you think of mediums\n[noise] there's been some very interesting research some of my colleagues are not to alarm and others at the Institute of neurotic sciences or looking at the possibility that when a medium is getting in fights\nAccurate as compared to when it's inaccurate there may be measurable differences in the brain and in fact that's what they found it was a preliminary study but it showed that when people evaluated\nThe statement made by the medium as having been accurate or correct\nThat the ... the memory center of the brain kind of cleared out it was as though the brains of these mediums we're creating a space for another set of memories to come in I find that extremely provocative and interesting so yeah I think there's\nThere's all kinds of mysteries in this world and science will only begin to approximate some of these experiences that people have\nHere you dean ... most of the life chasing down mediums wanting to try to communicate with his mother he was successful\n[noise] well I think there's been a lot of fraud\nThere's been a lot of Mr direction and that doesn't mean that all instances of communication are wrong or inaccurate so you know again it's how do we know what we know and what is the basis of\nFormulating our beliefs are convictions and are they right or not you know it's often we get stuck in places that aren't necessarily the best path forward\nBack to the phones now we go George in Corpus Christi Texas was George Europe\nHello George either All right\nOh just a I was like a lot of the callers call and uh it was hotter conscience loose or\n... or humanities destiny because of all or ill and are we going that way is going to be the only savior for everything that we do and um the lady before a bottle and she said the\n... the heart in mhm or a phone to believe it's it is just so hard on the sole or heart\nPills what the soul to do and the soul moves on\nAnd I just want to hear her say about that and I think you do it so much I Love the show\nThank you Joe and scientists are beginning to think the heart is much more than a ... year old\nAnd the guy I mean we know that we have multiple sources of intelligence in our bodies and I think that's extremely interesting I don't know and the answer to the question or are we evolving toward a higher consciousness or\nAre we evolving toward greater levels of complexity and technology but\nAre more allergy and our ethics haven't really changed that much I've been watching\nA show on the ... cheese and we know that you know they were catalytic to the time of the renaissance and promoting our ten language and science but at the same time there was enormous corruption\nAnd you know people poisoning other people to get them out of the way or you know really creating false narratives about people talk about false news\nUm fake news you know it's been happening and I think people have manage their\nInability to resolve different points of view through violence and I'm not seeing right now that there's a whole lot of\nAlternative higher level um meaning centered altruistic kinds of principles that are certainly being communicated in the popular media by our political leaders I'm just not seeing a lot of references to a whole\nOur own evolution toward something higher if we want to use that metaphor and it doesn't mean I'm not helpful because I also see that there is tremendous good in the world and often times we just need to shine a light on that\nI think eventually good beach over evil don't you\nI sure hope so I mean I think if we have an option of what to believe that's a good one to believe in\nYou sound a little ... than I Am a little\nI'm Jewish yeah I'm a little skeptical of how much we can simply just say yes everything's going to be fine\nYou know I'm just not sure that that's really where the story goes I think each of us in our life can make choices and do we want to ah grab hold of our highest potential do we want to develop our social and emotional intelligence you\nKnow those things take effort and if not people can just resort back to these kind of base impulses that come from the mid ... and the fight or flight and we don't really get that prefrontal cortex involved in a way that allows us to make wise decisions\nAre one of the things we see about aging and talking to Alice was that ah we know as people grow older\nOr there is this concern that we lose memory\nBut at the same time we gain wisdom\nSo it's as though we get these ... that help us to manage our lives better and so that's one of the hopeful things at least in terms of our own life development is as we grow older we may lose some of the detail but will gain greater insight\nAll right let's go to first time caller Michael driving in Ohio Hi Michael go ahead sure\nTheir village okay like\nI just wanted to call because I had this story that I have a I was listening to Maryland and uh normally listen deal might not ever have anything to say\nYou know I don't have any stories of my own but this one you got one on while I was a kid I was hit by a truck when I was riding my bicycle\nAnd I didn't die or anything you know I didn't like have a near death experience but I remember getting hit by the truck or remember\nHitting the ground and then the next memoranda have after that is the sky looking up at the sky but then I looked down and I can see a circle of people around me laying on the ground\nAnd I was just wondering if that's like something you've ever heard of before like it's not a near death experience but it's definitely an out of body experience\nI live in Maryland you have something like that\nYeah that sounds very similar to my experience and again I think what's helpful in telling each other these stories is that it helps us to remember our own instances of this and yeah that sounds like a very\nA predictable kind of near death out of body type experience it suggests that consciousness may have the capacity to move outside of our physical embodiment\nWhat is the new women experience the organization of course named after what ... what what is the ... experience\nWill know what it comes from the Greek meaning a direct knowing so you might think about kind of what we've been talking about tonight the difference between\nThe objective rational reason to kind of discourse and then that kind of intuition that bubbles up within us and we might not have a direct reference point\nFor how we know what we know but\nOh it and that often can be the most

[noise]\nI'm Lewis [noise]\nSo\nMale we've already you know we talked about Vail many times have connections to the underworld and um [noise] it's always easy [noise] to develop fearful\nNotion is a lot of what's happening behind the scenes as cleverly obscured have been some moments the open conspiracy of obvious but those who are the planners in control of the world are driven by a cult relationships for powers ... explanation if we can call it some sort of intrusion whether it\nBe a well in this case of said Cannick infiltration I'm I'm sure there are plenty of people out there listening he would say well short climates you you you see the devil and everything but you know you cannot be fire even argue against the notion\nThat we are up against an intergenerational pathological governance by powerful individuals that certainly pulls possess what would be the knowledge in the information\nThat is used and also the blood rights and the sacrifices and and and the tools necessary\nDo will power at the expense of their fellow man\n\nWe could argue that what we're seeing some of cold driven body of leadership that has an obligation as someone or something big we've seen his hauntingly identical to\nWhatever demonic ... short or or say panic carbon or coal you even dream up\nI mean there's some sort of send our kids them\nWhich is basically a turn meaning that there's a joint rule\nOr join rule of some kind of dark synergism\n... and beyond the general definition of trying to tell you send our kids are missing energy had been used to denote different political processes in various contexts\nIncreasingly terms have been used it a note ruled by secret elite sort of synergy it may be in power\n\nHas this alliance and Indian and it's not necessarily those associated with the president is not necessarily those associated with Congress if not necessarily those associated with\nAnybody we're seeing on TV which is talking to us about the rulings talking to was about the scandals I mean they're just basically puppets dinner answering to delete priesthood\nAnd some claim that there'll be a looming Avi\nUnfortunately the word ... everything with wide brush it so it's impossible to pinpoint just who may be responsible and who's pulling the strings here but someone\nWho claimed that this is art put that bail arch at the Washington DC mall and they did it just the day before the hearings took place well you up you know if I Want to be so bold as to identify some say Catholic alliance\nThat basically would somehow influenced the rulers of the world we can say well it's a little bit on the plot\n\nAnd we could identify it as some ancient devotion to the gotta fortresses because of Saturn the cult of bail I mean look\nThe gods from the sky the gods\nShouldn't the God of fortresses because of Saturn the cult of bail I mean look\nThe gods from the sky the gods of air bail is the God of a of the sky bail is or read all of these established connections with bail\nOut and we we we now have to take into consideration and there's there's a curious parallel between vests and other falls God's worshipped in earlier times it was when both\nThe ancient people's turned away from the ... God and went for some of these a pagan following a you know God's through the air\n\nAnd a lot of uh you know a religious privacy deals with\nAllowing for this anti Christ philosophy to enter into many of the established governments religions what have you creating minions it will it will ah did you the bidding of these gods there'll be powers\nAnd so the anti Christ or the anti Christ power with his Dark Tower this cancer\nWill grow\nAnd and what it will do is it will grant certain people that lead us the ability to work in tandem with this dark sinister state\nAnd I talked about the dark stayed a while ago but the idea is to divide up the areas of the earth\nSo that\nMeans being or whatever they may be the confidence tricks sure I've been talking about they can take over and we give them honor\nAnd that is the goal\nIn all of these groups [noise] all of these groups focus and then give their devotion to give their heart and soul to death and confusion and despair [noise]\nWe were talking about the ... property we were talking about the building of the third temple I mean all of these\nThings seem to be coming together I mean can you see this coming together or am I just like losing my mind here because you know we have a rabbi on the show he had publicly on the show we have another people commenting on all this\nAnd we're asking ourselves well somebody wanting to nudge the war between God and the devil in the future is this is this some sort of ask a ton a charade or play or some melodramatic play that they want to play out that the revelation of the Methodist what is going on I mean we're wired for this right\n\nAnd you show to regular observers but don't know anything about the background of the arch\nThey'd say well what's the big deal when I say well look at the coincidence\nLook at the coincidence as to the arch of bail erected in Washington DC and the day before they decide to go\nAnd have the testimony between Ford and Kavanaugh\nIn what the test only represent and what Kavanaugh represents as a chief justice ... confirmed\nThinking about what it all means\nOn September twenty seven the testimony delivered by Brett Kavanaugh to the Senate Judiciary committee took a turn that was unexpected and quite perverse\nSheldon Whitehouse the senator from Rhode Island used a portion it means a lot of questioning time to ask the Supreme Court nominee about the definition of the devil's triangle\nOn there were so many things you could ask you about but he decided to ask about the devil's triangle and for most Americans who came of age in the same years is Brett Kavanaugh well he may not know that term means but [noise] you know barring\nSounding a little crude and in the city is I'm going to tell you it's just slang term for a three seminars you\nTry to Kevin I told the committee that is that British the term was different devil's triangle he said was merely a drinking game three glasses in a triangle he said he says like playing quarters\nHowever the devil's triangle is often referred to a sexual threes them or two men have sex with a woman and not touch one another as otherwise would be considered homosexual considered gay\nSo that what the definition is whether it's\nPersonalized my cabinet I mean something totally different or probably repeated by Sheldon Whitehouse the devil was offered in a way that somehow describes who is in control of the powers of Washington DC\nThe power of bail the God of sex the God of man and the guy to power and the God of child sacrifice that God of dead babies the God of abortion\n\nAnd what the archer bail represents is everything that the saga for Kavanaugh situations revealing specifically accusations of sexual perversion the fight for power and the laws against child sacrifice in the form of abortion\nAnd in the end the made over whether or not\nGetting from Brett Kavanaugh boils down to the issue of sexual misconduct rape aboard\nAnd in the end we made over whether or not\nConfirmed bread cabinet boils down to the issue of sexual misconduct\nRape abortion and how his confirmation in the Senate is going to have a tremendous impact or have tremendous implications for the future of our country groups like Planned Parenthood for example see the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\nHas a potential threat to what they called reproductive freedom however the focus on Kavanaugh's confirmation has been primarily on the multiple sexual misconduct allegations\nGoing back to his high school but remember if Kavanaugh if confirmed you'll have a lot to say about abortion you'll have a lot to say about what the future holds for overweight now is just a coincidence\nThe arch of bail represents all of those things I talked about in more they arrested in Washington DC just before one of the biggest\nThe biggest hearings ever to decide the fate of our country there was no coincidence here no coincidence at all I Believe there are darker forces at play here\n\nAnd you will see when the end result happens how dark it will get\n\nGood at Bradley and Pennsylvania Hi Bradley\nYou're on ground zero hey I'll ask you if you think that's the same roof Ohio organizing this archer fail is the same group that's obsessed with it and the government to like this so now what do I want to say let's\nHave states like let's say the same that's obsessed with putting nine eleven out there it's like ... like what that emergency call alert learn presidential or the other day\nWell I Would say that uh yeah I mean look the same people that are behind all this the same people to give advice we can you know and and people like Carlos from California's you'd call it a nine and give his speech about the only minority\nBecause this is pretty much in my opinion have had the ... the written all over it okay [noise]\nPeople in these I guess you'd call them secret societal say panic groups within our government within\nA places of power they know what these symbols mean to people and even though consciously you know people say oh it's just an arch no big deal but subconsciously we're wired for all of this we're wired was symbolic edgy\nAnd ah there was a study that was done again to prove that you know cellular a generational cellular hand off from generation to generation generation\nThat trauma and certain things are in our cells that triggers certain thoughts and means subconsciously to the body so when you're dealing with something when you're dealing with a symbol that symbolizes everything that I've talked about in everything is being talked about\nIt before Kavanaugh hearings you have to take that into consideration of some sort of say panic power ploy\nIn Washington D. C. and it's being done\nFor a reason it's being done as a beacon to draw in those principalities from the air the bail is ... and all the symbolism comes together and it goes beyond cabin on it goes beyond forward believe it or not any data and I'll get into that later proceed Smith is the beginning\nAnd the end is going to be dark obviously going to be dark because it was placed they're sued to guarantee a dark ending but\nYou think that looking at the origin of how the archer fail if he was he wrecked it terrorism [noise] don't you think that's the tail end itself\nWell yeah I mean you know when you look at something that ah was first destroyed the way it was basically a temple dedicated to born God and then it's destroyed and then they look at it as they destroyed this monument we shall reelected and we will put on it then it's about peace and freedom and\nOr die and then it's destroyed and then they look at it as they destroyed this monument we shall reelected and we will put on it that it's about peace and freedom and no it's never about peace and freedom regardless of who tore it down it was a symbol of what I said it was it's a symbol of bail\nSo horn God child sacrifice sexual perversion all of these things that are being talked about in Washington DC today and all the things will be ruled upon by the FBI and by the Senate where they make their votes\n[noise] or I thought it was all I got I think All right thank you ... go to Jean in Michigan Hi junior on ground zero\nCry here really interested in Connecticut and um I think they laid off for quite a long list I stayed I think as a college student to top it there is no absolute at church it adds to it and I believe is liable not characters [noise]\nSo I'm ... I live up to the to the kids will be lie and say that when\nYou're innocent and guilty until proven innocent now the other way around right\nWell and I also think about that scripture neuter on me if you\nYou really think about what we're talking about it any and any time and civilization or a group that turns on his morality has no promise no problem and so when morality is turned about\nAnd we start you know we start taking the the the I guess the orders from the confidence stricter which is what I called the devil is the confidence stricter when we're just starting to take our orders from the darker powers and the darker powers or a play they leave their symbols and signs everywhere and if you pick up on those symbols and science and you'll be well aware of what's to come\nAnd that's why say repair for anything because for the for the short time\nThat this has been happening I've noticed certain patterns I didn't talk about that I felt it was appropriate to talk about them because of of some of the things I picked up on and so that's what I'm delivering to to not you can take it for what it's worth but trust me with all these are powers to play as I say prepare for anything\nBut our I agree with you know let's say interesting to hear Saturday Night thank you\nThank you thank you Jane and it and you know and and this is in fear mongering this is pay attention night [noise] because\nYou know [noise] a talk show host talking like this people will think he's crazy and I don't care if you think I'm Crazy [noise]\nYou know I just have a lot of knowledge about the cold [noise] and this has got the cold written all over [noise] it certainly has to be worried about the future of this country because of what it all symbolizes [noise]\nThey're actually summoning the power of bail [noise] to return again in that power is what fortify as an editor fires and the wrecks the anti Christ in our midst [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe peace prize awarded to a doctor who treats victims of gang rape and a woman who was a victim of the hands of ISIS Denise ... ... ... ... recognized by judges for\nThere to [noise] to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war\nDenise ... has spent decades treating injuries inflicted on women in conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo now the ... was captured by ISIS in Iraq in ... and how does the sex life she's now a ... day this is Fox News [noise]\n\nTV documentaries and more\nOf your favorite for our time\nNation coming soon to be the personal\nFunction don't you know Fox News rundown weekly morning ... dives deep into the major and controversial stories of the day to buy the anchors of Fox News radio driving out of your perspective of news you won't find anywhere else plane depending on Fox News I guess the only job\nBecause there's so much marketing and noise and yelling our role is to take three steps back\nAnd just CERN what really matters on him to be the most important thing that we do we are looking out for the forgotten men and women in this country luring them they're going to get a straight shooter no holds barred I'm not going to cut people slash Fox is the one place where we have voices we won't be\nControls my voice [noise] nobody wants to be\nReal news real honest opinion [noise] a week after the earthquake\nAnd tsunami Indonesian island the number of people dead has now more than Fifteen hundred and more bodies may be buried in the rubble they'll never be put on trial here but the US's indicted seven Russian intelligence officers for meddling this time though beyond just inserting themselves in the presidential politics are curing America\nU.S attorneys got Bernie says Westinghouse Electric corporation is among the target\nWide ranging conspiracy to hack into private computers and networks around the world\nThe indictment is not part of the Russia probe but officials say the hackers used similar strategy to the one used during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign three of the defendants had been previously charged by special counsel Robert Mueller as senior Russian lawmaker denounced the accusations at stake in Washington Rachel sacrament Fox News\nWill get a big update on the economy in a few hours the monthly jobs report\nEconomy if that's the main one hundred and eighty five thousand jobs were created last mind battered down from two hundred and one thousand in August\nFox Business network Tracy gr us go the unemployment rate's made dip to three point eight percent that would be near at almost fifty year low whatever the numbers are that could affect the stock market at the moment futures are down a bit the morning after the Dow plunge two hundred points to a big drop from Wednesday's record high in baseball playoffs [noise]\nShocked readers and laid off and run with all the Dodgers needed Los Angeles shutout Atlanta six\nNothing on M.

whole\nDivision we're seeing here I'm not making a decision about guilt\nThis whole division that we're seeing here now not making a decision about guilt who's right who's wrong and that's not what the arguments about tonight\nOkay\nNo matter what the definition you have for what is happening here no matter who's side you're taking\nThis arch in bail is the issue\nWe aren't you bail representing everything that Ford and cabinet are talking about sexual perversion the fight for power and the cars against child sacrifice in the form of abortion\nAnd in the end\nThe debate over whether or not to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nBoils down to the issue of sexual misconduct accusations of rape abortion and how his confirmation and the Senate is going to have a tremendous implication for the future of our country when you look at groups like Planned Parenthood who see the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh as a potential threat to what they call reproductive freedom\n\nBut of course the focus on Kavanaugh's confirmation is all circling around this idea of multiple sexual misconduct allegations against him dating back to his high school and undergraduate years\nNow it's just a coincidence or or they're darker forces at play\nToday the mainstream news reported that the suspect was arrested in the biological terrorist attack on President a press on the president a President Trump secretary of defense James Mattis chief of naval operations admiral John Richard sending the campaign offices of Darryl ... of Ted Cruz\nThey have a suspect it was reported yesterday October second the department\nOf defense officials confirmed that packages containing rice and were intercepted at the Pentagon however two members of Ted Cruz is to have had to be hospitalized for exposure to the poison that has made from ground Castro beans\nWilliam Clyde Allan uh Logan, Utah man confessed to sending letters laced with poison rice and and Castro beans to President Trump and the Pentagon and it's a peculiar coincidence to know that on the day the package was sent right before daybreak the moon was seen in front of the constellation Gemini\nTo jeopardize brightest stars are politics and caster Castro in politics with the twins from different mothers from mythology\nIt must be noted that the horn God bail\nIs often to pick the stance of a giant and that is Ryan and he's wearing the crown of Gemini see the symbolism and the connections are uncanny and and and so many creepy coincidences follow after another creepy coincidences but it was reported on the day that the FBI report was submitted to review in the cabin our case\nThat the rise to the suspect was apprehended and that can goats\nFound beheaded floating down the Chattahoochee River in Georgia not only has a smart worries other contaminated drinking water scenario but it also is sort of paranoid about some sort of Massey tonic ritual happening in the area what's going on when can be headed goats show up in a river where people drink the water\nAll of them drinking the blood of the goat all them several goats in the water he said that he saw these goats heads floating in the water he didn't know what to make the guy who was the river keeper there in in Georgia\nWhile bail has been considered the bullhorn God many people also associate him with the great horned God the goat horn God and they are and the rams that God\nShe to see the significance here see the the patterns here\nOr in God and we are and the rams that God\nShe ... she the significance here the the the patterns here there are patterns to be to be noticed in and these patterns are very diabolical and very scary\nAnd I and I just and I just worry that people don't see that they don't worry that this could very well be something\nOf a ritual\nI don't know who's behind it and I'm not going to point fingers because we always have this mysterious day that we have to always always think about but who's behind what oh I Know is is that these things do happen\nAnd if they said earlier you know what about the human grow what do they do that we're hearing about what they all gather together in a forest all the leaders of the world gather together and they gather under a horned\nOwl which of course people have called ...\nSimilar to what bale bale andme oh look at the same thing so they gather under this owl and they do this ritual called the cremation of care\nAnd during the creation of care the dance around this owl and it shows a burning young boy but it's not a real boy at least they ... they they tell us is not a real boy it's an effigy of a real boy\n\nAnd yet they do this and no one questions that we all just thinks it's a bunch of guys getting their Yo Yo's out\nBecause they need to [noise]\nMeanwhile decisions are being made [noise]\nThe FBI report [noise] has now been delivered the debate is on the boat is up I think tomorrow [noise]\nWere the moon sat between the two the Gemini the twins they're proud of Gemini sits on they had a male is esoteric I Know it is but certainly everything is going into play and you know anything about being called you know how dark and sinister this play is\nAnd does in secret society is why these medieval place and they loved to carry them out there rituals and they certainly will bring us down into the abyss if we do not pay attention to what's going on and I know I sound eccentric I Know it sounds crazy but you know what I think that you know and you feel it\nYou know what times we're in right now\nGo to Bob in California Hi, Bob you're on ground zero\nHigh Claude I have to say you're my favorite twenty first century broadcaster because you drill so deep and you have profound spiritual discernment thank you\nThank you I'm a former atheist from the long extinct necessarily project and I'm now ... non denominational Christian a follower of Jesus Christ\nAnd I've come to the conclusion that tonight you have clearly articulated that divide and conquer strategy of the fallen angels I Believe God is allowing this to happen to test the will of man [noise] and what you were talking about\nIs the most important subject that anyone can think about at this point in history and thank you for what you're doing\nRobot I think you and I and I hope you're recognizing when I'm trying to say I think a lot of people are are shocked because we wanted to get into the division and the arguments over who's right news wrong but the truth of the matter is the smear is great and people are being drawn into it and it's going to create some of the darkest division\nI've ever seen in the history of my country and its be fighting fighting tooth and nail to get the information out there that yes symbolism matters\nThat yes what we're seeing is subconsciously affecting us and I don't and and I don't want people who think this is crazy this is a reality when things don't fall into place like this you have to shake your head and say something dark as the foot here I Can't put my finger on it but we have to pay attention\nI agree with you one thousand percent\nMy research backs up everything you're saying I have quietly connected the dots myself and tonight you are the voice of this reality\nAnd it takes discernment and it takes patience to peel back the layers of deception but tonight you know provided us all within insights and wisdom and have given a spiritual sunglasses\nTo help us to see it through the glare of demonic deception ... this is a project to divide and conquer a house divided will fall in the United states of America represents freedom\nAnd that is an enemy idea to tell a Terry and forces of evil\nThank you Bob thank you Clyde and God Bless God Bless you Bye bye bye\n[noise]\nGo to mark in Kansas Hi Mark you're on ground zero thank you yeah um I like a lot of what you say\nBut I have to say I don't think the problem here is anything to do with a cult is I I my my guess is it Ninety nine percent of the people in this country don't know bail from Bailey wire [noise]\nWell that's what my purpose is to teach the country the difference between bail and bailing where\nWell now there's nothing wrong with that but uh\nWell that's what my purpose is to teach the country the difference between bail and bailing where\nWell now there's nothing wrong with that but my problem is I think is the problem is the ignorance of the American people that only one American citizens can the citizenship chest\nYeah that they give to people don't want to become citizens yes I Know that it's right around twenty percent\nAnd many don't even know what the constitution may notify parts of the first to them and they don't know a lot of things about their constitution they don't know how the voting system works\nThey don't know how they're going to walk away a lot of Americans are going to walk away from his cabinet forward situation dismayed and wondering how it all went down the way it did and they thought they were on the right team and they certainly will wonder how did this happen and it's because they don't pay attention to the nuances that are being thrown at them\nI'm taking from the perspective which is something that I was noticing some of the Colts a phrase allergy\nHand signals things of that nature numbers play a fact I mean nine Elevens you name it they're all there and people have been talking about them we've been hinting at them we finally ... dead or\nYou know we're we're close to the mark and what was going on here some people disagree saying that I was up in the night and crazy but no you can go back and everything that I had brought up since the beginning of September ... since the beginning of his hearing has happened\nAnd I didn't talk about the arch of building in recognizing we said it once in passing but this arch was erected in everything that arch represents is everything is being talked about in this hearing\nEverything nothing is overlooked everything is being broadcast and somehow I think this myth arch whatever it is if a transmitter bringing forward all the darkness and pain that it will
