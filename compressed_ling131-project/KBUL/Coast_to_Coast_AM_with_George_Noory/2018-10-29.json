most\nMost of us you know we talk about other dimensions parallel realities on this program all the time about beings from other worlds about injured dimensional time travelers dimensional portals\nIt'll kind of take it for granted sometimes that all those ideas are real or at least we think we understand that it wasn't always that way for people do how do we get to this point and what does it mean for us if there are other dimensions doesn't mean there are people in those other places and if so can they get here\nOr maybe they're us\nThese are heavy topics but we have a great guess to help us get our heads around them Christopher white earned a PHD and religious studies from Harvard He's written a brilliant book called other worlds spirituality and the search for invisible

though yeah maybe ... that were reported long ago are now being recorded at ease or aliens and it\nMay be the same being that are in different forms are seen through a different culture in prison where you can do on that\nWell yeah I mean I'm a big I'm sort of follower of of John Cale is would particularly and I think one of the things for me at least\nI mean I you know different people get difference in our responses from from reading his books but from my perspective I I kind of tight the view that is most important um [noise]\nRevelation if you like or conclusion was that many of these phenomena seem to be\nMulti connected if you like to connect said and by that you know you have a lot of reports where people have seen big foot tide creatures on in the same location and timeframe a site for example UFO activity I'm the most money point pleasant West Virginia in the sixties\nUm when there was ... when they ... from the same story around the [noise]\nThe skies above both point pleasant he'll shut a lot of encounters with the men in black and UFO in Kansas so I think some of these creatures at least some of the the we're the ones like my mind and the dog men and things like that I think I'm not even sure that I should fall into the category of\nCrypto zoology will all courageous aching because I'm not entirely sure they are creatures are animals in the way we understand it um you know when you get reports of say a big for vanishing a flash of light\nOr you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing it makes me think that we're dealing with something that's perceived as an animal that night may not be I don't think Kael was I'm\nSomeone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people\nJust didn't I just turn their heads I just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle and Dale with the the way the site of these phenomena\nIn this book the book of monsters or several reports early in the book that sort of blend together at least in my head you got ... men go ugh men are we're ... we're cat she chapters are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities\nUm or ... or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has changed into a Web well from a regular person you know that sort of all the\nThe Hollywood imagery butts the fact is that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seemed to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs\nI get a lot of reports like that but I've I've never gone to reports of someone you know literally shape shift the like in America have all the London or anything like that um but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that\nThe the locations where these dog man type creatures said is intriguing it very often these\nAncient burial ... I'm Native American land um some of the the the mysterious old mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing rather than just saying that random\nYou had one where we'll gauge that was from a military base it's not ancient either it's more recent time remember them yes\nYeah this was um a British a bicycle royal Airforce ... and uh I actually was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was um\nThat to an American guy but it's working I'm overseas it already come right in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of ... which had\nI'm an American presidents this was a high to the Cold War and he he saw that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ...\nAnd would have sort of kind of look like a big foot type creature was it not for five the just the the face was very different to how you're describing nights and it was more like a lung muzzle with point today is very much like a German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of a big football day\nWith a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um you know I didn't see any reason why he should you know create a story like that will fabricate the story like that he was um\nI was able to confess I mean he's a background in the military and he said he just wanted to share the story because they never forgotten about it and it was so if\nYou've got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are record these huge dogs I mean right out of the ... you make that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic cats and the you know you can see All right maybe as an animal the ski from the new or maybe somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the donors have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the the Doberman\n[noise] well yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal parts you know clearly is not\nWell in England or the okay we have what are known as find some black dogs now I'm Conan off of Conan Doyle who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel behind the ... he actually based his novel on a pre existing legend\nI'm of one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k. um that typically a much logging much larger than regular dogs are these fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the old legends and traditions if you were to say one of these um find some black dogs it would either made that you would die or a close family member or friend would die\nI'm On the ... the dog my entire often seen at the same places like um crossroads graveyards um places like that in moderation is I've got several um reports of people saying the find some black dogs in the vicinity of stone circles in the case\nThat was the most famous one but the you know there are many many um smaller\nUm formations around the a K and I've got two cases for Scotland where witnesses so what are these large black ducks fan and like they okay she's going back centuries the dog was that one second and then quite literally gum and next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what based things are you know that clearly not normal dogs I mean all eyes the spirits of\nDogs that was a slave em I guess the only downside with that is a much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the\nSpirit of that dogs would resemble the dogs they look like in real life I'm ...\nAnd then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cat lived there and well now you write\nIn fact they become known as ... face I Am big cats\nAnd I get every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the K now the occasional sort of ask I ask I pay you know from a zoo or menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases\nAnd you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a guy from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the\nProblem is there are these large black cats robbing around the K which simply by explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of his top of Scotland needs hundreds every now for that many reports to exist\nYou know that must be anti colonies are these creatures roaming around that age if by a flesh and blood regular animals which not every race or the phenomena and thinks that's the case\nYou know what we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment talking with Nick red burn about his the monster book\nCreatures beach and beans of nature of this could be the rock and roll theme song for Halloween ACDC hell's bells we'll be right back\n[noise]\nDo you want your TV show beyond belief with your ... ... beyond belief dot com Mm\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local news pipe for the ... post and somebody had same this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or if soaring would be a better term to use over the woods or at a high speed um you know kind of a like a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... it in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press and one of them even spoke to the local police or the I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou have a story in the book about the terror you call it the terrible old man thing Nineteen Seventy seven services an ... wages in Sunnyvale, California\n[noise] oh yeah that that's a really creepy story and I guess appropriate for um Halloween I miss a story a given to me by a lady named Terri and she had the ... in Nineteen Seventy seven with what I can only call like a money and black\nAnd not many black as ... portray by Will Smith and tell me late Jones in the movies\nBut the rail many black I'm much weight of a sort of very pile and skiing a and don't look entirely humans I sort of almost look ... found pie alike and there are a lot of power normal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know\nWhereas in the movies that sort of secret agents you know of a sacred agency but Terry told me the story of has Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time she was having lunch with a friend and they create demand in black time towards them sat down\nAnd proceeded to tell Terry I'm basically to the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy and she said that just looking at him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost like the money was ... was that sort of terminology and um it was sort of penetrating eyes this old black suits and just ...\nI'm sort of intimidating creepy ... but it didn't really come across as being completely human\nDidn't something I mean the things that this guy said was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nOr yes that's right or she had a lot of tragedy in a life and the kind of\nFolk after that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never really forgot it's all ... states and I think you know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life you know believing that's\nWhat this mindset or things said I'm going to come true you know I mean you could understand how it would create a great deal of stress for someone\nYou know the man's no reason to leave the movie version of more men is that this creature years\nDifferent forms the different people at different times but it's a harbinger of doomed to come that it predates bad things that are about to happen is that sort of how you think the ... the plays out in the men's I think the point pleasant and beyond\nWell yeah I mean there's no doubt it's um you know when you look at them off my story that it's sort of saturated and weirdness and tragedy for people who don't know it kicked off the lights sixty six important players in West Virginia\nI when people started saying this creature that some people described as like a flying humanoid a few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act to others described as a giant bud\nAnd um but whatever that I was saying people would play that I was saying something way bigger than any normal but bad or anything like that\nAnd when the scientists that hides in sixty seven\nYou had a lot of weird a UFO activity um the surfacing of this weird creepy character named injury cold it was like approach how money and black and also a lot of other amyloid they unconscious and also reports of women and black\nTurning up and threatening a UFO witnesses on of the highlights of it of course you know you have the specter of the month of mind flying around town\nNow in December sixty seven um they the towns um as it's called or as he was called the silver bridge collapsed into the Ohio River a point pleasant someone side of the Ohio River an Ohio it was on the other side obviously\nAnd um the bridge collapsed into the river killing dozens of papal\nAnd various race such as um addressed the the connection or the potential connection between the presence of the law firm on\nOn the collapse of the bridge and the deaths and you have there was really sort of two overriding ferries one but my mom\nA the cause of the disaster in the gaps all that it was sort of um a warning on to tell you that in a in a challenge strange way try to warn people of looming um disasters and look\nI'm that's still very much ... divided upon you know to this day but there's also an English equivalent of a known as they our mind which also has a sort of penetrating red eyes and large wings into a humanoid form\nAnd a friend of mine John diamonds who's looked into this case deeply John eventually had to walk away from the research because he found that every time he started to get back into the\nRace a chicken investigating the all my stories about things would happen to him like car accidents and I'm ill health\nAnd it happens so many times close to just after he started doing the research that he realized from his perspective but it really was as if you know\nCome over him every time he got into his any quite literally ...

tried to influence public perception of these topics monitor these subjects watch and spy on those who've had experiences listen to the phones follow them around messed with their heads\nThe answer is yes and Nick Redfern has put together a new project that pulls together far flung examples and government documents to make the case that it's true it's called top secret alien abduction files and that's what we're going to talk about in this hour we'll be right back [noise]\nOh yeah because I mean George ... ah first book flying saucers have landed published in the early fifties that\nSold in huge Vegas gigantic numbers of books were sold 'em on and have a ... it's\nHuge figures are gigantic numbers of books were sold 'em on and have a ... he went on the lecture circuits are all around the country\nAnd he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type of governments and the communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open the file honor dams skate um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ... bucks\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by this combination angle and I'm a number of the the contact chase I'd sort of similar approaches for example it again in the u._k.\nA you have the of the area society ... by George king that was closely watched\n'em by the British a police force because I'm George King various aside to be very much I'm On the nuclear weapons I'm so falls were opened on them\nSo in other words yes we have files opened on the contact cheese but predominantly because they have these political slums or in many of their claims buddy the important thing is\nAt the end of the day what it boils down to is that the FBI and the other agencies were opening surveillance files on people who claimed close encounters um with non human entities\nYou in a report in the book that's coming out the first of November 'em\nUp secret alien abduction while you're were something that I hadn't read before it's about a very famous case\nA ... ... ... the the this is an abduction cases in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female and uh I'd never heard this new explanation but it takes government surveillance all different levels that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean the the conventional aspect if you can call it a conventional\nUm aspects of the story goes back to the fifties and it's a famous case uh from Brazil where these young man named Antonio ... claim to being taken on board a UFO and as you said he had sex with these beautiful looking um alien woman\nAnd um and for all kinds of purpose if he was taken on board against his will so he was abducted you know it was an alien abduction case\nUm we didn't you follow gee you know it's either perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of an Sonia villa suppose\nAll you know it was a really weird aspect of the phenomena and\nNow there's this little I'm known aspect to the story a which places an entirely different slant on it until now if you read casually Antonio\n... says a report that he put together for um a Brazilian a UFO researcher and a doctor named ... says\nUm he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board um came down and he started to feel weird as if he'd been drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard this craft which he described as being sort of long rectangular\nAnd um he had like something on TALK like a dish that was spinning around very fast\nAnd he was making a Beijing noise now that kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the shape they the spinning disk on top of the road\nOh he's now that kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the shape they the spinning disk on top of the road to the ... noise\nSays like the classic Saturday you get with a helicopter now a mine came forward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he ... he didn't get very much a publicity is nine was Bosco metal ... and he had ties to the CIA and various other agencies\nAnd um he told a racial or you know research rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um the the abduction was a fabrication\nAnd that's going but it really did evolve a helicopter but they talk and said I'm ... hours he was out of work and then failed lights at night\nAnd I really some sort of aerosol illusion of Jenike aerosol\nEr which incapacitated him took came on board the helicopter and the the woman was really that and the power was played out um but he is in a sort of an old to states wasn't sure what was going on and that was sort of an ceremony asleep dumped back on the ground\nAnd the the theory or the story was that the agencies within governments\nThat may well a vein rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine how this was the fifties while the CIA eyes and ... and things like they the plan was to try and determine\nTo want to extend the human mind could be altered and you know in other words if we can convince people that I can say I aliens we can convince them and anything that was basically what it came down to so metal ... claim that um\n[noise] but they they the abduction if you like was played out and they kind of just then sat back and wait to to say how much of the story was taken and and when I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was prepared in books\nIt was the case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples of these are pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets that that it's something beyond just some alien presidents that there's military or government involvement yeah I mean they see\nWhere it gets confusing if the you know if they're on January and I didn't have adoptions and then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine how the human mind can be altered and they use the UFO angle is the ... to try and you know I'm just saying how it works on people it doesn't work\nSo you know it gets really confusing when that could be rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a bowling umbrella losing their bones but not investigating the abductions themselves to nominate soap or they do in both and just not feeling\nWell yeah I think there's good evidence that it's um it's actually both because it's some of the things that I spoke with said that they don't have a number of occasions I'd actually being visited by military personnel and it wasn't like a a traumatic threatening at my base situation it was more\nThan the military personnel were actually approaching the abduct tastes quietly\nRequesting that I didn't talk about their experiences and some of them didn't some some of them have but they basically they either was as if the military were asking questions um along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why this is being done so in other words\nThey're asking questions um along the lines of what can you give us some insight as to why they should be done so in other words they were trying to get to the heart of what the abductions where why that were being done\nBut in other cases there is good evidence also of um ... they have to pay a good example and somebody um it was tied to coast to coast ... I'm Greg tell me how um he had to pay to correspondents in the Nineteen\nNineties or with up to ... who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an ap duct tape herself\nAnd Greg told me how you know back in the early nineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all the lectures I wrote to each other back and forth were open and sailed back down with type\nAnd um that is clearly be done you know age late without making it look like they have until I was taught open race failed it was almost as if whoever was doing they swam to Greg and college ... know that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of like an intimidation hey you know we're watching it\nAnd that went on you know for for quite a period\nA Greg is working tonight as our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name I was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it\nI mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who you know um are not as credible as Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt that if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction then I think sometimes paypal can become sort of\nParanoid of every little thing in their life you know and which is a dangerous route to go down um but in saying that I made another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many papers so Shiite them with capital ...\nI'll tell you what network let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side a save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions but we got some other ground to cover before then we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons ... Seventy one\nJoined the ... the bones have been Greek for sure beats and to the men's ... dot com slash ... him and looked but [noise]\nWell I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and I'm clearly a rail one\nAnd it does seem to be tied to both capital mutilation and um [noise] the Eileen abduction phenomena and one of the things that's as being no taste and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these\nWhoever's flying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organization that operates outside of government you know my actually it may sort of do research and work for the governments\nBut it's not you know like the CIA or anybody like that fly Malley cup does I don't think I think it is sort of um [noise] you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program\nDesigned to do the work and and most piping government don't know anything about it at all because you might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government\nItself you know it might have been even\nSort of ... to private corporations which again would make it more difficult to get material for the fate of Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by ah by the fate of information request\nSo in that sense I think you know the the phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ... or abductions\nThe Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out what's going on you know there there's so many cases of black helicopters and an ... helicopters turning up near the homes sometime precariously there the homes\nOf alien abduction ... and and again kind of light with college entering Greg\nThey might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abduct taste um and be able to to respond at high speed ... in the ah [noise]\nEvent that they have that the fabled climatic helps his were actually able to\nCatch an ad abduction going ahead you know in the ... very time\nSomebody who's the tuning in tonight for the first time has to think we're all crazy alien abductions Kevin relations black helicopters and we're saying yeah this happens\nBut the files that you've obtained from US government from the u._k. government sheds light on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is that there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on there\nThe white on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is that there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on in their agencies different agencies in government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about who's responsible and why this happens\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows a you know many many cases agencies\nCame the information to themselves and Leslie leads to be shed and if we'd ailing with I just had a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to a private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more difficult\nBut I mean in terms of the files on the um on the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages\nI'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol mutations I'm a wave of and cancers that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the no native and know of and I'm bored of the United states in in the ... to Seventy five\nAnd I'm just various other cases including some from the ... when there was a wave of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas\nSo I think we're seeing a pot and and then I think the violence and intimidation a sort of the the mine coal and cause the you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences or to literally physically real or not it it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented it's tough to figure it out it's not to figure out what\nSomeone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up bombs are in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there there's still coming out about those are new to me the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the germ ... got to come out in December and then there's a book that's going to be published a I think after the first year\nAnd a lot of interest in the case with your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\n[laughter] well yeah I mean you know was our story is always intrigued me I Know a lot of people dismiss you add rides but one of the things I've always found about ... is unlike a lot of pain flu hoax things\nThat you follow gee you know when this story runs out of feel um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the ... and so on\nUm you know they are and I think that the big difference we'd lose oh is he never embroidered on the ... the original story be told as it was he's never expanded on it if he tells the same ... years ago\nHe hardly tried to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and\nHowever many you know dollars and so forth he doesn't you know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story it doesn't come across like your average hoax so that's one of the thing that's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nAre between the abductions\nAnd people who claimed that in some way or another they the the grace of the aisle and grays who do the abductions\nThat somehow they have this day and sort of sinister and disturbing in trashed in the human soul 'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that\nIf a briefing papers to read out and ask for this this portion of area fifty well and he was working at allegedly and um\nHe said that was the vi aliens or whatever they are viewed us as containers and um any speculated on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the graves had some sort of obsessive interesting in the human cell\nAnd one of the things I talk about in the book is\nI'm a number of abduct pays who were approached climbed steadily by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still ask questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you're out of fuel cell leaving your body um\nDid you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of\nDo child wave the story that was always telling as well\nYou know you you look at recent developments in regard to the UFO topic in general\nAnd and of course we've been told in Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force and they stopped project ... book they're not studying it it's no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it and now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but\nThat was the cover story and and now we've learned the last ten months that wasn't true but there were ongoing studies that were more than one in fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably is ridiculous topic\nUm in light of the kind of files that you bring up in this book where there's surveillance and there's counterintelligence and there's um you know just information and things that sort\nOr do you have concerns about the recent revelations I I I I Would think that people who are suspicious in her weary of this you know they were some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a confusing angle judge you know they ... they sign glove um rail abductions fabricated abductions the surveillance\nThe government itself trying to get its had around what's going on you know you put all this together and um [noise]\nYou know ... ... a rainy sort of a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know went on the way I've written the book is to demonstrate what we know the says\nKnow what we speculate as to why the government or an agency may be doing this why might they be fabricating\nAnd abduction event but then at the same time also investigating a legitimate event\nYou know it's it's it's not ... now where um you know being a just black and white you know it it's the the lines of really blood in trying to figure out what the overall goal is but\nThere is but there is no doubt at all that you know that there is sort of extensive um surveillance of abductees\nYes it is right now the X. files everything is great nothing

and therefore they don't\nKnow the disconnect between centuries of human experience\nAnd rigid doctrine is maybe one reason why so many people have given up on science in ways that are probably inappropriate in a barren also possibly dangerous is there a way to reconcile the seemingly bizarre experiences that people have rights\nExperience is that people have reported through the centuries out of body experiences missing time time slips near death encounters other realities of science versus spirituality science and religion is their way to bridge all of that well Dr Christopher white has written a remarkable new book\nThat offers a unique and new understanding of topics that we often discuss here on this program but can't really explain\nOther dimensions of the realities whether or not this reality might bleed into others and vice versa in a moment we'll take a deep dive into the deep end of that pool and I think you will be enthralled as I was when I read this will be right back [noise]\nGoing back to the Eighteen century but really the nineteenth century mathematicians raise this possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations look clean or they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on so and in fact just to get forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing\nAnd um um and so on so and in fact just to get forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members of the audience of her string theory but sure\nUm use me so yeah there's string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theories that incorporate these other dimensions and and they do it again in order to\nMake make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern government the universe\nTheir string theorists in um theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics\nAnd the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seemed to govern reality um and we know that both sets the equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit together\nWe have we we have we have a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and I'm like governor governor some atomic world was the er the atomic world world of quantum and we know those equations work we know the correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum\nOf the of the very large so planet and sons and galaxies and it's on 'em and these are Einstein's\nTheory of general relativity we we know both of those sets of equations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorists and others are assuming that there are\nAdditional spatial dimensions\nAnd they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other equations that we have it\nIn between sort of the ... version and wondering version you have things like spooky action at a distance or which of scientists have struggled to explain and tangled in theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean you know a mathematician who who work on on these subjects I'm also have to wrestle with\nOther mysteries right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know that they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem of having two sets of equations that don't fit together\nAnd they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's\nThere's other strange an uncanny on implications of of quantum physics that um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and and ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I try to talk about that in the book as well\nRight and the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is\nAbout scientists who work on these ideas but then I'm a scientist who then have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who who have religious experiences and start to talk about them is higher dimensional or somehow related to some some concepts and says X\nOr maybe we could use flat land as an illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land and I guess it wasn't a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nYeah absolutely yeah filing the great little book um [noise] so ... kind of a classic science fiction or nonfiction book written a long time ago a written in Eighteen eighty four\nBut it has quite a cultural life and in fact I remember reading flatland in high school calculus so ... you know math students\nBefore that it has quite a cultural life and in fact I remember reading flatland in high school calculus so ... you know math students all over the world still read flat land as a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live in ah the kinds of spaces and kind of dimensions we live in so\nYeah it's a great little book written by an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott\nHe was British he was he was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century I'm coming to coming to age in a in an era of science and wrestling with what it meant to be religious and scientific at the same time\nUm you know it was a time you know this Eighteen fifty nine was Darwin's origin of species and there were a number of\nUm there were a number of\nChallenges I guess you'd say to Christianity and Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing the ... wonderful book flat land which is a book about a lower dimensional two dimensional world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of world could exist um embedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe\nBut habits flat world was it was a two dimensional world the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat and his populated by\nTwo dimensional objects objects with just lengthened with say some of them were flat square some of them were flat circles are flat triangles and and even even lines they would all slide around on the surface of this flat world\nAnd of course they believe that uh they live in a two dimensional world until the climax until the climax of the of the novel when a three dimensional object\nA sphere inserts itself goes down in in in in search itself into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks\nOut on his his flat land the rise and sees the appearance of this mysterious object he starts talking to him and the sphere says I'm you know I'm I'm a three dimensional object and I come from another another world and the square says this can't be possible\nIn the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're flat a two dimensional world is there some better than a larger world so the sphere resorts to a more um extreme measure and he he reaches over and pulls the square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and\nOf course the than the square looks around and looks down on his flat world and can for the first time the the whole world spread out in front of them though the square becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of a higher dimension that there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back to his flat world of course and this is pretty enthusiastic about this and can't can't stay quiet about it and unfortunately in ... when it's forbidden\nIt's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of the higher dimension so he's put in jail where he\nWhere he stays for a number of years and years and and the story ends\nWith this for a flat square languishing in prison I'm\nHoping that the his readers ... some of his readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be more than meets the eye to to their reality so he sort of\nThe idea that the hype resupply land wouldn't allow anybody to talk about the other dimension I mean a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interested in commenting on the sort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived\nVery interesting comment on the sort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England yeah when he where he lives right sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild Fox but up at the square character did have these wild often and even at the stationary experience right where he saw that there was\nThat there was another space or direction to reality I mean and I'm so happy ever wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to\nThink about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions that might be others um that we don't see we go through our life\nI'm thinking about our world is the only world but you know may maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment we're talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions of the doors right going through take us into the brick\nMm Mm Mm to find out where George Norris speaking go to the coast to coast am dot com website and scroll down to the bottom and click your just calendar\nI was wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension and has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality I Am hinted intends an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he he makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right in the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a\nAnd he kinda hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty onto him so I think his his story is a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nAs I say in the book he develops the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nAnd then he he starts to think you know what if these what if these mathematical variables in my equation you know these higher higher dimensions that I'm using what if they actually have a real existence somehow um you know what if the math points to the real existence of these kinds of spaces and he\nHe thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he develops of way of what he thought of as a sort of re educating the senses in order to catch glimpses into this\nInto the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the senses I involves um new it involves a set of twenty seven cubes that are labeled a all twenty seven are labeled and they're stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube you know it's three by three by three\nUm and he'd and then he he memorize the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll uh and then he'll rotate a Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions\nIt's essentially sort of an imaginative um exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues sort\nOf shook their heads I think uh you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um and doing the research but instead he he was doing things like putting this this uh this cue these cube set together and helping coach the Princeton baseball team and he actually he actually also invented the pitching damage was one of the first\nUm um you know automated pitching devices on ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure Princeton [laughter] he uh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing but he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that you know that\nAnd and these [noise] you know our ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are seeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nWell as you document and trace I mean the this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you've got a yeah the mistakes and I I Would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto it they all use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\nUm as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife or heaven and so on and so I'd hindrance ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course it's flat land both on both of their um [noise]\nYou know the writings really become important so modern artists take up these ideas a spiritual writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people in the U.S and then in Europe take these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the book chapter seven\nChapter eight is is cs Lewis right which I'm ... who I'm sure many of your listeners have heard of cs\nLewis ... the ... the fame famous British a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer he uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he incorporates ideas about higher dimensions\nTo rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he\nHe incorporates them in a number of sermons ... and and his writings and then of course many people are familiar with the send fantasy writings and the same ideas around there as well he's got he's got references higher dimensions and um and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually\nTo you know he he was he was raised in the church but then he becomes an atheist\nOr like many like many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war\nAnd becomes disillusioned there's a number of people in there you know precisely in there and James Bennett and I'm a number of people go off to World War one or World War two in the book and they have they they get into combat situations OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nThings where you have any er an out of body experience right\nYeah right exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and cause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and for some of them those war experiences and disillusioned them and turn them off from religion but others are like like James Bennett\nA he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talked about in chapter six um\nWhich is a chapter really about dreams that seem to predict the future I'm kind of a kind of a cool chapter I I really like a chapter on so he has his out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimensions how that might help explain what happened to him\nWell let's talk about dreams a little bit I explain it to me how how this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else Ohio reality another reality\nYeah yeah yeah no dreams are fascinating and um your dreams seem to be important in just about every culture around the world um you know and in many cultures people have dream interpreters you know a special people who\nAre you tell your dream to and then they tell you what it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of ah [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation books and we have\nLike a therapist Carl young who many people know about who is is really important for people as they think about interpreting their dreams and so you have a people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of of dreams and in my book uh especially in that chapter six\nPeople are also wondering about the the spiritual meaning of dreams [noise] um [noise] in that book uh there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British\nAeronautical engineer also a soldier and and goes into combat and the second bowler war in South Africa right around the turn of the twentieth century he's he's in combat in Nineteen oh two [noise]\nHe starts to have dreams that they're not surprised him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams are then seem to happen in real life so he has\nHe has predicted dreams or what what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams he has dreams that seem to predict the future\nAnd these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin\nYou know as he's camped out uh with his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wondered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress I'm In a battle and these kinds of things but he would have dreams\nAnd then he would wake up generally what happened was that he would have dreams and then who wake up and the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event in the newspaper so what one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his book\nHe has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill towards the ocean he's obviously on an island he\nRecognizes the island as as a someplace he's already been in his dreams he noticed is that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the decisions are venting gas on the ground is rumbling people seem to be going about their business they're speaking French but he's panicked and he's\nHe's he's trying to alert people he's he knows that something's going to go wrong he knows who's going to be volcanic eruption so he's running around trying to get people's attention he doesn't speak French they don't seem to speak English he ends up talking to one official after another official after another no one really believes him and he ends up waking up and kind of a sweat in a panic\nNot a couple of days later he opens up the newspaper and he reads about this a catastrophic volcanic eruption and the island that Martin ... the French speaking island of Martinique\n'em and several of the details from his dream or correct um and some of them aren't some of them aren't as well and he tries to think um you know how could this be how could how could in in my dreams how could I have seen an event that hasn't happened\nMan he he keeps it to themselves for a while but eventually discharged and has back to the u._k. where he he actually is a early inventor of airplanes and his his you can Google M. J. W done and\nYou can Google and check out his airplane design says his airplanes were used by the British and they were used by the Canadian military and others had it as as those countries had towards World War one but he he tries to reflect on this he's puzzled by these dream he's worried about them he started writing them down\nJobs open and then there are people to fill that Rush Limbaugh

[noise]\nTried me flat shouldn't exercises\nYeah no I I've never tried reflection of exercises although in my book I talk a bit about um [noise]\nAnd actually some classes I teach of after college I talk about meditation on reflective surfaces so you know there's\nEven iPhones crying you know I don't know if you've heard that word crying before but that is sort of meditating on a reflective surface that could be a computer screen or television screen or selective water or a crystal ball or a number of different services but I Know that that is a spiritual and and visionary practice that a number of people use\nIn order to you know what what we say reach a higher consciousness or um [noise] yeah but that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nUh Marcia I just wrote that down I'm going to give that a try next year the suggested\nThe dollar [laughter] I'm reading\nFrom the idea right east of the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I'm Michael\n... what happened to me is I uh I started writing the ... of a dream journal and I I wrote a dream that my\nMother's husband who was that was going to give me a car\nAt all much money [noise] so [noise] I didn't believe it was going to happen but it did happen and I'm now drive in his car and I got the money to show it was very strange to me that a dream I wrote it down with him with the ... the un and everything and it came true like\nIt's very strange to me that a dream I wrote it down with him with a date on it and everything and it came true like months later [noise]\n[noise] yeah yeah that's right yeah there's a\nThere's a whole technique that Jay W done talks about in his book experiment with time that I talk about in my book about dream journal and how to do it and it sounds like\nYou did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream up you write it down right away and and um keep a whole journal and and think about your dreams and he believed that you know like you you believe everyone would start having these experiences where they would see these glimpses um glimpses into the future and the dream so that's that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael Moore sharing a wildcard line Joe in Monterey, California good morning Joe\n[noise] good a good evening George I'm I was about to ask your guest if he ever meditative but I thought that it might be better if I introduce another\nConcept to him as a what they call super conscious mind\nI'm not I'm In remote viewing remote viewing has it's drawbacks this is um this is a mental or is this a mental travel or sold travel but it's also in a higher state of Seoul travel a call ... conscious mind and you can access these high of world\nUm I Do this with my clients and uh they go into these different worlds for different reasons whether it's healing whether it's me to love one of the other reasons um it's an extremely um complex\nA multi verse and there's so many different things out there doing so much so many different things\nI was wondering if he ever a considered also a kind of um higher shelf of remote of writing is that it's not like you're writing automatic because that automatic writing it's really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation\nAnd all that does all you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a trans state and just start writing but listening to your thoughts not thinking but listening to what comes to you and after a short time it'll start to come out and you'll be channeling your higher shelf\nYeah yeah I like that comment because it reminds me of um [noise] you know sometimes the ways that people talk about higher dimensions I as a as a dimension of consciousness right um and and you\nDefinitely have the twentieth century psychologist and Carl young and many others um you know when we talk about there being three spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or the mentioned where would that be some people say well it's\nLike it's going in and you know it's not going out and we're going to end that consciousness sort of um occupies the the sort of a new direction um and yeah through meditative practices\nI think it is\nPossible to to access those those dimensions if you'd asked if I meditate I Do meditate you know I Do sort of mindfulness meditation and I definitely get into a right into his own or do you feel sort of peaceful and quiet and calm I haven't had any visionary experiences while meditating it's it's much more\nMuch more mundane unfortunately but um but I Do I Do meditate um and and do some of those practices and in my book I talk about others who have these kind of visionary meditative practices um sounds like what you do\nThanks job with a goal you know you read about a musician a and writers who suddenly get inspiration from just out of the blue ... you have written about you know writing yesterday you woke up with it in his hand yeah or or or other songwriters entire songs already written it came from somewhere else\nAnd you talked and you talked to scientists about scientific creativity unscientific convention and [noise]\nThese some of them will talk about dreams some of them will talk about other forms of inspiration some of them will say that these ideas came from somewhere else and I don't know where they came from some of them will talk about different there's ... there's different layers of consciousness um so I think there's a lot of mystery isn't there\nA Gordon in Lakeland, Florida good morning Gordon wildcard mind your own with Chris white\nYou know George ... uh I don't think I've ever called in the year so I I usually call in the George know each other and Dr ... thank you for taking my call but before I ask my question I wanted to just\nReference ... Salem is found in Hebrew chapter seven which makes reference to the king of failing and the Old Testament genesis fourteen and so I'm going to end up for reference for the listeners and ... and ... and you didn't have it now um I I wanted to try and get your opinion on my\nMy feeling in my theory that Europe has it goes the angels and the boiling are usually\nThe same but in some cases could be different for reference I'm a Christian they'd hold to the um Iran and the Eighteen prohibition against us contacting the spirit world but now they can contact us then I have this theory that in most cases um and and bikes I wanted to ask your opinion whether\nThe up and you saw the video up there on on the your post hers website I think that they may be using magnets to make a that pops up a pencils and pens jump around but I also think it's possible but there are genuine\nDemons angels uh parents which may may actual oh I don't think it's likely later this weird but it could be or maybe extra track throws a team from another dimension and so my theory hold in most cases the demons masquerading\nAs UFOs and eat teams but in some cases they may be Eighteenth so I'll stay on the line in case you want to ask me a question or something because this was pretty deep\nWell that's all on their Gordon let's let's get their take on some of that\nYeah there there's a lot there there is a lot there and there's a you know there's a whole all of the uh all of\nThe science fiction literature and um and even alien abduction literature uses that language of other dimensions right that that these that these beans came from another dimension I'm so there definitely is a lot of that in my book and there's a lot of American Pop culture\nAbout um other dimensional or other dimensional beings um you also raise the question of\nYou know what is the relationship of UFOs and extra traditional cultural beans to ghosts and spirits or demons and that that's also a question that people raise 'em and I'm not sure I'd be able to shed any additional light on that I I Know that from just some of my reading and\nAnd not literature and I'm thinking of like ... I don't know if you know ... stuff I'm I'm young I'm communion or he actually has a new book I'm I'm On the subject as well but he he talks sort of like you do I mean he he also wonders um what's\nThe relationship is between alien abduction and extraterrestrials on the one hand versus um spirits and goes on the other so he I think Whitley has come to come to believe that there's there's a connection um and it sounds like you've come to believe that as well if there's a that the connection\nSomehow you know maybe departed spirits um our aliens or aliens are depart spirits\nKnow we we explore the idea of a unified theory of weirdness on the program a crush on him looking for connections and you'd be amazed how many scientists or\nA behind the scenes are interested in those kind of subjects as well whether there's a connection yeah look at the idea of the University of many worlds theory and you talk about it in your book of course that wasn't that long\nAs well whether there's a connection yeah looking at the idea of the universe the many worlds theory and you talk about it in in your book of course that wasn't that long ago that that would have been too far out or just about any of them to accept the now it's it's not all that a controversial anymore\nIsn't that crazy yeah it's really crazy I mean yeah and there's a number of ways of thinking about a a world or a universe with many worlds right I mean you mentioned the many worlds theory quantum mechanics and there's of course also the the multiverse idea right the multiverse ideas that there's\nYou know I'm a large number or an infinite number of other universes in addition to our visible universe and you know I um I Believe now that that's a that's a very mainstream I'm I prefer to conventional wisdom now among cosmologists and theoretical physicists that that there is a multi birth you know which is\nUm and that that's another fantastic scientific concept but there's not proof for there's really not

from my perspective I I kind of take the view that is most important um [noise]\nRevelation if you like or conclusion was that many of these phenomena seems to be\nMulti connected if you like to connect said and by that\nYou know you have a lot of reports where people have seen big foot type creatures on in the same location and timeframe or say for example UFO activity I'm the most money point pleasant West Virginia in the sixties um when they were ... when they come off from the same soaring around the\nThe skies above ... point Pleasant Hill said a lot of encounters with men in black and you were following cancer so I think some of these creatures at least some of the the we're the ones like my mind and the dog men and things like that I think I'm not even sure that I should fall into the category of\nCrypto zoology little\nShaking because I'm not entirely sure they are creatures or animals in the way we understand it\nUm you know when you get reports of say a big foot vanishing a flash of light\nOr you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing it makes me think that we're dealing with something that's perceived as an animal that

different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has changed

to London or anything like that um but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that\nThe the locations where they used dog man type creatures said anything trading and it very often these\nAncient burial ... I'm Native American land um some of the the the mysterious all mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing rather than just saying that random\nYou had one uh where we'll cage that was from a military base it's not ancient either it's more recent times remember them yes\nYeah this was um at a a British a bicycle royal Airforce helped them re and are actually was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was um\nThat to an American guy but it's working I'm overseas I've already how come right in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of ... which had\nI'm an American presence there was a high to the Cold War and he he saw that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ...\nAnd would have sort of kind of look like a big foot tot trade show was it not for five the just the the face was very different to how you would describe a knife\nAnd it was more like a lung muzzle with point today is very much like a German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of a big football day\nWith a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um you know I didn't see any reason why he should you know create a story like that'll fabricated story like that he was um\nI was able to confess I mean he's a background in the mail a tray and he said we just wanted to share the story because they never forgotten about it and it was so when\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are report these huge dogs I mean right ... you make that that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic cats and the you know you can see All right maybe it's an animal the ski from the new or maybe in somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but\nThings are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the ... the u._k. countryside and some of the donors have been really dramatic can you share it\nOver and over again running wild in the ... the u._k. countryside and some of the encounters have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the the dog when\n[noise] well yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal parts you know clearly is not\nWell in England or the okay we have what are known as find some black dogs now\nI'm Conan of Conan Doyle who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel harm to the basket veils he actually face his novel on a pre existing legend\nI'm of one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k. um that typically a much logging much larger than regular dogs a base fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the legends and traditions if you were to say one of these um find some black dogs he would either made that you would die or you know a close family member or friend would die\nI'm On the and light that dog my entire often sane at the same places like um crossroads graveyards um places like that in moderation is I've got several\nUm reports of people saying the find some black dogs in the vicinity of stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but the you know there are many many um smaller\nI'm full nations around the a K and I've got two cases from Scotland where witnesses so one of these large black dogs that and like they okay she's going back centuries the dog was that one second and then quite literally gone the next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what these things are you know that clearly not normal dogs I mean all the ice the spirits of\nDogs that once lived um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the\nSpirits of of that dogs they would resemble the dogs they look like in real life I'm ...\nAnd then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cats lived there and well now you\nWrite in fact they become known as a bases I Am big cats\nAnd I get every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the K now\nThe occasional sort of ask I ask I pay you know from a zoo menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases and you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a sky from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly\nThe problem is there are these large black cats roaming around the K which simply defy explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of the top of Scotland these hundreds every year\nNow for that many reports to exist you know there must be anti colonies of these creatures roaming

sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of ... this old black suits and just gave off these really I'm sort of intimidating creepy ... but it didn't really come across as being completely human\nDidn't something I mean the thing is that this guy said it was going to happen to her I think they they didn't happen to her\nOr yes that's right so she got a lot of tragedy in a life and the kind of\nForecasted that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never really forgot it's all ... states and I think you know to have that sort of trauma hanging over

it predates bad things that are about to happen is that sort of how you think you you'd that plays out in the men's I think the point was ... and beyond\nWell yeah I mean there's no doubt that it's um you know when you look at the ... story that it's sort of saturated in weirdness and tragedy for people who don't know it kicked off the lights sixty six important players in West Virginia\nI when people started saying this creature that some people described as like a flying humanoid a few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act so others described as a giant bud\nAnd um but

may be\nYou know something that suggests again a connection between these creatures even though they perceived as being very difference of course but uh but that that way of activity in um Chicago last year it was very interesting\nFrom my perspective although I didn't really investigate them off on science things because um there are a lot of people um who are already looking into each one of

fifties that\nSold him huge fake is gigantic numbers of books with salt I'm On and have a ... went on to lecture circuits are all around the country\nAnd he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type of governments that communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file on her dams skate um predominantly because he was someone yes talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ... bucks\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful raiding his books and go into his lectures might be influenced by vase communist angle and I'm a number of they they contact chase I'd sort of similar approaches for example it again in the ...\nUh you have the theory of society ... by George king that was closely watched 'em by the British a police force because I'm George King of the various society but very much I'm On the nuclear weapons and so falls were opened on them\nSo in other words yes we have files opened on the contact pays but predominantly because they have the political science or in many of claims but if they pull the gaze\nAt the end of the day what it boils down to is that the FBI and the other agencies were opening of islands files on pay for who climbed close encounters um wave nonhuman entities\nAre you in a report in the book uh that's coming out of the first of November um top secret alien abduction while you were something that I had read before it's about a very famous case a Antonio BS bow us ... the the this is an abduction case in which the guy had\nA brief famous case a ... ... the the this is an abduction cases in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female and uh I'd never heard the new explanation but it takes government surveillance all different level still that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean the the conventional aspect if you can call it a conventional\nUm aspect to the story goes back to the fifties and it's a famous case uh from Brazil where these young man named Antonio villas Bowers claim to being taken on board a UFO and as you said he had sex with this beautiful looking um I live in woman\nAnd um and for all kinds of purpose if he was taken on board against these will so he was abducted you know it was an alien abduction case\nI'm reading you follow gee you know he saw the perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of Sonia ... is all you know it was a really weird aspect of the phenomena and\nNow there's this little I'm known aspects of to the story\nOr which place who's an entirely different slant on it until now if you read can fully Antonio ... says a report that he put together for um a Brazilian a UFO research or an adult to nine to ...\nUm he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board um came down and he started to feel weird as if he'd been drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard this craft which he described as being sort of long rectangular\nAnd um he had like something on TALK like a dish that was spinning around very fast\nAnd he was making a Beijing noise and that kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the the shape they the spinning disk on top of the road to the beach annoys\nSays like the classics and you get with a helicopter now a mine came forward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he's story didn't get very much a publicity is your name was Bosco metal ... and he had ties to the CIA and various other agencies\nAnd um he told a racial a year for research rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um the the abduction was a fabrication\nAnd the lord but he really did evolve a helicopter but they talk and said I'm ... hours he was out to the ... lights at night\nAnd they release some sort of aerosol illusion of Jenike aerosol\nA witch incapacitated in Tokyo mumbled the helicopter and the the woman was really there and the power was played out um but he is in a sort of an old to states wasn't sure what was going on and that was then soda and ceremony asleep dumb back on the ground\nAnd the the the rate of the story was but the\nAgencies within governments that may well a vein rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine how bad Monday through the fifties while the CIA eyes and ... and things like this the plan was to try and determine\nTo what extent the human mind could be altered and you know in other words if we can convince people that can say I aliens we can convince them and anything that was basically what it came down to so metal ... claim that um\n[noise] the the the the abduction if you like was played out and buy kind of just then sat back and wait to to say how much of the story\nAbduction if you like was played out and buy kind of just then sat back and white to to say how much of the story was taken and I went I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was a parenting books it was the case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples of these are pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets to think that it's something beyond just some alien presidents that there's military or government involvement\nYeah I mean they should where it gets confusing if they're you know if they're on January and I didn't have adoptions and then you have agencies fabricate taking them to try and determine how the human mind can be altered and I use the UFO angle is the ... to try and you know um to see how it works on paper doesn't work\nSo you know it gets really confusing when that could be rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around losing their bones but not investigating the abductions themselves the phenomena itself or are they doing both and just not feeling\nWell yeah I think there's good evidence that it's um it's actually both because it's so many abductees that I spoke with said that they found a number of occasions I'd actually being visited by military personnel and it wasn't like a a traumatic threatening at my base situation it was more\nThan the military personnel were actually approaching the abduct pace quietly\nRequesting that I didn't talk about their experiences and some of them didn't some some of them have but they basically they ... it was as if the military were asking questions\nUm along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why this is being done so in other words they were trying to get to the hearts of what the abductions where and why that were being done\nBut in other cases there is good evidence also of um surveillance of the of the object ... a good example\nAnd somebody um who is tied to coast to coast am Greg ... I'm Greg tell me how um he had to pay to correspondence in the Nineteen uh ninety's a duck to call it ... who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an ap duct tape herself\nAnd Greg told me how you know back in the early nineties you know sort of pre Internet tierra um all of the ... I wrote to each other back and forth\nWere opened an sailed back down with type\nAnd um now these can clearly be done you know a family without making it look like the ... I was taught to open a race failed it was almost as if whoever was doing this one to Greg and call it and it's a no that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of luck and intimidation hey you know we're watching it\nAnd that went on you know for for quite a period\nGreg is working tonight at our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it\nI mean there are a lot of people in the U. of oh field who you know are are not as credible is Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nI think sometimes you know there's no doubt that if you have a traumatic experience like an alien abduction then I think sometimes people can become sort of paranoid of every little thing in their life you know and which is a dangerous road to go down um but in saying that I mean another example is the whole issue of\nYou know which is a dangerous road chicken hum button shined badge I mean another example is the whole issue black helicopters which I think many people showed Shiite and we've got two shows\nI'll tell you what network let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side I'll save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions but we got some other ground to cover before that or we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons eyes and making Seventy one\nJoined the coast to coast am Facebook page with thousands of members bitch Greek for show updates in connecting with others ... dot com slash ... him and good luck but [noise]\nHad some ... agents who looked at it very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and in combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you're discussing this book\nWell I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and I'm only a real one\nUm they do seem to be tied to both ... and I'm In abduction phenomena and one of the things that's been noticing I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these\nFlying helicopters potentially I think it's part of an organized fashion that up right outside of government you know my actually my sort of do research and work for the government\nThe CIA or anybody like that fly helicopters I don't think I think it is sort of um you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work and\n... and most people in government don't know anything about it at all because you might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government\nItself you know it might have been even\nSort of ... to private corporations which again would make it more difficult to get material for the fate of Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by a by the freedom of information request\nSo in that sense I think you know the the phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ... or abductions\nThe Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out\nWhat's going on you know there there's so many cases of black helicopters an unmarked helicopters turning up near the homes sometime precariously there the homes of alien abductees and and again kind of light with college or in Greg\nThey might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abductees 'em\nBe able to to respond at high speed ... in the event that they have that the papal climatic helps his were actually able to catch an abduction going ahead you know in the ... so that very time\nSomebody who's the tuning in tonight to the first time that they were all crazy alien abductions cattle mutilation black helicopters and we're saying yeah stuff happens but the files that you've obtained from US government from the u._k. government should wait on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is\nThat there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on in their agencies different agencies in government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about\nWho's responsible and why this stuff happens\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows a you know many many cases agencies\nHave the information to themselves unless they used to be shed and if we ... I just had a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to a private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more difficult\nBut I mean in terms of the files on the um on the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages\nI'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol mutations I'm a wave of and cancers that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the ... native and know of and I'm bored of the United states in in the ... to Seventy five\nAnd I'm just various other cases including some from the ... when there was a wave of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas\nSo I think we're seeing a pot and on and I think some violence and intimidation a sort of the the mine coal and cause the you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences or to literally physically real or not it it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented it's tough to figure it out and it's got to figure out what\nSomeone else is looking for when they put people through this you mentioned you bring up bombs are in the in the book\nWhat someone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up ... in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there was a film coming out about those are it'll be the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the germ ... coming out in December and then there's a book that's going to be published I think after the first year\nAnd a lot of interest in the case but your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\n[noise] well yeah I mean you know ... story is always intrigued me I Know a lot of people dismiss you add rides but one of the things I've always found about ... is unlike a lot of pain flu hoax things\nThat you follow gee you know when this story runs out of feel um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on\nUm you know they are and I think that the big difference we lose our case he never embroidered on the ... the original story be told as it was he's never expanded on it if he tells the same ... years ago\nHe hardly tried to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and\nHowever many you know dollars and so forth he doesn't you know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story it doesn't come across like your average ... so that's one of the thing that's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nUm between the abductions\nAnd people who claimed that in some way or another they the the grace of the aisle and grays new to the abductions\nThat somehow they have this day and sort of sinister and disturbing interest in the human soul\n'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that um he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read out and ask for this portion of area fifty one he was working at allegedly [noise] and um\nHe said that with the V. I. aliens or whatever they are viewed us as containers and um any speculated on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the ... had some sort of obsessive interesting in the human cell\nAnd one of the things I talk about in the book is\nI'm a number of abduct pays who were approached climbed steadily by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still ask questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you're out of fuel cell leaving your body um\nDid you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of\nDo child wave the story that was always telling as well\nYou know you you look at recent developments in regard to the UFO topic in general\nAnd and of course we've been told in Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force and they stopped project ... book they are not studying it is no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it\nAnd now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but that was the cover story and and now we learned last ten months that wasn't true but there were on going studies were more than one in fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably is ridiculous topic\nUm in light of the kind of files that you bring up in this book where there's surveillance and there's counterintelligence and there's um you know disinformation and things that sort\nOr do you have concerns about the recent revelations I I Would think that people\nYou know just information and things that sort of do you have concerns about the recent revelations I I Would think that people who are suspicious sooner wary of this you know they there's some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a confusing angle George you know they ... they sign glove um rail abductions fabricated abductions the violence\nThe government itself trying to get its had around what's going on you know you put all this together and um [noise]\nYou know ... ... a rainy sort of a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know when uh the way I've written the book is to demonstrate what we know the says you know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency might be doing this why why they'd be fabricating\nAnd abduction event but then at the same time also investigating a legitimate events\nYou know it's it's it's not ... now where um\nYou know being a just black and white you know it it's the the lines are rarely blood in trying to figure out what the overall goal is but there is but there is no doubt at all that you know that there is sort of extensive um survivor and solve abductees\nFind out about the fresh start program that is now available through the big tax relief civic tax relief special tax hotlines can help you discover all the relief programs available for free\nI Would recommend anyone who has a tax on the context of ... actually\nJust cold eight hundred three one five nine nine five six to eight hundred three one five nine Ninety five six ... call now eight hundred three one five nine nine five six eight hundred three one five nine nine five six [noise]\n\nRussia question how long has\nThe medium she's been telling us that it's only a question of time that something happened settlement Donald Trump self destruct putting it never happens instead we keep watching his predicting self destructing Trump's opponents melt down now practically every day over the fact that Trump is\nThey melt down over to the fact that they can't make\nTrump meltdown Rush Limbaugh he's trying to handle one PM on news on that point five we this is where ...\nShe'd be well am nine Seventy buildings these huge huge ward and you're listening to news talk Ninety five boys [noise]\nAre you among the millions of Americans living with chronic pain so you may think prescription opioids are the solution truth is opioids only mask the pain\nAnd they come with serious side effects from ... to withdrawal symptoms to overdose there is another choice physical therapy physical therapists treat pain through movement and exercise shoes physical therapy visit move forward P.

all there is that the current scientific paradigm tells us that when we die that's it that's the yet at the many of the experiences that people report over the centuries things that happened to them for real or not real cat exist and therefore they don't\nYou know the disconnect between centuries of human experience\nAnd rigid doctrine is maybe one reason why so many people have given up on science in ways that are probably inappropriate and unfair and also possibly dangerous is there a way to reconcile\nThe seemingly bizarre experiences that people have reported through the centuries out of body experiences missing time time slips near death encounters other realities of science versus spirituality science and religion is their way to bridge all of that well Dr Christopher white has written a remarkable new book\nThat offers a unique and new understanding of topics that we ought to discuss here on this program but can't really explain\nOther dimensions of the realities whether or not this reality might lead into others and vice versa in a moment we'll take a deep dive into the deep end of that pool and I think you will be enthralled as I was when I read this will be right back [noise]\nGoing back to the Eighteen century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to they want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant\nUm um and so on so and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh and more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members every audience her string theory\nBut sure um use me\nSo yeah there's string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theories that incorporate these other dimensions and and they do it again in order to\nMake make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern govern the universe\nTheir string theorists in um theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics\nAnd the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seemed to govern reality um and we know that both sets the equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit together\nWe have we we have we had a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and I'm like governor governor subatomic world with the er the atomic world\nOf equations that govern very small things in the universe and I'm like governor governor subatomic world with the er the atomic world world of quantum and we know those equations work we know the correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum\nOf the of the very large so planets and sons and galaxies and it's on 'em and these are Einstein's\nTheory of general relativity we we know both of those sets of equations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorist and others are assuming that there are additional spatial dimensions\nAnd they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other equations that we have it\nIn between sort of the ... version and the ... version you have things like spooky action at a distance or which scientists have struggled to explain entanglement theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean\nYou know a mathematician who who work on on these subjects I'm also have to wrestle with other mysteries right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know that they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem of having two sets of equations that don't fit together\nAnd they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange an uncanny on implications of of quantum physics\nThat um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and and ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I tried to talk about that in the book as well\nWrite the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is\nAbout scientists who work on these ideas but then I'm a scientist who doesn't have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who who have religious experiences and start to talk about them as higher dimensional or somehow related to some some concepts in physics\nOr maybe we could use flat land as an illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land it I guess it wasn't a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nYeah absolutely yeah the ... the great little book I'm so flatland kind of a classic science fiction or nonfiction book written a long time ago a written in Eighteen eighty four\nHas quite a cultural life and in fact I remember reading flatland in high school calculus so ... you know math students all over the world still read flat land as a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live in uh the kinds of spaces and kind of dimensions we live in so\nYeah it's a great little book written by an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott\nHe was British he was he was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century I'm coming to coming to age in a in an era of science and wrestling with what it meant the religious and scientific at the same time\nUm you know it was a time you know this Eighteen fifty nine was Darwin's origin of species and there were a number of\nUm there were a number of\nChallenges I guess you'd say to Christianity hum and Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing the ... wonderful book flat land which is a book about a lower dimensional two dimensional world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of world could exist um imbedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe but habits flat world was that was a two dimensional world the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world\nTony universe but habits flat world was it was a two dimensional world the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat and his populated by\nTwo dimensional objects objects with just lengthen with some of them were flat square some of them were flat circles are flat triangles and and even even line they would all slide around on the surface of this flat world\nAnd of course they believe that uh they live in a two dimensional world until the climax until the climax of the of the novel when a three dimensional object\nA sphere inserts itself goes down in in in inserts itself into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks\nOut on his his flat land the rise and sees the appearance of this mysterious object we started talking to them and the sphere says I'm you know I'm I'm a three dimensional object then I come from another\nAnother world and the square says this can't be possible\nIn the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're flat a two dimensional world is is imbedded on a larger world so the sphere resorts to a more extreme measure and he he reaches over and pulls a square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and\nOf course the than the square looks around and looks down on his flat world and can for the first time the the whole world spread out in front of them though the square it becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of a higher dimension that there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back to his flat world of course and this is pretty enthusiastic about this and can't can't stay quiet about it and unfortunately in ... it's forbidden\nIt's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of the higher dimensions so he put in jail where he where he stays for a number of years and years and and the story ends with this for flat square languishing in prison I'm\nHoping that the his readers ... some of his readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye to to their reality so he sort of\nThe idea that the high priest a flat land wouldn't allow anybody to talk about the other dimension I'm In a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interested in commenting on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived right the sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um\nAny wild thoughts but ah but the square character did have these wild often and I even had the visionary experience right where he thought that that was that there was another space or direction to reality and and I'm so happy haven't wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to\nYou know think about the possibility that above hours three spaces are three spatial dimensions that might be others um that we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking that our world is the only world\nBut you know made maybe there's something beyond\nIt's a it's fun to to talk about and one to imagine um but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um I I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we will jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who were inspired by this idea\nA very sad I mean people who embrace it and uh they they go through trials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it and

moment the we're talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions of the doors right gone through take us into the brick\n\nDefined outward George Norris we can go to the coast to coast am dot com website scroll down to the bottom and click your just counted or the\nAnd wanted to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to the you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher to mention another new as a new more scientific way of thinking about um you know the existence of other spiritual low level or worlds to reality I Am hesitant\nThe new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality I Am hinted intends an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right in the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a\nAnd he kind of hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the math provide certainty onto him so I think is his story is a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nAs I say in the book he develops the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in in the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nAnd then he he starts to think you know what if these these mathematical variables in my equation you know these higher higher dimensions but I'm using what if they actually have a real existence somehow um you know what if the math points to the real existence of these kinds of\nSpaces and he\nHe thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he develops of way of what he thought of as a sort of re educating the senses in order to catch glimpses into this\nInto the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the senses I involves um new it involves a set of twenty seven cubes that are labeled a all twenty seven are labeled and they're stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube you know it's three by three by three\nUm and he'd and then he he memorize the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll uh and then he'll rotate a Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions\nIt's essentially sort of an imaginative\nUm exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues\nSort of shook their heads I think uh you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um and doing your research but instead he he was doing things like putting this this uh this cue these cubes sets together and helping coach the Princeton baseball team and he actually he actually also invented a pitching gun which was one of the first\nUm um you know automated pitching devices on ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure Princeton [laughter] he uh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing but he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that\nYou know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these [noise] you know our ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are\nSeeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nWell as you document in trades I mean the this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you've got a yeah the mistakes and I I Would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto a do they all use this idea for their own purposes\nAbsolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\nUm as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife or heaven and so on and so I'd hindrance ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course it's flat land both on both of their um [noise] you know the writings really become important so modern artists take up these ideas\nLand both on both of their um [noise] you know the writings really become important so modern artists take up these ideas a spiritual writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people are in the U.S and then in Europe take up these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the\nBook chapter seven\nChapter ages is cs Lewis right which I'm ... who I'm sure many of your listeners have heard of cs Lewis ...\nThe ... the fame famous British a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer he uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he incorporates ideas about higher dimensions\nTo rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he\nHe incorporates them in a number of sermons ... and and his writings and then of course many people are familiar with the scent fantasy writings and the same ideas are in there as well he's got he's got references higher dimensions and um and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually to you know he\nHe was he was raised in the church but then he becomes an atheist\nOr like many many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war\nAnd becomes disillusioned there's a number of people in there you know precisely isn't there and James van it and I'm a number of people go off to World War one or World War two in the book and they have they they get into combat situations OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nThings you have any or it out of body experience right\nYeah right exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and cause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and for some of them those war experiences and disillusioned them and turn them off from religion but others like like James Bennett\nA he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talk about in chapter six um\nWhich is a chapter really about dreams that seemed to predict the future I'm kind of a kind of a cool chapter I I really like a chapter on so he has this out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimensions how that might help explain what happened to him\nWell let's talk about dreams a little bit I explain it to me how how this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else Ohio reality another reality\nYeah yeah yeah no drinks are fascinating and um your dreams or seemed to be important and just about every culture around the world um you know and in many cultures people have dream interpreters you know a special people who\nAre you tell your dream to and then they tell you what it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of ah [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation books and we have people like the Swiss psychotherapist Carl young who many people know about who\nIs is really important for people as they think about interpreting their dreams and so you have a people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of of dreams and in my book\nUh especially in that chapter six\nPeople are also wondering about the the spiritual meaning of dreams [noise] um [noise] in that book uh there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British\nAeronautical engineer also a soldier and and goes into combat and the second bowler war in South Africa right around the turn of the twentieth century he's he's in combat in Nineteen oh two [noise]\nAnd he starts to have dreams that they're not surprised him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams are then seem to happen\nThat surprised him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams are then seem to happen in real life so he has\nHe has predicted dreams or ... what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams he has dreams that seem to predict the future\nAnd these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin\nYou know as he's camped out uh with his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wondered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress I'm In a battle and these kinds of things but he would have dreams\nAnd then he would wake up generally what happened was that he would have dreams and then you wake up and the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event in the newspaper so one one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his book\nHe has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill towards the ocean and he's obviously on an island\nHe recognizes the island as as a someplace he's already been in his dreams he noticed is that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the decisions are venting gas on the ground is rumbling people seem to be going about their business they're speaking French but he's panic and he's\nHe's he's trying to alert people he's he knows that something is going to go wrong he knows it's going to be volcanic eruption so he's running around trying to get people's attention he doesn't speak French they don't seem to speak English he ends up talking to one official after another official after another no one really believes him and he ends up waking up and kind of a sweat in a panic\nNot a couple of days later he opens up the newspaper and he reads about this a catastrophic\nVolcanic eruption and the island Martinique the French speaking island of Martinique 'em and several of the details from his dream or correct um and some of them aren't some of them aren't as well and he tries to think um you know how could this be how could how could in in my dreams how could I have seen an event\nThat hasn't happened\nMan he he keeps it to themselves for a while but eventually discharged and has back to the u._k. where he he actually is a early inventor of airplanes um and his his you can Google I'm Jay W done and\nYou can go go in and check out his airplane design says his airplanes were used by the British and they were used by the Canadian military and others had it as as those countries had towards World War one but he he tries to reflect on this he's puzzled by these dream he's worried about them he started writing them down", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Billings", "day": "29"}
