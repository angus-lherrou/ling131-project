situation but you know what we got to have our own rocketry here in the United states\nYeah we absolutely do to argument is is it shows how unreliable the Russian hardware really it I mean this is that an old are you a spacecraft and and boosters they've been getting for years they've they've had seven hundred and forty five flights\nThey had Twenty one failures that that does seem like much but it three percent and you know you're flying up the international space station at three percent fail you around your boosters is a it's not acceptable because it I mean most of the time you did not recover the ... most of the time of year like this catastrophic\nOh absolutely absolutely you know I still wonder what are we doing on the eye assess the international space station what are they doing up there\nI think we're watching for aliens mostly I'm maybe\nIt'll British TV show what would the UFO er that base intruder detectors said they called it up I think it kind of our version that said I mean I don't I don't know what else are you and they're not doing a whole heck of a lot of science and it\nSeems like with the point where either we should just building thing out and expand it and turn it into Babylon five or something or we should just give up and let it crashed down to the markets with one of those two because we're at a turning point I think and are we going to go forward with an American manned space program or not it really have time for us to make that they said well\nOff because they're gonna they're gonna hundred dollars\nYeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world which types\nOf companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollars in next time it goes to\nFour thousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that that nothing nothing beach that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when they're\nOn well what did the indicators marking the last two days is really what's the cause is it just panic or ... which\nWill will will to things in and actually they both relate back to the good old Donald hum last week you saw 'em treasury bond you you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year bonds shoot\nUp I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this would happen we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks up above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to four point three percent in in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and higher or lower it so\nYou know that that was the first thing that happened but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean this this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating and a lot of ways by\nChina's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide a down turn and crash and so so it was rising interest rates and um and then and more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about\nFor the last month at twenty six forty\nI'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know and then a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp rally for years and has been waiting to go back and we said look at breaks twenty six forty\nThat that's a sign that China is starting to go down again and it and it did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat there's something wrong and and again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking oh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates was the first black\nSomething wrong and and again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking oh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates was the first whack these last two days had a lot more to do with China and Trump\nIs really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways and Trump has been using the economy with tax cuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff\nAnd that causes inflation to grow up which it has and it causes grows to go up temporarily and what does the Federal Reserve is going to do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do it the economy's overheating they raise interest rates\nIf it's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous and and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I created this great thing and the trumps wrecking it no\nThis was predictable he's not you know he's got some you know gut feelings we gotta do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences\nOf things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pulled back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose what have you read a couple more D's downturns tomorrow's another five hundred point drop I mean then people start saying there's something wrong\n[noise] yes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this or the beginning of the year the markets peaked in in late January\nReal kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough we have a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent and different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kind of like went sideways and then he came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nWhat happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling and shorting to market it happened very quickly you'll see you know I've seen this the last seven\nStock bubbles throughout the history of everything from the Nikkei and the early nineties in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two crashing and every other one in the last century including the tech correct in recent bubbles\nThat first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half\nMonths with people get locked\nAnd that's the sign that that's the only way you know that the bubble has finally birth the problem is by the time that comes people already in trouble and they're panicking and and they get whacked hard so we did a dangerous sign is if we keep going down and and and literally the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just the balance after\nYou know fourteen hundred points that may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers Seventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand um to doubt\nIf the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders are going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds keep going up\nThis is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not\nFifty fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy\nEighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash\nWill happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make bubbles so dangerous [noise] um uh you know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross trial once you know when somebody asks what what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early\nBecause that level to this is uh\nOh from the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early because that's how this level to this is a bubble this isn't a normal bull market\nThat correct so nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles go up dramatically and they crash and and half the time and they crashed twice as dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this\nThis is a once in a lifetime of vent and it it the signs to me are building we've been telling people man this looks like a top here in the garden top here we only get\nThe good part is we can gauge as if we only get a normal ten Fifteen Percent or so corruption by the end of the year than we're probably good for one more route one more Trump rally into next year before this thing blows but ah\nRight now though the odds are shifting towards ah it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will boost the as bad as that time period\n[noise] ... well this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George ... decades in advance on demographics the baby boom peaking\nAnd and and and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries well what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and then their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nLow interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kind of like went sideways and didn't the laboratory debt emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more\nOn top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred and ... trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world [noise] and and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest debt bubble of anybody in any time in history and then when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so\nMy view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and stock crash because they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just build the tobacco up with money that was draining\nThis time more debt\nEverything's more stretch the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a\nFifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty per\n... she was absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back curious dance with us his website is his name Jerry ... D. E. N. T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff syllable lifetime and ...\n... ... am at no available bribe bone in now and we're not going to lose ... on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n[noise] right again well any time you get a major downturn recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure and that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and government the recessions is bad thing\nThey're good things um but and then and you want to buy the company that\nSurvive you know we had the dot com crash that was a Super Bowl I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half a six to seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently\nCracked in a lot of companies will not end well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if it apart Amazon there oh my God I was\nYou know like a you know a hundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies and you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued an bubble like this but they're also\nGo down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent that ended up being that was it ended up being the greatest company in the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so that's the secret and and the other thing is even if the earnings up companies if companies are so good\nThat they keep their earnings flap instead of declining evaluations on stock how many times earnings white people pay thirty times earnings for the typical\nBlack instead of declining evaluations on stock how many times earnings like people will pay thirty times earnings for the typical stock right now or forty and and sixty or eighty for the best taxed on\nThose collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down to fifty percent even if its earnings don't declined and then of course most companies' earnings do decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you see you have a secret indicator looking at some of the danger is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou know it's not a secret well I Know I Know believe\nMe Wall Street won't do this any way so you don't have to worry but\nBut what what happened there the smart money or the people who\nWho kind of push ups up and and and then when things go down there the ones to jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors in Boulder bought in stocks over about they're the ones that short for his I mean they're in the know\nAnd and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks that eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and\nStuff [noise] well they you can measure this\nAction or there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is the dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes I mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures markets there ahead of everything\nAnd so the market's gonna open down it opens down right at the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves that may well that's when the dumb money and most people would stop or something to protect themselves that's one of those reactions made that's the ...\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour end of the clothes so they measure this indicator measures but the smart money is doing versus a dumb money and the smart money\nHas not bought this rally in fact they've been shorting it they've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom in February of this year after that crap now they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to\nJanuary top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is declines and smart money buying and that\nHas been a strong warning signal to me in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico now\nI Am in Puerto Rico and I went through hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo where it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here and Michael\nBoth of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blowing up all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stop it it's just unbelievable it's it's like you know God's got angry or something you know into through a temper tantrum she'd moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and coal labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has ... in Calais wrote\nIslands that are like St Thomas and St Croix or St John\nAnd and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there in in I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family\nFor many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place spending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade\nAnd I said to my why don't we moved here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality on a corner of the price of South Beach Miami where we used to live and and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport\nWhich I get to twenty minutes an advanced they don't even check your id they just wait to see how you're going to tilt\nThe luau I'm not sure I liked that part\nWell it's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane flight it scenic\nI'm I'm I leave my condo during and landing on this island and one hour and once I got down here I realize I I could qualify for some tax advantages here which are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living and the crypto guys are coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualify there's real strong tax advantages so I'm living much cheaper\nAnd a great climate I can still fly to New York in four hours director Miami in two hours and in almost anywhere in the east coast is now it's difficult if I'm coming out your way but I have to go out to California which I just did\nFor a long time that that\nThe long haul now but I tell ya I I like it down here they've been in a recession there's no civil unrest that's recession for twelve years\nWe're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent ear and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd then I'm just going to see what happens in the next uh so many years\nThe big banks down there\n[noise] yeah yeah yeah about ... and ... down here and actually a lot of the banks are by bank of popular and Santander or Spanish Banks because this is by origin more of a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but they there are George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service so people\nEither just because they think we're in Zimbabwe\nOr they charge some huge X and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special\nPasta sauce and things like otherwise man this is a good deal and\nYou know I'm Down here for other reasons but I tell you people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower a\nBoom in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that they are allowed to vote in our elections\nWill most important they are allowed to freely mover immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities\nAnd then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico to put their kids to colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then\nSometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving\nTo the United states why sixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants from Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people and that's why\nThey have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides the U.S is better\nHere through tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized Puerto Rico because the U.S as always always rubbing their best people and again it it's they're more professional educated people are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\n[noise] so I Want you to use your best impressions what you think will

S. like there is in Puerto Rico now and that is one difference\nThese Puerto Ricans are not um don't have that sort of tension\nIn that polarity that's the one thing I can tell you 'cause I'm sitting here and I haven't even seen a bar fight near the less than a crime where where I Am\nHere is affected Hispanics in most African American you Rudy no democratic\nBig deal ... what what was his point\nWhile he well he's saying that that you know the the rich people don't like that these are people who are going to vote blue and we got this blue red war so when they see Puerto Ricans he's saying come to Rochester well we don't like him and he said they're not as high skilled well I'm telling ya in Orlando they're not saying that they're they are basically\nA reinvigorated Orlando there's four ... four hundred and fifty thousand Puerto Ricans now in just Orlando and a million\nIn Florida and those million which which she is right\nFour ... four hundred and fifty thousand Puerto Ricans now in just Orlando and a million\nIn Florida and those million which which she is right about or tilting the boat all all the key Senate races up and guess who they're appealing to\nThose Puerto Ricans the Republican and the Democrats Rick Scott and Bill Nelson are running for Senate in their boat courting the Puerto Ricans because they're five percent of the vote and that's enough to swing an election and they do\nThat won him a crowded ... isn't that what our democracy ...\nYes it is it is\nLet's go to New Jersey taken away Gregory\nRight yes my question Georgia and good morning I'm just like to say I live in a congressional district in northern New Jersey\nWe get thirty percent of our federal tax dollars back the blue states subsidized they're red states and ... and the state to receive the most was Kentucky with an idiot McConnell with the stresses me nuts and it's been like this for fifty years we subsidize the south in the southwest the northeast us an SOS the mid west\nFor um for your guest\nI've been reading Financial Times for many years and what you're saying as his column every week scaring the heck out of all of us with with what you're saying\n... will be closer to home I'm about four years from retirement if only thirty five years almost forty years or entity which was nationwide ... through New York\nOr pension was over funded in the late nineties it took a horrendous hit with the ... the tech stocks and then two thousand they almost obliterated as we have a meeting with thousands of is about to retire right all high tech guys and gals the whole thing\nWe have a meeting in about three weeks or entity can I don't trust any body on Wall street I think there should be a ... year teen set up there if you will again and I'm frankly rose bushes should come down from heaven and come back\nBut the thing is what do we ask our financial people who are running our pension fund with their fancy suits what are they doing to anticipate this problem and I'll take your answer off the air\nYeah you know real quick they too ... not only the stock market starts collapsing everybody's been driven end of the stock market because quantitative easing monetary policy's push down long term rates that you can get on safer investments like treasury bonds and corporate bonds and things like that which pension plan should be more end but\nBut you can't get your seven to eight percent returns they used to get with a conservative combination of stocks and bonds so everybody's gone more stocks and then stock start collapsing then they're in trouble the truth is as much as it's counter intuitive a pension plan today the best thing do\nWhat we're telling people right now this this break up and ... is going to make bonds\nA corporate bonds and treasury bonds long term more attractive if that thirty year treasury bond goes up to four point three percent we're telling our subscribers this is likely to happen\nIn the next several months for the next year at the most you're going to want to lock those and not only to get a four point three percent return is way better than almost any stock the evidence but those bonds will appreciate\nWhen stocks collapse and the economy slows down and interest rates go down bonds like falling interest rate so right now is not the time to buy these bonds but there's going to be a huge opportunity for investors\nAnd pension funds to lock in quality bonds it's only the quality bonds that did well in the great depression AAA corporate\nTen and thirty year treasury bond lock in those things for appreciation and for higher yields and don't be in stock the worst place to be for a pension plan is to do with everybody that run into stocks and collapse and you also write about blue states subsidizing read\nThat's why I think this time around it's going to be the blue states that succeed against red policies that they don't agree with but most of all there\nYour red economy when New York and California when the northeast and the west coast succeed from the union it'd be would it would be a problem\nLet's go to Thomas and the whole year California he Tom go ahead\nHey George thank you for taking my call sir Harry your research is really appreciated um [noise] I mean you know\nYou brought up earlier that a corollary to depressions and major recessions this war and\nYou could argue that the world today and saying\nHey third world war that's a proxy war you know in places like Syria yeah I'm In the south China Sea et cetera and one global corporations cannot\nCompromise their differences in the global boardrooms\nThere was a shooting war just like World War one world war two Korea\nVietnam and on and on\nSo don't you think I mean a limited nuclear exchange could turn the United states and to a third world country\nIn a day or two you know with a lecture magnetic poles it's cetera what is the probability of a shooting war\nYou know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan [noise] um but but what we're saying and zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge\nIn World War one people don't realize globalization global trade collapse sixty percent\nBetween World War one and World War two with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising tariffs just like we're seeing now everything's happening like happening this works it it it's\nIt everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries lose [noise] and and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea they can definitely be stopped there there's no question\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because\nNobody is big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have\nIs there's there is no counter bailing power they couldn't really take\nUs on one on one somebody hit us they would be dead long before we would so I think that's kind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundreds no there were major countervailing power is that's how you could have World War two but we're going to definitely have\nA political huge political sees this trade war we said in zero hour before this became obvious this is going to last two or three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical war but they're certainly\nGoing to be huge a political and trade wars and things\nLarry Larry with us we're coming back from final phone calls with

Portland, Oregon welcome to the program Jason go ahead\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the market is the second it has to do with the ... and I happened to it in mid July just before the huge in and out of the world but the average company which happened to be pretty good timing and I could afford polio and acts\nIt just before the huge and in the canopy gross but the beverage company which happened to be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually doubled in value\nFrom about fifty thousand up two hundred thousand portfolio but my question is would you um would this kind of be offered a little bit particularly until the ... election this November because there are several states that are looking you then have it on the ballot\nAnd if they legalize usually when that happens there's a kind of an upswing or would you pull out of that now because of this the danger of ah what you're talking about taking place\nWell you know yeah that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend and even block chain and crypto currency is our but all of these industries above all these these are hot sector like this will get hit strongly\nWhen we have a downturn because first of all everything gets hit but the the strongest sectors get hit the most cars they bubble up the most and people don't understand that same with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most in history has shown that so\nYou do have I mean I I Would say in this case you may want to hold on just to the election and see if there's a pop but yes I Do think\nCenter in such a hot sector take your games see what happens in the next few years especially the next year is going to be critical and then yeah things crash that is a good sector to get back into this\nIs a long term social political trend it's going to go in that direction although there may be some backlash and the downturn just because people get a little more conservative for a while but\nBut you are in a good actor but yes I I don't want to be an actor when when things crash and and and that's what a lot of people and there's a lot of people say well this sector will do All right because\nI went and the great depression than tire thirties and look for one any major sector toilet paper um utilities movies you know boos you know things that people would maybe use more in a downturn and and because of that collapse\nAnd valuations and that fear factor everything went down I couldn't find anything\nAny major stock sector that made money in the Nineteen thirties only the high quality bonds that so yeah take your games\nAgain in your case I might just see these elections pop and then then go the other way or do fifty fifty you know it it's up to you but there is danger there you're right about that\nPeriod when they when the bottom falls out of you know what you want more how do you know when the bomb\nWhat will again I mean we have clear we look at past corrections I mean everything's different this is not like you know the eighty two thousand eight to nine cracked and it's not like the seventies corrections stock corrections back then were fifty percent that's more typical this is more like these great resets\n... de leveraging of a bubble debt and financial assets which of course stock is are the leading ones when that happens Seventy percent is kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed\nEighty nine percent for the Dow eighty nine percent so I'm looking for levels like that I think my range\nIs Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start looking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now is that thirty year treasury bond which is a been a three point four percent recently\nIt that gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent that's when I started by even though that's the best thing in the downturn it's too early to buy that right now you're going to park you might just be unsafe short term bonds and CDs and T bills and stopped to preserve your money next step is\nAnd then and and and these sectors I mean commodities while in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first\nAnd then developed countries stocks and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities so I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like like like like a marijuana and pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a slam\nDunk winter long term [noise] wait for the ... you may get to buy into that a little earlier\nThan something like you know home builders\nNext on that one has to do good Kentucky first time caller for cello Alan\nHey George a lot of the show you Sacramento correct me if I'm wrong here but ranch sites all Republican yeah okay well there's danger Democrat Democrat or\nMake a dent did you not say earner did I miss I understand you've made you said the south was ran during the civil\nWar yes they they would have been they would have been more even though you know they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican Party in\nThe south and help get Nixon elected through southern voters\nAnd that's a whole different party had to convince a lot of democratic politicians and senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so ... the Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read is Republican\nBlue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now if you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor\nThe Democratic party just like it did in the thirties where you had Republicans Hoover coming into that when things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people there that you know the ... they go to the Democrats\nIn a downturn in a bull in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are\nOur long term research shows we are going to switch from Republican era here to a democratic one for a number of decades and that's just something you know the blue people are gonna like that the red people won't but all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPart is and and my work Republicans are always going to be here Democrats it it's a play of opposites that's\nJust as important as men and women and booms and busts and inflation and deflation and every other play of opposite\nAnd it goes back and forth the same thing the west has dominated the world uh since since uh the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century it's gonna be the east and that's another trend we can clearly show to cycle so so what we do\nIs just show people here's the trends this sector that sector inflation deflation\nThis country that country blue red I mean we can do all this stuff in the long term is surprisingly predictable\nAnd that's where Congress get it wrong comments think the short term predictable I'm guessing when I tell you I think this thing's gonna top now or so many months from now on making an educated guess that may make me sixty to Seventy percent right but never a hundred when I tell told people Twenty years ago baby boomers we're going to peak in two thousand seven\nIn the economy was going to slow down

woke up again and this time I was looking down at myself I thought it was a dream Mandy what a ... at that point it's lamb be back into my body\nI woke up was jarred um eleven years old I don't know what the heck happened to me yeah but eventually I got my way into a library you know weeks later\nShe stumbled into the um psyche grown section I guess and found a book on astral projection and sure enough I said that's what happened to me but I've not been able to do it since then at least in my awake\nMoment as well\nIt's completely spontaneous I wasn't trying to do it I didn't know anything about it um I just like you I just find myself voting on the ceiling looking down at my body and then\nBut you know there there are ways to produce and out of body experience has there is a neurologist in Montreal doctor all dependent field was able to his mapping out the different areas of the brain and he if he put on a pickle stimulation on the right tempo core taxi disabled producing out of body experience [noise]\nThat that doesn't tell me the out of body experience originates in the band that tells me that the that are being will protests the out of body experience [noise]\nUm and you know the types of out of out of body experiences we had was quite straightforward um they weren't complicated but some people as you say it can be called astral\nProjection around novel people can leave not just their their body but they can leave the room they can leave their house you know they can actually traveled to different locations\nAbsolutely now do you find that the people who tend to have these kinds of experiences are believers in the paranormal or not\n[noise] I'd say no not not not initially because when this happened to me I certainly wasn't a belief or I didn't even know such a thing as possible and I've just kind of learned about the paranormal as I go along and as I have these experiences\nUm another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen years old and how does the second year medical student I dreamt of us ... exam the night before the exam and when I went to the exam the next day the first question on the exam at the same as the first question in my dream\nYou have the answer that you knew exactly\nSo I felt like that dream helped me past my exam but I didn't tell anyone about it because it seems so unbelievable in fact if someone had told me that story I probably wouldn't have believed that\nThe name of the book is called the borders of normal with some time or a clinical psychiatrist you by the way these stigmatized says paranormal phenomenon tell me about the book\nWell one of the reasons I wrote this book has you know as I say in the subtitle I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena\nBecause what I found and this is my own experience as well when people have these experiences they tend not to talk about them because they think people are gonna think they're weird or their strange for there's something wrong with them or they're losing their mind is something like that [noise]\nThat I'm trying to say that a lot of people have these experiences\nIt's quite normal to have these experiences I mentioned that the word heron or a month for example the ... parent means beside so we have paralegals working beside lawyers have paramedics Paralympics and so on\nSo parent normal means beside normal it doesn't mean abnormal and there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I give a reading or if I give a talk somewhere people come up to me afterwards and share it with new things that have happened to them which they've never told anyone\nSo I'm trying to make it more acceptable for people to talk about these things and that was really what motivated me to read the book\nDid you ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died named Dr shift the cook curricula\nNo I'm not familiar with him [noise] she's or her oh her in the it was my aunt\nShe was she went to a Oxford University and she got her degree in psychiatry yes and specialized no kinds of things and then decided she was given all that up to study telepathy and that's all she did she wrote a couple of books was called breakthrough decrease\nShe was convinced totally convinced that the ... the was the real deal and the and again the psychiatrist seen that and so you're the only only other psychiatrist I Know that has really jumped into this\n[noise] although I'd like to look for that ... that sounds very interesting on\nBreaks through to creativity I'm\nDefinitely gonna look for it but you know they're being on books written by physicians about near death experiences for example even Alexander cruises have and yeah and his nearest surgeon\nAnd marry the Neal she loved to have an end back she's in our therapeutic surgeon and of course Oliver Sacks is and they're all just he wrote a book called hallucinations so physicians have written about these things but I haven't found another ... who's written about paranormal\nYeah you're going to enjoy that so I mean she she just the the the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away and a very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in a radio\nFell in their home no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show no you that's terrible it was just a a um how did you get interested in the last thing\nShe just always wires and there were so many things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to this and she's going to study it and she she went into it and the big white\n[noise] well that's good well I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my ... medical center in New York\nWhere they were studying dream telepathy\nThe ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had Sanders and receivers and the receiver it's we're in a sleep lab\nAnd they were hooked up to an EEG to um the AG could measure what we call Graham sleep rapid eye movement and then once the ... gene state the Centers for giving random images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on those images and try to send them to be the face and they found that people were more susceptible to ... to ... the when they're asleep\nAnd it's also true that people are more susceptible to telepathy when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the ... more Dr mini majors with us his book the borders of normal [noise]\nGo students ... new version of the coast to coast am apple is now available for I don't know I enjoyed for not only listen live on demand anywhere anytime\n[noise]\nAnd walking back with Dr many major U.S we're talking about his work the borders of normal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize is paranormal phenomenon many let's talk a little bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that though you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned over this throwing ... you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice with dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them\nAnd they called they didn't call them visions they call them visitors and as they got closer to death is visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting [noise]\n[noise] so yeah I think those those deathbed visions of very common and I was one interesting thing about death that visions is that sometimes\nThere are shared by people at the bedside there was one case of a woman in India who is dying and she says someone a deceased relative who came to take her to the other side and every three sisters who are at the bedside also saw the same person\nAnd that's the that's an unusual though isn't it it's it's unusual but there's been several cases like that or even in some cases where the medical personnel at the bedside saw the same vision that the dying\nPatients saw [noise] and that's interesting because\nYou know people who have death that vision the skeptics would say well that's because they're on medication or because they're confused or because they have a shortage of oxygen is the lack of oxygen to the brain they tried to get some kind of physical explanation for it\nBut at the visions are shared than those explanations wouldn't be valid because the people at the bedside wouldn't have a shortage of auction to their brains\nAnd they weren't on medication so [noise]\nUm it's hard to know how to explain that and there again the people who have these visions aren't necessarily believers in the afterlife\nIt's hard to know how to explain that and there again the people who have these visions aren't necessarily believers in the afterlife but these experiences are quite common\nWednesday when Steve Jobs from apple computer died many you know he was quoted as saying\nOh wow oh wow right now\nWhat do you think he he was making reference to\n[noise] well I Know some people who are dying tell their relatives they see a beautiful landscape a beautiful vision you know I'm a bright white light you know a spiritual beings you know I'm a feeling of unconditional love\nYou know these are some of the things that I imagine that Steve Jobs was experiencing\nYeah that could be that could be no skeptics course say what the you mentioned that you know it's the body itself is doing all these weird things near the ...\nHow can we argue against that\nWell there was one study of um cardiac patients who had been assassinated after cardiac arrest\nAnd this study was done by a cardiologist and he said of of the the patients who who died in ... Eighteen percent of them had a new report it in near death experience but it's that experience is due to lack of oxygen to the brain than they would have all had it because they all had a lack of oxygen the brain\nNot just as a small percentage [noise]\nSo you know that's one thing but then the other thing is that um these experiences are reported around the world not just in the U.S there's a lot of cross cultural studies that show that these experiences are in many different countries and they'd be being reported throughout time\nAnd one study looked at patients who are on medication versus patients who weren't on medication and the patients who weren't on medication who weren't confused and who didn't have a shortage boxed into the brain had the same experiences and were able to report them just as often as the other patients so [noise]\nUm people are skeptical I think for a good reason and I think it's good to be skeptical but it's also good to keep an open mind\nWell that's that's true in ... you you've talked about under deathbed the visions that they sometimes see a little bit more than just a family member they see other kinds of visitors as well explain that\n[noise] well the other visitors aside from family members they could be someone that they were very close to or sometimes they report angels coming to the others I'm coming to take them to the other side\nUm especially with children and there was a pediatrician mouth and Martha Stewart is dying children and he said the dying children didn't report\nDeceased relatives because their parents and their relatives and friends are all still living\nBut they've reported the angels that we're having to take them to the other side\nI had an experience at my father's funeral where I thought to angel is one of the other side of the costs and did anybody else you know so I could say I know they were a product of my own brain no one I saw them but in my own mind I saw those\nAngels and they were just as clear as day standing right in front of me and I had the idea that thought came into my mind that they were called minutes during angels and they had the idea that they were minister and my father to help them make the transition it's the next level of the next world\nAnd they made the most beautiful creatures and I didn't know what to make that but that's really when I decided I Need to start telling people about what's going on because that\nWas too much for me to keep the mice\nDo they see you\nI don't think so okay I don't think they were there for me I think they were there for my father\nRight so they didn't acknowledge you know you know you saw them\n... that's right [noise] now the other thing is when you say in terms of deathbed visions [noise]\nYou know um if they were produced by certain chemicals them I was the um visitors only ... the people who are deceased why wouldn't they be other people as well\nThe other thing is sometimes these visions of these people they're the person is dying doesn't know there may be a a brother or sister who had died there's a case where there was a car crash and ... all one brother died and the other brother was near death\nSo the the brother that was near death had a vision of his dad brother but he hasn't been told that his brother had died in the same accident he didn't know that there was the end\nAnd the rather cases like that to where the the deathbed visitors the person who is dying didn't know that that person was actually dead but because of the family wanted to spare them the knowledge\nPre ... do the dreams you lose your thoughts on what they are\nWell there again I've had the cognitive dreams I mentioned one above the memory powerful\nAbove yeah exactly they're very powerful and the question is how do we know of a dream is a pre cognitive dream or if it's an anxiety dream because often and you know when people are sleeping during the dreams they tried to protests things that happened during the day or things that they're worried about\n\nSo you know for example I talk about Abraham Lincoln\nTwo weeks before he was assassinated he he had a dream that he was murdered now we could say that that was the peak cognitive dream that we could also say that could have been an anxiety dream maybe he was worried that someone was going to kill him\n[noise] maybe I think you also had a dream where he was in the White House and he walked up to ... you saw your ... by ... and it was him in the casket\nI heard that too yeah yeah [noise] so that could have been a ... another famous person who reported a pretty cognitive dream of Charles Dickens\nReally I didn't hear that\nYeah 'cause when he would put a new book you travel around the small towns and villages and he'd give readings and so on so one night before he was to give a reading into a new town where he'd never been before he had a dream that\nIn a group of people came up to them after his reading and a young woman in red shah introduced himself to her with four words she said I Am ... Napier so when he woke up he thought that was very strange she didn't know anyone by that name but he remarked that the dream was very vivid\nAnd free cognitive dreams tend to be very vivid\nI'm often when we wake up in the morning or dream start to fade the pre cognitive dreams stay with us and we remember every detail so the next day he went to give us reading and sure enough after the meeting a group of people came up to him and there was a young woman wearing a red Shaw and she was introduced to him as ... here [noise]\nSo so this stream was a pretty cognitive dream and he didn't know what to think of it or or how to explain it but he he reported he had that the cognitive dream [noise]\nSo um it's some people take sample Larry ... is a person has written about the ... century cognitive beans and he's written a boat when should we pay attention to a dream how do we know if it's peak cognitive femur not\nAnd he said we should pay attention to dreams first of all the dream as we current or if it's especially vivid or if it involves death\nI heard of a case recently where um\nTold her husband ... that she dreamt that she and her children died in a terrorist attack\nIt's just in this country and it's become patently obvious to everybody and it's very simple if you are a Democrat and you've engaged in any kind of questionable illegal activity you get a pass if you're a

be and I was driving in the car and having lunch and she and we just talk and we just communicated\nHit it off huh\nWe just hit it off and when the night that she died I was sitting on the couch with

just\nThat was the first time\nI've ever had anything like that ever happened to me um I don't know if anyone else has ever had that kind of I mean it sounds like what you're talking about two and then for my son died I had the same thing I had the vision of ... a dream for like two weeks\nAnd just couldn't sleep an uneasy feeling in two cops coming to his dad's door so horrible\nAnd I didn't know what to think of it and it was just I've never had anything else like that happen [noise] um [noise] so um I I'm familiar you know I'm I've heard you know I just I don't know like\nI it only happens in hook people to me when\nIf they're going to die I kinda know I you know I kinda know things like\nDo you do you tell them\n[noise] [noise] well um no I Know I don't know who's going to die I just get\nReally ... somebody's gonna die\nI just it um I get very I start crying crying you know I I get very emotional and very sensitive and just crying and upset but not sure why\nMany what causes of fish don't want to say I'm Sorry to hear about your son and I was wondering um if you've had any post death contact with him\nNow anyway how they do I do not have any contact with him since he died now I have not and several people my daughters and several other friend path but no I have not in that very travelling\n[noise] okay well in terms of your question [noise] uh George what causes that well I guess I Would call that a free cognitive dream or premonition [noise] you know and I think it's related to that well on a theoretical level you could say on one level we're all connected\nAnd somehow we're able to communicate with each other in a way that we're not really aware of you know I'm I think that especially someone very close like a family member especially you know a child or a sibling or parent or a spouse\nIf you want to communicate with the deceased loved one is it easier to be a little more aggressive to try to communicate with them or do you laid back and let them try to come to you\nI Would say the the ladder I Would let them come to you you know because they may not be ready\nYou have to give them any signs that you're already\nWell you have to I think you have to say that you're open to the experience of that you would love to hear from them and then the ball is in their course\nLet's go to Virginia Keats with us welcome to the program Keith\nHi George how are you hey there good good can you hear me okay yeah pretty good\nOkay great I'm going to lead to a couple of things one last night with your guest that called in but are too late to get on and it there are some commonality and some of the topics tonight about\nUm the paranormal and\nA something that I consider to be quite a link between paranormal\n... and\nAh you know something I consider to be quite a link between paranormal and be a Judeo Christian teachings of the\nBible a missing link couldn't be\nA the content of a book called eternal man and anybody can do about or search it on YouTube or Amazon you can find different lectures and things about that and over the years time\nIt is a book written by a BYU religion of ... how often the professor and over the years I'm just listening to coast to coast it's just been quite remarkable that\nThere there is so much of the paranormal or that ... that can be clarified and expanded upon perhaps against some understanding about this of of the journal nature and our spiritual nature as well and\nUm to switch to another topic really quick [noise] um [noise] uh years ago I had a dream and it could've been induced by\nA listener on the coast to coast a lot about you ever go to experience I've had two friends who passed away only about I think Thirteen Days apart from each other and about twenty five days after the second one\nI had a dream it was very vivid now this dream is from about\nThirteen Years ago I think\nAnd uh I can still remember it today um I don't remember what happened before the than some of the dream and I don't remember what happened after the events of the jury in my dream but the but it was a very vivid and I want you to hold that\nThought and and retain that taught in your consideration\nAbout the possibility of\nA the certainty of Dr Christine Blasey Ford about the events that she said happened to her\nBut yet all the people that she mentioned not a single one of them knew anything about fat and a dream that I had was that um that was my my brother's apartment\nWhere the second friend had little he passed away playing basketball one night with my brother and and um he at the end of 'em this time the dream\nHe says to my brother and me I'll see you later and he looks at me and he says and I'll see you and Thirteen months and I knew he was dead wrong him as\nA a pretty young lady that was wearing a quote a charcoal grey quote I'm cutting coke or standing next to him I didn't know who that was had\nSeen her before I mean this is in a in a dream yeah so it was all a dream and uh and I thought you know and and every you know the people that I knew the dream or\nLike when the Elvis and and the apartment was completely laid out I couldn't tell you exactly the spot where once everything about it\nAnd um and so uh and I I actually did kind of take action I got life insurance and I figured there is a fifty fifty chance this can happen\nAnd it was the uh Thirteen months approached it was a well it didn't happen you know he didn't play in twelve months when he didn't say and fourteen months so\nThat was good window that I was kind of paying attention and or in past it I'm Still here today\nI'm Glad he was wrong\nI bet you are to\nGo students under the new version of the ...

there are some part of it are just overwhelmed you that you did not expect that you came across when you were researching it and put it together\nAnd I think the most interesting thing was the deathbed vision\nYou know because I think that thing that I didn't realize how common that was [noise] you know we've we've certainly heard a lot of a near death experience and visions and out of body experience is associated with near death experience but I wasn't really ... with a deathbed visions or the visions of deceased loved ones that are also very common\nThe death bed visions do you think it's the body's way of making death a little more comfortable for people or is it something other strictly outside of the physical brain\nI think it's both I think it's a combination because I like to look at it from the point of view of the body plus the mind of the most of my life plus the spiritual life so I think that for different components in each one is important\nWhat has been for you the most dramatic case you've come across\n... that's a good question because there's so many of them I mean there's there's cases have for example people who've had the cognitive dreams that have helped him win lotteries\nWow you know I'm I don't have those kind of dreams\nNo me neither but that ... been verified\n[noise] you know I wanted to say one comment about your previous caller sure when he was talking about the connection between paranormal experience and the Judeo Christian tradition Mm mhm\n[noise] if you look at the Bible they certainly lots of biblical profits like Daniel and then the keel or if example Joseph you know who had the cognitive dreams are prophetic beams you might say and even in the history of the church people like St Francis if uh the the Joan of arc they heard voices\nYou know when when John was Thirteen Years old she said she saw lining light light and she heard a voice which he identified as the art came to my call coming from her father's garden\nSo these experiences have been documented by many people throughout the Bible and throughout the history of the church so I think there is a connection\nYeah they're most definitely is just remarkable how this works Manny ... it's it's you know let's call it the God factor or whatever it might be but it's out there it's real yeah the big question is why should they were the first place what do you think\n[noise] that for the first thing that came to mind is that how to make our lives more meaningful\nIt gets that the different level or a different dimension to our lives and that somehow if that's something to feel like what we're going to even if it's a painful experience can have some meaning it can have some value\nAbsolutely okay let's take some phone calls here for you we will be

dream where it started off given the ... the day which was the same state\n... in real life so my question would be with your dream about the test\nThe next day which was you know you had the first question it's it's almost like the dream was a personal coach for you [noise]\nAh so I ask you about that you know what you think and the case that trains are going to a really acting in your favor number one and then\nIf the dream is not quite calling and what and you're thinking\nThat the aspects that are still really current and have card applications that you could cherry pick and how would you do that well first\nOf all your first question how do you know if the demons acting in your favor well I'd say is is the content of the dream a warning you know is it something that can be helpful for you and your daily life is telling you about something that's coming up for you and your life or is it about another person so\nI'd say it's acting in your favor first of all if it's about you not about another person\nAnd if it's and the action is beneficial now in terms of Kenya cherry pick I Would say yes because it can be some super fluid sort of extraneous materials industry and that's not necessarily related to the main point and sixteen [noise]\nSo I think to a certain extent you have to take out those parts of the dream which you feel applied to you in which can be helpful for you

things okay but if you say I have a conspiracy I have\nI have put together the names\nAnd I put together the ideas I began to the ideology behind the conspiracy\nAnd\nIt's amazing way of looking at how we are headed ... and which direction we'll head out our current trajectory our nation's\nDynamic is going away completely and I think people know that the dynamic of what America is and what it's supposed to be has gone away\nOkay two nights ago I called my show new justice no peace and attempted to point out the traditional\nWay we think of civil war in this country is crowding the fact that we're already in one and ... and well no one will ... tribute school shootings that beats the gate shootings Las Vegas attacks the symptoms of a civil war and progress our leaders both left and right our acknowledging now that violence\nWill be an inevitability in this country after the November midterm elections or this isn't me you know joining up the the emotion\nOkay 'cause I was putting so I put something up on my Facebook page oh yeah I put up with the Hillary Clinton said it it it is no there no more time to be civil I put that up on my on my side because that is that prompted a New York post to put up civil war on their headline\nSo yesterday the headline on the other your post civil war and I talked about civil war the night before the post posted their civil war headline so and and they were pointing to what Hillary Clinton said the Christian on the poor CNN when she was interviewing her and she said something to the fact that um\nYou know we don't have to be civil to a government that doesn't respect us\nOkay\nBut the Trump of course President Trump warned that there will be violence\nIf the Republican Party loses the November's midterm elections you've stated that the rights of Americans were under threat from quote violent people end quote now of course this type of rhetoric is expected because the media paint him as a leader who advocates violence I'm not saying this was an excuse and I wish I didn't have to practice\nThe new foot noting in order to make a point but this is what we have been forced to do you see the arguments are such that they cut deep both ways the media pays the president's threatened violence as wishful thinking on the president's part is if they know as a fact\nBut this is what he wants it and they will magnified in order to make him the poster child for his dream right wing views however the extremism became even more intense\nAfter CNN's Christie on on the porch sat down\nFor an interview with Hillary Clinton\nClinton told everyone watching that the time of civility is over she says you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for and what you care about it\nShe said that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the White House and or the Senate that's when civility can start again so there you have it a declaration of civil war in a license for violence\nSee the motives of course he's getting what you want to by any means necessary not the vote matters just how much trouble intimidation and ... and or instability you could create the change the direction of the votes so Donald Trump says there will be by there will be violence if the Republicans lose Hillary Clinton says no civility until we win\nNow that doesn't sound like called the war I don't know what does\nOkay and and I mean\nThe New York post agreed with me yesterday and what is most disconcerting is while the media will say that Trump's words are to be expected they failed to expound upon the comment that Hillary Clinton made no one's not even an interviewer stopped and asked her\nIf she was saying could be considered reckless or feeling the fire there was already started consequences be damned a civil war has to happen in order to take over the Senate that's what\nThat's what I got from both of them\nFrom says violence if we lose Hillary Clinton says violence until we win\nNow what should we do what should we do how are we supposed to vote either way we're screwed right he this is a quagmire\nThis this this is a quagmire this we are we have two leaders okay\nAnd and the other is a leader I don't care what you say she's the leader of a group of people ... she's the leader of the resistance OK she says we will not be civil until we when Trump says if you when they are they the Republicans won't be so\n... we're at war with ourselves\nAnd the mob\nNamely those who have been attacking\nPoliticians namely those who've been in you know creating the road road blocks okay or those who have been pounding on the doors of Congress during the cabin on hearing all of this mob mentality is is right now being contained\nBut one day it won't be contained okay and one day the mob will rule if the mob isn't ruling out are already you have two people should know better because what they're doing now is they're meddling in our own\nElections business meddling OK Hillary Clinton is meddling Donald Trump is meddling they're both meddling [noise] and they're giving threats of violence if it doesn't go their way [noise]\nThis is what is terrifying okay this is why I say civil war [noise]\nAnd then what you get is Hillary's response to listen to this\nKenny on Conway the presidential advisor talked about this process and she said it ... left wing conspiracy it echoes what you said about when your husband was being that she ended by investigations back in the nineties a vast white right wing conspiracy\nFirst of all your comment on that mirror language and secondly these anyway even a conservative think who I was speaking of yesterday said the only way to repair America should try to get back to some divinity and to try to make it even if we have political disagreements we're not going to war with each other without trying to destroy each other\nWell certainly I Would love to see us return to civility listening to one another I'm working out our differences that are not the Republican Party that exist today and that is certainly not the administration that we have in power right now [noise]\nWhen the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland\nA heard I think anything that they stole a justice from the ... I think they did I mean to keep a Supreme Court said open for a year\nSame question jurists they could have voted down they could have said well for ideological reasons philosophical reasons that we're not going to vote for him but no they selling wall and that was such a breach as\nAn actor and the constitutional responsibility of\nA Senate to advise on can count on Mount a nation that you cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nHouse formed or the horrible that Clinton that lady can start again [noise]\nThat sort of civility can start again is when we get the Senate\nOtherwise the time for civility is over but did you notice how a Christian of CNN Christian ... said\nUh on the porch said that ah she's noticed the mirroring of of what's being said here this is a left wing conspiracy as opposed to what Hillary said about a vast right wing conspiracy\nSo okay so let's just eliminate for the moment the idea of a theory roads Hillary's theory or whether it's Kellyanne Conway theory he isn't mirroring of time and it is a conspiracy but\nWho is behind the conspiracy who is joining up the emotion in Syria\nTo put us into this moment in time where extremism is even more intense\nWhere we have to gin up the extremism and get everybody angry to everybody you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy you stand for what you care about\nThat's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again\n\n[noise] see I see that as a declaration of civil war it's a license for violence\nAnd the motive of course is getting what you want by any means necessary and that is what it is you know consequences be damned you know this is what we want to this is what we need this is what we get\nAnd it has to happen in order for us to take over the Senate\nSo her claim that civility can return when the Democrats have power is the mission that something is up if Donald Trump is saying well if we do when there will be violence than he knows just exactly what happens\nWhen of course the mainstream media will continue to expose or at least exploit\nOr Donald Trump is saying because they want that to be used against them if and when violence breaks out at the election and we've been talking about the final blow for some time and\nMaybe this is it maybe we're waiting for that happening in November maybe we're having\nLater on but the response is what shows me the response to way Hillary Clinton had to say I mean the New York post headline yesterday declared civil war and published a number of articles pointing out the silliness of the country and civil war over the president\nIs they hate and a woman that resent the fact that she lost to a gym said running for the presidency\nAnd all the resentment of those who oppose her\nNow if you're one of the unfortunate wants to go to Facebook and vent your spleen on the matter you were either shadow band\nOr you were one of the unlucky ones hit with an algorithm stick\nTonight I'm being gym so you know those are you there listening and you're hearing the jamming\nI Know when I'm getting I mean Facebook said that today\nIn the jamming I Know when I'm getting I mean Facebook sad that today vapors over eight hundred US publishers and accounts for\nWhat they say was flooding users what politically oriented content that violated the company's spam policies\n\nNow the timing couldn't have been more obvious in my opinion and there certainly was an OB swell up criticism against Hillary Clinton Facebook of course and I think that they utilize their thought bullies or the thought police algorithms to remove any and all speech that would create any bad press for the former secretary of state\nFacebook said it was removing the publishers and accounts not because of the type of content they posted\n\nBut because of the behaviors they engaged in including spanning Facebook groups with identical pieces of content and using fake profiles not that not only did they remove sites that we're focusing on the comments of Clinton\nBut they didn't so before the midterm elections\nOne of the pages nation and distress pitched itself as the first online publication to endorse president Donald Trump founded in twenty twelve and a mask more than three point two million lives in over three million followers according to a Washington Post review on Thursday\nAnd reason and posting photos\nAnd to criticize journalists for failing to report on Trump's approach to China and sharing a link to to a story that are called\nRepresentative ah Maxine Waters demented the page affiliated itself with a website called America's freedom fighters which appeared to post its own content and duplicate press releases ran by others about violent crime and gun rights all alongside a sidebar of ads\n\nSo that was the response at least from what I can gather that Facebook decided they want to remove the eight hundred pages there was another um\nAnother page called ... press had more than seven hundred thousand and followers and posted ... Trump referred to the Republicans as cheating scum bags\n\nIt said reasonable reasonable people unite was at that that was another one left leaning page that Facebook purged posted a screen shot from Twitter user who sent somewhere in America\nA teenage girl is listening to her parents defend Brent Kavanaugh that she's thinking to yourself if something like that happens to me I have nowhere to

off a ... area of hail joy of a lot\nOf anti ... fantastic though there were a lot of areas or we had a list of areas where we were being jammed a few of our affiliates were being champ for some reason so we don't know why but I think we're back to normal now\nSo it's good to hear [noise] I'm just I just want to\nKind of wonder why is it that will have to be political parties or some place where I don't agree that the ... the the party or ... or ... or for the people at a constitutional uh\nWell it was supposed to be that way I mean political parties were just affiliations they they they weren't supposed to become a way of life for some sort of cult like following which we've developed here in this country now and as I said before the reasons why we're doing this now is because the media is encouraged it\nA fairness doctrine a has been removed so therefore uh this type of being can continue or there's no even killed reporting of of either side so both sides have the ability to to skew or or at least a you know changes story or put finishing touches or exclude parts of a story\nTo fit their ah I guess you could call their ideological criteria\nSo if you lean conservative you'll hear stories but you'll go wow that's surprising they're saying this about this but you'll never hear I have never heard a show or or any anything for that matter where conservatives are featured where they actually say something surprising\nA I've never heard a show or liberals are featured where they don't really say something surprising meaning that they they find themselves leaning towards a certain type of topic they would usually be considered conservative or conservative leaning towards a topic that they would certainly see as liberal I've never seen that before everything is so ... yeah everything is so rigid minded and so it's so myopic\nThat we can see what other people are feeling we just have our biases in our biases are enough to get it through the day\nHere a couple of weeks back get a caller CFOs you of the older older lady ah she thought that you might also talk about\nAll of matter what you say I'm a I'm a little a little this low level that know that you're trying to explain yourself all she does want to hear that all day\nBecause I said I said that what what my statement was\nI said that I think the President Trump will be the first oh actually the first and last president\nTo stand up for us to stand up to the un like he did and she didn't like that or she didn't like me saying that he would be the last president because he's well there'll be presidents after President Trump I said well yes of course there will be but they're not going to be as bold as to stand up to the un I don't think\nThat's right [noise] well that that club all heading or just\nIgnorance really um I guess it goes across all age groups but\nI just ... or a hospital or the way to keep all over the all of the strongest power of this country could ever see is is that people well lighted together I\nWill say that I've always I've always believed trends that there is power in dialogue and I think that dialogue should be allowed and and uh it should be allowed without insults without cut downs and without a you know that was biased to the point where there's no argument to be had\nPeople now spent their opinions as if they are a fact\nThat is that it's something that we picked up on over the last few years that just because you have an opinion on something doesn't make it real we've always heard the statement speak your truth well that means your truth is exclusive truth no truth is truth at least it used to be but now speaking your truth is exclusive truth to you\nNot the real truth that this is you off when you hear it because no one wants to hear the ugly truth they just want to hear truth that makes them feel good and the truth is that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump recently said\nThat there would be violence Trump's that there'd be violence if the Republicans did not win the Senate\nAnd Hillary Clinton says there will be continued instability unless they do win so unless the the uh the Democrats do win so both of them it's kind of said that well we know what everybody is going to do and and and they're not saying don't do that they're not saying don't they're just say this is going to happen it's like it's inevitable witty and that's the thing that bothers me about this\nYeah if I have no choice they're like yeah that that's going to happen regardless whether you are a lot\nWell and we're already seeing we're already seeing the the the uh the aftermath of this I mean the the the left wing media saying if you ever been to a Trump rally it's a mob and then I say well if you ever see what happened during the cabinet hearing it was a mob\nAnd uh they're all saying it's not a mob anti thoughts about a mob you know what are you saying there protesting there protesting peacefully\nPounding on the doors and screaming and yelling and ended up costing people in the blocking traffic and then telling some white guy in a car that he's white by a white guy I mean it's just the insanity it doesn't make any sense\n[laughter] instead of butter Clyde or just keep on keep on doing what you do it all and I'll I'll be let's say\nI appreciate that thank you so much um I I got this from surely I call my biases my values I'm biased on my morals\nAnd values and there's no compromise no biases are not morals [noise] they're just not I disagree biases are not morals biases\nYou can have biases that are based on nonsense that doesn't make them ride nor does it make some moral morality is when you do good to others morality is when you do good to yourself morality is when you love God morality is when you continue to spread hope\nAnd and you and you were a person who believes in being up right in straight [noise]\nHarry to acquire a um [noise] I read about this algorithm all day that Google has and it's a it's a a\n... for the military and they you get your code what job you have in the military and that and then the military has Google find your job or\nThe or the spirit was talking about today I go you know I recall it you're saying but if somebody is one of them Alex Jones or client list is talking about this Google slack identical as I said yes you call just so it's\nKind of strange thing is\nThe algorithm or what\nWhat what I think about it is that girls gather information all the time but not really for our good\nBut if there's if the Chinese have a you know the inside scoop on Google\nIt would be really easy for them to figure out what our forces are because I work in construction and so they are up is brought in here I talked to these we sell to all these military people up here then I talked to him all the time of our searches for a job you know see what they're going to do after they're out\nBut they're searching while they're actually in the military and that would be just really easy for somebody to say I want to know where all their forces are as they're going out reserve\nThey just really easy for somebody to say I want to know where all their forces are as they are going out as a reserve it kind of tells you that your guy goes in there and fill out there\nWhen they would have that anyway Robert even have that any way with hacking and backdoor a Trojan horses they'd be able to do that with a you know certain types of malware a\nBright ... if they're exactly they could get into Google at any time but all the information that's just come up lately here this new algorithms to do this military placing sure though and when they apply for it I'm sure they give them all around for medicine you know Sam what all that stuff they're looking for\nBut it's like if you are if you were in now and you had military clashes and say you come out here reservists they could actually place you into this and\nWhere they could literally put you\nTo anybody and they want it to literally bringing them for ... years without even knowing that you know\nRobert hold on one moment Ron again can hear me are they asking to evacuate the building oh [laughter] oh okay\nAll right I just turned an alarm go off and I heard was evacuated the building [noise] I'm not kidding and Enron article your Enron found the test to assist the test they have good because\nI just turned ... evacuate the building and I'm like whoa what's going on okay so they're doing a test in my building to evacuate I don't know why they were doing that I don't know I just wanted to know did they want us to move back he's one time I'll tell you the truth Robert\nI was in the building that was on fire and I did my show ... because I didn't hear the evacuation notice we I'd be very yeah they basically one of the dumpsters downstairs in the in the uh\nIn the in the area where they are called the vehicles were on fire and that was in a concrete area but there was burning and smoke and I noticed there was smoking there does again hold on\nHold on wait a minute\nOkay that was because they are they doing it no okay gosh freaked me out here okay I hear the tone and then all of a sudden they your evacuate the building of acting so they're doing the accusation drill here where we are\nOne of those spirit things Mac\nHe does this crazy Robert thank you so much for your call ... backed by by\nIs there anything else that can happen tonight that would really you know scare the hell outta me I mean first of all we hear the evacuation were glittering all over the country would a gym there jamming\nAnd this is it okay good I'm just hoping that it's this feels like a really bad dream it really does okay let's go to Chris in California Hi Chris you're on ground zero\n[laughter] hey ticket brass quiet [laughter] [laughter] I'm pretty sure I'll tell you I've\nBeen listening for for ... I'll tell you there's some of the patterns that I noticed is going on like window soon as all the tech stuff started going all crazy and censoring and stuff and it's been mostly censoring this conservative side and all of a sudden\nI started to notice because I got a I've recently gotten into the stock market\nI've noticed that a lot of the big tax now have been getting hit with like these penalties in science and like like when ... lost like Nineteen billion in one day\nSo I think it's kind of a you know you have like\n... the social media side is mainly being pushed by the liberal side where are you know big business has always been associated with the Republican side you know conservative side so I got a feeling that what's going on especially today\nBecause I mean you had you know ... off of violence on the right call for violence on the left and now all of a sudden boom you know they drop down everything you know all of the big tech giants they lost ... billion\nAnd boom\nYou know they drop down everything you know all of the big tech giants they lost billions today and the stock market but everything else is funny all like all the construction industry and and uh you know all those areas other uh other\nUh stock stock portfolio and stuff like that the only thing that really hit super hard\nWas all the giant techs so it could be\nWell Bush is the reason why there's terror raw or they know they know that the technological platforms in this country are shaping culture you know the algorithms are shaping culture and I played some things last night about algorithms I think that maybe we should rethink\nAbout how a computer tells us and shows and things because in reality it it's really screwing up how we think\nAnd I find it interesting though that after what Trump said in what Hillary Clinton said about civility and about violence that Facebook's response was okay we're going to remove both conservative and liberal sites that are extreme so removing a hundred of those\nAnd then add than a memo comes out of Google thing oh and by the way we're now only going to a look at the tone of what is being now\nHow are they going to look at every site and say we're going to look at the tone know what the good news you can put parameters in their in their ... their group of parameters and their algorithms to figure out the type of words that are being used in a website to determine whether or not it's racist or hateful uh and and that's how they're going to\nDo it [laughter] it's it's actually funny 'cause I literally just got off a three day a Facebook jail time\nFor uh making making a joke about a somebody brought up something about like um it was something about a Black Sea Ford and ah you know oh and it was I was like no I'm not saying that this that all women live this woman's alive and basically my joke\nBack was well you know what people say Lizzie Borden killed or Paris does that mean that all women are serial killers and then boom I literally the algorithms pick me up and gave me a free day jail sentence right\nWow see that's the [laughter] ... yeah and and I know is if you read it it's ... I mean come on let's say I was totally a satirical joke\nWell invite the thing the bill the algorithms reading what you're writing and they say well and and they'll always uh there's something else to it ah I've been called on to buy a Google and that is that a Google a basically a team after me once for doing something called scraping\nAnd so what that ... well I I Do know through my show okay I write notes through my show and I was ... on my on my regular website\nWell what I also do is I go back to a lot of old articles like articles that are like maybe twenty or Thirty years old and I've written Twenty years old actually and I've written them and I go back and see if I can find something and I I I wrote something about it a long time ago so I go back and find the information I wrote about a long time ago I put it in the article for my notes and it was actually\nA ... I'm I'm Sorry 'cause there was actually an author that got picked up by I think it was like the FBI started investigating him because he was a writer and he was doing a a a a novel about cereal a serious some serial\nKiller novel and go pick them up because he was like literally searching serial killers mhm [laughter]\nWell ... that's ... ... it's a ... it's a it's an algorithms doing that so you got to be careful about how you form your sentences you got to say exactly no you can't say anything that would even that appear to be or even misconstrued and being in\nThe ministry of truth to it as the ministry of truth I think that's the way it's just totally administered shit there is so sad\nAnd it's exactly what it is yeah it's been ministry of truth and that's and that's why you know when you talk about this you know people who will go oh you know it and they basically have the\nFor what it is yeah it's the ministry of truth and that's and that's why you know when you talk about this you know people will go you know it and they basically have their politics in their biases and use they look\nBeings are sad and then actions are done and what actions are done we try to figure out why the actions you've done it they're done because I have a feeling that both Facebook and Google realized that what they're doing is they're creating an atmosphere for civil war\nAnd we'll let me let me hear our leaders leaders saying things like well there will be violence\nOr if uh you know we don't win and other ones as well we're going to continue to be ah not visible in Philly when\nMrs ... motion and that's why they're trying to do it they're just trying to\nWe're real close as I hear the music project do you think Trump and Hillary actually working together in order for us to make the civil war happened and then bam all of a sudden we have the whole global is get the martial law they looked at with no idea [noise]\nI don't think that's a that's a good conspiracy theory but I have no idea [noise]\nHave agreed that collide thank you thank you [noise]\nSo many Daniels said though that when we're together [noise] arguably or allegedly together that he was talking to her about a plan [noise]", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "12"}
