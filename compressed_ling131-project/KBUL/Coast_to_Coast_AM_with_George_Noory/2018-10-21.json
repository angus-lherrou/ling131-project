welcome to coast to coast am I'm Richard Sayre and tonight the ...\nShould I say earlier this morning and during the open line segment a number of callers shared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife [noise]\nTonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time an alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist\nHarry Houdini Houdini and his wife best were fears the bunkers of psyche ability mediums and the spiritual his movement in fact Houdini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and there are fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween\nFour days after receiving for unexpected punches to his abdomen\nBy McGill University student backstage at the princes theater in Montreal Canadian connection there on his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wide best he would do so\nThen more than two years after his death\nHis wife best attended the sands\nConducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which for allegedly channel the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to\nBy Harry invest initially best stated publicly and assigned in witness testimony that she believed Terry Haddon fact\nCommunicated to her from the grave\nLater however she recanted and stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the say odds despite this best continue to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nDuring all that time she said she received no communication from Harry finally after the last say also in October thirty first Nineteen thirty six best gave up saying ten years is long enough to wait for any mad\nA ... was a prominent spiritual and so how did that how did that friendship survive and the fact that Harry was such an and vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fighting in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pads and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nAfter a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for\nHarry where she claimed that he brought she bought through Harry's mother and Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing\nI'm Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI was he sort of outed her in public didn't need any out her ...\nYeah yes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow no part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience is how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photo psychic act or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coated method\nThat that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody method um\nI think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of ten words and the tenth word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through can\nAnd number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when\nAnd so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry invest first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket political point oh what is the last two digits on the coin and they these were rich\nAnd play answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly Harry I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural miss to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins and mess held in her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight and because she would say she's communicating you invariably using these code words and she said quickly\nQuickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eights were in in the secret code emitted so so that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right makes ties right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passed number can but the way of doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now tell please be quickly look be quick\nAnd as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical dot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry Hi and\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this call because after the message was delivered to bath and she said that it works somebody\nQuickly said hey this was all in a book is all already published in a book this is no big deal well I thought and I read this on line a number of times someone would say within the book but they wouldn't\nSay the name of the book out of the people were saying it's on page da da da da di ... said ... and then I\nFinally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all of twenty five cents\nThey would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I scan the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just all of that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book\nAnd so that book does talk about those ten words and how it's used to form numbers but not how to form or\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd um let's see I hear a bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coded word Roosevelt that the secret message with in code word to leave\nKen word message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book this is important to ask who this is he also is a famous magician and he's a close personal friend of Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book\nEveryone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why was important for you to point out that this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini\nA and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because now we get into the sale and and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly he told them that I'm a skeptic I I I'm going to bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try and then\nShe has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he how did for get in touch with best\nWell I'll put an ad in just a minute but I just want to point out that I think that this worked\nBecause bath and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and all of a a little bit we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nUm Ford was reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of his clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in his on putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that's gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have and she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother\nTo show him that his mother's soul or spirit was surviving gap and so is this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither best Houdini nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford\nWas well aware of who d'nese reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDidn't tell us I got a jump in here forgive me Thomas I got a jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking us into the break with do me on coast to coast them [noise]\nDon't let your dog itch scratch stink or said like crazy come to China for help\nEight five night for two weeks one thousand eight five nine four to eight one thousand I N o v I T E\nNews talk Ninety five point five the best news and talk and building [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThomas resentful my guess is the author of leaving the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical dot com that time is tight Thomas so let's get to the other say on\nA at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nUm are there for it shows up and he Arthur forward usually worked for the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened\nAnd they were able to make it kind of a um like a show very theatrical show where Harry would work with Beth the same way they worked\nWhen they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her um well he was very poetic with very at times very touching and romantic and ah there were statements like\nThis but what they did was they put this ten key words on the table and then they coated them and after it was decoded\nThe message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that that's his nickname\nThat Harry used for her with Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song right around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring\nAnd so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and your language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd did anyone noted does anyone know Arthur Ford no that Roosevelt was the pen name for best there was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um [noise]\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of set up someone said that uh there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he and he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah\nI just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have\nKnown that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other\n... and and again he just he he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher ... just didn't show the word believe they used the secret coating message\nThat we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look can be quick in and these all windy coded spelled out the message which began with a Roosevelt and and believe yes\nYes and um\nAnd she declared the success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on set off this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence given to me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only herbal three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was the success that it happened\nI think so in effect of the\nNewspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around ... fourteen months after that there is a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now denounced that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever that\nThis was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or erratic rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it re Jew Jew Ari I Can't pronounce the name but I don't remember where\nAnd I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited Arthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in a closet but they're hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Ford it's someone that's been paid to in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says uh I paid Mrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because\nBats heard about at well as the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded in a letter\n'em to that same paper where she just completely denies it there she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford said that they were in cahoots he's a liar\nI mean she was very clear in this letter goes on and on and I'd never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted\nOn a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nYou know and this was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the\nSocial they go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the New York evening graphic\nBut it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the letter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity\nYou know I'm just telling you I was no party to any fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he can fast and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened\nIn one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so and I think that this stuff stirred and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nAnyone says they get in touch with me after my death and know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise] um so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sounds and twenty nine was she recanted and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward ten thousand dollar prize to any one to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting to yeah\nBecause you know if he really wasn't boots with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not\nBefore this happened I retracted the offer well that sounds you know pretty pretty iffy whereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress\nTo be hindered by some kind of monetary motivation you know would have been much more graceful you see it I mean\nBut it was just days after where she says I'm not going to pay the money [noise]\nRight so your your feelings are the best basically and she herself was in a vow to a bunker for fifty years and uh and so the social pressure from her family was just too much and so she she caved and she recanted\nRecovery from mental and substance use disorder is real it happens every day you can recover discover home ...\nRiver give up on your cells showing the voices for recovery for confidential information for mental and substance use disorder call one eight hundred six six to help ... by the U.S department of health and Human Services\nSays we're all she'd be willy nine Seventy buildings these huge huge ward and you're listening to news dawn ... for for a while [noise]\n\nUh Georgia police officer shot dead near school I'm an Carrick Fox News or go in that County Georgia police officer was shot and killed Saturday in snow bill the suspects still on the loose\nOr school I'm an Carrick Fox News or go in that County Georgia police officer was shot and killed Saturday and ... the suspects still on the loose sergeant Jake Smith\nOfficers are vicious vehicle Charlotte approached shots fired a shot [noise]\nHer [noise]\nPolice identifying the slain officer is thirty year old Anton Tony originally from Southern California\nThe vehicle was recovered and it's being processed by uh CSI unit thousands of Honduran migrants headed to Mexico and the U.S clashing with police on the Guatemala Mexico border democratic Senator Ben card and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee spoke with Fox News on Saturday this car\nShould be dealt with before it comes to the United states that is true those are legitimate a song or a request should be handled with the with the respect that we get it for two assault seekers those who are not part of that should not hopefully get into Mexico let alone to the United states\nThe presidents of Honduras Guatemala announcing late Saturday about two thousand Honduran migrants return to voluntarily President Trump threatening to close the U.S southern butter if Mexico could not stop the caravan\nPresident Trump is blaming Russia for the U.S withdrawal from the Nineteen eighty seven intermediate range nuclear forces treaty\nRussia is not adhere to the agreement so we'll go to Germany and we're going to develop their weapons if they get smart authors get bored and they say let's not developed these horrible nuclear weapons [noise] I Would be extremely happy with that\nThe president commenting after ... campaign rallies this his Fox News\nThis is ...

I I think of George Bush senior trying to buy stocks in Kmart back in the er the member that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man and there was a famous\nTV report he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know well he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nIt's funny how they live amongst us but they have no idea what the hell were about it's incredible really the ultra rich off during the training that people who just hit and they don't have any idea about us or what we do you know and sometimes I Wonder if they really want to but it's really I mean that does this\nRight All right it's it's the time to deal with\nThings like they lived in the clouds ... happy not contracted polio uh he ... he may not have been well he may have been president but it's certainly changed it to jak three of\nHis life as you would imagine it would but also his politics talk to me about how polio affected FDR more than just physically\nWell I'll tell you what this was where I I gained a lot of a lot of respect but ah I was not necessarily you know the three and I'm not much of socialist personal but you know when somebody comes down with well into power for relatives but the point where all the looters her head and they fight their way back\nUsing sure will um installing ... bars over over the bed so they can use their arms and then dragging your body to try and get themselves for a walk every day I'm successful when that happened to them you know the our ways uh\nStarted to you know obviously you know we'll be non treatments came and I'm not going to actually work each day that you identify with people who are suffering and who are needy loses a gigantic flights a humble pie actually change of life\nRight I mean he displayed ... you'd have to call it of heroism or in the face of this uh this disease I mean he basically dragged he's he he had a hunch is Iran's but he would drag himself from miles\nYeah every day he had this regimen that um you know he had\nBars and stalled out in front of the Roosevelt mansion and he would extract\nSome of these races and he would use crutches and the ... and it's just incredible and stuff but it it you know twelve pounds of steel on each leg and he was dragging his off if it's the\nTo the parallel bars where he's exercising bombs and then from the parallel bars closest route ... in front of a A R\nAnd then he's turning around and dragging himself back ... you know quote unquote walking trying to fix stops and you're gonna leave if this is talk about iron clad will unit that was that was a was really something else or anything\nWant to come back that\nThat part and then of course he ended up in Warm Springs Georgia\nA ...\n... want to come back that\nThat part and then of course he ended up in Warm Springs Georgia where the warm waters\nWith cheapest wage in my job and then other people with other collections of facts ill you have to live to identify with people in need and suffering\nSo it really changes what for sure\nAnd then there's the fast track or to the White House I'm just sort of ... we we we we've got about five five minutes before we head into the break at the bottom of the hour but let's just give me a sort of a thumbnail sketch of of his\nJourney to the White House or does it start with Governor of New York or is it under secretary of the navy\nInstruct for the White House started ... or ... Wilson a turtle huddle house actually who Woodrow Wilson was like all colonel house was Woodrow Wilson's well they didn't know that at the time that he was a it was it was a hostile employing\nAnd um they were followed it all in love with this communist ideal and um you know of course they didn't know anything about it but it was just like a great fan yeah it\nIt was through at um ... house and I'm\nI'm a geologist and actually looking system secretary in the navy and from their intended to use a ... million and that the political connections in New York to bunch for governor and then once governor I'm you know it was a\nIt was a jump to the White House one\nAnd he asked them to come out of the time when a ...\nSome things that I Want it to do\n'em over want it to do but you know he would call that I hate to hang a\nDidn't cooperate very well with with with over some of those were his ideas and now they don't have to jump right to a jump right to the White House some\nYou know started a he originally ran on tax cuts and everything and we realized that goes that old isn't working you completely flip and what you know with a socialist end of it\nAnd uh you know we're ... and you become friends with the suffering so\nRight well we'll get into the the new deal in the depression and and and so forth and and the fact that it will do this after the break but I just wanted to mention the idea that someone in a in a confined to a wheelchair or and it had a such a debilitating disease polio\nOr for that person to to rise to the White House at a time when as you point out in who murdered FDR at a time when\nA physical handicap like this was also also equated with sort of ... of mind and how\nWithout against the complicity of the media that sort of agreed you know to not talk about it he never would have been president\nYou know it's amazing the parallels he made a very cooperative very sympathetic maybe they're just like today well no uh [laughter] it's like today without whether I'm like well if you can bridge I'm\nSure [laughter] yeah yeah absolutely or loss of freedom he gets a free pass\nThe or the or between these two guys will have to talk about when you get back but uh it's it's it's a history basically just repeating repeating itself with\nThe Russians and the White House and you know just all kinds of things it's incredible uh like operating it down and known known catches it you know they felt\nThe hell but how is it that's a that no one\nOf you know notice store or said hey wait a minute our president\nWalk is he equipped you know this is thinking back then obviously we know better now but the idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago\nUh that no one would take notice of that\nWell they they they pick their camera shots well and I hope people for a few hours a day that this was the guy if\nHe would get really think I'm horrified thought processes that why do you really really really tough so what do you do is you do it without someone one arm he will Luther arm and that helped with the ... or something it would appear to be walking\nTo pick a couple of steps so they could I guess you know by podium users will be a different candidate shops and you know they they do remarkably well so they are to ward off the fact\nThat in case anything you\nGet paid in a search something to go public and claimed that you know I was just so that was showing any for X amount of hours so I mean propaganda and all those oils Walsh anything back down you know it's just that\nThe new deal with smaller and easier to control obviously we didn't have other things you know cell phones and cameras on the phone and you know they could get twice a day at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which you're seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely good I'm\n... like this is complicated fire I'm already struck\nThe point the lemon had changed debate in which the president was going to be one in from march until January\nSo you didn't go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that rose or at a waiter take office for or ex so\nThis

coming do you live from coast to Toronto, Canada affiliate in depth radio news talk ten ten\nSteve you be my guest who murdered FDR you know when people without these lists you know the greatest presidents and so forth FDR's often on those lists uh you know right up there with with Lincoln and Washington and Kennedy of course\nI'm ... FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him\nAnd uh he's certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in a in a horrible devastating depression like fifty percent unemployment and the banking system it failed and there's just sort of paint the picture for us how bad it was\nFifty percent unemployment in the bank system failed and it's just sent paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad ah you know the president preceding Hoover had a roaring economy going and of course and you remember remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things were starting to\nWe were starting out starting to be able to afford luxuries and the country but Hoover got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raised a few taxes and put some regulations on and here that fast\nAnd uh you know so here comes FDR in ... there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering\nSo he has this has low vision of legislation a in a you know in order to help these people in or so he thought and he did he did a great deal of hell for a lot of people we put people to work and it was on the government or the grammar paycheck\nAnd um this was the\nExperiment from the communists the communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp in Nineteen Nineteen in this country\nOkay so all of this information or was coming through\nOr his friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you're a New York city or and so this is was their idea\nOf how to help the workers in the working class and it was a flood of legislation or were\nThey just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FBI regulated at that point everything from farms to banking food to securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put everyone to work on the government do so we could have this cradle to grave wonderful society that style and and the Soviets had fooled us into thinking existed\nNew ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we're going to escape the uh the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all those new wonderful\nPeaks and valleys in capitalism I think you meant the I think he's the communist instead of ...\nSorry about that I hear the noise the pitfalls and valleys in ... of of of capitalism you know so right\n... ... if I might you because you you are you you print the list of legislative uh\nUm actions that were enacted\nA in in who murdered FDR let me just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy acted beer wine revenue act\nOf creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief act agricultural adjustment act emergency far mortgage act Tennessee Valley authority ac securities act aggregation of gold team in class homeowners lone act Glass Steagall banking act national industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act\nAnd the farm credit act um and he I mean he did this\nReally without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ran that through I wasn't going to bore everybody with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I Will not\nDo that I'm happy to bore them with your show [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list\nBut it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was right out of almost like the communist manifesto that then he had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it certainly it certainly was\nThe same basic control he was carrying just like Stalin style and just purged all of his enemies you know if you got in a way of style and you know you ended up that his first two wives his doctor who told things to um you know he he just went\nOh and you know you ended up that his first two wives his doctor who told things to um you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either disagree with America challenging politically\nAnd that kind of salad did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worried you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know weary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nOkay so well all of this\nWas going on in Europe is great war is brewing you know he's seen lots of Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it so if this was a great a second new deal must be better so\nUm they start to put a you know implement and then the second new deal and they start to realize that substantial portions of it were unconstitutional so the um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get it passed and it was\nI mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean a tremendous amount\nAnd I know in the history books history\nBooks say a lot of things are I Know the history books paid him as this wonderful magical genie of or economic success he wasn't there was an economic failure people were ah they were surviving and that was about it\nThat was about all they were doing and the you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services\nWe were ... you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean it was it was a it was a cat us it was a cutoff because atrophy\nHow do you use the trading with the enemy act or to to to gain more power lend lease there's music playing the you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\n[noise] [noise] well [laughter] again when he did was that was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the Senate was the same thing with the with the one lease program he was moving you know munitions in goods and services to the to the to defeat the access powers\nAnd he was giving them to the to our allies you know free France included and eventually this new Soviet Union so that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time\nSo there's a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started or he had to do that because it started to realize the new deal was not working\nSo there was\nNo there was a lot going on economically in in our country and there came to a point\nWhere he knew that we had to get into this war\nAnd the spies indeed and\nYou know we have spies who I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries have it I'm more you have spies to our spies in Germany were starting to tell us they're finishing your heavy water experiments and with the beats who rockets to carry the nuclear weapons to all for it to the globe\nWe'd be speaking German right now\nI mean they were on the brand so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst here of what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nSo in the book you argue as many as I have that that NPR New Japanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um then the question is did he get he sort of make it happen beanie let it happen or what he just sort of glad it happened\nYou know I I say in my book that I think FDR was probably the greatest war president we ever had and that's because he just loved war he did everything to make World War two happening I'm going to catch flak for that but you know what the words too bad it's true or right\nAlmost seven years later though Ryan is a happy healthy girl loves playing hockey\nThis is possible thanks to organizations like Alex is

am to go to ferrier school\nOr not free or a school ferrier school what is that you ask well so I actually Nathan a it turns out like his granddaddy back in Kentucky is a horse lover a horse

it's just a totally cool vocation kind of a throwback\nA I in fact I thought that job kind of gone the out of fashion sort of like ... at the bowling alley which was a great after school job for kids back in the day\nBefore automation ... or or working at the rotisserie ...\nRemember those anyway so Nathan is going to shoe horses and I'm a I Love horses\nRight so there was a the conference in Casablanca and and then later to Iran I think in a was Turan in Nineteen forty three and again for forty three correct they had even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world ah and skilled at this point you know\nRobots or you know he you know my my standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy I met my today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was in a relatively young guy\nUm he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards because deathbed confessions come out diaries or published a you know with a documents were declassified and then you can really go back\nAnd really and that's what I like to do um some people right to make friends I write to solve murders on call me crazy so he can really go back in pieced together the snippets of of what was going on so I'm the decay inspiring with the Nazis firing\nA was a large aspiring American history thirty three members and they were over here to assassinate and sabotage anything if they get their hands on um operation Pistorius' or was another Nazis firing eight members or they were created after Pearl Harbor\nOr they attacked salient targets and has a state and they were all caught and I believe\nEach one of them except for one seven of them got the electric chair one got Thirty years in prison because he flipped on the other ones did they ever get close to Roosevelt\nOh yeah absolutely they did but Stalin was closer Stalin had infiltrated so much Roosevelt Roosevelt I'm White House it was it was incredible so this is it this is what I was saying about the parallels to modern day\nAnd people think oh this was Seventy some odd years every five years or whatever what have you oh this you know this was all his ... his reasons repeating\nItself okay so here we have in the White House again I'm Roosevelt was basically screwing everything in the White House and here we have another of another president who's accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House\nAnd uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communist completely frustrated at the White House\nAnd we'll talk about that I'm sure down the road and here we go again here's Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating is White House\nSo give me an example of give me an example in in Roosevelt White House of some of the the communist and the ... year\nOh well the first communist overhead as there was a Monday house which was um a Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth they came that were involved in um FDR's White House\nI couldn't list them all uh there there were\nThere were hundreds of them at least Fifteen higher ranking officials and half the White House where knowing communist starting with Harry Dexter why all the way through the elder his\nAnd they were in all kinds of different uh and also Harry Hopkins which turned out later he was fingered in Nineteen Ninety and I'll talk about Harry hop into the er at length later\nSo they don't get bored on your way it's more common [laughter] um the or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated in the following places that I could find the agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's office\nThe department of state the national labor relations board the labor advisory board or the war productions\nBoard the price of administration the U.S treasury to\nLabor relations board the labor advisory board\nOr the war productions board the price administration the U.S Treasury Department U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee\nSo I won't bore you on with the laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were you know who were in that list or who are high ranking officials in those are in that list of of people so I mean he was just\nCommunists were all around them Harry Hopkins actually it was the HHS secretary of state he was one of the architects of the new deal because one of FDR's closest friends in confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know I obviously\nEvery every I couldn't travel very well\nBecause of his affliction and you know the races and the wheelchair and so far so we had to have someone fly over to talk to Stalin and so forth and uh that person was Harry Hopkins um who's Harry Hopkins actually was ... ah friends of Eleanor Roosevelt\n'em through the\nCPU essay the Communist Party United States of America which is still in existence by the way they mentioned that or not\nAnd how they Hopkins is down and get on famously he was actually ... Harry Hopkins as time went by he was also architect could lend lease program to help\nThe Soviets out\nSo Harry Hopkins ... famously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming the waters in America before all of this happen okay I'll get to that in a minute or he was Harry happens afterwards fire afterwards\nWas fingered by a KGB the factor and I'm going to butcher this name 'em all they grew up skiing and there's a name here I just simply couldn't even begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB the factors they both identified\nHarry Hopkins is the mysterious agent Nineteen who is contacting a Soviet Union\nAbout uh the the than on a project which of course we all know is a nuclear weaponry so here we have I mean there are informants and spies all around the\nFDR so so the point where they he goes to the wrong conference\nYou know I mean ... a style and knows more about Roosevelt then Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt meeting at these conferences it was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were uh at the hands of a an ... weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him\nStyling right information right he had plans in the post war world of\nTaking America was half communist anyway he had plans are taking over America and making them a full communist country with him as a ruler\nSo he was a little diluted in his own in his own right but how this all happened was\nPrior to this of course this was a new ideology communism while this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this and that and you know we don't have\nTo go to work in every word is provided for well Stalin had sent invitations to\nUm to the directors in Hollywood a\nUnion leaders a college professors he knew the target and they would were sent invitations all expense paid to go over to Russia\nTo see how this this work and they went to a city in the city's names escaping me at home and it is are listed in my book\nIn the they were to observe how Russia did things and how everyone was care for how this working how terrific it was and look at what we've done and you need to do this year country because you're you know look at you look at\nOr if he really sees the opportunities town was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how

okay\nI Am I'm just trying to get over the story of the ... the girl they their grandfather's ashes and the cookies she wants to ... was the ones that are gray Persian the famine in Russia under Stalin\nIt must be really going on Rick or or or anybody you know [laughter]\nYeah well it never ceases to amaze uh when I just wanted to chicken and you can because people need to know it's you know you're on the east coast it's three forty in the morning and the three hours is a long stretch to talk so I just want to make sure you're you're doing OK and we appreciate you being here with us and staying up\nLate so I'm I wanted to talk about you know so much of the post world are so much of the post\nWar world is a result and then then the ensuing Cold War and and all of that\nReally is a result of FDR's frail condition his greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference and y'all\nTo in forty four when when that post war world was really carved up and\nStyle and obviously you know took advantage he seized upon\nRoosevelt frail condition or and and um [noise] FDR really didn't know what happened he just was so out of it but\nI mean you you look at those pictures of FDR at the the also conference and obviously he is is he looks like death warmed over but seven months before at the Tehran Conference he looks as as fit as a federal I mean ... what is going on with what happened in those seven months\nWell over to this point we've been talking about the bond that we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with them I'm happier as being slowly poison from within the White House and I have to be very careful here not to give this book away but it was a type of\nAmerica is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and what they were poisoning with with something that was\nPlentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet but\nThe rest of the world certainly did Europe certainly did some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older so in certain situations they had to jump on us and you know I don't think grandpa Walton would've known anything about poisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially because they didn't know it was poisonous at the time so\nFDR as being slowly poisoning from inside the White House every time he goes away\nToo Warm Springs Georgia to sow his ailing legs and go on a retreat so he can mentally and physically rejuvenate himself he starts to get stronger every time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or so you know I I did a little digging\nInto this because it was just so what started me on this whole thing of FDR I thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient\nThat in the tiny Marshall Eighteen days\nA Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini had all died conveniently at the end of the war I thought that was a little convenient so this is what people asked me we just start looking into this for and this and that I also thought it was all convenient that FDR just\nDied of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's bunker I thought that was a little to get a little bit convenient so and when I started to dig in and I saw that the the odd deterioration of this president during this time period\nI said you know wait a minute I I really got to look into this I didn't believe it in high school when we were taught about it back then they actually taught history you know I mean\n[laughter] but in the book you point out how he he doctors I guess Dr mcentire admiral a navy admiral mcentire his personal physician\nAnd a cardiologist Dr Howard Bruins they were they had no idea what was going on and they were doing X rays and take doing all of these tests they were really clueless\nWell and this is where you know this is where the rubber finally starting to meet the road for me they really work for what they were thinking the American public just\nThought oh he ... himself out for us and you know he was the advance of polio and this and that and the other thing in\nThe symptoms of the his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors Emma Ross McIntyre who's the White House physician he was also the vice admiral and in a surgeon surgeon general of the navy\nUm you know he was FDR's physician from thirty to forty five until he died a Dr Howard brewing was a commander in the navy a course FDR's a navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors\nOr he was chief of cardiology emphasize though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy no idea [noise] so what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so baffled as because FDR is getting sick after meal times\nThis is my first hand something was wrong in his blood pressure would bounce\nHe would go normal and then it would go it would go warring out of control three ten over one Ninety five or something and it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying very hard to every ... wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything that they were giving him\nSo we know when they when they\nTo this point they said look at you know Nineteen forty four is rolling around this guy's going to run for president again again and we've got to get to the bottom with how's it going on here so they send them to the doctor of the day\nFounder of the lead clinic in Boston and he's a surgeon and he is the guy in America at the time [laughter] so he examines FBI march in Nineteen forty four\nAnd um when he comes out was is a ... a glaring statement which is now available online you can look it up at the History Channel basically saying that this is a dead man walking\nAnd do what he the laundry list of symptoms that he reveals that FDR has does not align with the advance of polio\nThey advance they align with the advance of poisoning FDR is being slowly poison styling style and got him I can tell you that I'm\nStyling wants FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar confidence because he wants to rule the world\nAfter yard he wanted to set up the for policemen of the world um the United states Great Britain China in the Soviet Union so they could all police there quarter of the world actually I didn't want to share of the world with I'm Sorry I didn't want to share of the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world\nHe was a megalomaniac with what he did in the Soviet Union of course we didn't know that then it wasn't wasn't you know reveal to us until years later\nWho died that was part of the negotiation team in the U.S at ... am on the way back from the all time or one of Roosevelt aids died conveniently also on the brain in your in\nBut there are people dropping dead around FDR of rain any resumes all over the place that no one writes about again no one writes about this or his name was pile Watson and he was a high ranking naval officer he was on the way back I Believe in that surround conference dies on this ship cerebral hemorrhage\nHe gets back he being FDR he gets back a short time later I'm FDR's personal secretary also in a Mac and talking to relation to the doctor Ross McIntyre he dies of his cerebral hemorrhage\nThe drug of the day is more free rat poison and its colorless tasteless\nOrder less and its circulating all over the place is a matter of fact styling got murdered or the rat poison or for some in from the internal ... governor\nThat came out later as well so there's a lot going on war friend is not what got FDR would have been to sudden it would have thrown up too many red flags okay style wouldn't want it to deal with Harry Truman he wanted to deal with Harry Truman 'cause he wasn't as political savvy or so he thought he knew that FDR was\nA a tremendous mine and he couldn't outsmart them okay so here's you know this had to happen um for style and to

[laughter] it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote a\nThe uh the book being um the White House\nPhysician and that was a Ross and Ross mcentire were they in on the murder have absolutely no idea I I I couldn't say I'd have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit little\nIgnorant maybe and and what happened to ... the Russian painter and her driver and and and um she would tops husband\n[noise] well they just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time or two afterwards well immediately afterwards well\nThey packed up the uh uh uh Robbins and assume it's off and they threw Wilson\nFair with among others um [laughter] and um they tried to get out of Warm Springs Georgia as fast as possible so in her book um her being I'm sure with off in her book she describes the plight that they took to to get away from Warm Springs Georgia\nWhich I thought was a little crazy because if it was a natural death\nUm you know why I don't know why would you lie to flee the scene right right you know I mean if it's a natural death why still the records you know and there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually\nUm JFK shot in Dallas they break law to bring him to a lot of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas they break law to bring him to besides the now the law was\nThe same in Nineteen sixty three is it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it sort of a thousand or so both you know both the JFK and FDR's body I removed a legally they're both at but says though we're all kinds of fun\nThings happen you know a lot of this besides that could talk you know and and they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's is death to him being being buried they couldn't get this guy's body in the ground fast enough no\nNor did by the way and no one involving\nNo autopsy Nolan bombing it just went crazy\nHere and crazier and crazier all the way through so I mean and there's other things in history to Richard I mean take a look at 'em you know not just this I'm\nGoing to be working on Princess Diana coming up next but there are other presidents in history who I also believe that the murder that they glossed over\nUm Warren Harding Warren Harding was it was it was obvious this guy was murdered and there's another one that we thought about but as far as FDR's concern\nI mean the the [laughter] the information in my head just exploded when I started digging and digging and digging and it's still it's still boggles my mind you know the book is going to publish for a little while now and I still even after the book is one published you know I'll find a new fact ... should have put that in the book I mean is\nThat the volume three perhaps uh let me get the calls here ah and he's in Alabama and the wild card line any good morning welcome to cost\nThank you Steve I'm calling to ask you about ... music ... she won several of your race your garden party she cannot aunt who work at the state department and parents are married now\nI'd also like me can experience with the blood dancer strapped for my grandmother which was watering eight ... hand things however it looked like brain can take conscious blading all in the body mind than ever and it came time to name your and from\nThere you go like you don't you say it wasn't warfare and with Roosevelt because that would have been too quick\nYeah it was it wasn't people around him they were disposing of with war for him because it and she's right she's right I mean it thins the blood out to to the point where if you touch a person they'll get you know either their their brains will either bleed or they'll have an ... or something or cerebral hemorrhage\nAnd they'll also and of course I Know Dr but no my parents are both on it they're both on a variety of blood\nCenter so right my late father was as well sure that's only caused brooding than any thanks for calling in\nThank you uh let's go back in the wild card line is it my New York\nAnd my I had more high there are many good morning ah okay\nAs quick a three part and I listen all over the edge in Florida I look for I heard um a gentleman on the air I heard ... top ...\nWho also believe that FDR with with a lot of it and I'd like to know if he is familiar with him and his theory around it\nA second and what is it the grasses so he would be someone that would talk about the new the new deal as as a\nUh doing the right thing around that that they're offered so called Great Depression and so I like thoughts on that and last late ... about\nBoth of direction connection and it's a both FDR and is a current stable genius if you will and the White House is saying somewhat different because\nAh with the current administration is seen to have more to do with leading up to even out he wound up as president and of course the money that he had to go to encounter writes in Saudi Arabia but I'd like to elaborate\nOn ... and and of course the ah that do see a fifty fifty sad you know we know that he has a ... and then\nWell my if I could just jump in here because we're not talking about Trump I think if it's enough to put words in your mouth but I think it would be kind of facetious\nOr about the Russian connection with Trump but let's just stick to FDR where we can do a whole show perhaps another time on on the Russian dusty and so forth much and you're right ... a big fan of FDR and no Webster a little bit and I've had dinner with him and and the U.S is on about the new deal\nUh obviously Steve you're you're not a fan did you have anything to add\nUh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing at the time I think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go 'cause I Want it to my knowledge there's never been done before so I mean it\nI have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good thing it helps a lot of people um it just wasn't along sustaining campaign\nSo as far as the Russians in the current administration yeah I was going to be in a little facetious as to how how everyone has imposed history you're kind of repeats itself what kind of doesn't you know um it's it's amazing how\nWe have the [laughter] we were right back in the same thing we have another red scare them in the country it's it's really it's really something you know it's a village or who's also for her if he were alive he would he would really enjoy those rising\nRight so I think the point they are making there was that the the Russian connection during FDR's time was overt uh and today it's I guess you would to coin a phrase from CNN it's nothing burger\nRight I mean if I mean if they ever prove it with from which I don't know if they're ever going to um they may I don't know I'm not privy to that information but it's it's just interesting\nHow how old the two of the history is another red scare it's starting to repeat itself all over again\nAnd here we are Seventy some odd years passed its funny which is how history repeats itself becomes relevant actually I'm interesting book I think you'll like it thanks for less than I ever growing up\nWe will ah we're heading into a break here at the bottom of the hour and then we will get to a more calls people are lined up in Chicago Pennsylvania Gulfport, Mississippi San Pedro California Sioux Falls South Dakota we'll get to as many of you as we can\nAnd here's the Reverend Al Green I'm so tired of being alone taking a break on coast to coast am [noise]\nFor having me real quick to thing\nWind up if you look at a at Roosevelt Nineteen forty four you look so bad I have a hard time thing that they had to kill him because he was going to die anyway that's why they got rid of Henry Wallace may Truman to buy for the night before or campaign 'cause they didn't make the lip\nSecond of all I don't I've read up on this or that they would do and how I got away with all the stuff when Roosevelt died dollar that somebody to look at Roosevelt body apparently and make sure that he uh let's see if he was he was calling because I'm a dollar and did a lot of that\nAnd I think it was the for the story was it it would require you to ... he wanted Roosevelt ... rate them over the cold that the that Iran and uh you know and all that and gotten to deal with the fight about ... ... again by the fact that uh that's all I wanted him dead I I think he did not want them to want to live longer they pop like\nMark my take on it All right interesting John ... bad shape you going to die anyway All right Stephen and you want to reply [noise] um\nI you know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils okay a lot of the things that we've been sold 'em have shown slanted okay\nI'm not suggesting what you said has been he look so bad in Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poisoned systematically poison that's\nWhy he look so bad in Nineteen forty four this wasn't for\nSo after almost two years of being poisoned systematically poison\nWhy he looks so bad in Nineteen forty four this wasn't from the advance on polio and it spills out very very plainly in my book so it's a it's an interesting time in history there's an awful lot of people who researched this and I learned from every one of them I'm not going to sit here and professor know every little angle that's for sure\nBut um as far as silenced I wouldn't want to rule the world he didn't he didn't have any interest in sharing anything with FDR so if he sent something to look in the ... in the end of the coughing or send someone to verify what was going on he was already being where the death was already verified from the two Russians that were in front of him when he\nDied so if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting that didn't if indeed that had happened\nIt was probably just so he could uh you know get recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of falls propaganda\nHi John thank you for that meeting point there ah let's see how to James in Philadelphia Hi James good morning look at the coast to coast\nThank you Richard uh but my guess for my\nQuestion for Mr ... he's just show banning it in your research physical or did you come across all anything about this just to ... an attempted coup against a Roosevelt and the thirties and that\nUh if it did happen if you came across it how close was it a ... happening and it costs us ... uh it was a exposed by an army general ... medley butler and that one of the people involved was a I think it was a Garth or\nDid you come across anything about the coup how if it if it's true how posted it come to happening\nUm if it if it did happen if there was an attempted coup\nAgainst Roosevelt\nThat's not something that you discuss in the book like a ...\nA James thanks for calling and I did run run into that information but it was after the book was published so you won't find that information in there\nI thought it was fascinating when I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did um and ... yeah I don't really I don't know I guess that people say a lot of things I don't know how true that really is\nWith the amount of people who are around Roosevelt who\nDidn't like him for multiple reasons\nI'm from you know suppressing the uh the the capitalist to holding office as long as he did it would not would not surprise me\nBut I mean as far as as far as that's concerned I don't have any I don't have any great knowledge into that I discovered it after the book but I did run into it so thanks for your call and I'm Sorry I couldn't be of much help there like I said I I I Would be lying if I said I felt that I knew everything\nLike James thank you for that way and he's in Chicago Wayne good morning luck because\nYou're ridge or one time you cannot do your job do you feel good return from from nurtured married\nWow that's very kind of you to say but it's you know it's going to guess like Steve who who make my job very easy\nRight where are our to grab the American minister um I figure the Mars commercial back in the day to Mars period and commercial where where they talk about I'm ... trying to clear your mind the American or commercial returned from Sudan or trigger Barton deterred\nDrummers [laughter] I was almost getting hungry wait until you had to bring up the search you [laughter] I Know I Know\n... ... ... words [laughter] order here um\nWe are ... you're on years ago ... ... what I'm\nTalking about this year we're talking about\nMaking a very compelling ... ... ... everybody are committed suicide or nurse weren't Eleanor ...\nYou're probably ... ...\n... everybody are committed suicide or nurse weren't Eleanor hurried

guess the question would be why why would he um why would he\nDo that I don't know Stephen have you have you ever come across anything indicating that any theory that ... that FDR means tried to take

this news talk contends the old C F R B had been on the radio for eighty years correction is more like Ninety Ninety years [noise]\nAlso last night or should I say earlier this morning during the open line segment a number of callers shared their near death\nEarlier this morning during the open line segment a number of callers shared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife [noise]\nTonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time an alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist\nHarry Houdini Houdini and his wife best were fears the bunkers of psychic ability mediums and spiritual this movement in fact Houdini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and their fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving for unexpected punches was abdomen\nBy McGill University student backstage at the princess theater in Montreal Canadian connection there on his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wide best he would do so\nThan more than two years after his death his wife best attended the sounds conducted by medium psychic Arthur for\nDuring which for allegedly channeled the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to\nBy Harry invest initially best stated publicly and assigned in witness testimony that she believed Terry Haddon fact communicated to her from the grave\nLater however she recanted and stated publicly that no Harry had not\nCommunicated to er during the say odds despite this best continue to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nDuring all that time she said she received no communication from Harry finally after the last say ounce on October thirty first Nineteen thirty six best gave up saying ten years is long enough to wait for any mad\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pads and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nAfter a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading\nFor Harry where she claimed that he brought she bought through Harry's mother and Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing\nI'm Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI was he sort of outed her in public didn't need any out her ... yeah\nYes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow no part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience was how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photos psychic act or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coated method that that Harry and best could communicate with each other\nIn order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody methods um\nI think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of Penn words and the tenth word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through can\nAnd number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry invest first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket political point oh like what is the last two digits on the coastline and they these were rich\nAnd play answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly\nAnd that would be number eight and\nSo it has a natural them is to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins the best selling her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating to invariably using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eights were in in the secret code emitted so so that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix ties right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend but the way of doing that and that's what we're used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now ... please be quickly look be quick and as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical dot com infinitely mystical\nDot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry Hi and\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this call because after the message was delivered to bath and she said that it works somebody\nQuickly said hey this was all in a book is all already published in a book this is no big deal well I thought and I read this on line a number of times someone would say within the book but they wouldn't say the name of the book out of the people were saying it's on page da da da da di ... crazy and then I\nFinally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county and for all of twenty five cents they\nWould move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book I couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just all of that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book\nAnd so that book does talk about those ten words and how it's used to form numbers but not out a form we're\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd um let's see I hear a bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coded word rose about that the secret message with in code word to leave and the actual\nSecret can word message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also is a famous magician and he's a close personal friend of Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book\nEveryone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nWe need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why was important for you to point out that this secret code\nWe need to introduce a Ford and and why was important for you to point out that this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini\nA and therefore it may have been possible for so much to know about that because now we get into the say aunts and and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly he told them that\nI'm a skeptic I I I'm a ... I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try and then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford howdy howdy Ford get in touch with best [noise]\nWell I ... just a minute but I just want to point out that I think that this worked\nBecause bath and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and all of a a little bit we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nUm Ford was reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of its clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into this session and\nIn his on putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that's gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have and she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother\nTo show him that his mother's soul and spirit with surviving gap and so she got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was well aware\nOf who ... his reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDid all this I got a jump in here forgive me Thomas I got to jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking us into the break with do me on coast to coast am [noise]\nAnd joined the peace of mind ... today for just Ninety nine dollars a visit cardio dot com that's K. A. R. D. I. A. dot com\nBoom\nIn billings news Tom Ninety five boys [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas resentful my guess is the author of leaving the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com that time is tight Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens\n[noise] um are there for it shows up and he either for it usually worked for the spirit name Fletcher and\nFletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world communicate to our physical world\nIs it a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show very theatrical show where hey would work with that same way they worked\nWhen they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her um well he was very poetic with very at times very touching and romantic and there were statements like throw in the curtain and all of this but what they did with they put this pen chemo\nAnd ah there were statements like throw open the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this ten key words on the table and then they coated them and after it was decoded\nThe message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that that is a nickname\nThat Harry used for her was Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song right around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring\nAnd so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Rosa bell believe\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd that anyone noted did anyone knows it or the Ford no that Roosevelt was the pen name for best there was this common knowledge\nHe might have been known throughout the close friends um [noise]\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of set up someone said that uh there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he and he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah I just don't find this credible so I won't go into it\nBut um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other writers\nAnd and again he just he he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher ... just didn't show the word believe they used the secret coating message\nThat we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look can be quick in and these all windy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe yes\nYes and um\nAnd she declared success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on said oh this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence given to me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it signed by not only hurt but three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that had happened\nI think so in effect of the\nNewspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around fourteen months after this there is a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now\nDenounce that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever that this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there\nAnother a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or radical rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it\nI'm a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New Yorker graph or we Rafik rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it re Jew Jew Ari I Can't pronounce the name but I don't remember one\nName but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited Arthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in a closet but they're hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Ford it's someone that's been paid to in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says uh I paid Mrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because\nBats heard about at well as the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded in a letter 'em to that same paper where she just completely denies it there she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford said that they were in cahoots he's a liar\nI mean she was very clear in this letter goes on and on and I'd never seen\nThis letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted on a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nYou know and this was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the social\nThey go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the New York evening graphic\nBut it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the letter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity\nYou know I'm just telling you I was no party to any fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he can fast and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened\nIn one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so and I think that this faster and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my death and know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise]\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sounds in twenty nine was she re camping and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward ten thousand dollar price too\nAnd but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward ten thousand dollar prize to allow anyone to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because\nYou know if he really wasn't ... with Arthur Ford\nHe could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer\nWell that sounds you know pretty pretty iffy whereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress to be hindered by some kind of monetary\nHere is a nice foundation shows it's gratitude to concerts and festivals bases around the globe community outreach programs across the country and building brand new customs smart home for our most severely wounded better\nFind out how you can join the call donate Gary Sunnis foundation dot org\nWe ... we're much she'd be willy nine Seventy buildings these huge huge ward and you're listening to news talking points [noise]\n[noise]\nHans in Georgia I'm Pam who sales Fox News the fatal shooting of a police officer\nHunting in Georgia I'm Pam who sales Fox News the fatal shooting of a police officer has authorities in Georgia looking for a teenager officer Antwon Tony was killed yesterday in ... county\nOffers a vehicle shell shocked shocked [noise]\nWhen it county police sergeant Jake Smith police believe Eighteen year old to sorry Maynard ups Melville fired the shots a second peanuts under arrest for aggravated assault related to a separate incident after the shootings\nIn South Carolina more than two dozen people or heard after all floors collapsed overnight during a party inside a clubhouse Clemson police say none of the injuries is life threatening\nPresident Trump keeping the pressure on his political opponents\nDemocratic Party has become a green roof was on the Internet mob determined to get power by any means necessary [noise] the president\nWrapping up a series of rallies in the west that one in Nevada where Senate Republican Dean Heller is facing a tough challenge from democratic congresswoman Jackie rose and Democrats also hitting Nevada hard\nNo matter how old are your your your never ever just reading a lecture goes as consequential as election nationally and locally\nFormer vice president Joe Biden in Las Vegas former President Obama will visit Vegas tomorrow deadly election disruptions in Afghanistan where a roadside bomb killed nearly a dozen civilians including several children two days a parliamentary elections got underway yesterday the first since twenty ten\nThe LA Dodgers and the Boston Red Sox will need to stay for game one of the world series the Dodgers knocking off\nThe Milwaukee Brewers last night this is Fox News [noise]\nThis is ...

physical weakness raised concerns for his health among friends family and associates that President needed arrest the chance to recuperate and regain his strengths\nAccordingly the president once again traveled to the little White House in Warm Springs Georgia with him when an entourage of friends and relatives FDR had first visited this health spa noted for its healing mineral water is Twenty one years earlier and an effort to find a relief for his paralyzed lower body\nRoosevelt looked forward to two weeks of relaxation\nAt one PM on April twelfth Nineteen forty five Roosevelt sat in the living room of his cottage surrounded by friends and family as he signed letters and documents an artist stood painting his portrait at an easel nearby the conversation was lively the atmosphere congenial\nThe president turned to the artist I'm reminded her that they had only Fifteen minutes left in the session\nSuddenly he grabbed his head complaining of a sharp pain the president was suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage that would end his life in men is America's longest serving president who had led the nation through the great depression and World War two was dead\nWell forget all that says Steve ... everything you think you know about half how FDR died is wrong Steve you baby joins me next on coast to coast they [noise]\nTake one atom of nitrogen and bonded with one atom of oxygen boom you just created nitric oxide a miracle molecule your own body makes that fills your cardiovascular health keeping you vibrant\nRight and he was also governor of New York lots of you know he was you know he was also governor of New York which is was has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah and it has happened that way through history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have um ... sort of I I think of George Bush a senior in trying to buy stocks in Kmart back in the er the remember that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man\nAnd there was a famous TV reporter he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know while he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nIt's funny how they live amongst us but they have no idea what the hell were about incredible really the ultra rich off during the training that people who just hit and they don't have any idea about us or what we do you know and sometimes I Wonder if they really want to put his faith and that does it\nRight All right if if the time to do is it's like they lived in the cloud spent ... happy not contracted polio\nUh he ... he may not have been well he may have been president but it's certainly changed the trajectory of his life that you would imagine it would but also he's politics talking about how polio affected FDR more than just physically\nWell I'll tell you what this is where I I gained a lot of a lot of respect but ah I was not necessarily you know the you know I'm not much of social it's personal\nBut you know when somebody comes down with him in power for relatives but the point where all the looters and they fight their way back\nUsing sure will um installing ... bars over over the bed so they can use their arms and dragging your body to try and get themselves to walk every day the ... when that happens to them you know the our ways uh\nStarted to you know obviously you know we'll be non treatments came in and actually work each day that you identify with people who are suffering and who are needy loses a gigantic flights a humble pie actually change of life\nRight I mean he displayed ... you'd have to call it of heroism or in the face of this uh this disease I mean he basically dragged he's he he had a hunch is Iran's but he would drag himself from miles\nYeah every day he had this regimen that um you know he had the bars and stalled out in front of the Roosevelt mansion and he would\nActually in these races and he would use crutches lately with him it's just incredible but it it you know twelve pounds of steel on each leg and he was dragging and solve it is\nIncredible but it it you know twelve pounds of steel on each leg and easy dragging himself if he did a parallel bars where he's exercising the bombs that and then from the parallel bars the closest route ... in front of a A R\nAnd then he was turning around and dragging himself back ... you know quote unquote walking trying to fix stops and you know I mean if this is talk about it quite well in the unit that was that was a was really something else or if they\nDo want to come back that\nFar and then of course he ended up in Warm Springs Georgia where the warm\nWaters with cheapest wage in my job and then other people with other collections of bachelor ill you have to act as life to identify with people in need and suffering\nSo it really changes what for sure\nAnd then there's the fast track or to the White House I'm just sort of ... we we we we've got about five five minutes before we head into the break at the bottom of the hour but let's just give me instead of a a thumbnail sketch of the of his\nJourney to the White House or does it start with Governor of New York or is it under secretary of the navy\nInstruct for the White House started ... or ... Wilson a turtle huddle house actually who Woodrow Wilson was his idol colonel house was Woodrow Wilson's well he didn't know what if the time that he was a it was it was a hostile employing\nAnd um they were ... it's all in love with this communist ideal and um you know of course they didn't know anything about it but it was just sort of rate than\nIt was through at um ... house and I'm\nI'm a geologist and actually that was that in just from secretary in the navy and from there and some of the user Roosevelt million and that the political connections in New York to run for governor and then once governor I'm you know it was a\nIt was a jump to the White House one\nAnd they asked them to come out of the time when a ... some of the things that I Want it to do\n'em over want it to do but you know he would call that I hate to hang a cooperating\nVery well with a with a ... or some of those were his ideas and now we don't have to jump right to a jump right to the White House and\nYou know start at the he originally ran on tax cuts and everything and we realized that those that old isn't working you completely flip and when you know with a socialist kind of it\nAnd uh you know for ... and you become like country suffering so\nRight well we'll get into the the new deal in the depression and and and so forth and and the fact that it will do this after the break but I just wanted to mention the idea that someone in a in a confined to a wheelchair or and it had a such a debilitating disease polio\nOr for that person to to rise to the White House at a time when as you point out in who murdered FDR at a time when\nA physical handicap like this was also also equated with sort of ... of mind and how\nWould that would I guess the complicity of the media that sort of agreed you know to not talk about it he never would have been president\nYou know it's amazing the parallels he made a very cooperative very sympathetic maybe he'll just like you know well now a [laughter] just like today without whether I Know it's like well opposite in prison for\nSure [laughter] absolutely lost in ... when he gets a free pass\nToday without whether they plop preaching\nShort [laughter] stab theloop hair loss if he gets a free pass to\nBe a between these two guys will have to talk about when you get back on it which all history basically just repeating repeating itself\nWith the Russians and the White House and you know just all kinds of things it's incredible uh way back when they get out\nKnown known catches with you know they felt the hell\nBut how is it sets a that no one sort of you know notice store or saying hey wait a minute our president is gonna is in a wheelchair or he can barely walk is he equipped you know this is thinking back then obviously we know better now but\nThe idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago um that no one would take notice of that\nWell they they they pick their camera shots well and actually I paid ... people for time of the day that this was a guy who said\nHe would get really think I'm horrified thought processes at one it's a really really really tough job when you do is be like without someone one arm he will leave the room and help but look at your pain or something at the time he would appear to be walking\nPicket couple of steps so they take it I guess you know buying podium use a little bit different than the shops and you know they they do remarkably well so they did it or to ward off the fact\nThat in case anything do you\nEat painting a search jumping to Republican claim that you know five ... so it was shown in for X amount of hours so I mean good propaganda and all those oils were Walsh anything back then you know it's just that\nThe media was smaller and easier to control I just ... we didn't have other things you know cell phones and cameras on the phones and you know they could get why they're good at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which is seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but ... the kind of cheated that a little bit\n[laughter] yeah absolutely the um\n... like this is complicated I I'm only to strike the toy amendment had changed debate in which the president was going to be sworn in from march until January\nSo we didn't go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that Roosevelt had to wait to take office for or acts but so\nThis mystery thing all the hundred days and they still judge presidents way way up a hundred days I'm at the table in the hundreds it was because of pitching\nRight Adam for

FDR is ... is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him\nAnd uh he certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in it you know horrible devastating depression like fifty percent unemployment and the banking system failed and it's just sent paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad or you know the president preceding Hoover had Orange County going and of course and reading and remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things were starting to where it started\nServing to be able to afford luxuries and the country but Hoover got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise your taxes and put some regulations on in here that fast\nAnd uh you know so here comes FDR in ... says there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering\nSo he has a says slow region of legislation a in a you know in order to help these people in or so he thought and he did he did a great deal of hell for a lot of people we put people to work and it was on the government or the government pay check and um this\nWas the ... experiment from the communists the communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp in Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through a as friends\nAnd the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you're on the study or and so this was their idea\nOf how to help the workers in the working class and it was a flood of legislation or were they\nJust basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen\nFDR regulated it at that point everything from farms to banking food to securities act and all points in between so this was done to put every once in a work on the government do so we could have\nThis cradle to grave wonderful society that style and and the Soviets had\nKnow fooled us into thinking existed new ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we're going to escape the or the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all this new wonderful\nPeaks and valleys of capitalism I think you meant the I think he's the communism ...\nI'm Sorry about that I hear the noise the pitfalls and valleys in ... of of of capitalism you know so right\nYou ... if I might you because you you are you you print the list of legislative uh um actions that were enacted a in\nIn who murdered FDR let me just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy acted beer wine revenue act\nOf creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief jak agricultural adjustment act emergency far mortgage jak Tennessee Valley authority acts securities act aggregation of gold payment class homeowners look lone act\nGlass Steagall banking act national industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act and the farm credit act um and he I mean he did this really without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ran that through I wasn't going to bore everybody with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I Will not that\nI'm happy to bore them with your show [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was right out of almost like the communist manifesto that\nStalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it ... it certainly was the same basic control he was carrying just like Stalin style and just Persia all of his enemies you know if you got nowhere style and you know you ended up that his first two wives his doctor who told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either disagree with America challenging politically\nAnd that kind of Stalin did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worried you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know a weary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent\nThat he thought okay so well all of this was\nGoing on in Europe is great wars ... you know he's seen lots of Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it so if this was a great a second new deal must be better so\nUm and they start to put a you know implement and then the second new deal and they start to realize that substantial portions of it were unconstitutional so the um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get it passed and that was\nI mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean a tremendous amounts\nAnd I know in the history books\nHistory books say a lot of things are I Know the history books paid him as this wonderful magical genie of or economic success he wasn't there was an economic failure people were ah they were surviving and that was about it\nThat was about all they were doing and the you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services\nWhere were you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean it was it was a it was a cat us it was a ... because I asked her feet\nHow do you use the training with the enemy act or to to to gain more power lend lease there's music playing the you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\n[noise] [noise] well [laughter] again when he did was that was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the Senate was the same thing with the with the lend lease program he was moving you know munitions and goods and services to the to the to defeat the access powers\nAnd he was given to the to our allies you know free France included and eventually this the Soviet Union\nSo that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time so there's a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started or he had to do that because he started to realize the new deal is not working so there was\nA there was a lot going on economically in in our country and then there came to a point\nWhere he knew that we had to get into this war and the spies indeed\nAnd you know we have spies too I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries have it I'm more you have spies to our spies in Germany\nWere starting to tell us they're finishing your heavy water experiments and with the beats who rockets to carry the nuclear weapons to all for it to the globe we'd be speaking German right now I mean they were on the brand\nSo we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nToo in the book you argue as many as a man that that NPR New Japanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um then the question is did he get he sort of make it happen\nIt's sort of glad it happened\nYou know I I say in my book that I think that the I was probably the greatest war president we ever had and that's because he just loved war\nHe did everything to make World War two happened and I might catch flak for that but you know what the words too bad it's true All right um the Japanese were there an oil debtor nation

post war world\nA instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still looks pretty robust or you know he you know by by standard to Nineteen forties he was an older guy by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I wanted to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards because deathbed confessions come out diaries or published a you know with a documents were declassified and then you can really go back\nAnd really and that's what I like to do um some people right to make friends I write to solve murders a call me crazy so you can really go back in pieced together the snippets of of what was going on so I'm the decay inspiring with the Nazis firing\nA was a large aspiring American history thirty three members and that they were over here to assassinate and sabotage anything if they get their hands on um operation Pistorius' uh was another Nazis firing eight members are that are created after Pearl Harbor\nOr they attacked Jillian targets and has a state and they were all caught and I leave with\nEach one of them except for one seven of them got the electric chair one got Thirty years in prison because he flipped on the other ones did they ever get close to Roosevelt\nOh yeah absolutely they did but Stalin was closer Stalin had infiltrated so much Roosevelt Roosevelt's I'm White House it was it was incredible so this is it this is what I was saying about the parallels to modern day\nAnd people think oh this was Seventy some odd years every five years or whatever what have you\nOh this you know this was all history is not all his readers repeating itself okay so here we have in the White House again I'm Roosevelt was basically screwing everything in the White House and here we have another another president who's accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House\nAnd uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communist completely and frustrated at the White House\nAnd we'll talk about that ensured on the road and here we go again here's Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating is White House\nSo he'll give me an example of give me an example in in Roosevelt White House of some of the communist that had he's here\nWho are the first communist that overhead as there was a Monday house which was um a Woodrow Wilson's\n'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth they came that were involved in um FDR's White House\nThere were there were hundreds of them at least Fifteen high ranking officials and half the White House winnowing communist starting with Harry Dexter why all the way through the elder us\nAnd they were in all kinds of different uh and also Harry Hopkins which turned out later he was fingered in Nineteen Ninety you know talk about Harry Hopkins of the er at length later so they don't get bored and go away it's more common [laughter]\nUm the or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated in the following places that I could find the agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's office the department of state the national labor relations board the labor advisory board\nOr the war productions board the price administration the U.S Treasury Department [laughter] U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee\nSo I won't bore you on with the laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were you know who were in that list or who are high ranking officials in those are in that list of of people so I mean he was just\nCommunists were all around them Harry Hopkins actually it was the HHS secretary of state he was one of the architects of the new deal it was one of FDR's closest friends in confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know I obviously\nEvery every I couldn't travel very well because of his affliction and you know the racist in a wheelchair and so far so we had to have someone fly over to talk to Stalin and so forth\nAnd uh that person was Harry Hopkins um who's Harry Hopkins actually was ... ah friends of Eleanor Roosevelt 'em through the\nCPU essay the Communist Party United States of America which is still in existence by the way I mentioned that or not and how the Hopkins is down and get on\nFamously he was actually ... Harry Hopkins as time went by he was also architect could lend lease program to help the Soviets out\nSo Harry Hopkins ... famously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming the waters in America before all of this happen okay I'll get to that in a minute or he was Harry Hopkins afterwards fire afterwards was fingered\nBy a KGB the factor and I'm going to butcher this name 'em all they grew up skiing and there's a name here I just simply couldn't even begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB the factors they both identified\nHarry Hopkins is the mysterious agent Nineteen who is contacting a Soviet Union about uh the the than on a project\nWhich of course we all know is a nuclear weaponry\nSo here we have I mean there are informants and spies all around the\nFDR so so the point where they he goes to the wrong conference you know I mean I feel a style and knows more about Roosevelt then Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt\nAnd they're meeting at these conferences it was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were uh at the hands of a an ... weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him\nStalin writer information he writes he had plans in the post war world of taking America was half communist anyway he had plans of taking over America and making them a full communist country with him as a ruler so he was a little diluted in his own in his own right\nBut how this all happened was\nPrior to this of course this was a new ideology communism while this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this and that and you know we don't have to go to work in every word is provided for\nPatients to um to the directors of Hollywood a union leaders are college professors he knew the target and they would were sent invitations all expense paid to go over to Russia\nTo see how this this work and they went to a city in the city's names escaping it ... it is are listed in my book\nIn the they were to observe how Russia did things and how everyone was care for how this work and how terrific it was and look at what we've done and you need to do this to your country has your you know look at you look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities town was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how they tried to recruit anyway you had loudly\nSo it was a fictitious found that didn't exist there was made it hard work basically\nSo they can village a Potemkin village and there you go um\nHe sends all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country meaning our country and to this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil umpires you know in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings in the spring party by style and spelling is the puppet master he uh he's this guy what he managed to accomplish in his wife\nWas incredible he was one of the six original members of the votes of the revolution\nAnd he ended up there just to make fun of style and\nHe was nothing more than a he was to keep the party journals and use the column\nComrade um

Steven you hold on okay\nI Am I'm just trying to get over the story of the uh the girl they their grandfather's ashes and the cookies she wants to she was on to the gray Persian the famine in Russia under Stalin\nAnd what's really going on Rick her or anybody you know [laughter] yeah well\nIt never ceases to amaze uh when I just wanted to check in with you because people need to know it's you know you're on the east coast it's three forty in the morning and the three hours is a long stretch to talk so I just want to make sure you're you're doing OK and we appreciate you being here with us and staying up\nLate so I'm I wanted to talk about you know so much of the post world are so much of the post war world is a result and then then the ensuing Cold War and and all of that\nReally is a result of FDR's frail condition\nHe's greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference and you also\nIn forty four when\nThe hours frail condition he's greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference in ... forty four when when that post war world was really carved up and style and obviously you know took advantage he seized upon\nRoosevelt spray all condition or and and um FDR really didn't know what happened do you just was so out of it but\nI mean you you look at those pictures of FDR at the the conference and obviously he's ... he looks like death warmed over like seven months before at the Tehran Conference he looks is as fit as a federal I mean ... what is going on with what happened in those seven months\n[laughter] well up until this point we've been talking about the bond that we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with them um every hour as being slowly poisoning\nFrom within the White House and I have\nTo be very careful here not to give this book away but it was a type of toys and let's see what are you thinking of America is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and what they were poisoning with with something that was\nPlentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet but\nThe rest of the world certainly did Europe certainly did some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older so in certain situations they hit a jump on us\nAnd you know I don't think grandpa Walton would've known anything about\nPoisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially 'cause they didn't know it was poisonous at the time so\nFDR as being slowly poisoning from inside the White House every time he goes away\nToo Warm Springs Georgia to sow his ailing legs and go on a retreat so he can mentally and physically rejuvenate himself he starts to get stronger every time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or so you know I I did a little digging into this because\nIt was just so what started me on this whole thing of FDR I thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient\nThat in the tiny march at Eighteen days\nA Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini had all died conveniently at the end of the war I thought that was a little convenient\nSo this is what people actually it would just start looking into this for this and that I also thought it was all convenient that FDR just died of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's bunker I thought that was a little to get a little bit convenient so [noise]\nAnd when I started to dig in and I saw that the the odd deterioration of this president during this time period\nI said you know wait a minute I really got to look into this I didn't believe it in high school when we were taught about it back then they actually taught history\nYou know I mean [laughter] anybody in the book you point out how his his doctors\nI guess Dr uh mcentire admiral a navy admiral mcentire his personal physician and his his cardiologist Dr Howard ruin\nThey were they had no idea what was going on and they were doing X rays and take doing all of these tests they were really clueless\nWell and this is where you know this is where the rubber finally starting to meet the road for me they really work for what they were thinking the American public just thought oh he ... himself out for us and you know he was the advance of polio and this and that and the other thing and\nThe symptoms of the his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors emmer Ross McIntyre who's the White House physician he was also the vice admiral and in a surgeon surgeon general of the navy\nUm you know he was FDR's physician from thirty to forty five until he died\nA surgeon surgeon general of the navy um you know he was FDR's physician from thirty to forty five until he died a Dr Howard Bruins was a commander in the navy a course FDR's a navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors\nOr he was chief of cardiology emphasize though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy no idea [noise] so what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so baffled as because FDR is getting sick after meal times\nThis is my first hand something was wrong in his blood pressure would bounce he would do normal and then it would go it would go warring out of control three ten over one Ninety five or something and it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying very hard\nTo every any it wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything that they were giving him\nSo when when they when they\nGot to this point they said look at you know Nineteen forty four is rolling around this guy's going to run for president again again and we've got to get to the bottom of what the hell's going on here so they sent him to the doctor of the day Dr frankly\nFounder of the lead clinic in Boston and he's a surgeon and he is the guy\nIn America at the time [laughter] so he examines after the march in Nineteen forty four\nAnd um when he comes out was is a ... a glaring statement which is now available online you can look it up at the History Channel basically saying that this is a dead man walking\nAnd do what he the laundry list of the symptoms that he reveals that FDR has does not align with the advance of polio\nThey advance they align with the advance of poisoning FDR as being slowly poison styling Stalin guide them I can tell you that I'm\nStyling wants FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar confidence because he wants to rule the world\nAfter yard he wanted to set up the for policemen of the world um the United states Great Britain China in the Soviet Union so they could all police there are a quarter of the world\nFDR didn't want to share of the world with uncertain Stalin didn't want to share the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world\nHe was a megalomaniac look at what he didn't Soviet Union of course we didn't know that then it wasn't wasn't you know reveal to us until years later\nWho died that was part of the negotiation team in the U.S [laughter] on the way back from the all time or one of Roosevelt aids died conveniently also on the brain in your in\nBut there are people dropping dead around FDR of rain any resumes all over the place that no one writes about again no one writes about this or his name was pile Watson and he was a high ranking naval officer he was on the way like I Believe from that surround conference dies on this ship of a cerebral hemorrhage\nHe gets back he being FDR he gets back a short time later I'm FDR's\nSecretary also\nIn a Mac and talking to relation to the doctor Ross McIntyre he dies of\nHis cerebral hemorrhage the drug of the day is worth ... rat poison\nAnd its colorless tasteless voter lists and its circulating\nAll over the place as a matter of fact styling got murdered or the rat poison or offering them in from the internal ... governor that came out later as well so there's a lot going on war friend is not what got FDR would have been to sudden\nIs it is governor that came out later as well so there's a lot going on war friend is not what got FDR would have been to sudden it would have thrown up too many red flags okay style wouldn't want it to deal with Harry Truman he wanted to deal with Harry Truman 'cause he wasn't as political\nSavvy or so he thought", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city":
