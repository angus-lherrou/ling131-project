let's start from the beginning he was a vibrant young man what happened\nYes for Ralph was a vibrant young man with no\nMedical history whatsoever was admitted to the University of Missouri Kansas City prestigious six year bachelor degree empty program were children graduate and six years with a BA in an empty [noise]\nAnd after completing the first year that program he got food poisoning [noise]\nWent to a hospital in Kansas City it was administered very controversial drug by the name of ... gland Ari G.

both physical and mental condition\nBegan to deteriorate and there are many many many cases of this that can be found on the Internet\nAnd when you see it begin to deteriorate physically and mentally did you notice the change with him\nAbsolutely within a day or two he and one of his medical school room mates had done research\nAnd the changes I noticed or his anxiety began to increase he began to complain of strange pains that he had never had before and this began a slow deterioration that I Would call something like this doing this whole lot of the human body\nAnd at this point rough took his life\nOver the course of a early in twenty Seventeen he was I brought him back home to St Louis and he made three attempts on his life\nTo take themselves out of this horrific condition that was bringing him intense pain and from what I understand the form of anxiety times a hundred [noise] um\nAnd that was bringing him intense pain and from what I understand the form of anxiety times a hundred a man on his last attempt tea was successful and um I did hold his hand and was there and he passed away\nHow old was he Johnson he was twenty [noise] and how did he take his life\nHe tried with two other attempts that were unsuccessful\nBut on the last attempt a he used a gun and at that time I wasn't there he sent me a text that really began the marketing of a year but the text came to me at exactly eleven eleven\nAnd that's where we are going to talk about tonight the ... that have occurred for you especially after this tragedy occurred I mean I remember being in St Louis when I heard about this\nAnd it was a it was shocking situation for anybody to have to go through a ... it it is my biggest nightmare of course as a parent\nTo lose your trial before before you go and uh I could only what you were going through at the time with this kind of pain but the synchronous cities then started so tell us a little bit about the name Institute and the twenty two which is the name of your book\n[noise] I I looked at that tax George again and again and again and in some way I've found solid and connecting with that last tax\nAnd as I began to stare at it again and again it occurred to me eleven eleven well Ralph was born on two twenty two [laughter] and so the number twenty two began to resonate with me a firm that was the beginning point I Would say of that resignation\nI Want to tell our audience this little sacred a city here when I was talking with Jonathan several weeks ago about this situation in his book and of course the tragedy that occurred now you mentioned that you don't use his son roles\nUm was a you know just a delightful young guy and he's used to name Gabriel of course uh you took that name as well did you not\nI did Ralph middle name was Gabriel and so I changed my middle name to Gabriel I felt the universe and that one is and doing that it was symbolic was spiritual and um brought me significant meaning\nAnd on and I was talking to Jonathan and I said to my dad's name was ... and uh you know he was born on February twenty seconds which is the same date that Ralph was born in these weird synchronous if you started coming up all over again in ... in everything else\nDo you believe that your son is Cindy ... messages Jonathan through these strange occurrences\n[noise] I I Do believe that I I've always been a rational analytical regimented person in in my personal life in my profession and Avi aiding [noise]\nAnd with the pain of what happened\nIt began to open up my thought process and I said wait a minute\nThere's just got to be more and I took down the wall of what was my personal rationality and began to read I began to study a I've been studying the ancient ... text in Hebrew I've looked through other religions and mystical world\nAnd I do believe that the in finance\nIs communicating with me\n[noise] what message do you think Ralph is trying to pass on to you what does she\nIs communicating with me\n[noise] what message do you think Ralph is trying to pass on to you what does he want you to know\n[noise] I find comfort in knowing that he's letting me know that the existence of him has not the best life on earth for him has seized but the existence in the cosmic soup if you will\nDoes not stop [noise]\nAnd that has brought me tremendous comfort\nI I I was going to say you must you in a very strange way of course to give you the kind of comfort to know that his existence continues that he's out there somewhere [noise]\nAh in trying to get you little messages every once in a while now just to make you aware that you know hey Dan I'm here\n[noise] [noise] well you know it it hasn't been always once in a while sometimes it's a little more frequent uh about two weeks

touched it it always keeps the correct time ten days ago\nI woke up I put on the watch I got in the car I went to work at my watch was twenty two minutes by all I had to look at it a few times but it was twenty two men and\nDo you get behind the car and you look in a license plate and you see twenty two there to do these numbers pop up all over the place\nYou know they do pop up to me and at times I think they're popping up and at times I think they're not coincidences so I really created a word for myself out of coincidences I'm calling them coincide and says\nBecause as it on a recent trip to Los Angeles and I'm thinking a lot about him and hotel I check into and they hand me a key and I walk up to the room and the room number is to twenty two\nJeeze random they just give it to you correct

with us again his website in the need to twenty two dot com linked up the coast to coast am dot com we're talking about his latest work called in for twenty two about the life of his son roped into synchronous cities that have occurred since rough tragically passed on\nJonathan I Know how tough this was for you when this tragedy occurred how're you doing now\n[noise] well George I'm definitely doing better [noise]\nOne of the things that's really helped me to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the Internet and in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings have this ability\nBut I think of the brain as the infinite zone\nAnd I think of the body as the finite zone and for\nThe anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body and so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite and so in meditative thought and then thinking to higher levels of\nThat ability and the infant its own where each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat did you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\n[noise] I have to say that I I question that I didn't think about it much\nAnd ever since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nNone of the goals really didn't get to the second is three strange occurrences that want to go through each one and if you explain to us what happened tell us about the drivers which what happened there\nSo about eight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem\nWith it tell anybody you want and he looked at me and a very strange stare and said\nI'll just tell them Ralph set it look and I looked at him\nHe said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said\nNo she how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head [laughter]\nI Love that about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\n[laughter] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and say we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nGets timing in secret and then you had the courage with some strange lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights and I was leaving in the house was empty\nAnd the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me during the lights back\nWith the light switch back down and put it back up put it back down and they went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off\nAnd at that time I left the house and just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\nIt was a point where you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise] um [noise] I don't I don't fault Tam I\nHave struggled to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shielded themselves from any and all liability from every American citizen\nWell they're they're protected by law I think\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJohnathan which was roles subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\n[noise] no\nWell the kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student ah frequently making jokes he was just if you ask his friends they would portray just the most honest I'm likeable young man you could you could think of\nNot to go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stand to take some stuff uh you know they go to the bathroom as often as they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the hospital I\nI think I think he was vomiting profusely there was a lot of blood out with his friends who were all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that cool\n[noise] well I got the call after the medication had been given to him about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOh okay let's go to some culture for your job let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington questions story Hi Patty\nHi uh I've I've got a little story and I hope it's relevant to this synchronous cities that I think I've got more and then you can shake a stick at\nUm it started with my son ah who incidentally was taken away from me when he was born we somehow managed to to make a connection\nThat we could look back for each other on that he was born on my birthday three minutes apart from the

P. Morgan adding one million ounces to their stockpile of a hundred and thirty three million ounces\nAnd last time we talk to you told us about China's plans to build huge solar farms which could spike silver demand we also talked about California being the first state to require new homes to have solar are there other states\nMany are in the process but the latest trend is community solar what's that\nThat's where cities install solar panels and homeowners share the power Minnesota's doing this and if it's successful the program to the community solar expand nationwide even globally\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year oh no it's not even close to a quarter Liberia it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light gays from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border as\nWell why is it that made you an astronomer realize that something ten times the mass of earth could be there and the first plane\nHit the clue that there is another planet out in the solar system\nReally came from looking at the very most distant objects that are in orbit around the sun well beyond Pluto they travel extreme distances and all these ones that are this far away all sweep off in one particular direction and there's no reason they should\nThey should be randomly around the sky the fact that they're all off in this one direction you\nCan only be explained by the presence of a planet that's perturbation their orbits and keeping them piled up in that direction\nAnd that what they knew had lined in October of twenty Eighteen are about is one of the smaller objects that's being swept off my whatever the massive look called planet nine that you discovered in twenty sixteen\nThat's exactly right although I don't use the word discovered yet I Would say we proposed the planets and when we see it it will have been discovered\nWhat do you use any two people who ask questions about rogue planet and they ... through the ... Marion and all of that because it does come up a lot\nWhat exactly are rogue planet how can a planet me lung during in the universe between sellers distancing galaxy\nThere certainly are fees wandering planets rogue planets and they come about from the same sort of reason that we think that planet nine is out there they certainly formed around a star just like our planet stood and then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other\nAnd one of them got tossed out\nThe smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one\nAnd in our case we think that that happened to planet nine but planet nine didn't get tossed quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge\nBut if if it had gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter it could have been completely injected from our solar system in which case it would just be wandering through space and so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's no question about it\nWhen people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that there is a giant planet that's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and\nThings like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracy stuff that actually makes no sense\nGeneral world audience why something NASA like a planet cannot sneak up on earth in the inner planets with out every astronomer on for knowing\nIf something like number I don't know what's the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally over to headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system [noise]\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize\nIf it were really coming it would be so bright\nThat you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming you wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping it secret\nAnd you would have been visible to every backyard astronomer with the telescope for the past decade and it would have been visible to every professional astronomer for the past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know anywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world is\nSomething ten times the mass of our earth where even out past Pluto out in the ... what would be the obvious observation all changes perturbation in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers in an apartment in the planets that we know of planet nine has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets and you can figure out why it's ten we actually think more like seven now seven times amounts of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun than the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so Jupiter has a tremendous effect on the planet is in the solar system\nAnd nobody sits around and there's worry that Jupiter is certainly going to come destroy us planet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter sort of it's a fact it's really minimal one effect that it does have is that over\nFour billion years is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planet but even that is just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii in November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible to talk with you in December about what you might find or you have to wait to do papers for\nThe way the process works as well go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks two a month to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month or two of collecting those data and then at that point we'll announce the existence as soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back to the telescope and double checked that it's really there\nAnd then will announce its existence right away so we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] January twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nIs possible I'm always very optimistic Constantine fatigue and my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it will take us another ten years I think it'll take us one year so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nThat habit during right from the ... the entire ... those ... and a half ago and body\nThe Oregon right from the man who discovered the uh in terms of those perturbations\nOf those half a dozen bodies that are all kind of gather together out where the guy prevailed in the uh or cloud in that area and I think one of the most important part of doing this research project with these scientists is that I had no confusion\nAbout the fact that if there was something massive\nThat when trying to move in to our solar system what it's called the inner solar system\nFrom a mercury the thought and mercury out to wear a now Neptune and you're on a star because Pluto is a been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hyper belt\nThat there's nothing they could be out coming this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity\nThat that's the thing about gravity in math and it it would have impact on every single thing and that's all\nThat's slowly I would've loved those ... been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if you would have been able to convince him about that new bureau\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own work that I had a discussion a face\nTo face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do it said that for conversations but Linda because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\nThat ... even if\nShe doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that there could be a massive planet but when you read let say about the ... through scholar and you do that translation that we're a carbon\nDone and you look at the carving the one thing that always is\nConfusing to me it's been talking about a Trump planet but in the can of form a loving guy\nTo hold on right there in the most comeback bullets finished that up in conversation [noise]\nNational debt relief has helped tens of thousands of people just like you reduce more than five

were back with Linda molten how whose story next we'll deal with climate change window\nYeah you know Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty eight when the world with really kind of waking up seriously for the first time to global climate change\nAnd real potential dire consequences in the future if we didn't get on top of the expanding methane and carbon dioxide\nBlankets around the earth and at the United nation\nMany countries especially the worry about being Ireland and we see level rise could flood and display population they came together to form the inter governmental\nPanel on climate change often known as the eye PCC any objective was to provide data about earth changes on an ongoing basis\nTo help project some of these impact on world politics and the economy\nBy twenty Fifteen only three years ago and the Paris Agreement on climate change\nMany small island nation were so worried about disappearing under ... rising sea levels that the eye can see the committed to doing a twenty Eighteen report written by Ninety One scientist from forty country\nThe question was hidden humans to restrict global warming two degrees Celsius or one point five degrees Celsius below pre industrial levels the October twenty Eighteen I ... the answer is\nStricter at one point five degrees Celsius equal to a to point seven degrees Fahrenheit ... the the new target to achieve and hold in place by twenty thirty that's only a decade from now it's right\nIf our planet continues to warm up above that limit of one point five degrees Celsius\nScientists warn that will be a catastrophe of math die off they will accelerate and the coral reefs and if they die that kills off other marine species dependent upon the coral weather will become more violent and wins flooding rains and devastating wildfires\nWeather extremes will cause famine and fighting over land food in freshwater\nAnd sea level rise will force more and more island and coast populations to move\nBut to where\nThe twenty Eighteen IPC reports that the next ten years between now and twenty thirty are crucial and in order to keep the one point five degrees Celsius limit nations must cut greenhouse gas emissions by almost half of what they were in twenty ten\nSolar wind and other renewable energy sources must replace\nAs much as sixty seven percent of today's electricity coal\nIt as an industry around the world it must be phased out\nThe coordinating lead author VIP see the report says quote\nThere's kind of a head in the sand mentality that has taken ... now in Washington which seems to pretend that this climate change threat does not exist\nBut this was widely knowledge in the defense community meaning the Pentagon as recently as three years ago and twenty Fifteen ...\nHe is professor drew Shen del PHD professor of earth sciences and the earth and sciences division at Duke University and he joins us now from Durham North Carolina\nCould you please give me the top five places in the United states where water is coming in and flooding is already making people move\nI Would say those or Florida Alaska and around the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia and Louisiana so those would probably be the top of the United states\nAnd where it would be the five top nations in the world that are now island and other places that are most impacted by sea level rise\nAround the world unfortunately all too many very low lying countries and that's a large part of why we have this new report those\nCountries want to the United nations to investigate a lower woman target thinking that\nTwo degrees was probably not sufficient to protect them those are most of the islands in the south Pacific also ... and the Indian Ocean many Caribbean countries\nAnd then there are very low lying countries like Bangladesh where the bulk of the population very close to level Nigeria has huge population you Roger she level but you know sodas most of the world and the United states also has an enormous populations right up the coast\nAnd where in Alaska\nIn Alaska you have an interesting problem where it's it's a combination of rising sea levels and melting ice and the ice protected the shorelines from the waves from the ocean\nAnd without the ice the wage can reach the shore and more easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels we saw a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the buried straight area many of them are already having to be evacuated and moved to higher ground\nSo it's not so much the north slope of the south and west coasts\nI Believe that the combination of federal and state governments\nAlready moving people in Alaska from flooding to higher ground yeah\nAnd he is that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina as well\nThere's not been so much evacuation of the coast there's been more what used to be rare flooding events that are now becoming quite common so I think that there is likely to have to be evacuations in the next couple of decades of at least some places\nThere's an island did not speak for example\nBetween Maryland and Virginia more than half of it was already going\nWe've seen the water come up through the drains skin to Charleston South Carolina and Virginia where nuisance flooding that went very rare as it comes so commonplace that governments have had to put a marker so that motorists can see how deep the flooding is it's so routine and Florida it's been some of the worst\nFlooding of streets in the southeast part of the state\nHas become fairly routine as he level rise has continued and we've seen an acceleration because both the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets are melting more rapidly than was expected just a decade ago and dump more water into the ocean unfortunately what we've been seeing\nOver the past several decades since we started to generate these projections from computer models and then watch the models has often been too conservative and things are happening faster than the models project\nCan you give an example of what has been dramatic compared to the computer model\nOne thing was the boss of sea ice in the Arctic it went like two or three times faster than the models project to\nYes the Arctic has melted two to three times faster than the computer's projected already by twenty Eighteen ... that a harbinger of the fact that it's likely the warming and melting ice will keep increasing faster like what happened in the Arctic\nWell we've been observing from satellite that melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating\nSo that is definitely a worry\nIt is extremely challenging problem to figure out exactly how this massive she might become de stabilized based on say melting from the top with water slipping down through cracks in the ice sheet and lubricating the dead below\nYou know when we were we because the warming has been so fast in the Arctic that the acceleration will continue\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty eight teen what would you prefer jak we will be seeing more dramatic weather events between twenty Eighteen and twenty thirty\nLess rainfall in the west increasing water scarcity greater probability of drought greater likelihood of high fire conditions\nAnd receive flooding in the east as you get more extreme heavy rainfall events and the more heat waves everywhere around the country\nAnd well even the heat extremes going up in metropolitan areas around the country so things like Chicago in the Nineteen nineties having a severe heat wave that killed thousands of people\nDestroy whatever as much as they can Donald Trump we have to defend that\nAnybody that pays any attention to the media knows it for the media is focusing on it and\nIn the last two and a half years just because they think

supposed to recall this information because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any sub text in your mind or your soul about who we'd be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it may because in my past experience with ever since I was a child I'd had psychic dreams\nDreams of having relationships with an entity\nThat was giving the instructions I can describe the entity to you as a very thin very white pale entity I couldn't see a face all I Know it would very skinny they'd had very long fingers\nHow many I don't know how many fingers that had it could have had five\nPretty skinny it hadn't very long fingers how many I don't know how many fingers that had it could have had five it could have had three I just remember one finger because I had the feeling that it was touching made with one finger energetic freaks me out in the rain I remember\nThe environment and being very luminous very white almost to wear id which squinting your eyes that I remembered that being the strangest thing about it I was standing before it it was sitting in a\nVery large thrown like chair but it was so then it seemed like a rope would've just dangling from mid air with Robie arms and it was just really creepy\n... you've had this as a repeating dream yes and\nThe ... that you were describing the extreme sadness is it possible that this very white being is in fact a reptile snake\nI got more that it was more like in in fact\nThan a snake because\nIt had a texture to it skinny this\nIt was like you know what a insect wings look like they're kind of transparent but you can feed those veins or whatever going through it when I Lived in Florida when I was a kid we lived there for a short time in Jacksonville\nAnd I was always outside and I loved collecting animals and things like that but there are a huge praying mantis as they would hang out on the bushes that stand that said those arms and the shape of its neck and its body\nAre you standing in front of this praying mantis light and are you standing in front of it and it is in some sort of a crouched are sitting position\nI wanted to say at the city position because by the this big huge thrown like chair that its feet it in it it's very very very large\nAnd so this is perhaps an eight foot tall praying mantis\nIt possibly could be\nAnything specifically coming into your head from it as you stand there\nI think I can smell it I think it smells like rotting wood or something to that nature like consented to the nose\nDo you have a sense that there's any kind of closing or garment\nNo I don't think there was any clothing\nAnd the caller that is the praying mantis in front of you\nVery pale almost like albino Gary pale\nAnd there are praying mantis who's that can be white ...\nI don't think I've ever seen one\nDo you see anything in the eyes\nI don't remember the ... it's almost as if I couldn't look at them I think I was terrified to look at them but I had a feeling that this entity was in ... something to me because I wasn't afraid\nIt was almost like it was giving the instructions very strange I don't remember a voice it was almost as if it would tell a path ethic\nAnd the the being the praying mantis essence seem to be glowing like a sure why\nIt wasn't glowing had modeled skin but it was Barry White you could tell that it had a lot of texture\nYou know if it was white it had like ... I Would say you know how they would be like model skin like someone who had struggles are almost like an albino salamander skin\nIt sounds like you're describing every Chilean skin\nAlmost like an albino salamander skin\nIt sounds like you're describing your roof Chileans skin not a praying mantis skin\nTexture was like that yeah\nBut the swarm was like a pre managed into\nThat's how I Would describe it because of the arms they were in ... and they were long but you could tell that they were joining could very strangely as I reach puberty I remember I started having a lot of glowing pain\nAt one point I did find a spot on my groin and it was like a puncture area that blistered I just had to ... that maybe they were doing something with me to recover sperm or something\nBased on everything that you have experience with the praying mantis well would you speculate could be coming further\nI think everything is speeding up now\nSomething is about to happen that's the feeling I get I get this feeling of urgency I get this feeling of it's too late to do anything about the current situation in something is coming to either fix it or maybe help China that I don't know\nBut whatever it was you would put into the category of something positive and protective\nI Do absolutely do I've had many drains over the past few years involving a lot of water mostly how does the water

last night Trump story well it is and things keep being well when they started with the issue\nOf uh I was asking\nPeople if they had had any kind of childhood out of body in the ages four to six a

twice\nThat led to my asking for a whether people had had these kinds of foggy white stuff\nAnd that led to Charles hazard and other even mailers who are saying that this is not the only person last night on my YouTube channel I had a dialogue with my audience\nAbout has anybody whether they were in a duck tape and experience or meditate or how they had any insights about water\nA lot of water affecting the planet between now and twenty twenty six\nAnd that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower science we said that uh he had worked on a project having to do with this exact\nA real whistle blower science with that that\nUh he worked on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six\nIn which there could be some either a natural cycle or something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that there's going to be like a shift or a jolt\nAnd that it would cause the nominees in tremendous amounts of flooding\nAnd I had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them\nAbout exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle interacting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is what that is written about in genesis\nAnd that is how ... and and a complex all seem to be going that every single question is leading to answer that people are raising more issues and scientists are all for coming forward and saying that they have information about this\nAnd so tonight if there's anybody listening on coast\nIf you are in the military government whistle blower category or human abducted category and you have any information\nDo we look back and talk and\n\nThen we'll go back into ... and how we talk about the strange encounter Linda\nYes if you Google UFOs in ancient paintings\nSeveral dozen images and websites will emerge looting\nA Fifteen sixty one eighty would cut found in Nuremberg, Germany\nIt depicts so large black sword shaped aerial vehicle in the sky were colorful aerial spheres cylinders and rod surrounded illustration of the

jelly beans with wings and to odd oval shaped aerial vehicles each containing a human like figure\nThey're being on the right side of the crucified Christ seems to be looking back from his craft to

retired us air force staff sergeant named Tony guy he also sent me his duty to fourteen to prove his military background we drive included at the end of my earth files news report tonight\nThis email contained a life experience that he wrote up for me in titled quote\nThe experience that made me a believer that we are not alone\nAnd it began Hi Linda my name is Tony I Would like to tell you about something that I saw as a black child I Am fifty seven now but at the time that the incident I was four or five years old in Nineteen sixty five Nineteen sixty six\nI was in my bed one night and I had woke up and could not go back to sleep\nHere now from Winston Salem North Carolina to tell his own voice was stunned him as a child and haunted him to this very day is retired us air force staff sergeant Tony guy\nI Lived in Dayton, Ohio I was about four years of age I live with my mother\nThe guy outlived in Dayton, Ohio\nI was about four years of age\nI live with my mother and she had a best friend that she waited two bedroom apartment my mother had two children\nAnd my mother's friend had two children\nAnd we were all about the same age it's a two bedroom apartment and it's two levels you have to go up the stairs to get to the two bedrooms and bathrooms\nAnd I was in my bed sleeping along with my brother and two other kids and I woke up in the middle of the night I have trouble going back to sleep and not just they earn in a dark\n... go back to sleep so I decided to get up out of bed and I went to the window\nAnd I was just looking out the window and it was very quiet but I didn't hear any cars that's how I knew\nIt was very late at night 'cause I didn't hear your cargo by so I'm looking around and I happened to look up look up in the sky you know just looking around because it was really nothing to see but that grassy field in between the apartments\nAnd so I look up and I see a light apply light in the sky a suit was on an airplane that same light that I was looking at because it was the only thing in the sky I notice\nSomething was coming down there by the time my notes it may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground the light that I was looking at came down it was an or\nWhat I noticed about it was one half of it was so white collar and the other half of it was neon green color you know like the glow sticks that you see at the concert when they had to close the extent are neon green glow sticks right\nIt look like that and I was saying to myself this looks like a perfect circle but it's a little all is if you cut the perfect circle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nA little lighter in the middle then it wouldn't be any that were perfect circle\nYeah and I noticed that word it to light met in the middle the straw white light in the lime green light there was no bleed over you could clearly see where the neon green ended in assault white began and this object it looked to be as thin as a balloon\nWhen you say he was like a balloon you mean that in the surface was translucent and you could see through it\nYeah I could clearly see through it it was no metal nothing like that it was more like a seafood balloon so the and it's like you're looking at a seafood for long and what are you seeing\nWhat I'm seeing is a person standing inside the fall white part wearing like down and he's looking up\nHe's just standing there looking up like he's looking up into the bars I don't know what he's looking at but I could clearly see this and I'm saying to myself look at that that is a person can keep in mind I'm no more than twenty five to thirty feet from is is that\nThe only reason I didn't climb out the window that night was because I was like if you knock out the screen and go down there you\nGo on a beach [laughter] you know\nWhat I was like man I wanted to go but I'm going to be nearby do this you know I Know she is but I just didn't understand it the key is the significance

my imagining it are my crazy but then you start hearing stories like what we're hearing the news now and you know that the corpses of these babies I mean how long\n\nWere these bodies in the ceiling a vis a vis mortuary\nAnd then there were thirty eight other bodies the world we knew we may had names on the cascades but no one no one in ... they weren't very they were just rotting in this in this mortuary\nThe bodies were running in the adult bodies were rotting in the basement and there were baby corpses in the ceilings were mummified\nIn Detroit and\nThe reason why they found them was because this guy this entrepreneur wanted to make this funeral home area into a community center\nAnd show they they shut it down but they were also breaking the rules so they you know the state didn't have a problem shutting displaced down but I got to make something out of a horror film\n\nComing out of a horror film and then these girls it'll be go to school to bring in golf with every butcher knives they bring everything and they're waiting in the bathroom for their classmates in one by one\nGirls you know they go to school they bring in ... butcher knives they bring everything and they're waiting in the bathroom for their classmates and\nOne by one they plan to kill them and one by one they plan to drink their blood and one by one they planned to eat their flesh these are two middle school girls\n\nAnd they said they worship the devil now how is the how was it they were turned on to this what was the influence where do they influence come from and why is it now which is I mean it was it was just you know we we were talking about this parasitic\nEvil is parasitic evil that you know\nThat they can be a part of everyone's life the once you allow yourself to be infected\n\nYou know if you allow yourself to be infected and you allow whatever it is to get in and you know when I had a ... when we were on the other night talking\nAbout the the parasitic evil okay we were talking about that the other night I didn't even get to half of what I wanted to talk about and the reason why was because of the fact that it was just there were just so many things or\nYou know and ... you know was on the show so many things that we didn't cover so many things that he wanted to talk about so many things you know we're talking about mental disorders and possessions you know that there's a fine line it's not always obvious in in many cases I mean medicine claims they okay it's ... it's psychosis and of course spiritual realms tell you that you could be possess\n\nBut in the in the ancient writing so I get them outta smile at the car and which is this which is hammering\nThe Catholics added and all these other you know books they said that vampires and we're ... we're in effect part of some blood disorders some blood disease then they had no idea what it was and this is where we got the vampire legend is from\n\nThe empire legends are are basically we all beliefs that blood\nBlood was the life blood Gabe live any blood was tainted blood tainted blood would eventually create a profane remnant creature\nOf empire\nAnd not only that there was this like there was just like a or the chemical\n... using a blood and of course seeming or or it's a fluid of life\nWas going hand in hand\nSo whenever they said do not lose your virtue what they were tired of eyes do not lose your blood do not give your blood to anyone hold your blood to you\nDo not to file someone else with your seaman or your seed that is because that is part of

about how the worms enter into the mind and what they have led to or things like the final solution the strengthening of the strain parasitic evil where we wait for the wording to turn on the showers and fire up the up and the darkness prevails is the word was manifesting in mind when a person intentionally tried to destroy the body or the mind\nIt tends to open a pathway that invites a position

they want to please\nDemonic guts\nAnd the knowledge of all of the beans have been suppressed by the church is they just narrowed it down to one and that seats and but there's something more\nAnd

you doing\nI'm good thank you so it's been a strange year I mean there's ... there have been so many stories that does is certainly a [noise] I guess we're being in the realm of\nNot necessarily paranormal but that terrifying when it comes to the dead when it comes to children were influenced to\nGo into schools and wait for their friends to come into the bathroom so they can kill them and drink their blood and I'm sure there are many other things that you're aware of in the news what do you think it's happening I mean it's not necessarily part of the empire culture but we're seeing a lot of people acting out and uh how do you explain that\nYou know it's it's been at it\nTrue but we're seeing a lot of people acting out and uh how do you explain that\nYou know it's it's been a busy here for a lot of things and people have been fairly unhinged so that doesn't really surprised me\nSo it is you're you're saying this is a this is a B will being on him there's a bit you know usually you know the the the whole vampire idea\nIs not that people just go out in and pounce on others uh what's going on the vampire lifestyle is that it's it's more discreet am I right [noise]\nWell I think I have discussed this before I I'm not really involved in the vampire lifestyle that uh I'd I'd say that it doesn't really surprised me that this sort of thing is going to crop up when with these girls when\nAll the adults around them are acting like lunatics and I in this at least in America things have been a kind of mad\nThat you say you don't live the vampire lifestyle but you are of empire right you you do drink blood human\n... yes yes and of course those two are very different things\nOkay so what is the difference then so we can I just want to make it clear for everybody's way better understanding and I'm sure that's why you're here on the show was bringing a better understanding here to the table so what is the difference between the vampire lifestyle and being a vampire per se\nUm well I'd say that they're dramatically different because the vampire lifestyle is generally about effect Haitian and fashion right and uh drinking blood is its own thing\nSo do you think or were you born of empire do you think I was yeah when you're drinking blood or the young age\n[noise] well now I don't think so because um [noise] I mean I wouldn't say young uh most of us tend to start to show signs of that around ... pretty around Thirteen fourteen this is very typical [noise]\nIt's a typical story and I've I've heard it a lot so um eventually you start to build up a sort of a stock of stories on how these things come to be and people and almost all of us have the same\nShe you're born with this and do you you started to use it and your teen years in puberty you started craving butter you started realizing you knew your first taste of it what was your first taste of it what was it offered to you or did you or or was it something that you did for yourself\nI think the first time I ever deliberately drink blood was when I was having a a blood draw at a doctor's office so when they told me to hold the the guards there [noise] I didn't\nAnd while they were turned away [noise]\nIt's ... and I taste in my own so that would be the first time\nWhen I was probably Thirteen\nWas insatiable craving or you just wanted to do it as an experiment [noise]\nAnd often something's about to happen and when I listened to it things go really wow and when I ignorant things down\nThe voice has never prompted you to do anything aggressive do that\nNo no it's\nAnybody who has ever been in a situation where they've been\nThey've heard a voice that says\nUm duck or turn the wheel to the left or something like that now is what I'm Talking\nAbout so it's kind of a by camera experience something he was talking to a low frequency steep within your you hear it you sense that you understand that you do these voices or does this experience affect your dreams\n[noise] I think so I think that the dreams I for myself the dreams I had have been very guiding and I've had most of my premonition St James so when I have ... I generally don't have them and waking\nAs others excites a diet I've had them and dreams what is the vampire dream about\n[noise] what do you dream about I mean it\nIt looks as if he wants a ... I mean yeah I mean how would I Know it just seems\nLike a lot of your dreams I ... I was always the imagine a vampire\nHave dreams that are far more ah maybe intense or a sexual in nature or\nAmericans could end the list of of what I Would perceive a vampire because you know blood is not only the life but you know if you do anything about what you probably do\nAbout what old mosaic lawyers to say and what what are used to be a whole Bram stoke are of course wrote about mosaic law in the Bible or all of these I'm always interchangeable views on blood is the life blood is is also\nWell uh all of these are always interchangeable views on blood is the life blood is is also a part of virtue or it's something that are in the old ancient writings was uh they said the by blood was also found in the seeming the men\nThat are this was this was the life giving a lecture that ah gosh a ambrosia is what they call the ... the ... I mean that was like what seven hundred eight hundred years ago they had no idea what DNA was\nThey had no idea so so some people say okay I have a steady stream of advisors except for the moment is right\nI mean well I don't I don't know but 'cause if you look at the ... enrolled tablets and stuff and you see lots of descriptions that equate to DNA and if you look at the cross section of DNA you can find the the shape the flower of life millennials habits\nThey also talking about ... fires right they talk about uh the ancient Egypt or are we just heard about them I mean some argue that ah ah the ah the offspring of low and came products\nAre first vampire what'd you say that\nWell that was difficult to to break down into factor fiction was\nMythology isn't until we prove that it's something that would be a direct bloodline to\nTo uh I don't know I mean you look at the you look at the history you know the history that why would you look at the age and history of the biblical history the Old Testament history of\nThe ... and the and uh I mean I say you know people always argue would be whether or not aliens or the fallen Angel I say that the early ancestors that were the vamp Eric ancestors without falling falling angels what do you say that\nI think that that's got a strong basis and\nPossibility that I think that it's important to realize that I I don't believe that that time hires are strictly physical uh I think that the condition has a strong possibility of being the physical and spiritual same time that you have to have those in alignment for just be the way it is\nBut where does that spirituality come from I mean if the if the base itself I mean\nUh you know I don't want to I don't want to sound flippant by saying that vampires get a bad rap\nWhen they get a bad rap and then of course we have the pariah it we have the misunderstood loving vampires and all the movies and all of this stuff but if you're saying that there's some sort of a spiritual nature to the vampire where does that spiritual nature come from does it come from\nA what we'd call a right hand path or does it come from a weapon path\nI don't know but I Would say that ah you know\nI had to separate people described the exact same thing to me or one of them was a psychic I'm an active psychic the meaning that they\nCan sort of turn it on look around see things and another one was a passive psychic and but it was a stressful situation and buses them saw something very similar in regards to me\nAnd they describe it as tall thin\nDark just behind me\nAnd I don't know what that means but I've been leaning in the direction of [noise]\nLooking towards uh the the descriptions of Asian being very similar to the description of the nest saline\nSo you're you're saying that it never leaving the gym and probably interchangeable\nAnd I think that there's a yeah I think there's a possibility I'm not a hundred percent on that of course that's all theory but I think that there is a possibility and Rosemary guy like kind of talks like that she says that the regime\nOf course that's all the area but I think that there is a possibility and\nRosemary guy like kind of talks like that she says that a regime where there were discussions about the gym and we talked about pie on and in fact about you know I'm On the van period gym there is also be al I'm always seem to be on my team I Hope I say that right there are also the vampires of east and ah they're very real\nBut they're created maybe they are not born into this world they are created in this world\nBy by outcome some magicians and they're formed a in some sort of a um I don't know is called X of genesis or you know we talked about second genesis a couple of nights ago but it's it's basically the idea that there is a\nMirror image of mankind\nIn another universe that actually can be conjured or brought forward from the abyss and that can be an inch and then it could be used as a protective\nType of service that would be a not only uh intuitive\nBut also ravenous predatory in or perhaps even vamp Eric in a sense that it would it would do the bidding of its master\nBut I think what you're talking about something similar to the to the ... or the the goal of them yeah and I don't think that they are creating anything I think they might be something something and they might be coddling something together but I think anything of any real power such as the gym\nBut when you when you have a third grade okay but you're talking about this this entity this tall black dark entity that you have you talked about\nAnd you think that maybe that's something that you probably brought forth from your own a darker a ... a unconscious mind that he is quite possibly like in June or ... or something that is doing your bidding that it's something outside of you\nBut not only guides you but also you guy did or you push it in in a direction that seeks out others like you would that be something that you
