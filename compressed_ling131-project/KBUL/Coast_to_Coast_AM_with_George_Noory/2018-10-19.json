absolutely and that you know you come with ... if you'd like but at what\nLot of work for you to do and I say I'm really not interested and at that moment I don't think it had much choice because by cuts in George realized my sister and I are in trouble came and pulled us both out and\nKind of an ceremony furniture with on the beach and that was back in my body but I wanted to tell you that it was a glorious experience and I've had many that was really one of the first\nAnd I I learned a lot from that I learned not to let my says to teach me how to swim for one thing that they're probably in the mail message from that\nExactly it's a scary thing I got to tell you the same thing happened to me when I was a kid except I didn't have an agility experiences with my father's brother my uncle was the twins\nAnd we're walking in a lake and uh I'm side by side next to my uncle\nAnd a hole in this leak him just like you don't I when I must have been about eight years old Joyce\nAnd I'm going I and I thought this is it I'm dead end nowhere back something called me back up popped right back up and then my uncle didn't even know I went under just kept walking ... was the weirdest feeling but I thought that was it for me it was a strange feeling\nGeorge I wanted to tell you I don't know if you ever went to my website but I was home lots of times Oh thank you I was at the world\nTrade Center when nine eleven occurred because my husband and I had an apartment very club through like a thousand feet from some of the world Trade Center and we moved there about a month before buildings came down\nYeah we share a month and on the day we moved to end jak and I looked up and the world Trade Center was towering over our little building\nOn liberty court and I I said you know we said to each other boy this thing comes down we're finished well exactly a month later they'd come down as you know and we were\nWe had to leave the building and because it was unsafe to be there so many people in that area had to leave but we came back a few days later when saved and I had the most the nominal experience and that's my website where um\nWhat happened I I I actually\nHad gone to sleep and I was awake and and tell us to go into the living room\nAnd to help people to cross over because they were coming through they had created a portal in my building and in my apartment and the people who were had just died were coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty that was Battery Park\nSo that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had and thousands of people keep seems they just kept coming coming I guess you know\nAre you still love that area Jewish\nNo we saw that apartment when my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida\nBut uh just like so many incredible things that people would just try to remember some of the things that happen to them I think most people say well if I was just and you know something that just happened but write them down record your dreams as I'm sure your your next guest has got to tell us\nBut write everything down and try to analyze or you're experiencing the best way to develop your yes pay is to try to remember and to try to record what you're experiencing and it will really happen that way it'll open up more of that consciousness and you'll be able to help other people as well\nSo that's that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences I had a I don't know if I should if you're ready for me to tell you another one of a one my phenomenal experiences about a\nLovely yeah sure absolutely\nTrucks thank you I had never heard of ... but uh I had a ... about maybe four years ago I had this out and party experience where I did ask to travel

said jak before I wake up please write this down and\nI spelled it out ... and I misspelled it slightly put an H on it where it didn't belong and then he was a lot of things gone but I went to his

impressed and thought what really connected with me what how passionate about something logical us operations\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table and then to the very simple for step process the sharing a dream of a story that makes it sound you can get it done and minutes you get some help feed back in your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our genes I mean bad habits apart from that is part of it to be let out so the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get the job of deal with the family\nWe think that we should lie in the church in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch a good time to embark on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nSometimes we close our dreams because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams you know sometimes this is very interesting\nSometimes he kissed goodbye to our dreams because we think that our dreams are giving us a little ring pictures\nOf possibility that we cannot none of us because they're not young enough but not rich and not one never find the right girl or the right guy and sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream because we don't think that we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space\nWhat we would like to see an are waking life these of some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you follow the the simple suggestions that I also you can get your dreams that you can stop dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have a with\nYou might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nWere then you can dream wide awake welder rounds you will speak the language of signs and symbols and good is if you pay attention and sometimes you get more alert\nTo those pop up so the pop ups and waking life that can get shivers cause you feel my gosh there's a hidden handed work that that helps to turn on the dream flown the night as well\nAs some incredible wage the dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you have had some stories are directly related to that\nWell it's a recurring dream is coming again and again and as a hilarious story a mysterious reality is about a woman doctor for England who's complaining of the breakfast table\nHow Robert why do I keep having the same thing dream when I got to do my medical exams Thirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is the same ... very close to the same dream it's probably because\nYou have dreamed producers who are making a dream movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through you're trying to get you to understand the situation I'm trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on there trying to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I I did one of the stories I I picture I sort of dream production movie company\nThat is making dreams for us and repeating that performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked how I'll dream producers might be getting very bulletin fed up with us if they have to keep on making\nThe same but just not\nGetting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that dreams come about I mean dreams that not all to be put in one box we do have dreamed productions where you feel and you might be quite right when you feel as though\nAnd that is making a certain kind of dream you because you need to get a message and another the stories and mysterious reality as I describe but very strange women who sat down next to me in a play in an old reality and mentored me at a certain point that a dead house than to the ... he was a pop musician he'd been shot in the face in a diner in Seattle\nOn the news of the previous story and he says to her in her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies for people that they're seeing their dreams that I'm doing the music and the special effects\nOn the fact that goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect of what's happening and dreams\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed it might use that dream a if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you become conscious it might be either some shadow or hidden aspect of yourself maybe if you're a high a self made people cite the wiser and fight the highest self\nIs the director I don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you is not alien to you is not hostile to you\nAnd is probably being run by someone with a side it why is the perspective and maybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because one of the ways that dream\nShock is awake into doing some course correction is\nThey dramatized and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams are powerful Robert in a eyeball we used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nThat's right I mean I think that here's here's where our our current understanding of dreaming and currents physics uh meet up I mean the our current under staffed by kinda understanding I mean the really ready to revive some guidance and understanding about dreams of dreaming is traveling for example\nAre you in physics tells the science tells us that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information condom field of information that contain everything we could ever possibly need to know and we have access to it\nAccording to our ability to have this information and do something with it in ... in the first place what's going on I think in dreams we discovered that we have personal doorways into this whole quantum information field\nAnd depending on the work and play with prepared to do with the information might getting we can bring through more and more I mean you can set an intention any night for example to be very simple about this very simple practical you can do dream in the basement beans use at an intention\nTo get guidance on any theme that interest you and probably something will come through if you don't think you've got anything you're awake in the middle of the night to reset your intention and maybe at this point\nYou're ready to lose the dream on that subject as well because he's got some rest and you're ready to take off\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way and they come through across history one of my book

latest book is called mysterious realities how many books have you written Robert\nThis is the twenty fifth publish the old way George but I must tell you I'm getting nervous because I Dreamed some time ago I have a life contract that says I have to probably sixty eight books out on a short of that\nThat's still pretty prolific though good for you good for you and they're ... they're all fascinating works that\nThese dreams are so important I mean I I think people can you make themselves healthy in a dream that you can get a better job in a dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them and dreams it's amazing what you can do with dreams isn't it\nDoes lifting some really interesting areas for example in terms of I Hope\nI mean one of the things going on in dreams of that that body talk as well as the old joke in other words and dreams we see what's going on inside the body and old fashioned doctors\nUnderstand this and in traditional Chinese medicine for example that says front and center the idea is that a dream I give the X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show symptoms that are developing might enable us to avoid those symptoms\nBut that's one of the functions of framing and and in terms of our emotional and spiritual health of dreams which shows the things that help us to get wild and to stay well ended with acting up on those dreams of trying to bring their energy\nThrough you mentioned connecting with other people will you know to let the the which literally means fellow feeling at a distance or or of being in touch with someone else\nIt's a common phenomenon and dreams in fact it's surprising that more people who are related to each other\nDistance or or or being in touch with someone else\nIt's a common phenomenon and dreams in fact it's surprising that more people who are related to each other either by Lovell by family or by common colds or whatever\nI'm not aware more often that they might be dreaming with ... and all of each other I mean there's a phenomenal shed dreaming or interactive treatment which we find ourselves sharing adventures with friends and other people I mean this was another fascinating phenomena and dreams\nAs a matter of fact you discover if you wake up your dreams remember more than a look at what's going on\nBut you have what used to be cold and it's being cold again super normal capacity the abnormal but not supernatural but that'd be on the normal I'm Talking about things like pre cognition\nUntil after the ... and and so on and and and and you are able to see things before they happen to able to see things the distance but I go to connect with other people and these are natural powers and abilities that belong to you and if you become a more active dreamed that you'll find that fewer growing in developing these gifts and the very helpful in life\nIn terms of creative solutions for things green tool to live with them if you can't find a solution to a problem the ordinary life\nPut the question to your dreams and see what comes and I would add to that that you can do this in everyday life as well because dreaming for the it's not just about what happens when you close your eyes it's what happens when you open your eyes wider so proud of this part of part of the fence gold is is\nThat the world around you once again we'll speak to like a dream if you pay attention so I encourage people many of my story is done on this\nTo notice what goes on in the amazing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a thought or preoccupation on your mind and suddenly the will deliver an incident or citing\nThat gives you not only a reflection on what's on your mind but sometimes a way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is\nPut your question to the world go down the street are going to the talk of going your morning commute\nWithout question in your mind and received the first unusual unexpected thing that enters your field of perception as a message from the use of the surrounds you it is amazing how specifically the world will speak to you delivering a dream like message when you play that game\nIn Nineteen Seventy one Robert I did my first radio audition tape and the and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them to be some radio person on the street reporter\nAnd do what I Would do when I dropped it off at a certain radio station I wanted to work at I concentrated on that person every night when I went to bed or he already had my tape and heard from him a mature enough after two days I'm going to sleep concentrating on the individual\nI'm visualizing what he looks like I had met him one time and uh sure enough two days later the guy calls me and says hey I like this tape and I've got something for you to come on down it

become a reality where they don't even have to play soldiers or whatever\nI'm saying well let's get let's get Robert ... take on some of those rubber what do you think that many damn\nWell it's possible that you would dreaming of future developments in technology and in other ways that might amount of this he sounds as if you haven't run into these situations in ordinary reality yet and hopefully you weren't\nAnd thought to it's perfectly possible that you had long range pre cognition in dreams of situations that might develop in life it's also possible\nBut the dreams have a symbolic made not simply a Luttrell meaning but the symbolic meaning if I'm dreaming of of of the situation that seems very serious and talk and threatening going across the ... and seeing this may be this EMT\nOkay maybe that's symbolic of something that lies ahead to me in life which is\nGoing to have the emotional falls to the emotional pools\nOr something like that maybe my dreams are actually coaching me preparing me for an emotional situation which are not all the situation which I Need to be ready for I don't know but that comes to my mind the upside down cell phone you know I just want ... holding that image I realize it might be something larger more scary than a cell phone\nBut I wanted to reach into that dream and grab that cell phones lengthy a cell phone and speak on it and see who's on the other end I mean this this is the way that I Am about treats that's probably why I mean I'd rather\nLiked the idea of the upside down cellphone yeah it's scary but if it's my dream my actually however many years that he has since the dream I sort of want to reach into the dream grab that cell phone\nOr the ... to my ear and say who is there talk to me who while you and see what I get it might be that it's the kind of phony what you can talk to someone on the other side of death you know dreams where often people are often talking to the dead\nOn phones all receiving phone calls from among sort of want to go that direction with that tree\nRobert wire dream sometimes can't diluted in mired in a confusion in a terrible and things like that why isn't that just so obvious\nWell I think that actually the dream ... the dream sauces and many sources of freedoms and tried to communicate as clearly as possible but but not necessarily not enough to follow all of this\nAh and also we need to remember the dreams are experiences with whatever report we we quote to each other from a dream is only a report it's not the full\nAlso we need to remember the dreams are experiences that whatever report we we quote to each other from a dream is only a report it's not the full experience so it might seem convoluted all confusing or not ... but that might be because we've only brought back a few things from the dream and don't know how to put them together which is why\nI find the best way to understand the dream is to try to get your head back inside to try to get back inside the dream\nTake a look at what is really going on when you do that you pretty quick you determine whether it's literally symbolic you can fill in some of the get\nWhen you learn the technique of cream reentry of going back inside a dream I I and once we understand that I think one of the songs you were playing the something about living a whole life\nYeah imply implicitly in your dreams I mean once they understand that we're having tremendous experiences\nAnd couldn't live days or weeks in a in a dream and a few minutes to talk time we can begin to grasp that whatever we bring back from the dreams only partial and may be confused we might need to go beyond office memories of the tree and bring back more in order to understand what's going on\nOne is more prevalent Lucia dream free cognitive dreams just normal regular dreams what pops up the most\nWell a lot of people are dying seem yet to understand how to come loose and dream is the idea of listed dream has become very popular since that movie inception and and the ideas how to you can make love to anyone in your dreams and you can be Superman that centrist said there's been a sort of adolescent quality to some of the\nThe ... the ... century listed dreaming is actually easier than most people make it to themselves when they try and memorize ways of wake you up to ... inside of dream look at your hands he didn't stick a thing go through your town that kind of stuff as I said earlier the easiest way to become lose to dream is to start up loose that stay that way\nSo I didn't know how common listed breathing is amongst the population of the moment\nAt the moment I Do know that probably everybody is having pre cognitive dreams but only a few people are aware of that yet only a few people have woken up to it I think it's it's routine I think that we do in the night whether we know it or not\nScout ahead of ourselves some aspect of consciousness checks out what lies ahead I think that's going on all the time but I think many people have yet to wake up to the fact that they can do it and can use it\nSo regular dreams what regular dreams of people I mean the dream stand the whole spectrum there are big dreams are little dreams a little dreams that I'd rather routine processing of what went on the day before commentary on how you said yourself and how fast you ate the night before and then there are the big dreams\nWhich of the dreams which you feel that you have received a message for those you might feel yourself in the presence of the highest source of wisdom all you've gone travelling you know you've gone too distant galaxy or different time period or a place where the dead or alive so\nThe point is that all of these avenues of knowledge and adventure open to everyone all the time the only thing that prevents you from getting in on this\nIs is perhaps your reluctance until now to make time in your life to amend the more of what's going on in the night to write it down keep a journal that's basic practice keep a journal writer don't give it a title notice you'll feelings around the experience to run a reality check ask\nWhether this could happen in the future once you're willing to do some simple things like that you're on the way to becoming a more active treatment he had to find it's getting to power and expand your life and those sorts of ways\nTo go to Thomas in ... California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call Robert ... work that you are doing you know I wanted to tell me Robert um [noise] you know you talk about you know we get tired at night we close our eyes like go to sleep\nWe have dreams and in those ... mental a travel ban maybe even mentally\nWell have we have dreams and in those ... mentally travel man maybe even mentally time travel\nBut then tonight us over we open our eyes and is it possible you imply that is that we are stepping from one dream state to another that we are stepping in from night\nTo oh waking dream during the day a dream and watch reality as maybe plastic malleable um\nWhere we can not just mentally travel mentally time travel but actually like the shopping men and women around the world that cycling travel and physically time travel because they are aware that\nReality as a white can dream as opposed to a night during I was wondering if any comment on that you seem to do that\nI ... I Love your right being statement Thomas yes I think we do step when we come out of the freedom of the night into the dream of the day I think we do step from one stage unconditional creamy into another one I think the\nWaking life is also a dream in reality you might be more plastic and now the boat and we make allowance full we talked earlier about how your your your intentions the energies you carry the attitudes you carry good a shape you'll reality\nThe physical possibility of time travel all shapes shifting et cetera is of course is is his feet on the debate among scholars and scientists than and their traditions of it in different so many lineages as you imply whether time travel is a physical possibility either\nFor certain kinds of primal Sherman or with the technology of the future I don't know but I Do know I mean I didn't know from my experience I don't think I physically stepped from one time into another though I felt very very much on the edge of it sometimes I don't know where the shapes shifting and the way the Germans connect with animal spirits central is\nPhysically possible for those people today but I Do believe it probably was physically possible an early stage of human evolution when the human animal divide was not as absolute as is today but anyway leaving aside those are areas which sounds amazing to think about and the stuff of good stories\nI'm absolutely certain that you are right when you say that to come back from a dream of the night in the day is to move from one stage of dreaming to another actually I often feel Thomas\nLive I step from what's simply step from one room into another from one landscape all from one willed into another I have a sort of just so feeling okay I was there doing that that reality now I'm back in the body in the bed\nI get it out of bed I go out in the street and I try not to forget that we might have more opportunity as we go out in the street or out in the day to change things for the better and make healthy choices and to participate in the construction of reality that we sometimes falafel\nDreams is just so powerful Robert I think my gosh they are they are\nAnd dreaming of the way that we wake up this is one of my postal mantras when I used to be my bumper sticker on my car when I had bumper stickers on my car\nI made I made one that said wake up and dream because to me dreaming is not fundamentally about what happens during sleep I valued sleep creams highly including the ones you don't ... do not want the night show you exactly what you need to know not we can

work conversation with a Damon of Luna\nYes a lot of people are a little scared about that what's what's going on\nThey might be I mean it it it it might be scary to think that there are realms of spiritual beings beyond our human plane\nUh who are operating in ... tree that might initially be a little daunting to human it's an ancient understanding the astro play in the mood and I'm not talking about the physical ... known to the Astros realm of lunar\nIs a place of much traffic where sold off their it coming into the body in this world transit with solo third leaving the world after

on the right track is going up let's rub the down with some of their beings all this plane\nSo I gave voice to being of the asteroid realm of lives and he's not to be cool to the money's not a deep and he's a day mom that the ancient Greek too which is neither good no doubt in itself it means he's a spiritual being\nWho lives on a different plane of reality and we're hearing his voice\nWhat

first question would be a I'm noticing some trains\nThat seemed to have a scene with moving parts square that this moving parts and I would kind of compare this to say like the second half of the Titanic movie where\nA DiCaprio is trying to find his way out of the ship that oil is moving parts and they still has that team they still wants to stay with us girlfriend in the movie or you know it still has ... about the relationship so the idea of a dream showing moving parts\nAnd my second thing just as you're talking now [laughter] I was thinking of a I had played a lot of basketball and I never focused on jumping and I noticed\nA couple of times like block shots that word near the top of the black board so I had to be shopping high\nEnergy good jumping ... yeah\nAnd this was correlated to going to the gym a lot more and I wasn't going to the gym so I could jump higher you know is basically concerned with scarring a lot of points or getting a lot of assessed\nSo I Can't having the scream about shopping and I never really thought about shopping one I played a lot of basketball so what's\nThe idea of a dream bringing up the aspects of something you did a lot\nYet didn't focus on while you were doing it and why would a dream to that it's OK maybe like a singer you know always son to a certain type of song or or in rock and springing up another type of a singing you know\nInteresting ... I mean I'm thinking if I if I Am a boomer player I I'm not doing at this stage in my life but here I Am jumping at high is I used to do in in my dream\nMaybe the dream is preparing me for jump jump in life of a different kind where is the next ... jump I might want to take in my life it might be a new form of activity might be a new form of understanding where am I going to be a slam dunk in the field of activity in life so that we might be making an analogy\nBetween my ... my great prowess on on the basketball court\nWith these jumps at the gym that it lies ahead the the the moving parts and the Titanic analogy is interesting is not a lot to go on but it by the moving parts they think of that you know emotional scene from the movie\nI might wonder again where in my life my being prepared by history to move on in some sense and I can't think about the Titanic without recalling the there was a great British research a psychic phenomena and the paranormal go W T stand here the famous journalist in his day we went down on that\nGreat British research a psychic phenomena and the parrot no local W T stead you're the famous term listed his day but went down on the Titanic Twenty years before he went down on the Titanic\nHe wrote a story about the record the supposedly unsinkable lineup cold the majestic NO NAME of the captain of the vote in his story was the name of the captain on the Titanic\nSo they're from the history of the Titanic we have an account\nOf long range pre cognition as embodied the story rather than simply a dream report I must add the head up the death dictated or incentives dictated or a marketable account of life on the other side of the cold the blue island so the Titanic association\nSets all sorts of pot moving in my mind that thank you for that\nYou know how do you explain things like Leonardo da Vinci came up with I mean he was a genius it almost like a time travel or how would you do that in a dream state you think you\nYou you feel that in relation to sit and kind of mind when she was often said that you can't explain Tesla the original Tesla except as a time traveler you do feel that great minds are able to draw upon

bought like in behavior\nI mean that's one of a causal observers right they just stand there occasionally say oh this is the door make a left here it's like it's like being one of those talking maps make a left three hundred feet ... that's kind of a an NBC it's kind of given you directions that does it has a limited script\nAnd says the same thing over and over again and so if you go to Facebook or if you go\nThis is kind of giving you directions that doesn't really has a limited script and says the same thing over and over again\nAnd so if you go to Facebook or if you go to you know Twitter or read it or ... or you may be able to see these things but apparently Twitter responded\nAnd uh took down about Fifteen hunter accounts that were happy and the same name and ah they said it violates their terms of service so with regard to intentionally misleading election related content now several months ago\n[noise]\nThis NBC tournaments basically it was it's basically a drawn gray cartoon it's is anyone can draw one of these things as kind of like a a ... an alien gray it's like a ... a head round two eyes kind of the upside down seven nose in a straight line for a mouth\n\nSo they put them over the faces of people on CNN they put in and they have a they may have a column Capra Nick one\nUm and ah it's just\nIt's a new symbol I think it's a new symbol for the future as long as that continues and you know and and if if it if it shows up\nI I just think that it targets ... it it's kind of unfortunate that we have that only for the last two people will say well\nGod you're giving a lot of uh a lot of uh but let's see well I just think it's interesting and the thing is I think there should be a mean use to demonstrate to brainwash masses that have become members of the Q A non technical because chewing on has all the personality of algorithmic Bob that turns out what people believe was inside information about President Trump\n\nAnd people that follow accused seem to believe that there are hidden references to Q. everywhere\n\nAnd when there are those who question or even acknowledge accuracy bought they're told to trust the plan I was good that Clyde\nTrust the plan as if it were some religious code amongst the NBC's on the right trusts the plan\n\nSo here we are again seeing how easy it is\nHow it's becoming easy to just program the masses through means bits now there have been threats is pushing the issue of like a cultural and the sad thing is is that followers of cue believe\nThat\nThey're getting inside information about some great conspiracy when the conspiracy has always been about a plot to destroy the United states\nAnd not an exclusive plot that targets one man like President Trump all the queue and on does is create an atmosphere to dissolve the cognitive dissonance caused by the gap between Trump and so I was ... hours like the imagine instead of what he really is and what he's really doing\n\nIt all enforces the fantasy disguised as a plan that again creepy and PCs for the right\n\nI mean you don't create a wild fantasy about your leader being a covert genius unless you understand that most people\nDo that to most people that he he looks like something quite different and you don't need an occult story about how your site is secretly wedding if it's actually winning\nUnderstand what I'm saying I mean the entire population is being programmed into becoming this radicalized whatever and they're trapped in their own cognitive biased by programmers but no just what buttons to push\nAnd what a losing as they can conjure that certain people can agree on and the various collectors within the collective\nI mean what we're seeing here is high in mind within hive mind within hive mind within hive mind until the substances rendered and hurt for the purpose of major programming and that and then there's a major programming wipe and they're all back to normal again\n\nIt's like we do one have ... ... we're going to do another\nWhere we have a problem\nWe demand answers for a solution and the person who creates the problem is the person that gives us a solution I mean it's truly terrifying when you think about it because it just would further the argument that we are living in a highly controlled matrix where consciousness can be manipulated to further the goals of the programmers\n\nAre in consciousness is very mysterious I mean it seems mysterious it's like this is supernatural paranormal mystery\nWriter or wildlife in general can be explained by physics chemistry and biology\n\nIt seems that what everyone tries to explain like when they try to explain the relationship between the brain and the subject of events that are experiences feelings something appears to be left out of the uh the explanation somebody has left out\nOf the equation\nSee the brain can be objective it if it chooses to be however he does emotion\nThat is driving this guy says so there is this war going on between the brain and the subjective experience\nIt's called the explanatory gap where we have to bridge the brain the conscious as the experience of motion and critical analysis\nWe have to try and do that and we have to do that without even thinking about it\n\nBut most people leave out one or the other I mean either they have all the motion and they don't put truth in the mix or they they don't have critical analysis of the easily misled\n\nSo what we have now is we have this problem of of of understanding primary consciousness where we have the ability to have any experience or any feeling at all\nSome people I don't care they're ineffective they're unaffected they are disenfranchised they're angry they don't they just don't want to participate\nI mean the experiences of feelings we get now are both natural and organic and of course we're now experiencing the virtual reality or the hyper reality from the electronic illusion or everything that we see now is part of some electronic stimulus\nMost of our knowledge comes from a TV most right now it's comes from a cell phone most are now it's going to tell us ... or ... or well talked about\n\nAnd with that comes to the mixing of language that changing meaning of words that double think the double speak the news speak the propaganda\nAll those things that lead to the programming that we have now and people don't even realize they're being program they just say well I mean part of the game right so we struggle with primary consciousness that we used to be that we would just take for granted that we have primary conscious now there are people out there\nBecoming apathetic there are people out there are becoming for their people out there just don't care at all anymore and you know it's really scary is is that if people are being bred not care if they're creating is a nurse you up there and they're creating is um\nAny entropy they're creating all this what this does is this creates monsters\n\nBecause if you wanted to find a monster you can save the starling be like you know in the bushes orange starling be sweating the ratings pounds to predator [noise] yeah that's that's one definition of a monster but there is a definition of the monster that I think fits\nAnd it's something I think we need to take into account and that is the definition of a monster is\nA person who just doesn't care anymore\nAnd that's what we're struggling with right we're struggling with the idea of ... if we even care\n\nAnd I think it's unfortunate that we're seeing more people respond to the electronic illusion\nAnd they are becoming a non player characters or NBC's as a matter of habit\nLucian and they are becoming a non player characters or NBC's as a matter of habit and in some cases people do this because they wanted to survive they don't want to get involved\nAnd so this is where we are now we're in a position where we don't know whether to go left or right\nSo some people don't go anywhere at all and see I've always said this I say I I always say if you want to really get Americans to do nothing\nAll you have to do is obfuscate all you have to do was confuse them and they want and they won't make a decision and say well if I'm confused I don't want to do this because I'm damned if I Do\nAnd damned if I don't\nThink that's why you see less people vote I think when they're all saying get out and vote get out and vote red white and blue eyes whatever way they're talking about they're getting they're encouraging people to go out and do something even when they're confused\n\nAnd it's hard to sell people when they're confused [noise] and so if you're confused what do you do well out of ... in without looking stupid\n[noise] you decide to read the script we

you did and notice they use the word show in that program because everything is a program in this matrix\nIs that when you did with mark sergeant on flatter now it's not whether the earth is flat or not but I think what that did is that got people questioning the nature of reality why are so many people looking at the shape of the earth and asking questions\nI think there's something deeper going on there and that's the idea that reality itself it's starting to\nUm be revealed to two people for what it is as the veils are dropping more and more but I I I think I think also what we're seeing as we're seeing a a an advent and I think\nYou kind of pointed out when we were talking earlier what we have is we have a we have questions and the questions are are we living in a constructed reality is this reality constructed who's constructed reality\nAnd how we all become a but I but it all becomes programmed into agreeing on one particular loose in ancient after one particular illusion\nAnd and this has been a analyzed by a lot of scientists these days they're saying is this illusion we agree\nAfter one particular illusion and and this has been a analyzed by a lot of a scientist these days are saying is this an illusion that we agree upon and candy illusion be crack can we a detour the illusion and give people agreeing on one who's the nation after another who whose mission after another\nAnd so yeah it's flat earth you know and you think your sweat well that's one of ... when people agree on\nAnd the reality can be changes easily programmed people can fall off the flat earth and be program or they can go and they can also believe other things such as political beliefs as so it's becoming more and more apparent as we were talking about the matrix\nUh the majors the matrix exist and they were easily program going into my right\nExactly exactly and the point is that people are waking up from the programming and starting to ask questions about the nature of reality itself this NPR seeming that uh has just taken off for the last couple of weeks\nAnd it's something that we've been talking about seriously for the last two to three years I'm through these ... on a journey so we've been on um we started to realize there was a light and some people and no lights and others and we were asking ourselves why is this and as we started to really break down the nature of reality and start to\nRealize that what we're seeing in the ... is is not necessarily energy I mean it is on one sense but on the other sense it is a computer code that we're looking at the computer code the matrix that started to open up more and more doors and then we have people like Iran must coming out and saying\nThat there's a one in a billion chance that we're not\nWanting to billion chance that we are not living in a holographic simulated universe and his reasoning behind that is it's a matrix can be designed it will be designed and beans will eventually be put in there\nAnd if the universe is as old as we believe it to be there has to be a dance beans with the capability to do this I mean we're doing this right now with virtual reality technology we're still at the MTA at the baby stages but one or two more generations and we're going to have totally subversive experiences now what happens if\nWe plug ourselves into one of these machines and we simply can't wake up from it right now what really what really sealed the deal for me is I'm a professor and a professor gates\nAnd um he's a physicist who actually was looking at string theory and discovered a computer code within string theory and this just sealed it for me\nNow it wasn't just any computer code but it was a computer code written by a computer scientist by the name of Claude Shannon in the Nineteen forties\nNow I'm sure a lot of people have delved into computer code in one form or another everybody has a website these days so you know how complex computer code is ... it's not just finding different symbols and things like that and he's finding a complex computer code\nWithin string theory written by a guy in the Nineteen forties\nNoticed you know this reminds me of ... remember the germs to the movies pie\nI remember pi yeah the ... the number two sixteen\nWas the number of God and there was two hundred and sixty names of God in these rabbis we're trying to five and tried to getting out of this kid named max and and they were obsessed with number I did a whole entered your code sequencing\nOf of the numbers of code or we were actually we had the crystal skull with us and I talked about how a there is a some numerical codes and keeps the code keys to the kingdom and cues to consciousness and all these numbers show up a invariably in in Cuba form so ah six cube just six six six to sixteen\n[noise] ah is is a actually a a party that\nHundred and forty four thousand all these numbers we see in the Bible or all code numbers all seem to come together in a certain code and so are you bringing up\nFour thousand all these numbers we see in the Bible or all code numbers\nAll seem to come together in a certain code and so are you bringing a code like this idea that there's a certain code in a certain key to the matrix I biggest spouse they weren't expand upon that little bit more Chris stand by Chris geo weather's tonight on ground zero you have some interesting things to say about are you an NBC\nChewing on is a buck and it's obvious that it's a ... would be beautiful algorithm is able to convince scores of people\nThat we're on some supernatural quest that there is some cold hidden ah insider than giving them information about Donald Trump the future\nAnd in reality it it's just a beautiful bought but it's a compounding the the uh the cognitive bias of its users and I think that people need to wake up to that to do you agree\nDoubt about it um we see this in a spiritual as community as well people I'm Harold this book called the law of one or something like that that is written by raw\nAnd it says I Am raw here's my message I Am raw here's another message and it's clearly a botched the exact same writing style as this he went on 'em so we see it on a on a physical level we see it on the spiritual level\nBut um I think ultimately\nWhat we're doing here is we're recognizing what the ancient have been telling us all along they just didn't have the language to communicate this he goes back to the emerald tablets of ...\nYou have the children of light and you have the children of men they distinction between that you you go to the Bible you have men and you have the sons of men and we're talking Old Testament here\nThat makes a big distinction between the two you go to a ... just as for example he talks about the morals and the dissolvables you go to ... she talks about the ones with the divine sparked inside of them and one's without the divine spark\nI think what's happened now is we are living in the apocalypse the apocalypse being the great to be a revealing the dropping of the veil and more and more of these realities are becoming a parent to those who are capable of seeing them some people are not capable they just don't have\nThey they don't have the consciousness to see this and instead what's happening is they're being further and further and further scripted um to create this reality it's almost as if the matrix is clutching out on itself I Would say I\nDid the interesting point because here's something I wanted to point out you've given me an epiphany the whole just listening to give me an epiphany\nSo you're talking we're talking about numbers in code we've covered the numbers in code thing on the cube sick show a couple of weeks ago um you talk about pi you're talking about the numbers in a gym Andrea you're talking about the holy numbers the the ... the geometry the codes all these things that are simply close to the matrix\nAnd of course we see what this in PC mean is we see what it's doing to the left\nWe see that it's this interchangeable mob NBC rumor using one a one letter I'm a one letter ahead each time for a mob that's and PC it's all ... and and and it it it it reminds me of a form of sorcery and I'd say that this is probably\nI don't know I should go this far in saying that it's black magic being utilized on the Internet as black magic being used within the matrix to kind of\nBring to pass a uh some of these anomalies going on these glitches you talk about\nAbsolutely Clyde and I would go even charade or try to go ahead [laughter] we're connected oh good okay go ahead and gone on that I Want to know about what if I'm\nThinking this is something that is resonating with you\nWell if you go back to ancient Egypt or the missions in ancient Egypt always used to ... what were called words have power and they believe that you had to say these words exactly right\nOr that magical spell would not be would not stick it wouldn't take and the God or got is that you were invoking wouldn't show up and it just wouldn't work and said they were very very particularly about their words that they used\nAnd even the forty to lots of not they ... they would have\nSuch an emphasis on the words that were used and so words carry such meaning and such power that it seems like both political parties the right in the left has taken it out how to use these words in combination with each other to create magical spells\nAnd trigger parts of consciousness as well\nI mean think about this from a computer simulation perspective what are we doing when we're speaking words were sending out a program or a script if they're doing this on a mass level\nAre I'm sure that you've talked about the fate of state that the country and this goes into when you're watching TV puts you in states where you're more susceptible they repeat things over and over again and then they twist the words as we were talking about 'em off air uh and you probably mentioned it in your first our\nUh George Orwell talks about double speak well we go back to nine eleven and what do we have the first piece of legislation that cut a legislation that comes out it's called the Patriot act yeah those unpatriotic and he's the paper to add ever come out of these other ... other example\nChange climate changes but what they're doing is they give it a name like climate change to say I don't believe in climate change or a moron because climate does change but what they need to clarify is and the person who said they don't believe in climate is they say\nNo I don't believe in the in the political gerrymandering of climate change for the effect of sustainable development and redistribute redistricting\nThat means that the redistribution of wealth and also geo engineering to destroy this planet that's what I'm against so it'd be says are you against climate change are are are you believe in climate change I say I believe in climate change but I don't believe in the political a double speak that is the word climate change I just don't believe it\nYou're absolutely right I have in my hand to document that I downloaded from CIA dot Gov\nIt's called the analysis and assessment of gateway process and this is the basis for a lot of the remote viewing projects and psychic projects um style projects mind manipulation projects and so on and so forth\nThat the CIA and military have been engaged in\nAnd within this document talks about something called patterning\nAnd you can put an individual into a stage um where they're able to project a hologram into the universe and bring down a hologram back and essentially manifest reality by ... by projecting that hologram that's ...\n... you know how to do that yeah ... yeah I imagine is quite right or doing this on a mass scale oh yeah well don't realize that\nThey're literally creating the reality that they want by manipulating the masses\nThat's right I mean and and that that's the thing is reality he's created okay reality was created by people who know how to use the trigger words and phrases know how to cast the rights spells it is a is a trip in black magic it is priests craft are the highest level okay it's it's it's a matter of sorcery\nAnd there are people in power that do this and they know what we're just to use what images to use and how they're used to stimulate movement stimulate action and\nAnd they're doing this and people don't realize and that's why the idea of this and PC mean is very important because of what he's doing\nAnd how people are reacting to what I mean look this is just something nondescript formed it's on the Internet right now it caused Twitter to shut down Fifteen hundred sites Twitter sites because they were using this nondescript among Kilian\nI couldn't come on ... but it's actually a symbol of alchemy when you think about it\nYou're absolutely right and the reason that black magic works the reason that intention works and so on and so forth\nIs because we're living in a simulation there's no other way to look at it ... does astrology and hers astrological ratings are so perfect that if I don't read my transit charts in the morning\nI wind up making a fool out of myself during the day then she'll show me hey look I wrote your transits for you this morning and he just didn't bother to read them right the only way that it works is if we're looking at some kind of energy source that's really having some kind of affects your on the matrix\nAnd it only works inside of a computer simulation it wouldn't work in the real world environment\nRight you've got to know the right words I mean remember I'm John be an ad Kelly we magicians that a worthy pre I guess the precursors to al ... and if you remember what they did they sang into homes at certain words and codes\nIn order to open up the habit than they did this because they were under the direction of the queen of the time and they were doing this what is known
