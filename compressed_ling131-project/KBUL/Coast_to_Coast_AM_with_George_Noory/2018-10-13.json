businesses and psychic protection Jeffrey is also an expert on hunting and homes and businesses psychic ability good go such as spirit guide as well and we're tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks stores for having me back on your show the fifth time and a big hello everybody around are beautiful planet\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring out ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that\nIndividual and the media a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about all things supernatural a good and evil\nAh also in tradition um it's harvest time and uh in the tradition of that that\nThere's a veil of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing\nThat I deal with half and all the time and um but the media pay more attention to it this time of year\nAnd that's fine anytime we talk about it and get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever do you think demonic spirits and we'll get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirits ... something to do with that\nDefinitely ah we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth and this is a huge target for demand\nA lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nThis is a huge target for demonic spirits and also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people that have power\nAnd can change the world for good or for ill\nAnd uh I think that there's never been a time in our history\nWhere demons have a greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get you take Jeffrey on one is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that there was a counterpart of angels there that powerful they are not regular\nPeople who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they're very involved and may have not\nEver lived in the physical realm or not have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect physical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily\nAnd ah\nWe're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people it's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that\nAre under the pack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits\nAnd ah\nDemonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical realm\nFrom the non physical route and actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit in a negative spirit also demonic spirits are are are much better\nEquipped to uh influenced people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can see them and tell a path ethically trans for information\nInto our system or emotional systems make us angry at each other the other people at ourselves get us to do things we would not normally do and we can't see them we don't know that there are there\nSee that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many\nDemonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as you go I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist and it's also true of spirits it's also true that a demonic spirits ah can change you know once\nThey were you know positive experience in their ego got to them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack are so many\nShe is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack a so many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits and all spirits\nDo not have voice boxes they communicate George ... ethically and we all communicate color\nEthically it's kind of like a river that travels underneath\nOur consciousness and they communicate on that level\nAnd they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in that's also very common and uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people are not all violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits\nBut they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sort negative spears people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative things when they were alive and continue to do negative things demonic spirits are very powerful and it's an exorcist when I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's you know they can come and get you\nOwe apps and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect that when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes negative feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking for it's a vet the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work\nTwenty seven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked or successfully a few times for short duration is and it's very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form at a moment's notice\nDid you see them I can you ... I was\nBorn with the ability to seize spirits I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school and grade school I thought I saw spirits in the classroom some were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them with a school work in the summer are looking at me\nLike how can you see me\nWhat are you doing I don't like this and these are the ones I had to watch out for and they'd actually come and started walking towards me in the classroom and I was very uncomfortable\nNight stay with us Jeffrey we're going to hit a break and we're gonna come back and talk more about the demonic spirits where do they come from what they want and the next hour we'll take phone calls all about the\n... the new version of the ... bone in now enjoyed for ... ... on demand anywhere anytime good acoustic ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nThere's some exciting news simply safest now valued at one billion dollars this company used to be just five guys working together\nNow they protect more than two million people simply said system is easy to use\nIncredibly intuitive and takes just minutes to set up their no contracts are hidden fees and twenty four seven monitoring is only fourteen Ninety nine months visit simply say ... dot com the order you simply safe system now that you'll get free shipping and free returns that's simply safe no re dot com simply say nor dot com the little things\nLike finding twenty bucks and a lot\n\nOn yelling led to shop on line for all the newest dialing back Neal's around not comical I paid dot com today for incredible down I knew in my\nEven much says check on the on line for me to find the same\nEvery day said dot com mental things mean everything I think\n... coal into one which is coming horse dung thought I had a large top condition he's also the world's biggest killer has decided to stop pecking kinda boring it was just incredible feeling said I never felt before touches pins and needles around my heart when I have the ... two and a half months later\nSomething amazing happened which already taste more on my hot actually contract is almost staggering about this was the staging a chick Rick ... to ...

[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nJeffrey ... with us as we talk about demons we'll take calls next to our as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a\nNatural human said humans they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true\nThey have nothing that we want and so ah they attack\nChildren in their cribs ... attack people at work\nThey attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that\nUh we can see them but they can see us degenerate negative emotional energy they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand\nWhat they're trying to do they don't want us to know that there were there they want us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but the reality is is that they are around the spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them\nAnd they communicated with us ... either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy a business and you destroy a person's ability to make money destroyed their family\nDestroy their lives\nAnd also ... to change or the way we think about each other right now they have us at each other's throats right where they wanna\nSell they sure do and we have to stop it and there's there's ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story\nEverybody I've talked to has some kind of a story of uh being in a home apartment condo a party a bar in a pub any ... any place\nWhere the scene or felt something strange or picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can\nInfluence this by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying are feeling\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things\nThat we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not normally do that\nAnd so when we're angry bathroom they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them\nOr they do know that they're there they may not believe in them\nPeople making decisions around our world they work on them\nOr they do know that there are there and they may not believe in them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody\nBut most people do so what happens when we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not most spirits are good summer not\nAnd so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue to hang around our world and\nIt is to do things he would not normally do demonic spirits are\nJust experts at it they have weapons they have devices that they make a lot of non physical energy is just like spirits do spirits change their forms\nLike our our parents die as an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating and thinking about generating a form of what they want it to look like and also generating close because most people do not see\nMaking spirits so all these things are generated on a non physical level emotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well so demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred enrage\nWe think it's our own\nBut it's not always completely are wrong\nOr the under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nNot sure if there's one particular spirit in charge of\nNegative spirits I ... the demonic spirits are kind of like criminals they really don't even get along with each other\nThey don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always the rule or they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this\nUh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time\nWorking on individuals and families getting them to fight uh getting people to fight with each other and getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify what would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage\nAnd very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally ah it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of a very negative\nA beam of light all come out on an attack I pull out my non physical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on but everybody is not so fortunate the vacancy them and know that they're coming\nAnd so there are around us and we don't know it around just at work and at home also negative spirits you know and and negative spirits can work for them essentially and and sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not\nAre also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die all the time and lots of them are not good\nUh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so essentially the entire human race right now is under attack\nBy negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits\nNow is under attack by negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier may not have ever lived in the physical realm\nOr for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred enraged and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura and to get us to react\nTo they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially\nKill a child in the cradle he had no problem with\nThat I Know that's a scary thought it was horrible they have\nThey just hate humans and so they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend\nThemselves and then our world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize\nThree ... three two

release it\nYou know out into the atmosphere but it will not remove it from your home will not removed from your living environment it has to be actually pushed down\nInto the earth and away from the property in order for it to be removed because essentially what I think that's going on here to Jay Z you've been releasing it by doing these you know really positive things stage\nFrankenstein it's all of these things you know I'd recommend them certainly but we're releasing them into the atmosphere there's still have to be released from and pushed out from the home in order for them to be out of your life and I think it was going on is that is just accumulated\nA to the point where it's all around you and you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home and this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things\nYou know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work and to some extent\nYou know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work\nAnd to some extent but emotional energy in negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kinda like you know taking the Bruins pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a dust pan\nYet the you know a broom and get it in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening\nAll right thanks for them now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy Jeffrey\nPeople generate both positive and a ... a negative emotional energies from the very first day that were born shortage\nAnd these things can become trapped in our bodies energy feels also known as the ... but the orders not just a bunch of pretty lights it is who we are it's part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems\nHave an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical\nBody which is our spirit or maybe three or four feet\nOutside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped over a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue\nSo emotional energy this negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy fields and we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's home\nI'm watching TV or you know a pub just every place\nThere is emotional energy and our bodies energy fields that we don't protect ourselves and most people don't that it actually permeates into our energy field and mixes with our own emotional energy\nPositive and negative and causes havoc and this is one of the biggest problems that people who call me have it's not it was just demonic spirits the idea is is that we are filled full of emotional energy not a positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of what we want to let\nGo and so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy negative emotional energy is something that uh people want to release\nI bet they feel a hundred percent better when it's natural let's go to Jerry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show ...\n... ah yeah George or I guess what I'm a even as the original language or the scriptures and I'm I'm actually writing a book called that we really know guy is and I tell you the Bible in Nineteen eighty Meg I've dealt with a lot of the party\nA scene and I was going to ask you Jeffrey are you a Christian\nI don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in God I also think that ah the argument over creationist a series and a true scientific physical theories as ridiculous\nThey pull work hand in hand first prince will is creation spirits don't just sit around and clouds and do and do nothing higher spirits angels God you know they create almost like a battery of a cake\nOn a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical so that non physical proceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely but also the big bang theory\nSo the idea that you know creation is does that happen is the universe created absolutely but also the big bang theory why not so it's essentially like I said like baking a cake you know that spirit guide angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating an designing these things perpetually right now as we speak not just in the beginning of time but right now and that filters up it's connected with the physical all things physical so each person has to levels\nOf physical body which is very finite sixty eighty years or Fifteen Years or whatever and our spirit which is completely a turtle and our personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that are not that you have but I mean that is\nBeing fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with I'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially so I Believe in all of this is science to me\nYou know and I think that you know God has a personality\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think what you're doing this marvelous you know I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to the jury for another question go ahead Jerry\nUh yeah what I was going to say is you're talking about religion religion teaches at probation that God go to church give your money do this do do that that's not from guy\nThe problem is is that we have many ministers out there that teach uh this type of stuff then basically do they make money off the guy the problem is\nWith this with this whole scenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know this\nBut you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion is it is it's a relationship between you and God now why is that\nWell to be an arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus is title is genes is\nIs Lord Jesus Christ lord needs deity genes this means humanity and Christ means anointed one\nOkay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on this earth in fact in fact Peter said that I'm a ... that God is no respect or a person so we're all in the same boat\nIt would be no matter how much knowledge we know we're all in the same boat with God\nBecause we have is the nature because we're we're born in San because of Adam's then because we carry out and then ah our entire life we we are and and even Paul says is that that none of us are the glory of God we were all in the same boat\nThose demons seem to be every where we're going to come back a declining calls in a moment on the coast to coast

California\n\nWelcome back Jeffrey ... with us let's go back to the phones ... California's with Thomas\n... charge thank you for taking my call sir Jeffrey\nGreat work that you're doing Jeffrey my question is about war and the battle field in war zones how does\nMilitary personnel men and women\nIn a battle situation protect themselves from the Monica solved I'm not talking about\nJust battling insurgents physically but there must be a lot of demonic energies in a wartime battlefield situation and you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI Do I was in the air force myself many years ago um and essentially they're our message throughout rules on the other side\nOf emotional energy that we all generate and and as a in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear and there's killing going on and so it certainly is a a a place where negative spirits are attracted to demonic spirits negative spirit says well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy field there are methods there are rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves to protect us from the effects\nThat negative energy that is generated by other people fear around us were just natural and the battle situation uh emotional energy that's just you know so intense on the battlefield there are multiple layers\nThat can be applied that actually work so that negative energy actually balances off of us\nThis is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know uh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves in the military\nYou just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple and it can you know take this stuff I designed over the years\nWith the help of nice spirit guides can be brought up in five or ten seconds\nYou need it fast you know the old style was doing things ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening I read all that stuff when I got out of the service ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes and the evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we need we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us\nWe need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately in order to deflect negative emotional energy or this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also ... off the fear\nAnd here so I think that it's very important that we all learn that this kind of thing and it's a science it's not a religion would I what I'm involved\nIn is not religion I Would not even to say it's really metaphysical it's non physical science I have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say scientist or not\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say\nScientists do not call me up and argue with me they are right ideals non physical science which is essentially is the non physical part of our body are emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body that is susceptible to attack\nAnd also negative emotional energy by negative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad and scariest situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nThey do it in order to destroy a person's life a hack the fabric of the family and the best way to do it is to pull out the resources the money George to get it out if they destroy your business\nThan they have a two fold thing going on and they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home it can cause people to lose their place\nOr where they live all sorts of problems that can cause them to feel bad and actually react\nSometimes violently\nAnd also it has an effect upon the actual business environment we're now you have the failed business I think of most restaurants they fail within a year\nSo restaurant after restaurant comes in her business after business comes in and you have problems of failed dismisses and that has an accumulation of emotional energy as well\nPlus you have all the people working uh who don't necessarily get along is kind of like our our second family we have a family at home and we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along\nAnd so essentially we have a lot of emotional energy people at work were sitting at their desks and maybe thinking I really hated here when they're doing that they're generating emotional energy\nAnd it can it can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes as negative and it accumulates in the environment this also attracts negative spirits and demonic spirits because if they can get somebody fired by you know doing or saying something\nUh you know inappropriate or a you know simply not doing their job or she'll be destroying the business itself by making of a the business atmosphere very uncomfortable emotionally everybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub or a business or restaurant and saying you know what\nThis place doesn't feel right what they're picking up on George is emotional energy whether it be good or bad that's emotional energy they're picking up on everybody has the story of that this place doesn't feel right\nIt's emotional energy and it needs to be cleared out so\nThey attack businesses because they can actually make a business failed you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work and now they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments with their significant others\nWith their kids and a and then it just snowballs\nNext up let's go to the Monique in sun ... son ... California Hi Monique go ahead\n...

I didn't take many things in those days I don't think they knew how\nThey didn't have the capability but uh\nWe audiences were alive and they were always smoking the way we got to do a ... show one day we'll come back in a moment William Henry is joining us to talk about the watchers will be back\nThe website is no conveniently optimized for mobile devices if you're a good students ... you can listen to live in these shows right on your bones just lose it goes to goes to um dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or\nA wonderful George thank you so much for having me on the show again to any traveling I've been in a clinic Connecticut I was in LA uh on Monday doing some new interviews for ancient aliens really excited\nAbout that good for you should look this up all your here\nWell it was such a fast track and um [noise] so I just there overnight and a personal note I had a second cat who passed away\nYesterday so it's kind of really emotionally are very very difficult time he was my beloved buddy he's on his journey now how old was he he was eleven\nNow that's not tools for a cat is\nNo it's not as that I was really hoping to be here a few more years and um but as time was it was time for him to go sadly and I'm gonna miss miss him dearly\nWell he's out there somewhere you know that he's here with us now yep absolutely tell me about the watchers\nThe watchers incredible story very much very controversial of course there's a wide range of of viewpoints on the watchers ranging from the Thirteen and they're evil they're controlling us people want to know\nWhat why are they here and and and what are they doing a why are they interfering with humanity and people actually blame the watchers for humanity's ills and that's one very definite point of view but then the other point of view is that [noise]\nAll watchers for humanity's hills and\nThat's one very definite point of view but then the other point of view is that\nThey were here they came from the heavenly realm from the Rome called sigh\nOn according to the Bible the location of God's throne they're dispatched to earth in order to bring a new teaching to humanity a teaching about how humans can transform into angels and make the journey from the earthly round to the heavenly realm of sigh on and it seems that that what's happened\nIn the intervening centuries and by the way it was\nThe watchers were briefly mentioned in the Old Testament and the book of genesis and then it's the scenes about a hundred and fifty years before Jesus all of a sudden there's this rise of astounding what's known as apocalyptic material developed by the ... the idea scenes\nApocalyptic simply means that a human man is in contact with an otherworldly being a supernatural being angelic being maybe even an extraterrestrial in some people's view\nWho delivers knowledge about another supernatural world and this then became an explosion of of knowledge about the watchers\nAnd the ability of humans to cross over what the church considers a forbidden boundary between flash and light between spirit and flash\nNo these scenes do they not right to did see squirrels as well\nThat's exactly right the scenes there's no question that that after the destruction of the temple of Solomon and eighty Seventy when the scenes were attacked the Roman army came into\nInto Jerusalem into Galloway the scenes bundled up their sacred tax which there were many hit them in caves and they were last until Nineteen forty seven when they were were rediscovered and this is when modern consciousness really begins to [noise] to understand the full story of the watchers\nThe watchers are the and ... ... Rome or are they from\nTwo schools of thought there's some that believe that they're simply and only human beings ancient pagan royalty existed maybe going back to the time even before the flood and the that they were able to survive the flood and then continued with new blood lines after the time of the flood\nThe second viewpoint is that they are and this comes from the Bible as well as the dead sea scrolls that they are celestial beings\nLight being ephemeral beings who had the ability to phase into physical manifestation they could take flesh and blood oddities and face back and forth by the way between flesh and blood and their their light being status and then infiltrated human affairs\nThat sounds interesting to me when\nThey are and this is where it gets kind of disturbing because as you think it began to research the watchers it's you're presented with a crossroads you're either going to take the tack that they are purely evil and their demonic as many people do\nAnd if you take that path it's going to lead you down to the path where you're following their offspring who recalled than to feel them as these giant beings with the ... and in this whole axis of research which is very interesting but if you're following that path\nChances are you are not probing deeply behind the tax and into the tax\nLeft by the scenes and you are realizing that at the seams themselves were utilizing\nAncient texts and teachings that they had developed in\nSynthesized from ancient Babylon Egypt Iran Iraq the teachings of the address that were centered on how do we contact the watchers one and two how do we transform ourselves into angels and in fact this is what the Dead Sea scrolls are all about is this a scene\nOh do we transform ourselves into angels and in fact this is what the Dead Sea scrolls are all about is this is seen this group of the scenes Jewish mistakes a hundred and fifty years before the time of Jesus who were utilizing these teachings to congregate with the angels the holy ones the angels are the lord\nThe watchers and work transforming their bodies into\nLight in other words into angels\n... which of course in the book of genesis to me either fallen angel I'm not sure what do you think\nI don't think so because when you look at the at a mile edgy of ... the meaning of the word ... it's far far from established fact the term fallen angel is ...\nMeans that they're evil beings or that they are being who were\nAre somehow demonic they their fallen because they came out of the higher vibration or if you will have an ally realms and took human body that is their great sin they crossed what\nThe church establishment views as a forbidden boundary you're not allowed to cross over from flesh into spirit with out\nGod's permission and this is the whole crux of the question did the watchers when they\nDescended from the heavenly realms and took on physicality ...\n\nAgainst the will of God and that that's going to determine your whole viewpoint about the watchers and what happened was that early church fathers based on some of the work of the scenes and others simply decided that they were\nDemonic being that they were a powers that were beyond human control and certain humans began teaching that we need to avoid the watchers at all cost do not seek\nTo transform yourself into an angel without God's permission because in order to actually what the church terms is a sand or experience the rapture you have to be invited by God and that's the great crossing a line that the watchers\nTranscended are crossed over and came to teach humans and how to do how to turn into angels\nWilliam in your book to watch is you do talk about a luminous clouds were gods rude on them to me it sounds like ... we'll it sounds kind of you and foolish doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean in in the New Testament the Greek word for clouds isn't to feel which is the world where we get the word in the field I'm from and so these are cloud riders and when you as I did in my book and and the watchers book I collected\nVarious examples of today are Judeo Christian art that shows the watchers including a Jesus riding upon cloud vehicles luminous clouds they're literally levitating on these clouds\nAnd what we learned is that this cloud is actually a symbol for their ascension body they're light oddity it's it's not a hardware UFO like a a flying Toyota\nIt's actually an organic light vehicle that is produced by the human body and it enables them to travel entered dimension only and throughout the cosmos\nArguing with William Henry his latest work the watchers and of course we're going to get into many things that he is an investigative menthol it just goes\nAfter these gone that the visited us spiritual or physical\nSpiritual first who had the ability to phase into physicality and their bodies are described actually as fluid they can virtually instantly according to the stories transform from their acquiesce\nFluid shape into physicality they can even turn invisible\nAnd this is what we we discover and in some of the ... tax as well as in the dead sea scrolls where there were they're describing looking at these luminous beings who are radiating rainbow light\nWho their bodies are described as full of eyes they're covered with feathers and they have certain teams type faces and when you add all this description together it precisely matches with the Tibetans describe as the rainbow body of light\nIn the Tibetan great perfection tradition they believe that humans can morph into a light body that they describe that what they tell us that are the the\nOur body the frequency of our body can be accelerated until it dissolves into five color rainbow light leaving behind only hair toe in fingernails that have no nerves to be transmitted the watchers could do this and I believe that the the Tibetan great perfection tradition originates with the watchers\nAnd so these watchers could

New Mexico ordinary fifty one or maybe they always you know Stanley Kubrick directed at that all that it's always been speculation that conspiracy theory but to Hollywood has always been involved\nWith the bringing the moon landing to all of us at first it was on a grainy TV screen shot from actually a camera focused on a monitor wasn't a direct feed to the television stations it was basically a camera focused on a small screen in a studio\nAnd this is why when you look back at the moon landing you see a lot of ghostly images jumping around on this scape this moonscape and it's really hard to tell it's hard to tell the detail of of what's happening and this is also why a lot of people have doubts because if you why do we have a direct feed or why did they do it in black and white when there was color available at the time\nThey're all kinds of questions that they believe it or not I figure very valid question that there is somebody just nuts\nOr that people asking and they and they assume but they've been a lot of I think a lot of questions that need to be answered it never get answered and the reason why they don't get answers because most of the time when you talk about this and you speak up and you say\nI have some doubts about the moon landing in Nineteen sixty nine you know how dare you they they're always angry and they're never willing to answer a question\nAnd a and then if they do answer the questions sometimes they answer them and\nThey're still not clear you tried to say well that's not clear enough for me and they go or it's not clear and they and they get all put out an angry\nAbout it the defending it so there's one thing that\nWill defend or most people to sign and that is the most money and and to all of his doubters which\nSeven percent I don't know if it's a little more now maybe it's less depending on what propaganda you you decide to take in which will be this movie first man\nAnd I say it's fan fiction because it is I Believe it I Believe that when you see this film it's going to be a lot of fan fiction it's not going to be based on reality hell even the uh even the flag being planted in the lunar soil is not even gonna be depicted in this bill\nWhich he got a lot of people pissed off saying this is not a patriotic film the whole patriotic achievement was landing on the moon how dare you not put the American fight even Buzz Aldrin\nWas passed by the older now and he said what the hell was no American flag in the in the end the regular last what kind of crap is this I'm an American I'm an American we put the flag and and I know why they didn't put the flag in the moon on the on the moon in this\nMovie because they wanted they don't want to piss off the Chinese investors Hollywood's bought out by the Chinese and why and what we want to remove the American flag with the most important things is that well there's plenty of flags on the astronauts coach just plenty of flags on the rockets there's plenty of ... okay sure\nWhat that moment in time where they put the American flag in the soil is you know hits iconic it's kinda like it's the same thing as as\nAs having the soldiers putting the flag up at ... at the same thing as the fire fireman putting the flag up at nine eleven ... the ground zero it's like\nBut you know but they've they've written it out and um\nI Know this is going to boost the interest again in space travel but you know when you look back at some of the movies that they made before a Hollywood is actually\nIn a lot of cases they been Mooney mirror America I mean does anybody remember the Nineteen Seventy one James Bond film diamonds Are Forever\nYeah in that film James Bond Sean Connery one of my favorite bonds or Sean Connery stumbles onto a moonscape set\nSo they're staging the moon landing on this moonscape set and James Bond breaks in the movie set in runs through the uh the whole set up\nRuining what they're trying to do if you remember that see I I couldn't believe it I mean that was like what Nineteen Seventy one how bowls of them in Nineteen Seventy one you know we were just pressure on the moon and already somebody in a ... on the set of diamonds Are Forever decided they decided that they're going to put\nJames Bond on the moon that make you looked like he broke in [noise] [laughter] what a Capricorn One that was Nineteen Seventy eight right [noise] uh that's where NASA supposedly fake the landing on Mars [noise]\nBeing a lot of people thought ooh they can do it on his side they did a pretty convincingly two thousand what a space odyssey wow\n[noise] some people say that even Star Trek was canceled before the moon shot because they were afraid that if they were running Star Trek where a bunch of men land on a fake planet but somebody will get the idea oh yeah just like\nOther lives about the moon and uh it was just me you know what if it was just saying what if it's not that I believed it totally I just had doubts\nSo having doubts I decided well I haven't lived out back and say okay I Want to present the two people will say oh man that was the ugliest thing I'd Jim overt from NASA right we are dirty letter I had I I just thought what the hell of a gun you know what ... what did I Do\nSee at the time I was young and I didn't care if I were or whatever you know now I'm older I care a lot about you know it was his views and [laughter] just because I Love talking to people back then it was a man I'm just a young kid I don't care and then of course I had my cup it's when I had my\nYou know car blown to pieces by a pitcher and my bees but you know as I grew out of that really damn quick and\nDecided that I Would be a little bit more open a little more balanced but of course when you have Fox\nTV doing the special conspiracy theory did we land on the moon I started to see a pattern here and thinking what's going on then came by several\nAnd maybe you know barge several as he's this film maker is about as old as I Am actually he he was like what I call him he wanted to fly out to Oregon because he\nSaid all just fly out to Oregon and be on your show I said but it's just a local show the time it was local item to I don't think I was on national the time I was on national\nNah not after two thousand one and I think it he wrote a he he did this a movie called a funny thing happened on the way to the moon\nAnd um and so when he did it uh I thought it was interesting take and I wanted to talk to them about it he was ready to fly to Portland talk to me and I tell them no no no no no but if you remember Martin several he was the guy\nThat ah went around with and with the Bible and he got into Buzz Aldrin space he said I Want you to swear on and all that but you walked on the moon\nAnd altering when touched the Bible is you see your fraud that you're a liar you're a coward you're ... you're a thief and Buzz Aldrin wet\nFood punched him right in the face and a jock connected and ah it was then that I realized that the whole you know moon debate\nWhether or not we went on the moon was literally and metaphorically getting a black guy and so I backed off for a while\nAnd even though I still have my doubts about the first moon landing there seemed to be some talk about going to the moon again and I thought I thank God I don't have to talk about this any more it was really sad is that if you look at you know some of the things\nIn some of the things about me and some you know a biography of Seventy says to write about me if it's not about me being\nIn a punk band and being an interior designer ah people write and say that I'm I'm a moon hoax a enthusiasts around the moon hoax or ... I I'm a proponent of the moon hoax theory or\nI don't know if a proponent of the moon hopes theory but I have a person who has doubts and I've always had doubts and I think one of the things Penn Jillette had a had a radio show after he did the Showtime special\nIt was a guy that came on and and ... his mind a bit because you know of course Penn Jillette said it's all BS but then there was a show where parents who I was kind of like going will\nNever thought about that never thought about that so even though I still had my doubts about the first moon landing there seem to be some talk about going to the moon again and I was really exciting two thousand for\nPresident George W. Bush started the conversation about putting men back on the moon in twenty Fifteen he said we should be able to do this by twenty Fifteen that's our goal he said the national adjusted new spacecraft to crush it was called the crew exploration vehicle by two thousand eight\nAnd to conduct the first manned mission no later than twenty fourteen four years after the deadline we still have a cinnamon back to the moon if you remember during the inauguration parade of President Obama there was a new moon vehicle\nThey were driving through the parade and you know of course Michelle Obama said something under a breath and they didn't catch it but I Wish you know a bad liberating would have gotten it because it just seems to me that she said something really you know derogatory about you know this this vehicle and\nWe kept we kept hearing that the goal was going to be moved to twenty twenty ... twenty Fifteen twenty twenty two thousand nine we were told the NASA was carrying out of experiments to find water\nOn the moon and they did this in order to facilitate the possibility of a moon base\nBut that was ally okay simply ally no matter how many people would scream than the accusation was part of a conspiracy theory or that that saying that the the mission was a lie it was becoming quite clear\nThat the mission was slated protests MySpace weapon it was space weapons technology they wanted to have someone who had nothing to do with finding water\nTo put on a ... actually put up a moon base what happened is NASA launched\nIt was said to be the first moon launch in ten years in two thousand I first met in launching ten years and he said what they did is they set up a pair of on that man's science probes that we're supposed to help determine where astronauts could land and colonizing the years to come\nNasser received over five hundred million dollars\nFor something called the LCROSS mission LCROSS it was also a mission that was supposed to survey and map areas of the moon and then a senator rocket will be intentionally crashed into the moon's surface at twice the speed of a bullet and it was supposed to blow up at six mile crater\nAnd then they pour it would be ... a week for the whole rocket would crash there would be another spacecraft called shepherding craft\nAnd that would then determine if there was potential or potential ice particulates in the moon debris plume so they wanted to measure water in the moon degree and and the moon ah debris plume ice particles to see if there was any water they can use to or perhaps put a\nA moon base there well the liftoff occurred just one month and two days shy\nOf the ... anniversary of the ladies first moon landing and the LCROSS mission was suspicious from the beginning and and as we prepared for the impact or others began to bring a they're they're they're bringing up some inconsistencies about the situation is very interesting facts they were exposed to a lot of law\nAnd to bring a they're they're they're bringing up some inconsistencies about the situation is very interesting\nFacts they were exposed to a lot of lives about this LCROSS mission some of them I I actually heard on the Howard Stern show which I thought was interesting that they even Howard Stern was saying or they're going to blow up the earth the moon and they were saying you know and\nOf course they're all laughing now they're going to blow up the ... they're going to have to send a rocket to the moon and blow up a crater and lie upon lie upon lie upon lie\nAnd um so what was really interesting about the LCROSS mission NASA claimed that the LCROSS mission was supposed to map out the moon for landing sites for new moon missions before the Apollo missions though there were orbiter set out to the moon and in Nineteen Ninety four\nIf you remember the Clementine was launched between February twenty six and April twenty second Nineteen Ninety four Clementine was able to deliver more than one point eight million digital images of the moon back to ground control including the ... satellite ground tracking station located in Maryland\n\nYou know these images that they got were quickly accessible to the general public via the Internet and one scientist reviewed the data from Clementine they already found a possible existence of ice within some of the moon's crater so they knew that ice was their Clementine it already\nTold him about it in Nineteen Ninety four so why do they have to make up the lie and say we're going to slam something in the end of the moon so we can see if there's a there's ice it just doesn't make sense\n\nI mean think about it in two thousand nine NASA had just celebrated the forty anniversary of the moon landing and for some reason was not aware of the moon's topography with all the manned missions in orbit so that they have successfully completed doesn't make any sense and with all the the mapping doesn't make any sense they they found ice on the moon long before they could have a rocket do it for them in two thousand nine\nNow so it was also vague about how fast the rockets would reach orbit around the moon the LCROSS rockets according to press releases we're supposed to take a week to ten days to reach the moon now the Apollo missions took three days and each mission at various times ... eight to twenty hours to complete um [noise]\nIt was ten million or been said that that's the ... are basically ... there two hours\nFor orbit average time two hours for orbit around the moon that's Apollo eight twenty hours to complete ten moon orbits which is about two hours per orbit but yet it took\nTen days when they sell cross rocket to get to the moon transferring the day to day or the other missions results also a time space\nFrom the moon to it [laughter] it was just\nA pile of twelve ... twelve for example of how twelve got to the moon in twenty six point five hours\nAnd yet a policy Seventeen took Seventy six hours it takes the space shuttle sixty six hours to reach the I. S. S. I don't want to ... I was going about a hundred eighty five miles an hour\nUp here\nSo I'm I'm just ... I mean maybe I'm Bad at math but thing about that ten days they get to the moon without cross Apollo eight to twenty hours to complete ten moon arbitrage records for about two ... two hours for orbit\n\nAnd then we see the transference of data power twelve got to the moon twenty six point five Apollo Seventeen Seventy six and the space shuttle take sixty six hours to reach the IRS that's going a hundred and eighty five miles of of the year\nGet it together as straight university\nDo to stray dot edu to learn stray or university a certified to operate by chef\nThere was ever a time to live United it is now\nNow is the time to speak with one voice to build up not tear down it's time to join hands and live United against the problems that keep our communities from thriving\nUnited Way fights for the health education and financial stability of every person in every community will you volunteer or donate now at United Way dot org\nThey gave me by going after my surgery I didn't know it would be the ...

safely that kind of thing [noise]\nPlenty of technology to go to the moon and bring a man safely back to earth not very nobody died unless you count Gus Grissom dying on the pad but that was that wasn't going to he died on earth\nBut going back pretty easy back in the Nineteen sixties going to the moon now not easy a technology not being able to build it in time and guess what guys something's happening we we got this report today Seventeen scientists\nOften report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future NASA mission\nAnd this briefing was sent out by the national Academy of sciences engineering in Madison\nBasically emphasizes the importance of including astrobiology the study of how life originated on earth and how it might evolve elsewhere in the universe in brief phase\nOf all NASA missions destined for space from inception and conceptual its inception conceptualization the planning to development and operations\nSo now it's obvious as to why nother story today and this is this is a out of Russia so there's still some sketchy things going on but that's what's so Russians found these colliding stars and\nThey were going wow look how cool these guarding stars are they're going to collide completely you know by twenty twenty two\nOh it's interesting to look at and so then they said well we're going to look into one of the laser\nEnter parameter gravitational wave observatory and we're going to find out just how these\nThings sound right and so they got the sound and this is the sound that got now pay attention because it's all coming together quite nicely listen listen to that that doesn't sound they picked up from this are the stars colliding\n\n\n\n\nAmazing isn't it and they're saying well guess what guys they're coming and it it it sounds like the ... it sounds like an armada it's coming our way and they didn't specify what kind of our modern ... as well to start school but man he's he's things are showing movement you know this is the sound they make when they show movement\nThat's the ... what kind of are motivated as well as to start to go anywhere man these these things are showing movement you know this is the sound they make when they show movement\nSo the good news is is that we've got all this stuff you know happening\nYou know aliens yes this is this is a pretty interest I mean if they're saying look every discovery\nEverything that you go out and do now say it has to have some sort of a extra biological signature to it\nAnd they mentioned look at all the known planets we found the exoplanets and all this stuff well what's really sad about all this and saying well we don't have anything available to send out in the space to do this\nAnd they're saying you know we\nNeed to be able to find ways to get there because we don't have anything to go after our extraterrestrial neighbors or to find them\nIn any soldier system and so with all these advances are saying well we need a budget and now says only plan to return astronauts to the moon after nearly fifty years just got slammed by internal audit\nMassive space launch system is designed to be the world's most powerful rocket supposed to be able to take astronauts to the moon and Mars and back however\nIt costs twelve point two billion dollars to develop and launch this rocket first mission and they're saying it's running years behind schedule it faces major cost overruns on Wednesday government auditors published report highlighting problems with the work of NASA in Boeing they're the biggest contractors for the SOS\nReport flag sixty four million dollars in extra fees awarded by NASA slam bowling for poor performance and question the long term sustainability the super rocket program\nThe report even calls it a question of sustainability of the entire project meaning that even with all the bright idea isn't designed the rocket won't even make it off the launch pad to the moon making making this newly manned moon project a pipe dream\nMean auditors put so much blame for the high costs and delays on Boeing [noise] one\nOf the contractors the company is responsible for about fifty six percent of the new rockets cost but it's years behind schedule and delivering the biggest section of the rocket [noise] and [noise]\nI mean there's just puts you off I mean does it does give you more jobs as to whether or not we went to the moon in the first place [noise]\nYeah she asked him it was it a some sort of a Comic Con or some sort of a science ... convention and\nShe said to him she said you know Mr Aldrin you know why but we got back to the moon and bugs gave it gave him gave her this look like well that's a question that you know little girls don't ask you know this is a big question and I have I have my reservations\nLet me let me play you a little clip I got it right here hold on one second ... Michael play for you listen to\n[noise] [noise]\nThat's not an eight\nYear old question [laughter] that's my question [noise]\nI've worn though but I think I Know [noise] 'cause we didn't go there and [noise] and that's where it happened\nAnd and if it didn't happen [noise] it's nice to know why it didn't happen so in the future if we want to keep doing something we need to know why [noise] something stopped in the past we wanted to keep going [noise]\nMoney because they want to buy new things to keep doing the same thing over [noise] because [noise] money [noise] other things the\nMore money too so we can change what part of this and then what powers they just to be [noise] and ... billion worth [noise]\nYou know when we toured around the world after we came back [noise]\nThe most fascinating [noise] observation\nWas science [noise] it's sad [noise] we did not just us not just America but we the world different countries they sell like they were part of what we were\nSo Mike there's the recording what do you make of that recording\nA man or the last part really makes me sad because can you imagine I mean like we did it what is the world and we came together and actually thought like that again\nIt would be nice wouldn't it but see that's the whole point right the whole point was as I said a couple of nights ago the whole point is to find a reason to unite the planet and you know the moon landing was a time to do that\nRockets discord according to President Nixon that uh you know it was interesting how\nWe can do something peaceful out in space when we fall into the rock has this court so this court on earth and I'm the same things happening now but now all the reports of alien alien signals all these things are excited about that nobody is hearing them because we're all fighting amongst each other\nAnd now says everything we're going to do now has an alien agenda behind it and yeah we don't have the money nor the we have the rockets to go to the moon again or go to Mars or even go anywhere to send anything to find these things got Tony Hawkes air\nRight there are a ah we went to the moon said this is ... ... that rocket should have been like a world treasure\nI I don't find it how you lose the blueprints\nTo it rocket yeah that that was\nGood for humanity it was a rocket to well it was good for the war\nRight it was a safe rocket to better that hydrogen bombs strapped you do or the shuttled to\nRemember that I was in first grade when the when they exploded with the teacher that was\nYeah there has been cold and it was it was horrific\nBut challenger challenger exploded in space and it was because of a little old ring somebody was made in a place called more than ... call just ah probably sixty\nMiles away from my house uh they made it there\nAnd because of the cold it broke Rio ringing costs the leak and that thing went up like a hydrogen bomb for the Saturday Night live and they were did all the Saturn five never did it it had more payload then the shuttle did\nAbsolutely and then they're talking about are facing can't a deal with the regular there how are you telling me that they walked on the moon ... to ... and now they can't just take the seats from the Smithsonian and remake them no\nThey can't\nIt's B. S. it all sounds like beer\nI Know it made it I mean is this just makes you got to be here we are ready for alien contact and according to them we have nothing to go out and meet them with nothing no\nNo it's not that ...\nAnd you know we had a spacecraft that joke when biased or what was it a Hawaiian word ... craft yeah yes yeah and that tell you the truth or how long have we actually been able to like say go out to space and like keep an eye on space\nLong time we've had we've had like what the Kepler Kepler climates being found and gosh all these other things you know it's all and the scientists tell her why we're there\nHow long has that black Knight satellite been up there oh for thousands of you that that went by that get readings from that satellite\nI'm sure they get 'em all the time\nAnd you know how would we know that it didn't pass by us four hundred years ago or five hundred years ago and us not be able to see it and it's been collecting records from that\nWell did you know and I don't know uh how many times you've heard the show um but there was actually a Pepsi commercial did you ever hear about the Pepsi commercial\nPepsi commercial and acting the black night it was a ten minute commercial for Pepsi and it was supposed to contact the black night\nI remember when you did it with a day's Indian or the Australian or\nDo they do yeah yeah yeah I remember that I remember that\nThere was actually a commercial it was put out a I think three years ago\nMarshall the ten minute Pepsi out I don't know when it was played or where it was played\nFor the whole idea was to send a signal to the black Knight satellite a signal of peace and they actually the pick of the ... satellite as this\nThis ancient tool to contact the aliens where there was an amazing thing and there was gonna why are they doing this what\nWhat how how do they know about the black night and and and that's a lot of things go on that don't make the mainstream news and they're fascinating but the biggest frustration tonight for me was\nAll of this NASA go out there and find stuff but we don't have the money even send a rocket to the moon I mean ... ... ... it doesn't make any sense we\nGet we're getting ready to send people out around the moon you know do you think we're really going to see the pictures from that\nWell I don't even think it's going to happen because I was reading or you're talking about the the Japanese artist is supposed to go up\nYeah yeah yeah and don't even I have a rocket and radio they don't have a rocket ready for him yet they don't even have anything ready for him he had to go there\nNothing\nNot that I just I just buy also convenient you know that they can't they they can't do something that people did with the technology of our regular ...\nIt's amazing isn't it it's mind\nBoggling to twenty Eighteen we can't be able to get off the ground all eat it when you first base speech set the gangs and does eat all that they see\nNow my thinking it was all I agree too I mean going by the way\nI cannot play those tones again from the stars [noise]\nUm [noise] I just got word\nBe low tone some people did not hear the lower Jones of the frequency that I played of this so called armada that Russia is tracking [noise]\nAnd it set off alarms all over the United states on radio stations to trick\nSo I'm Sorry if you are in life it's just like the networks I'm Sorry if I [noise]\nDissent alarms out to everybody every this is a this is radio guy this is a real radio at night\nAnd so I sent out the star frequency or the amount of alien frequency or whatever it was\nSet alarms off all over radio stations across the country so I Apologize for that\nI can hear the low frequency I can hear the home and it went up and up and up to the books out [noise]\nSo we'll be back with more ground zero they'll go away [noise]\nThe best use and talk ... news talk Ninety five point five [noise]\nThinking about life insurance what if you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what happens when you call select quote life\nFor example Georgia's forty he was getting sky high quotes from other companies because he takes meds to control his blood pressure but when I shopped around I found him a ten year five hundred thousand dollar policy for under twenty five dollars a month I'm select quote agent dance to be now and believe me if select quotas and shopping for your life", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Billings", "day": "13"}
