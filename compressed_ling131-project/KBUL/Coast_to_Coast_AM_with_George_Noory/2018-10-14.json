university offers over one hundred and fifty highly rain degree programs one hundred percent on line\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great in Virginia\nOnly twenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm generally what I each person is in a check unit\nOr Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah these Akron as ... and um when that controlled holistic environmental\nChamber in other words each person's in personal isolation both and I speak to them when we're doing a technique\nThrough headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber and then I present Emmys sank which is a ... a ... brain synchronization to kind of technology plus guided meditation\nAnd we do five of these uh day typically and what what the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state\nAnd every person listening in their own isolation chamber through the headphones\nNow is it like a cubicle or ... and ... and a decline or well how do you know it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad\nOkay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um it's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that\nBecause you can go deeper with no or external stimulus factions like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um the flow chambers exempt in this\nCase you're not floating you're you're in this this controlled unit and all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank\nYou have headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them and the control unit and our guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right no that's the idea you are isolated and they don't feel alone because you have the headphones on and you know they\nThey're listening through headphones and exercise minor typically about a Fifteen minutes long each one\n... and and people go on these incredible journey friend who see this several times on wet when he now anything since and all the technology is the mine are all beat someone into a data hate\nYes the idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course are ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself\nBy Nora will be technologies been around for a long time and it helps us to go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go on this journey where would you and I knew that [laughter] ... do you think people do it it's kind of a formula right\nYes there's a relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis\nUm there's different progression setter used but it's basically a meditative type of program that's guided often guided where you would just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences during even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience\nBut in my class for instance people have passed life regressions mhm they have contact\nWith all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up to our inner self people experience different kinds of\nAh let's just say eye opening and mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life for ... a regression type flashes are quite common\nAnd there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore\nYour true self\nAnd to open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional self within you\nKnow you tend to question could you ask the house and then you write them down when you come out and then like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal and you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal\nWhatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery because information can be\nTransmitted many different ways\nIt's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways\nSo it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information but uh people have all kinds of profound experiences\nAnd they awakened to\nTheir their true self and they're the answers within them\nMhm yeah so the implications than personal growth in the spiritual awakening that are\nHappening in the can really transformational and I like it because you find your house to them and you need a way you're feeling you William how he died in the direction that\nI Would have my own personal experience now my friend my friend has been a guest on the show before she said that she has in the past encountered\nTools that need help and I think that's fascinating council\nSure um we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just means ... to ...\nUh that's but that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen that comes up in my class as well ah where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say\nTo people that and ... there are people that have died but they are law store for instance someone that may have died\nTwo people that and there are people that have died but they are lost or for instance someone that may have died um quickly and they're just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI Know that that type of thing does happen quite a bit and I'm at ...\nAt the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance it's called guidelines\nI'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um [noise] and to let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMhm mhm so to assist him in crossing over have you ever done this after\nA a\nTragic incident and national tragic incident where massive it's still you know one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact ah during that period of time um that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way I imagine you're having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're shifting those are people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and its its functions in different names and different cultures\nGo ahead and Institute we we presented in I\nThink I'm more or let's just say are very grounded in a scientific waves at least a scientific as we can ... that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented\nIn a very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because really allowed to have their own experience within that I Want to find down a little bit\nMore and now one of the culture or does this and what it calls and other cultures are going to take a quick\nBreak William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about what other countries just exist and and also a little bit more on how you can do this on your own on and live with that but my guess William moment in Miami in are you listening to customers and\nShe's the victim of a devastating crime called mortgage fraud ... title and mortgage are kept on line where thieves foreign and domestic hack them it's simple they forge your title and borrow every penny of equity you having your whole life this police officer\nI Know about title fraud so I register with home title walk and discovered some face had already taken over title thank God I found out in time\nNo bank I don't eat that program or insurance protects you hold title lock will for pennies per day hold tight a lock puts a barrier around your ... title and mortgage the instant it detects tampering there on it helping to shut it down\nFind out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar shirt free with sign up this at home kind of luck dot com\nHome title luck dot com\n[noise] does\nDo them on news on Ninety five point five [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell ... ... am I only cigar and my guest is William boom and we're talking about out of the tiny exploration and self induced antibody exploration\nNot through the trauma that to an actual workshop or it sounds fun regulated type of out of body exploration is is a thing and it's also\nWell done it's very well done it and something that William Bowman has led for almost Twenty years that's in the ... it is difficult but this is not something you can do on your own William where what are the culture has this existed in history\n[noise] Alicia from the very beginning of time I'm Out of body experiences are probably the quintessential I'm a way that throughout history people had profound experiences I mean look at a biblical like revelations begins with I was in the spirit\nAnd if you look back to all the biblical text all the\nTransformational type of experience to keep all their their consciousness was\nThe book called text all the transformational type of experiences people their their consciousness was projected or extended let's say beyond their physical limits and that is in itself a form of out of body exploration it's\nJust that was in two thousand years ago wasn't called that on the way it goes all the way back to ancient Hindu the Buddhist text\n'em to every culture and religion known to man if you start to read it objectively you'll see there's comments about this uh I was in the spirit or I was beyond\nMy physical body let's put it that way and there they had this profound experience\nHow can in town and tiny and validate life after like\nWell it gives you that inside number one it's a shocker for many people just to be aware of the fact that oh my God I continue its a verification that you continue beyond your body\nAnd that's a that's a ... in itself a big life change or for people it's a wake in it because then they realize oh my God there's I continue there's other things that are that are going on beyond the single experience\nAnd it really opens people's minds to the potential what they are [noise] think about it there's um seven and a half billion people on the planet and people don't have a clue\nWhere they're going to death they don't know where they come from before they were born and they don't know really what they are they they assume there are a human being because they were they found themselves in the human\nBody mhm but in actuality\nA consciousness uh can take on any for I I Know from having out of body experiences encountering are all kinds of life forms including by the way animals\nMany people contact a love and love pets six cetera during their out of body experiences and the pets are having out of body experience\nAny new ones that have come sooner already\nKnow or even the ones that are alive I write about this my first book where my my dog McGregor would would follow me out of body and I also had a cat that would do that\n... I mean these this is just real events that are happening the fascinating\nPeople all over the world I mean we're a multi dimensional beans that's what we are and are biological body you know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time\nAnd then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration\nIs that it's multi dimensional and that death is an illusion really I'm no no that's been said but once you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who are passed\nAnd you're doing this face to face this is life changing you no longer need a psychic the actors the intermediary you you you're empowered to discover the answers for yourself\nAnd it's really to find out what kind of journey or we all on because this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know what I did when I interviewed Raymond Moody on my show and you know the ... the grandfather and clean the term life again and and he had expressed to me\nIs that\nHe doesn't know for sure\nThat that yeah life after death exist because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard thousands and thousands of reports of people who live here in\nHis life after life ... ... he still doesn't as a scientist as a ... right now I Know for sure this is\nExactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need books study research will never give you that kind of verification\nYou can read a thousand books\nYou could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic\nAnd it's not going to give you the inside and the verification you'll get from one out of body experience\nBecause suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards\nI mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\n... and to get away from this bickering and confusion and division I mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being you know you're continuing as you're involving beyond this temporary stage of development\nIt puts everything into a whole different perspective and I'm not the first time I mean this is not the Buddhist up and saying this for a long time\nThat you know we're more than our bodies and that were involved in beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage of our revolution\nYeah and I meant to say that ran in ... he coined the term near death experience sorry I didn't mean like a afterlife that that's just let's say you know when I did my own Google Search on\nI just typed in near death experience in over twenty five million searches come up on Google were not the only ones that are interested in this this is becoming more and more of a\nA phenomenon a popular topic people are interested in what beyond disorder now I have been good not sort of played so much as the er anymore but\nI Want to ask you you could you had an experience like if you were sick and you had this experience for you um you were that can you use this out of body experience to help you in some way can you tell us about that\nWell in two thousand

everything just starts to\nShut down I think it as an interest in just a sec says something to do with it every ... yeah really focusing their attention on their um let's just say their biological urges mhm mhm\nBut children or I I I have an entire chapter devoted to this is my second book about children's out of body experience\nI have received thousands of letters from over the decades from

you close the and create a new ending to it and her dishes a dream technique\nOh absolutely can you do that you can run nightmare\nIs a ... is a reflection of your fear\nAnd during and it's a matter of fact it's a technique I teach um that we have the ability to confront and let's just say dissolve our fears during an out of body experience in a very elegant manner you send loved to the fear during the out of body experience\nUm in other words you don't run from it you can from it and you send loved to it and dissolve that fear and you do it fully conscious not just in a dream\nBut imagine it works in a dream to but imagine how much more powerful that would be if you're fully absolutely conscious\nAnd you do the same technique where you are literally dissipate in dissolving fears are blocks that's the great block for self knowledge is fear\nRight it's\nIt's a great block that all of us confront and one way or another it's it's an invisible barks at everybody creates around themselves and that's important I find that out of body exploration gives us that ability to confront and dissipate and dissolve\nThose fears that end up uh that just said eliminating our our

mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population a and it still used today right actively unfortunately to control um ... you know societies\nOr we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be um feared\nAnd ... that is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when we have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal\nAnd it sounds a little grandiose putting in you know that you know my God I'm more than my body I Am a mortal I'm I'm not some um week pathetic\nBeing that needs to be manipulated or told what to think I you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be\nAnd that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body it really does help you and your level of consciousness and\nForget about tiny problem in life that you feel are still large because our brains me in that way they surely they are insignificant when you compare him to hell down our universe really is I'm Talking about being beyond Bonnie\nYeah yeah and it was\nOur our universe really is I'm Talking about being beyond our body yeah yeah\nAnd what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nAnd you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance the political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff 'cause you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game it's foot here the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience so that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer upon of anyone else any belief system government religion\nYou are free of all that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the rock that we tend to get in with his aunt or uncle news that we hadn't ridiculous that's and\nYou realize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self\n... that's the core\nIssue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it's suddenly awoke one day and I knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars are being ... none of that would occur\n... because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connect and there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly I'll be connected to only the ones that want to be connected to [laughter]\nGo we go beyond the ego\nYeah we we were going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to take your\nCalls to simply give us a call and I only think I can listen ... damn [noise]\nSure and testing let's go to Jamie in Washington state first time caller here comes to coast and Jeannie when does your question\nHuh how's it going great where does your question my friend\nI'm curious if there's any relevance between the out of body experiences in a memory loss\nOr questioned Clinton you mean not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\n... coalition a little bit of both the uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experience itself\nBut not\nInterfering with your like everyday memory of meaning to recall of certain things that you use all the time so to speak like we're in stuff like that and drive in things like that\nOh I Would say definitely not a I can speak for myself I think my memory um is excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years\nOr so I I well like I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory loss and ... and I'm issues when you have a brain trauma but not so much the antibody techniques it doesn't just served their brain memory patterns and All right\nNo I've not seen any correlation for that I have um I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experiences or have an incredibly productive and lives in their late years like Robert Monroe did and others that are written many books\nI'm In their later years let's say [noise] so if anything I think there's the opposite I think ah you open up potentially um certain pathways that enhance your ability to remember and to function\nSometimes the hand\nThat enhance your ability to remember and to function\nSometimes the have you ever experienced is Jamie and added money sending\n... ... in them than I can be made to ... to figure myself out so to speak you know yeah Mm make myself poll whatnot with my phone so\nGreat now that's great thank you so much the phone call I appreciate it yeah that's\nOne of the techniques that William talks about is covering you know two out of body channel and I do like the fact that it doesn't end isn't she does with the TV I any type of trauma or a brain injury we want to avoid those they\nThey're not signed no no and that's\nA unfortunately a lot of people do associate the two ... um and it's and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do a for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese or an element of near death but\nThe two were actually even though ... ... ... are part of the near death experience there also independent of them so it's important distinction to make\n... interesting um I just go to Dave in New Jersey or ... or ... Elena night\nHey Lisa the call is Kelly from inside the studio\nAnd testing [laughter] right so\nThis is where it might get a little weird but I was he a lawyer I was growing up in a place called ... town Pennsylvania we moved here when I was about to when I started getting visitation\nThere were these patients they gave me um I first saw a ... a day I Can't wait for the school\nWhere I filled out as gay load my hands both by days where there's all those two girls and their lives were in charge scaly inhabited exactly when the war and I saw her life before add to doubt but off they gave me a chance for a ...\nI was younger I didn't know what it was how are you liar of\nFascinating is very cool too can be deeply competent is ...\nIs a cat and um there are multiple um experiences and reports of\nPeople that have ah let's just say knowledge of events are not only in the past but in the future or what we would perceive as the future you know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time\nAs we know we look at time into linear but yet those of us who have out of body experience is quickly realize that for instance you can live a life in five minutes\nIt's ... it's there was no time as we perceive it then non physical reality it's a whole and all that that's why it's important to learn about the\nThe dynamics of our true home are true reality which is non physical 'cause it everything functions and a little different than it does here [noise]\nUh and that's why it's important to begin to read or at least learn about how non physical reality functions\n... that sounds ... can you ask in along it makes you called him I appreciate it and we and can you ask in going into and out of body Syrians and\nCan you ask in going into and out of money sitting and media destiny question or\nHow does he get something out that really going into the future more than he giving out your ...\nYou can you can ask anything a matter of fact that's one of the things I Try to um teach people is to be open to asking if you have a question asked to get the universe is willing to provide the answers\nYour higher self or your higher mind however you perceive that it wants to assist you if you're open to that assistance and there is no limit to what can be it let's just say obtained\nUm there's literally no limit\n... but you have to ask\nYeah it's great to see if she did she are wild card line to berry in St Louis Hi Danny how are you\nHi Lisa thanks for taking my call\nI had a question you your guest um years ago while we were about ... idea that we're really close to the past subtly while we were out of town and um I I wouldn't call back and I just didn't let in my lap view of him to be in a casket so I didn't go\nOff and I was upset about that and I had this dream and that was back at least by the time\nAnd I was chasing the suspect through a a ... a mall very familiar with but when I made the term I mean it was my dad he was standing there who right there and it wasn't fuzzy or not it was my dad ... and I said to him I just said dad and he he held his hand up\nAnd he said you need to settle town it's okay and uh I I Want to talk to him but he was actually fading out and I was I said to him I said dad don't leave pleased Elise and he was gone and I walked up\nBut after I woke up I I it's stress and everything was all gone and I guess my question is\nWhy this dream on that 'cause I was stressed out about it and it was in my imagination or or does she think that maybe that was my dad actually contacted me from the ... you know life after death around settled down because it actually works\nYeah I think it was I mean that's reported by my God countless people report that kind of contact and often it's perceived as a dream like experience uh the universe is a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continue on\nAnd yes the people especially in within thirty days of an individual passing\nThe the the chance of contact is incredibly high a and often will perceive it and a dream like environment because we're more open\nWhen our ego mind is when we fall asleep or Hugo mind set aside and we can begin to experience is but yeah I think that was a valid\nAbsolutely valid a contact Mm uh I Know I've had that with my mother on many occasions and almost everybody I Know it's had some form of contact\nAnd that kind of regard with a loved one\nHeat sounded very healing yeah say what it is very\nHealing I I think that's a wonderful experience\nAnd I think your intention was right to see a father in ... you remember him rather than any casket and I think that's a really wonderful intention and he basically did this technique it now\nA casket and I think that's a

pay your even getting up at night to go\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest estate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like wow I hired twenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you do things will allow Louis everything\nIn the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter]\nI Can't wait\nOh surely actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom at the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\n[laughter] I thought it was just so precious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary\nFriend when I was a child too and I didn't think much about it we'll see started telling him what to do like oh in the beginning it was really sweet like oh sue made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat and I'd\nBe like that Phillies sue [laughter] you know\nInnocent but then\nI I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell the story so when I wrote about it and my first book haunted managing springs I changed the name\nOf the people and how old was your nephew epigenetics at this time next okay in\nOne night in the middle of the night he came into our bedroom crying and he was covered in scratch marks\nAnd he was bleeding okay he was bleeding and it looked like he had been bitten all over his body and I pulled off his shirt\nAnd he was bruised and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had his in his hands and I ran down to his room and he had to cut the ear off of our cat and he said the stew made him do it oh\nDear you said stew I'm Sorry he kept\nCalling it stew this goes through it wasn't sue I'm Sorry it was too well it was after about two or three months my nephew had his speech and pet him and and really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name\nThe one that died now the one that did not like me anymore right for and before oh\nIt was awful he said to me stupid doesn't want you any here anymore\nAnd then how would you do did you\nOh my gosh I was so frightened you've just been even to recall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell that story um\nIt it was the ... we had to I we had no choice right had no choice oh where did you do that oh\nWe had no choice and then if it's if it's to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties and like I said in the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that silly stew\nHe stole something again you know and I might find oh my eyeglasses in the freezer or or they might be missing completely for a week and then I might find them outside in the driveway\nIt was just kind of ... in the beginning and and and fairly innocent\nBut what I really think happened was not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but um because see remember it was hunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several people wins or men knows I'm just going to\nSay that well what we ended up finding out was that it was it puts on a portal [noise] it is it's it's really strongly haunted still\nI'm ... and you are still living there no milk no after\nFive years we did get out we got out and the day that we left the day that we decided we had to leave every single doorbell and the house was going off with was a four story home and we had doorbell is on every level\nWe took the door but [laughter]\nOn the first level and then the second level went off we took those batteries out the third level went off it it felt like they were driving us crazy\nLike driving you out would happen celebrating\nWhat came of that place what would happen to me\nWell actually after we sold it then the Maddox family bought it and this was in two thousand five and they just sold it about two years ago but wildly owned it in two thousand fourteen [noise]\nOn a ledge was voted number six on the nation's top ten most haunted places just behind the lazy boarding house\nBy USA Today and the Huffington Post who\nWould buy something like that\nIt actually you know what about how about true beauty what happened with this house is that it was actually bought by someone who turned it into a Buddhist\nA Buddhist\nRetreat and it's wonderful because last I heard is that they cleared all the spirits away and that the house is happy again so I Am really glad\nThat I Would take a lot of work but they have done so much work than men with ...\nExperts and they uh they change the gardening they change the direction of certain\nYou know that really works ... apparently it worked because it's it's it's free [laughter] fascinating about a hundred years\nYeah it was tremendously haunted and then later after you know me being a historian and everything I wanted to know why the house was so haunted [noise] and I won't get into that right now I did\nFind out that there was a reason there always is any time something tragic or horrible happens it leaves a psychic in in print or bruises if you will that can be felt by some people and I'm One of those people unfortunately\nWell at least you know that about yourself some people may feel it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives and\nThis is so interesting that you should bring this up because I'm actually my children's stepmother um their mother died of cancer when they were one and three years old\nAnd so um they're both very smart people on both of them there have there a doctorate degree my son interesting enough um is a doctor at Stanford right now and he was the only one in our family who never saw a ghost when we were living it on a ledge or experience something paranormal\nAnd I really believe it was because he just didn't want to you [laughter]\nKnow he had an analytical mind do want to become a doctor conferred that late he\nTotally turned it out so all these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until I knew\nWhen to do with the Joneses friends do you mind that moms go turn [laughter] and ah\nIt it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally\n[laughter] oh it has she validated you\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling so now you still live in managing springs right Joes little the history of that area\nWell this I Believe this is one and this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right yeah\nOh well this was his home base he used to hang out here all the time because we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in the Rockies and um so he actually built a lab on the top of pikes peak the man he was fascinated with managed to springs\nIn the middle of the Rockies ... and I'm so he actually built a lab on the top of pikes peak the man he was fascinated with managing springs especially because we have some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter of vanity springs on the beautiful hiking trails that we have and my hope this will shake my hand and never find true north I kid you not be the end of the American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in these sacred places the trees actually grow kind of sideways I'm just curious but the hair on my back on my arms and my neck\nWill go up ...\nYou can feel it um and the other thing that curious about it is that\nBecause of these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the clubhouse hotel and he was watching as these birds um or just\nCircling over managing springs like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense of ability to find their way through north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain and it was the he was saying he was the lady that maybe because of the magnetic anomalies at the Brits were hunting\nConfused because they were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and in like ... how the pilots\nTo sing it really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing Springs Colorado when we come back with my guest Stephanie waters I Am the guardian listening to coast to coast am\nSo Tiffany chose a little bit more about you when we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're real in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just ... you\nKnow I'm\nI think another reason why I'm that\nPeople were drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had to pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nWhat have you right over their natural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that the um native is actually curse the town after that and that's why it's so hot that\nMakes sense to me [laughter] yeah just yeah it does now you live there I Do ... and you like it [laughter] you\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here and I am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened to OK a year ago it was September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge now this\nFor your own body it was awful he ... he was suicide um\nCome to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a high incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism and I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to\nUm processing it but they they don't know how to\nChannel the energy of manage to that is the leg and that that's why there is so there are so many um artist answer singer musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly channel this energy for the powers of good [laughter]\nIf you actually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't\n... it will turn against you it will become a negative force and I know that because it happened to me when I first\nMoved here [laughter] oh and I see it happening to other people would I have one of them\nMy a godsend moved in with me a year ago and I said I was trying to help them out he was gone through a hard time and I have this beautiful addict apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and bathroom and I said he could live there for free just needed to get a job he was only here for a week and he you know the the spirit a manatee Wilber took him and he goes I can\nFeel it I can feel it I've never felt so good in my life you know [laughter] I said well you got to be careful well he burned out and about a month [laughter] and it was really sad\nHow do you suggest people process that energy wherever they live if it's a haunted house or if it's a a relative how do you channel that energy\nWell I definitely don't want to be around\nI said I I Try to keep you know a healthy attitude about it if if I can call it that [laughter] because you have to think about this why is it goes here why are they lingering that can't be good [laughter]\nBecause there is a regional business right\nWell yeah but I mean that's that's that's a lot of anger too if you think about it and [noise] um what do you say that\nI can you would have to have a lot of anger to be ... it to be tethered here um if you are full of light and full of love and full of Christ consciousness whatever you want to call it\nI don't think you'd be tethered here after life I think that you would want to move on and towards the life um\nYou know you're going to the point there you'd these beings wanting to see each other here to hunter disrupt people because they have a grudge\nWell some of them I Believe our conscious and some of them I don't think that they know that they are here still but they're they're all troubled I you know I Love these stories when people go on my bed and breakfast is haunted but only by us friendly spirit I'm like give me a great\nThere are no such thing as a friendly those Casper or otherwise\n[laughter] will because it why would they why would they stay that's a good point\nIt's trawling it's trawling and and when you sit around with this okay it it it can it can lead you down a dark road okay I've seen it happen to my friends I mean I don't watch TV and I haven't for Twenty years and it's funny that I'm In this business because now all these goes hunting shows or on TV [noise]\nUm and I guess in the last year or two you hear all these stories about these people that are on these goes hunting shows and they kill each other and [laughter] you heard about this stuff I think they get involved into a dark force you know it's nothing to play around with\nOur own goes troubled and our own lives\nThat I Believe so I think\nThat everyone has a different opinion now I Want to tell you something this last book that I just wrote was actually written because of a ghost\nI was called on the telephone to write a story to help this poor person who has been demonized for the last hundred years I helped her cross over by writing this last book and I have that that's a matter of fact\nIs that been forgotten ...\nBoth legends allure of the Rockies by ship for and it just came out and the very first story\nIs true I Swear to God Knows about it [laughter] pardon jealous about it okay about\nIts it actually begins in Nineteen eighty five\nI was a college student and I decided to go to this little mining town to um interview the owners of this old theater and I'm not going to mention the theater 'cause I Want people to buy my book [laughter]\nAnyway they go to I go to the theater and I have an amazing paranormal experience where I actually saw the former owner of the theater and she was crying and she was upset because her name had been painted [noise]\nWell I didn't know what to do when I got back to school I'm not going to write this story they are going to think I'm not ... did not tell this story to anyone you know I've been single since I was little kids so I\nSometimes to just put it out in my mind and don't tell anyone\nOkay so now flash forward to two thousand sixteen I had written for books on got ghosts legends lord of the Rocky Mountains and live quite happy to rest on my little Rory laurels\nAnd I ... out of the blue got a telephone call from the Colorado alarm company about an insurance\nOn Harrison Avenue and those historians out there might know where that is\nBut only a historian would know where that was\nAnd that being said this was a message left on my home number now I was getting ready to take a walk I heard the phone rang and I was like I'm not going to get it but something told me to get it so five minutes later I went and checked the phone and I'm like oh my gosh this is an intrusion signal at the\nAt the this place you know in the mountains and I'm like what they call me I'm three hours a day\nAnd furthermore I mean only I Would know where this place is 'cause I'm a historian I mean this was really weird not even the same area code or anything so I called the Colorado alarm company right back and said why in the devil are you

every seven years and so it seems to be true\nNow I looked into this and I'm like going All right well when's the last time that we've actually had somebody tried to remove the curse\nAnd it was back in two thousand\nAnd what happened was in Nineteen Ninety nine we had a huge lead again and it wiped out our spa building and it was almost going to be demolished\nThe Murphy company came in and they spend up quite a lot of money to have this\nBuilding completely Reagan got it because it had to get rid of all this ... this and that was like three million dollars right there [noise] but anyway just to make sure that their investment was not going to be flooded\nThey actually asked five members of the Native American Indian canceled come here and do a healing right over the town and over this fall building and I actually read the article in the Colorado Springs does that\nAnd it said after they did the healing ritual in front of the spa building that five crows flew up into the air\nAnd not even being able to find true not north flew into the building and crashed I'm not kidding you you've got if you want to look it up it's easy to do\nLooking [laughter] and then an omen I don't\nKnow but you know what in two thousand Thirteen it flooded again it didn't work\nNow right [laughter] if feels like an elementary maybe they shouldn't do there again yeah I mean not with a concept I mean there are\nCertain things to do that for these history tours and things that are being done in these sacred land ... or ... being built and so forth where's the this fine line there to honor and respect the lore of that particular lane and\nYeah I I say thanks every day you know to the good lord to the spirits that be to the land that be and I give there is a legend about managing springs that you're not allowed to leave and unless you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you come here because you are supposed to learn a lesson you don't come here because it's a choice you\nMark summoned to this town\nI Know that sounds crazy but I have talked to so many people over the years and I always ask them I said so what brought you to manage to springs hallways the same story well it was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran out of yes uh-huh and stuff like that and when you hear so many of them you know this isn't it\nIt was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran out of yes uh-huh and stuff like that and when you hear so many of them you know this isn't a coincidence\nMm interesting so let's go back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to those types of energy or maybe you have a ghost in your house or something that might be\nVisiting you what what do you suggest to people that maybe don't want you want to move to transition when it move on already yeah\nSee I think that when someone dies now I I Want to ... this would make sure that I don't offend anybody is religious or spiritual beliefs this is these are just my feelings I think when someone dies for the first three days or so that maybe their spirit linger it's that they stay here some people believe that some\nYou know maybe you just hang around to see her funeral and then you leave if you're not have both [laughter] um other stay right up but if\nThere is a lingering energy in your home get rid of it or move\n[laughter] it's usually owns that particular place a\nSeat I earlier in the conversation I did say that my house has haunted that I live in now and that I Want to say but the ... that it is it used to be the pikes peak Bible college that has a very interesting history\nAnd anyhow the other day band that it is that the valley so than this time of year I actually heard choir and music in my house I've lived here for Fifteen Years have never heard that before when I ran into the dining room and then it it ceased\nI Know it was inside of my house I heard it my dogs hurt it they were handling is going on\nI think that's a residual it's like a group in time you know quantum physicist and explain it better than I can but I just think of it is like Brent toast\nYou can still smell the front so [laughter] it's gone yeah I live\nIn time make more sense where it could be a coming back into this dimension temporarily in a split second\nYes and see that doesn't have a consciousness the choir music that I heard did not have a consciousness who\nYou mean by no means it was just like I heard it in the room like some it was a burping time does that make sense didn't have a conscious\nIt's yeah it's just music that I heard like they came through sometimes believe it or not I can hear the trains that used to run behind my house that ran in over a hundred years yeah so yeah when I hear\nSo I don't know other people\nDo [laughter] you have anybody around that you could ask a much\nMore in tune with the higher laws of nature as I said delicately they can they can pick up on it too had children especially that's why I Love it when when little children come on my tour is because um I turned it down a little bit so I don't scare them so much but ah the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to the\nRight to read so back to where people feel that they're afraid of goes through thing that they're not usually wanting to stay they want to move on or they should leave on it and\nMove on I think it would be like you know when you're hungry you just know to eat\nHow do you help but being do that how would you suggest or how would you teach someone to us this this goes to move on\nWell you can always try talking to it I Swear it works and what would you ask\nI tell it are you you need to move on you know you're not supposed to be here anymore and I know this is your house and you love it that you are not supposed to be here anymore your loved ones that are waiting for you on the other side you need to go\nAnd just talk to them like a kind person would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get caught\nSo would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get caught here it's it's really sad if you think about these go centers that go out and our teasing them like they're like they're like in the zoo or something\nYou know he's not very nice\nLooking Ghostbusters where they could vacuum them up and put them into two yeah when you ask this where you say to this this entity that might be hanging around and causing this just move on ... ... why do people get scared\nI think that you know what those timing is addicting first of all it is so fascinating we both been fascinating with what's on the other side and then once you have validation I tell you what it does not stop it that it's like gambling or something it\nOpens up a whole new world as opposed to the moon and I can't\nBelieve this happened and then you do feel special because so many people want a validation that there is life after death let's be honest\nAnd when you do have it happen it blows your mind and you will never forget it and you will never let anyone talk you out of what you saw the that's what happened to me when I was a child my parents told me that it was because they drop me on the head when I was a baby imagine that\nSo I mean they all my life I was told that I was crazy and I'm not [laughter] other people have had it\nHappen in ...

do the tours you have a group to comes with you and it's more of an active type of tour right\nMy two words it's because the town itself is very active and this is how I Do my tour is um if you look at my website manager legends that time you will see that there's very little information on there after Seventeen years there's a reason for that I don't have a meeting sites because before my tours\nI actually do a prayer and a meditation on ask for the spirits which one wants to come out and talk tonight\nSo the tourists do change night by night and you never know which spirit is going to come out and play quite interesting\nDoes the ... specific date and time and all that you think are not as validated\nNo I didn't say that at all I'm just saying that's how I run my tours okay\nThere are always different they always change because that's how the paranormal is it's always changing it's always different\nThat there are some spirits that are pretty consistent but I called those kind of has much like fishing I mean as much as I Love to go fishing sometimes I don't catch it's darn thing and that's how those hunting is you just never know what's going to happen and then sometimes

ball\nBall\nYou know I Can't believe how easy it will save hundreds of dollars in my car insurance with Geico\nKnow we've got a good person and Maureen car insurance\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from how great it is urging him only twenty four people\nCan attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop\nI'm generally what I mean each person is in the Czech unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah these Akron as ... and\nI'm Lynn that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in and personal isolation both and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber and then I present\nEmmy sank which is a ... a ... a brain synchronization to kind of technology plus guided meditation\nAnd we do five of these uh day typically and what what the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state\nAnd every person listening in their own isolation chamber through the headphones\nNow he did like a cubicle or on and on the line or how you know it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um it's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber\nWhy is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus actions like\nI'm In many ways the same concept behind um the flu chambers exempt in this case you're not floating you're you're in this this controlled unit and all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank\nHeadphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them and their control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right\nNo that's the idea you are isolated\nAnd they don't feel alone because you have headphones on on you know\nThey they're listening through headphones and exercise minor typical you about a Fifteen minutes long each one\nAnd and people go on these incredible journey friend who's been several times um\nLong each one and\nAnd people go on these incredible journey friend who's been several times on wet when he ... he is the ... and ... data hate\nYes the idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course\nAre ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself by nor will be technologies been around for a long time that it helps us to go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go I'm turning where would you and I knew that there isn't a pattern that you take people's you know it it kind of a formula right\nWell there is a yes or is it relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis um there's different progression setter used but it's basically a meditative\nType of program that's guided often guided where you would just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences during even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance\nPeople have passed fly for aggressions mhm they have contact\nWith all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up to our inner self people experience different kinds of\nAh let's just say I opening a mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life or ... or regression type flashes are quite common\nAnd there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore\nYour true self and\nTo open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional self within you\nKnow what questions could you ask the house and then do you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal and you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever in whatever kind of information may have come to you\nOr imagery 'cause information can be\nTransmitted many different ways\nIt's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information\nBut uh people have all kinds of profound experiences\nAnd they awakened to\nTheir their true self and they're the answer is within them\nMhm yeah so the implication that personal growth in the spiritual awakening that are\nHappening in the can really be transformational and I like it because you by your house to them I mean in a way you're feeling you William how he died in in the direction that\nI Would have my own personal experience\nFeeling you William how he died in in the direction that I Would have my own personal experience now my friend my friend has been a guest on the show before she said that she has in the past encountered\nSouls that need help and I think that's fascinating councils that\nSure um we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just means ... to ...\nUh that's but that will happen in um\nIn all the classes that can happen that comes up in my class as well or where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say to people that and ... there are people that have died but they are law store\nFor instance someone that may have died um quickly and they were just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI Know that that type of thing does happen quite a bit and I'm at\n... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance it's called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um [noise] and\nTo let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMhm mhm so to assist them in crossing over have you ever done this after\nA\nTragic incident and national tragic incident were masked is still lean on one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era and myself and I received a lot of contact or during that period of time um that was a\nThat was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way of managing your having coffee one morning in your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that so there was a lot of people\nThat were a shift in those um\nPeople that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and its its functions and different names and different cultures\nBut then I went to two we we presented in\nThink I'm more or let's just say I'm very grounded in a scientific waves at least the scientific as we can that goes for all the training here that it's a it's done in a way that's presented\nIn a very logical way that's um understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allowed to have their own experience but then all of that\nI went to find out a little bit more now one of the culture or does this and what it's called in other cultures are going to take a quick\nBreak William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about what are their culture sickness then and also a little bit more on how you can you didn't on your own on and live with that but my guess William ...

I mean these\nThis is we're just real events that are happening the fascinating people all over\nThe world I mean we're a multi dimensional beans that's what we are and are biological body you know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time\nAnd then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration\nIs that it's multi dimensional and that death is in a ... really you know that's been said but once you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who are passed\nAnd you're doing this face to face this is life changing you no longer need a psychic to act as the intermediary you you you were in power to\nAnswers for yourself and really to find out what kind of journey are we all on because this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know what I shared this with you but I just interviewed Raymond Moody on my guy is show and you know the ... the grandfather and coined the term a life after death\nAnd um she had\nExpressed to me after Fifteen Years in doing is\nIs that\nHe doesn't know for sure\nThat that yeah life after death exists because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard thousands and thousands of reports of people who have experience\nIs a life after life it's just phenomenal and he still doesn't as a scientist as a ... right is not you know for sure yes is\nExactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need books\nStudy research will never give you that kind of verification you can read a thousand books\nYou could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic and it's not going to give you the inside and the verification you'll get from one out of body experience\nBecause suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards I mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\n... and to get away from this bickering and confusion and division I mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being you know you're continuing as you're involving beyond this temporary stage of development\nIt puts everything into a whole different perspective and I'm not the first time I mean this is not the Buddhist up and saying this for a long time that you know we're more than our bodies\nAnd that were involved in beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage of our revolution\nYeah and I meant to say that ran in ... he coined the

down to\nThe average age of first out of money doing things going on you know that people are required recount Canton and it's often heated and it happens over and over again the declines during early teenage years well anything can really get that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to\nShut down I think it as an interest in just a sec says something to do with it everybody ... yeah refocusing\nTheir attention on their um let's just say their biological urges seven but children or I I have an entire chapter devoted to this is my second book\nAbout children's out of body experience\nI have received thousands of letters from over the decades from parents who share their experiences\nWith about their children unfortunately I'm In our society sometimes these or misinterpreted and you know they they end up taking their child to a a psychologist or psychiatrist because it's out of there\nOut of the norm for our family to deal with huh so they end up giving the child Ritalin or something else to calm them down or whatever or it's unfortunate because there it's just\nNatural you know ... or ... you know what's funny is that Ninety over Ninety percent of Americans believe that there is an afterlife\nThat we are non physical spiritual being in other words and if we are as most people believe them why would we be locked into a biological machine for our entire life Web when that's not what we are\nWe we have a natural ability to explore beyond their physical limits the Buddhist sub known this forever that's why they trained young Buddhist boys at a very young age to be getting their training and meditation because they're more open to having profound\nSpiritual or multi dimensional experiences when they're young\nRight right and then you know\nWe don't receive that ... we've been trained to be a very materialistic from birth so that has a tendency we have to overcome that conditioning that most of us have or the\nTo not mostly focused on\nSo that has a tendency we have to overcome that conditioning though most of us have or the\nRight to not mostly focused on the external when we're young somewhere between two to five years older than the he's putting them on the average number amount of money is very important yes\nThey're very young and they continue up to puberty and a lot of them are a major I have twin boys and my boys both of them would have just profound experiences now it was it was amazing to me what they would do it at night\nYeah that's incredible I had one on now you say it's common even encounter other senior experiences can you go back and read it the way you had a nightmare and you want to go back and you went to\nClose the and create a new ending to it and this is a dream technique\nOh absolutely can you do that\nYou can run nightmare is a ... is a reflection of your fear\nAnd during and it's a matter of fact it's a technique I teach um that we have the ability to confront and let's just say dissolve our fears during an out of body experience in a very elegant manner you send loved to the fear during the out of body experience\nUm in other words you don't run from it you confront it and you send loved to it and dissolve that fear\nAnd you do it fully conscious not just in a dream but imagine it works in a dream to but imagine how much more powerful that would be if you're fully absolutely conscious\nAnd you do the same technique where you are literally dissipate in dissolving fears are blocks that's the great block for self knowledge is fear\nRight it's\nIt's a great block that all of us confront and one way or another it's it's an invisible box that everybody creates around themselves and that's important I find that out of body exploration gives us that ability to confront and dissipate and dissolve\nThose fears that end up uh that just said eliminating our our ability to express ourselves fully in this life\nAlthough he eighty six percent to respond and supported no fear no fear tearing out of money that they had a very peaceful and\nYes according to this survey\nHating [laughter] that's very high\nIt yes it was it was pretty high remember that a lot of people responding to me also were not um they were open to the experience to some degree I have to\nAcknowledge that that's a good point uh they were not\nLet's say indoctrinated with this health far and damnation ... I'm a belief system that of course is nothing but fear\nHere is a controlling mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population a and it still used today actively unfortunately the control\nUm ... you know societies or we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be um feared\nAnd ... that is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when you have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal\nAnd it sounds a little grandiose putting in you know that you know my ...\nThe real life number one you were a mortal and it sounds a little grandiose for them you know that you know my God I more than my body I Am a mortal I'm I'm not some um\nWeek pathetic being that needs to be manipulated or told what to think I you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be and that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body it really does help you\nAnd your level of consciousness and forget about tiny problem than in life that you feel are so large because our brains make them that way but surely they are insignificant when you compare him to\nHow vast our our universe really is I'm Talking about being beyond our body yeah yeah\nAnd what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nAnd you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance the political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff could you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game it's foot here you know the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer upon of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's and that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the ... that we tend to get in with his his uncle news that we hadn't ridiculous and\nYou realize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ...\nThat's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it's suddenly awoke one day and knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars there'll be no no ... none of that would occur\n... because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connect it but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly all be connected to only the ones that want to be connected to [laughter]\nDo we go beyond the ego\nYeah we we were going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to take your\nCalls 'cause he'll say to give us a call and I only thing I listen he because he couldn't stand [noise]\nSure and has to let's go to Jamie in Washington state first time caller here and coast to coast and Jamie what is your question\nHuh how's it going great what is your question my friend I'm\nCurious if there's any a relative in between the out of body experiences and a memory loss\nGood question the question I mean not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\n... a coalition of a bit of both uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experience itself\nBut not\nInterfering with your like everyday memory of needing to recall of certain things that you use all the time so to speak like war and stuff like that and drive in things like that\nOh I Would definitely not a I can speak for myself I think my memory I'm excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years\nOr so I I well like I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory loss and and um issues when you have a brain trauma but not so much the out of body techniques that doesn't just ...\nAnd then All right no I have not seen any correlation for that I um I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experiences or have an incredibly productive and\nLives in their late years like Robert Monroe did and others that are written many books\nI'm In their later years let's say [noise] so if anything I think there's the opposite I think ah you open up potentially um certain pathways that enhance your ability to remember and to function\nSometimes the have you ever

to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you\nYou do things a little out literally everything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till the\nGhost of surely actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom at the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\n[laughter] I thought it was just so\nPrecious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary friend when I was a child too and I didn't think much about it [noise] will soon started telling him what to do like oh in the beginning it was really sweet like oh sue made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat and I'd\nBe like that Phillies sue [laughter]\nYou know innocent but then uh I I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it and my first book haunted managing springs I changed the name\nOf the people and how old was your nephew epigenetics at this time next okay and\nOne night in the middle of the night he came into our bedroom crying and he was covered\nIn scratch marks and he was bleeding case\nHe was bleeding and it looks like he's been bitten all over his body and I pulled off his shirt\nAnd he was Bruce and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had his in his hands and I ran down to his room and he had to cut the ear off of our cat and he said the stew made him do it oh\nDear you said stew I'm Sorry he\nKept calling it stew this goes through it wasn't sue I'm Sorry it was too well it was after about two or three months my nephew had his speech and pet him and and really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name the one that died\nNow the one that did not like me anymore right for and before oh it was awful\nHe said to me stupid doesn't want you any here anymore\nAnd then how would you do did you\nOh my gosh I was so frightened you can even to recall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell that story um\nIt it was the ... we had to I we had no choice right had no choice oh what did you do that\nAnd if it's if it's to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties and like I said in the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that silly stew\nHe stole something again you know and I might find all my eyeglasses in the freezer or or they might be missing completely for a week and then I might find them outside in the driveway and\nIt was just kind of ... in the beginning and and and fairly innocent\nBut what I really think happened was not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but um because see remember it was hunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several keeping wins or menus I'm just going to\nSay that well what we ended up finding out was that it was it that sign up for it all it is it suits dream lead strongly haunted still I'm ...\nAnd you are still living there no milk no after\nFive years we did get out we got out and the day that we left\nThe day that we decided we had to leave every single doorbell and the house was going off with was a four story home and we had ... on every level and we took the doorbell about the batteries out of the doorbell\nOn the first level and then the second level went off we took those batteries out the third level went off it it felt like they were driving us crazy\nLike driving you out would happen celebrating what came of the place with what happened to her\nWell actually after we sold it then the Maddox family bought it and this was in two thousand five and they just sold it about two years ago but wildly owned it in two thousand fourteen [noise] on a ledge was voted\nNumber six on the nation's top ten most haunted places just\nBehind the lazy boarding house by USA Today and the Huffington Post who would buy something like that ah it actually you know what to talk about how about\nTrue beauty what happened with this house is that it was actually bought by someone who turned it into a Buddhist a Buddhist\nRetreat and it's wonderful because last I heard\nIs that they cleared all the spirits away and that the house as happy again so I Am really\nGlad that I Would take a lot of work but they have done so much work than men with ...\nExperts and they ah they change the gardening they change the direction of certain\nYou know that really works it apparently it worked because it's it's free [laughter] fascinating about a hundred years\nYeah it was tremendously haunted and then later after you know me being a historian and everything I wanted to know why the house was so haunted [noise]\nAnd I won't get into that right now I did find out\nThat there was a reason there always is any time something tragic or horrible happens it leaves a psychic in in print or bruises if you will that can be felt by some people and I'm One of those people unfortunately\nWell at least you know that about you know some people may feel it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives and\nThis is so interesting that you should bring this up because I'm actually my children's stepmother um their mother died of cancer when they were one and three years old and so um they're both very smart people on both of them there have there a doctorate degree my son interesting enough\nAnd so um they're both very smart people on both of them there have there a doctorate degree my son interesting enough um is a doctor at Stanford right now and he was the only one in our family who never saw a ghost when we were living it on a ledge or experience something paranormal\nAnd I really believe it was because he just didn't want to you [laughter]\nKnow he had an analytical mind do want to become a doctor and he\nTotally turned it out so all these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until\nI knew I wanted to do with the Joneses friends do ya my mom's a ghostwriter [laughter] and ah\nIt it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally [laughter]\nSo it has to be validated yeah\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling so now you still live in ... springs right Joes little the history of that area\nWell this I Believe this is one this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right yeah\nOh well this was his home base he used to hang out here all the time because we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in the Rockies and um so he actually built a lab on the top of pikes peak the man he was fascinated with managed to springs especially because we have some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter of the ... springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have and my how this will shake my hand and never find true north I kid you not be the end of the American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in these sacred places the trees actually grow kind of sideways I'm just curious ... the hair on my back on my arms and my neck\nWill go up [laughter] and um you\nCan feel it um and the other thing that's curious about it is that\nBecause of these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the clubhouse hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just\nCircling over managing springs like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense of ability to find their way through north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain and it ... they he was saying he was speculating that maybe because of the magnetic anomalies at the Brits were\nCutting confused because they were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and in like ... the pilots\nTo sing it really is a very special place that is to me we will find out more about managing Springs Colorado when we come back\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you when we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there where else in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nYeah um\nI think another reason why I'm that people\nWere drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had to pack between them that they would not\nFight them and they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nWhat have you right over their natural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that the um natives actually curse the town after that and that's why it's so haunted\nMake sense to me [laughter] yeah it does yeah it does now you live there I Do ... and you like it [laughter] I Do\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here and I am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened to OK a year ago it was September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge now this\nVery own dead body it was awful he's and he lets suicide um\nCome to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a high incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism and I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to um\nBut they they\nThe energy of managed to that is the legend that that's why there is so there are so many um artist answer singers musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly channel this energy\nFor the powers of good [laughter] if you\nActually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't ... it will turn against you it will become a negative force and I know that because it happened to me when I first\nMoved here [laughter] oh and I see it happening to other people when I warned them\nMy a godsend moved in with me a year ago and I said I was trying to help them out he was going through a hard time and I have this beautiful addict apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and the bathroom and I said he could live there for free just needed to get a job he was only here for a week and he you know the the spirit of mandatory Wilber took him and he goes I can\nFeel it I can feel it I've never felt so good in my life you know [laughter] I said well you got to be careful well he burned out and about a month and [laughter] and it was really sad\nHow do you suggest people process that energy wherever they live if it's a haunted house or if it's a a relative how do you channel that energy\nWell I definitely don't want to be around any negative energy anymore like I said I\nI Try to keep you know a healthy attitude about it if if I can call it\nBad [laughter] because you have to think about this why is it goes here why are they lingering that can't be good [laughter]\nBecause there is on regional business right\nWell yeah but I mean that's that's that's a lot of anger too if you think about it and [noise] um what do you say that\nI can you would have to have a lot of anger to be ... it to be petted here um if you are full of life and full of love and full of Christ consciousness whatever you want to call it\nI don't think you'd be tethered here after life I think that you would want to move on and toward the light um\nYou know you got a good point there you'd these beings want to see each other here to hunter disrupt people because they have a grudge\nWell some of them I Believe our conscious and some of them I don't think that they know that they are here still but they're they're all troubled\nI you know I Love these stories when people go on my bed and breakfast is haunted but only by us friendly spirit I'm like give me a great there are no such thing as a friendly those Casper or otherwise\n[laughter] will because it why would they why would they ... that's a good point\nIt's doing its thing and and when you sit around with this okay ... it can it can lead\nYou down a dark road okay I've seen it happen to my friends I mean I don't watch TV and I haven't for Twenty years and it's funny that I'm In this business because now all these goes hunting shows are on television\nAnd I guess in the last year or two you hear all these stories about these people that are on these goes hunting shows and they kill each other and [laughter] you heard about this stuff I think they get involved into a dark force you know it's nothing to play around with\nOur own goes troubled and our own lives\nThat I Believe so I think that everyone has a different opinion now I Want to tell you something this last book that I just wrote was actually written because of a ghost\nI was called on the telephone to write a story to help this poor person who has been demonized for the last hundred years I helped her crossover by writing this last\nBook and I have that that's a matter of fact is that been forgotten jails and color on his goals legends and lore of the Rockies by ship for and it\nThe very first story\nIs true I Swear to God\nKnows about it [laughter] pardon Jones about it okay\nAbout it it actually begins in Nineteen eighty five I was a college student and I decided to go to this little mining town to um interview the owners of this old theater and I'm not going to mention the theater 'cause I Want people to buy my book [laughter]\nAnyway they go to I go to this theater and I have an amazing paranormal experience where I actually saw the former owner of the theater and she was crying and she was upset because her name had been painted [noise]\nWell I didn't know what to do when I got back to school I'm not going to write this story they are going to think I'm not ... you did not tell this story to anyone you know I've been single since I was little kids so I some times just put it out in my mind and don't tell anyone\nOkay so now flash forward to two thousand sixteen I have written for books on got goes legends lord of the Rocky Mountains and was quite happy to rest on my literary laurels\nAnd I ... out of the blue got a telephone call from the Colorado alarm company about an intrusion signal\nOn Harrison Avenue in those historians out there might know where that is but only a historian would know where that was\nAnd that being said this was a message left on my home number\nNow I was getting ready to take a walk I heard the phone rang and I was like I'm not going to get it but something told me to get it so five minutes later I went and checked the phone and I'm like oh my gosh this is an intrusion signal at the at the this place you know up in the mountains and I'm like well they called me I'm three hours a day\nAnd and furthermore I mean only I Would know where this place is because I'm a historian I mean this was really weird not even the same area code or anything\nSo I called the Colorado alarm can be right back and said why in the devil are you calling me is your call tech number I don't even have the same area code as as this place and it was a man that answered the phone\nAnd it was a woman's voice on my answering machine and the man said I don't know what you're talking about lady and I gave my phone number and he goes we didn't call your house\nAnd I said I got it on my answering machine he goes I don't know what you're talking about you're going to have to take this up with the theatre [laughter]\nI call the police department and I said you know your alarms going off at the theater and they go yeah I got were on our way [laughter] really next morning I\nCalled the mayor of ... this town on most of the name I called the mayor I called the theater I Hope everybody could nobody could give me an answer\nNow did you do have that voice on your side\nLet everybody listen to the first person I called was one of my dear friends dory spent my business partner she is the fact that she's been on good morning America she's pretty well known and and I said what the devil is going on with this and she listens to the tapes you know on my tape recorder on my answering machine I let her listen to it\nAnd she went into a trance and she did a reading and she we found out that I had the same birthday as the former owner of this I'm old theater\nAnd a lot more in common that was just mind blowing and my friend said to me you were destined to write a story about this crying goes because she is very sad that she has been demon all these all these years and no one has hurt her side of the story\nAnd she wants you to correct it for her [laughter] you're kidding me and I said she goes no no I'm not kidding you so I called I called the um the manager of this theater and I told her own lives if I go I Know you're going to be ... I think I'm Crazy relation to this message and\nThe manager of this theater and I told her all of this I go I Know you're going to be ... I think I'm Crazy relation to this message and she calls me back and she goes I Want you to come up here by himself\nAll alone watch that scene is closed in the winter okay and I said well it's you know than her and she goes I don't care to come on up so I get there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Billings", "day": "14"}
