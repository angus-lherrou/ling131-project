getting a good weekend off I Hope and doing something fun and ... in in this period just before Halloween that is our focus for both tonight and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night\nLooking forward to a season with the which it's a in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we had a great show but\nAbout witchcraft in Salem a couple of months ago but in this case uh we'll be talking about in regard to Halloween and some of the festivities it will be taking place and ah and then also the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nAbout the scariest story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true\nAnd also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James who some of you better know as a sportswriter he writes ah he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the ... he was not in he's not in LA tonight\n... originally we had um scheduled I'm Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out he wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to finish in after all which is great because in the tradition of like\nYou know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff um it's a creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night on coast to coast but it won't be any better than tonight will do open lines later on we'll tell you some of the subjects will get to\nIn the news segment in a minute but but by the way speaking of the world series I think we're competing against it right now we're still in in the late innings still tied up unless something changed uh it was a great game\nAnd I don't want to accuse Larry King of being a vampire you know I'm not saying Larry vampire [noise]\nPreserving their innocence and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the siege of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut you do you how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to load thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's\nReally about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak in ... in labs all over the world uh I tell for example the story of the mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars who's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nGot his finger in this whole neural net a business which is a a really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine this because we're already doing it with mice and in in the very near future um you know it's pretty certain that we are going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think of it as a fisherman snatch so you injected into the brain cavity of a mouse\nAnd when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain and then kind of a integrate itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this neuron that has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it\nAnd the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which\nI'm we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that the lawn mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that's that's even better\nBut one of the one of the things that Iran must get foreseen is a day when we eat with the use the one of these ... we can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't need a Keeter\nWord or anything like that so I think\nIs the beginning of the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts are memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore once he had that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts on\nFetched anymore once you have that in our own that you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know quantum computers are on the horizon and so you're talking about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa\n[laughter] way way out there right and so easily\nEasily a whole you know it's not just the ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic\nWeekend right about that tonight and we will I I think\nThat's the way to go not cryogenic the crowd Jennings has that kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think the other technologies are much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know ... and so and I'm not going to try and partially what you said to me it's been a ...\nI think it's fair to say and this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward\nIs when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we can do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically\nThat's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because you know if we if we take our science fiction movies seriously then we're often reminded that what starts off as a really good idea [laughter]\nI couldn't go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\n... thank you thank you [laughter] absolutely oh I\nKnow absolutely and and you're right there this book deals with\nWe're right at the house in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes it in for some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies Rhett are are kind of one foot in the present and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it you know it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about ... in the sky want on the sweet bind by one day\nNo these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about hey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have\nA ... they we are creating these are incredible robots artificial intelligence so we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is the near future but it is it's it's enabling right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I'm reminded of the of the ... song um which I I inevitably come back to an subjects like this history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla and and the the ... the I think this is where\nI'm sort of curious about your approach on this because this book is published by a a publishing company which is known for being state based\nAnd and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion of\nNot just doing things because we can but because we should do and the arts are really important in there too so you know just because we're on the threshold of doing something\nAnd ... who how are we going to make a decision on the implications of when we decide this river Noone would this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I have to give them credit it was their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you've been\nReporting science all your life and I thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this that\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I describe our perfect base in their ... it's just like you know the old dragnet\nSeries you know the facts ma'am right Andrew\n... that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot notes if you can imagine\nOh no I've read through to you you're very young you sound very thorough\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just\nServe this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so here here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um\nI see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence they really spectacular many of them are brilliant\nAre a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this\nBut then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous why I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA\nWith the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics math and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be and\nI explored Hindu wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter] and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I thought like the ... not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my ... my face very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system\nIs I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist sets the system there are some innovations in this book that I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\n[noise] [noise]\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is ah is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is like the weather that was through uploading a brain and putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate was the end used for that um other than our own human vanity that we become immortal\n[noise] yeah I agree with you in and uh I think on another concern a in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive um you know ... and never mind trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let let's talk about some of the\nTechnology that is being used to let's say a I'm a help treat macular degeneration I wouldn't just pick that as an example\nThat's a good way in California right the company in California\nMarketing a retinal implants for people who are have macular degeneration under eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy so a lot of this technology that that are aimed at improving our health Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving immortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about and science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the years well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now\nIs for people who have been kind of disenfranchised um or marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking and we're taking it as a\nBehind and and and and and we're not going to we're not going to take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting when I talk about in the book\nDoes regular I Know you talk like that to the people in Salem no use that kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know and [laughter]\nSo I figured it the late night show so\nI'm trying to get all you're done and now I Know it's\nLate but you know never mind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know tied to have to say what you said was a bus or\n[laughter] but um but I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these what they're calling bug out houses\nRent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world\nOn the chance that you know when the stuff hits the fan there I go again but one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I Hope some I quote former Google engineers and a Google executives are and and others\nWho say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay but hang on to me and you listen I listen to ... ... ... because the idea of having a bug out house right yeah that's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has a has that philosophy\nRight it was ... to ... yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that believes\nThat doesn't that's not the named Jimmy although I understand your point I I'm thinking about I\nI'm more reminded of of ah you know of what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance right they're done they they ... they ... that was there a moment\nAnd the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion to that for example when you think about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral or leads any way we could\nYou know a ... quantify society hits the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all\nIt's the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them and then if that becomes the ... the class that's perpetuated\nI Would say again they had their chance this ... ... it has to there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else who's going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from age do you well time machine right\nMhm yes yes yes yeah no it it it's interesting uh by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside\nWhen in fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and I had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere and the ... at the after party and Jeff bloom was there and a bunch of other guys and I went up to ... I said\nJeff you know you're always like playing a scientist or not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I said sure I I'm just curious I said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up or what he just\nNot just a job and you know he has though I was at ... disappointed in his answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in physics at\nCollege right now you know [laughter] but no job for him but yeah it's in ... I I ... I Love\nYou bringing that up in the dinosaurs had their chance [noise] it's really an indication of how the\nEarth how the world works how the universe works for\nDesign work is designed to work exactly yeah and\nYou know you know you're somebody's religious beliefs aside for a moment let's just talk like strictly science sure um\n... what what we learn is that uh these species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's a meteor or whether it's a a temperature change or or it's a a rampant disease that ... that I'm In you know like the woolly mammoth\nSaber tooth cats and so forth and so on\nAnd the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder why are we doing here and then I think what Arthur C Clark one set and it stuck with me\nHe said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I don't know how long do\nYou know and you wonder are we like outsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just being too clever by a half with a staff thinking that you know we're going to improve life the\nWe're going to improve the human condition and in fact just the opposite happens we do ourselves in I mean that's a real possibility\nAnd and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said they had their chance maybe some some creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance now he blew it\nUp and now here's an age now let me raise up a little differently yeah there was a ... humans killed off species they didn't die out no actually they were killed off\nAs opposed to say\nEvolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow the evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by\nYou know the fact that they you know some giant bird and New Zealand laid these really big exit you know human could eat off for three days and so um you know there's going to so I mean I I realize you can make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some species\nThree days and so to me you know there's going to so I mean I I realize you can make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some species like some\nLike some bare earth some tiger whenever that if we cloned that there and brought him back in ... introduced to the wild not enough time has passed that he couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles\nUm but I Do think when we start looking into the future and then we start making all these plans of who's going to beat and who's going to not be\nIsn't less than half\nAs much Native American there's your average European American is\nRussia [noise] and I am the one I'm going to be fine point five point this is weird or a dog you will am nine Seventy building recently you toward it and you're listening to the news on for like

is Ian but it [noise]\n[noise] we've got a great feeling story\nOur one of those botanical that is so absolutely so amazing David if you're a guy that has overcome severe issue or\nUm\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed the monkeys head and then they re attached\nIt or just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert\nAnd he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig and there are scientists who are her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it\nSo we're once again you know remember I'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart transplant\nSure you remember that uh the Jobbik are sure of what was his name Jobbik right or yeah something like that and um\nEverybody cringed at oh my God way way putting them which lab mechanical hard in a human being and the you know was in South Africa\nRight and yeah I'm ... and ... and ... and\nAnd you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on um we were even getting past mechanical hearts hey by the way in a you talk about things that\nGive me some pause here's one there are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota and you know I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but okay there you are [laughter]\nYou know you know the minute you University of Minnesota's mustard recently do you have a huge research you it's a it's an hour one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just it just I don't know why it just gives me an article but anyway you have three groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called ... really there shape human and pick human ... so these are\nCreatures whose DNA has been knit together using human DNA and she'd be in a or human DNA pig DNA\nAnd they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human hearts for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and neat\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom a\nBut now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility not discuss the book that if you put too much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question too much human DNA too little human DNA then you don't get the human organs\nRight if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain\nTrapped inside of a body of a sheep or a pig I mean these these are the things that are very real now because of our ability to tamper with the\nThat's one of the things that give me give me a little bit later that we really wanted to and what's interesting is that these guys are doing it\nAnd by the way I quote one of the researchers that says yeah that's that's a real possibility that this is not like\nYou know made up all pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this possibility\nBut they're doing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health which is the government's never won funding body for biological genetic engineering so even an I. H. this kind of very um [noise] yeah you know forward thinking funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just push the pause button\nAnd decide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines for\nThe guard rails oh I'm sure I'm sure these guys are not just doing it in violation of the agent probably doing it against the advice of their moms and what do you do yeah yeah they don't mind\nThe oh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then ... says the town over and I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found in my mom's kitchen\nAnd I look back and I'm Out there and the garage at the ... of our how [laughter] making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nAnd I don't ... I Would filled balloons up with it and then send little insects aloft just to see what happens after a while I was eight and a little mad scientist in the area [laughter]\nCreate your own space program against their will right by the by the way\nGuys that come area you're right the mothers I say why don't you get right not filling that already go play tiddlywinks or something safer\nMentioned LA ... as you mentioned LA I Want to mention that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston and LA you kidding me know so I didn't know what I mean the ending fifteens inning game\nThree of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like sinking a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz he's into kind of works and so I don't know I I guess I guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors because that's how that's how it's happening but right now still there's two men on top of the fifteenth and we're we'll keep an eye on it so\nSorry Joe ... is the the island of Dr ... pretty scary it really is but I I still you know now do you think of what the technology that people you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm you know we're Siri you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look on a windows series is it snowing\nYou know or you know Google ... you know by me some more uh ten meet whatever and these commercials and everybody's focused on that type of business and I kind of get it\nBut they were just beginning to learn the downs of having a microphone connected um and and monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another it's interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things to worry about\nAnd that's another thing we're bringing about ourselves okay you're a ... if you're\nAbsolutely right I tell the story of a little girl in Dallas texas\nWho use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by me well you know this a doll house the fancy fancy dollhouse and parents were totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house the parents freak out\nBut here's the punch line and you would think that the parents will have learned a lesson and like ditch the echo you know\nThat I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around Alexa now are you\nKidding me I mean that's the take away I mean you know leaders are oh yeah I Know it's so\nBig brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story\nAnd ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing in will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and death now I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter\nMaybe it there in the ... they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on now we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nAnd for the security of our cut a country I just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so a saying that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nThe anger that kind of a ... year three injuring or your dishwasher everything that's going to get\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now I'm more than eight billion\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese are ... see this as an opportunity to bug us to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show key thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how the came in\nHe killed he killed his wife and the basement and the police started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\n\nMichael before we start getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before we because I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat they police found was that the woman was wearing a face woman wearing a fit but it's one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that they they could actually get this calculate how many feet chi walk and it didn't square with the story from the hospital\nAnd then and then the other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology\nOut at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things that are fine on every aspects of our life that can tell you when you're asleep when you're awake how many feet you are\nWhat your heart rate uh you know if you watch Netflix the the the they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean\nThere ... this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited ... on ourselves than we are well these gadgets\nYeah and I liked a lot of them I mean I were an apple watch by the way they used that as a plot device that thing about the fitbit in a ... a law and order episode last week the exact same thing they\nTook it from the real life oh they do they always do\nNo ripped from today's headlines so he uh but that's where I mean I I think that they like to catch a killer is one thing like people are going to go oh good they got a killer because of the ... that the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court\nThat's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection system\nWhich accidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime\nI mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test\nIt commits a crime I mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having this humongous database of face prince\nRunning a that they've not you're not covering the young\nAnd and and and they have like an eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent\nInaccuracy running with which raises the possibility that\nYou and I got to have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their database but the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and could finger culprits is wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere\nAre saying it's it's more than twenty percent\nAnd so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people are going to be fingered by a ... a screen up\nA Michael deal in the end of life as we know it let's get to keep who's in Virginia on coast to coast am key\nHello can you hear me in a perfectly good ah how are you tonight on getting my um turned back up there you go and you had a question from Michael yes Michael and I argue or speaking about the ah Jarvis cart\nHave uh a couple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because of his ferret experience\nAnd service even there was a whistle blower this call them coast to coast and before but uh but it'll be great to have them on to tell a story about a lot of things I'm One of the um predecessors that artificial heart was a a\nHeart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine and Dr wrestling Nelson or\nWorked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that a sharp a cart was at the University of Utah\nAnd some Thirty years earlier and he and his career as a heart surgery I had some paranormal experience is one of which was a\nWhere he did a surgery that a technique that had never been done before and he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically a ... or whatever was\nPut right in his mind and he did the surgery a from those instructions said he was able to see him his mind and later\nI got to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so if you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like ... did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah I'm a wrestling now and by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to it because I knew there were ... we had our time is pressures and I open lines is where that kind of blown so let me go\nTo a Tracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracy\nMichael I got one question for you here where does it end where did you just stop when do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we that's that's a good question I mean are we playing God yeah and when do we play God is maybe another question but Michael [noise]\nWell I think that is the ultimate\nOh God yeah and when do we played God is maybe another question but Michael [noise]\nWell I think that is the ultimate question the traits he's asking and uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president needs to now we have\nDiscovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book and ... and it's a very telling quote\nAnd I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but ... when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who was in the thick of it\nAnd this this is directly an answer to Tracy is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about\nAnd and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture a child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with a dynamite you know you pick your you you pick your image imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you're going to have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one stink or\nThat Canadian within rice that but it was everything else\nBut I think that's the crux two of the playing God premise are we playing God or aren't we would we cure a disease if the diseases natural it was as God made it natural and the earth is hurricanes\nAre we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid this phrase although I Know it's a popular place phrase\n... that's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really in companies all the ways in which\nYou know when we make a better break pad or do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but it wasn't really a matter of playing God I I think it's more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplants I I mean that can be said we're playing ... so what I like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oil fields on\nFine yeah totally I was I was\nThe first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil fill a oh a oil fields that were on fire and the way I had to get there was through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the a Saudi Arabian oil company he knew away through the mind feels\nAnd so that's how I I think of trace this question is\nI see as their I see as navigating a mine field\nAnd as you know so far we've been able to avoid to a stepping on that one mind that it's gonna do it in\nBut as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous nevermind a great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine but as I say all it takes for us to do is to step on that one mind that won the hidden mine and it's just going to blow\nSo the thing I think that will be the end if it had to come that way but no I Am committed\nOkay so you're the scientist you're the you're the you got the PHD in physics\n[noise] let me just give you what I think is a better metaphor though for a for a science and this is is we had to get you had you know let's say the the goal was the other side of that

can ask or any kind of question you want you to have the answer right there [noise]\nWell I'm a person asked her well who do you think Jesus was on her response was a fictional person but then ask coop Mohamed was and there was a famous religious leader\nHey garbage in garbage out buddy\nYou know a very interesting things I hadn't heard that about a Alaska Alexis but and that's how they programmed her to to say that there was of course wrong and and not accurate or not just wrong but historically there was obviously and I think even people\nWho are atheists who studied this subject come to the conclusion by and large that he was a historical figures\nOr as was Mohammed but that that's crazy and I hope they fixed that I that sounds like you've been to the Silicon Valley though doesn't it\nUh let me go to um marry who's in New Jersey and goes to goes day yeah Mary\nAround how are you tonight I'm going back\nTo your guest um I don't get that kind of a I possibly that\nWell that's a great question the ghost in the machine\nThat about like a rabbi and look trekking that's [laughter]\nYeah that's an interesting idea I I Would think possession you know generally we talk about possession of the soul so if it's\nIf it's just a a machine you know complicated hammer um it would have no soul than it could occupy but then again you talked to other people who said inanimate objects\nYou know become the uh uh the resting place or the attach ... place for you know a spirits from that will are unwilling to leave an area and so they become attached to a thing\nSo maybe not in sold as we would say like there's an instrument possession but who knows you know that's what led coast to coast you all are always bringing up never thought of Paula is in Omaha on coast to coast go ahead Paula\nYeah let's say I'm a\nI remember when you're on the law and what was my drama\nI'm not\nQuite so that was that like now my tonight is yeah when I began\nAnyway anyway um there are people out there that are in English or they're really loud\nAnd I really really really like and I think you have any right when our L\nK now which two weeks I Walk around [noise] and I I was\nA guy and I ...\nI just walked around [noise] and I I ... I mean on\nSaturday when I get\nOur gale yeah some day in time ... ... ...\n... people that are so beautiful and so wonderful and ensure our own lives and it just kinda\nHanging or what and I think you're one\nWho oh you're very sweet but I agree with you and I think that morning period after art I think it was just it just even though many people were anticipating that this complication was going to get worse I\nI think it you know if you'll pardon the expression I think we all you know lost their breath over that we just do just cut us off guard [laughter] so yeah and I'm Sorry and I I Know that I think I think you have any leaves highways\nThat and\nThat that's just stay out quick might there it's a ... test came here oh cool passed away and I grew up and I you know\nYou grow up around radio stations trends and ... yeah\n[laughter] that's good I Would never did that start track a nap\nAnd get there and it's just a kid they\nSay oh my God it's a\nWell it's nice to chat with you I tell me real quickly uh so what kind of see what station did your father worked for a\nWhile he don't Cape deal Iran and cat ... and they were where\nOh wow I Know I'm a panicky\nSome simply shit I Would like to I was like to hear that you God Bless you have a great night\nI I've always worked I'm not that ... advance I mean I can handle the little one in probably two oh one of any class about engineering and something like that but I Love the engineers they really know the stuff\nThat's really cool they could just builds up to not enough and I'm All right so that brings me to oh keys from Virginia is back so key had called um when we were talking with our guest last hour and it seemed much more appropriate to have him on here for open lines so\nI'm Glad you called back heat so you you had a friend who it was you were telling a story about how the surgeon had essentially experience to kind of\nAlmost like a scientific revolution but it came into almost sort of divinely delivered where he suddenly knew exactly what to do in this complicated surgery do I get that right\nOh that's correct because I understand it and um that individual by the way and and uh thanks for having the icon and sorry for not be a little bit quicker smoother with everything but um somebody very topics for either ... and they are related to some of the things I wanted to say too but sure\nThis gentleman Dr wrestling now and uh also had a a hero lights experience for a failure or twice in surgery which his patients died\nAnd they were children and they later many years later a visited him from the spirit world\nAnd delivered a message for him to give to their parents and so anyway this individual by the way is the same roof I'm now from that in a at the age of Ninety three\nAfter having been a possible for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints having left because\nUh became the curse of the church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three and a an amazing man even that they um downhill skier at that age\nAnd um [noise] anyhow um what I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy and other things in which\nThings are held by the prophet job gave a little bit of ... and ... and ... on things are touched the coast am that there can be or perhaps a connecting and for ... informed that link about paranormal and things from traditional Judeo Christian\nTeaching a that we find them and also in the Bible and and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph ... revealed or haven't revealed to him I should say by a Jesus Christ and many other officers that he had\nA profits and he brought about a lot of\nNew scripture hatred scripture as well as new scripture [noise]\nYou know and and we're going to get about thirty more seconds used to go ahead I said\nBasically to wrap it up to be a turtle man is one concept that he spoke about it and he taught about and I wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by trim and maps and there's a very good Youtube video Joseph Smith and the recovery of eternal man because\nA lot of those principles seem to than Boston by you know the the church from the council on some of the scriptures that loss that that were the basis of the creek\nWill have to leave that for\nA LDS scholars to sort out um\nBut that's interesting and I I I have a lot of friends ... so\nThey mention a pharmacist\nOr want it all the pairs correctly and and the and the jar container so they're all facing out towards out or whether they combine that get to order it would just have their own fan right there\nYeah but the thing of the the moving of the I mean it really is it's an amazing video in it for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it um but the scissors in depends who the ... in this little cup holder who district moving around\nAnd this is it's not I mean you could almost making an argument like maybe the jar\nWas on the slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh but I don't get the thing with the the pencils and the than the scissors so yeah benevolent pulled you guys don't go with that until it got\nAny other theory to a a back in a ... is in Wyoming and coast to coast Michelle\nOh wow high fencing in I'm Sorry I'm a truck driver I'm like you know\nFirst things first the first things first thing I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but that'd be easier\nI Know I can talk right now for a second can take on I'm a first time caller longtime listener and nice to have you what I was\nWondering why it's like I was raised Catholic and then like I chose to kind of walk away from that and explore other options and other things out there because\nYou know I just I don't know that's that's the way I'd help inside an remembering tear gas Michael I'm of course when you first got on he was talking about that you know that scientific side of him and and\nThe thing that lady tell\nThem to read the Bible and now he's sort of changed his mind on it and it's a Christian so what I was wondering and I don't know how well very strong with religious stuff exactly but um\nIt's a little bit like I I Wonder\nHow often when I'm driving down the road and how it can trust the authenticity of the Bible because you know I have often heard that a lot of the major story from it like the story of the ... and the story of um you know like I said\nYou're a hero type figure the mind of a virgin and stuff those steroids can be found in like pre biblical tax you know like ... ... attacks from like ... and ... you know whatever\nCreates the Bible so you're talking about the ...\nYou're talking about ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels in the end the guilt diminish narratives should the news story [noise] um and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of\nMan God or ... that was burned by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is just another version of that so the question to me\nAlways is not this to me and this is where I think a lot of it in my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up because I'm not going I'm not trusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust\nBecause I'm not going I'm not trust in the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the Bible because of how many true ... it has in it\n[noise] okay there's a there's a difference to me and there are true is that we know to be a worse\nSteering by right there there you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good do you you still have to be good to them because it only makes us is Jewish worse\nYou know and and so there are ... and and a lot of these stories tell the truth is the actual facts of these stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be honest I\nBuy or they'll let you know story that can be found and on their ... like I'm Still trying to find like the other and her name on the line\nWell know here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories there are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who when Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago\nOr the other people started in ... like I'm emphasizing something from their tradition saying see were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote\nThe things that they said had pre existed that story whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof about that there isn't in the Egyptians there's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but it in the end does it matter I mean it it it do you can you do you live your life better\nIt doesn't improve your life that's the question and I think getting hung up on worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science there's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be a science book and it's not I don't think um and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day\nHow come to think of that let's my best answer for you open it gives you something to chew over while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas and\nThey're not here to thing sounds good\n[laughter] good will be ... be a you know you're a bad man the gym and you get where you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad you're was the first time I got to be there with you um I go to a adjusted and who's in Texas on coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy hey hey yeah and it's nice to be on my list them wherever they were actually called in are you going to take it to the left everybody's on the the religious aspect but uh do whatever you want to get some more scientific stuff yeah sure I'm I'm not\nSure if a lot of people call it that Iran mosque interview or he had with Joe Rogan and\nI only smoked ...\nYeah they're they're I think there are a little out there but uh I think somebody is um that logically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot\nPretty impactful way says things about like a a guy in a side of an addict augmentation and stuff\nAnd uh I really thought it was a neat metaphor they use than how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around you know we have the ability on the massive computations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want\nAnd all that and he said that you know in the very\nNear future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free\nYou know and uh you know what would that do maybe to the educational system would we go to school will be just like philosophy classes to learn how to think properly you know\nWell we need more of those I think we need more of those [noise] no I think I think I think I think a lot\nWe treat ... ... yeah I think we treat philosophy of some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built and\nI'm you know it's just a fine arts credit that people just take\nJust have to write it because it can do it if it's not that it's dance you know or something so at night and dance at least if offer you don't have\nTo go [laughter] but you know to your point on on ... I'm a big believer in I'm In his technological ... solutions big I'm big on sustainability [noise]\nUm uh the Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed\nOr you know his mental state from over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera I I think that review much more of the humanness which we don't and we tend to think almost of Ilan must be some big giant slot machine is\nYes some against the whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I I only\nVenus is are you know are reminded of that stuff is very intellectual always have some kind of inner struggle\nRight and so I'm a I I'm an investor actually in a very small am in a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after that Joe Rogan interview and uh and has recovered mostly women\nA day or something like that would affect stock\nWell I don't know that though because I see my argument would be that Iran must we I invested in ... mosque\nMhm right I didn't I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the sixty minutes interview\nVentures but as a person\nYeah I thought that guy smart he gets it um and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better and make a lot of money and so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview\nI'm watching the wheels come off right I'm watching it was a wheeled circling me and just like watching a test lower the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome so I'm I I think anytime the head of a company like that becomes so synonymous with the product\nI think they have to be much more careful about how they live their lives in public that's my feeling on that but [laughter] but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree to use its own genius\nI think you suppose and stuff a little more on it in on public but I mean I think the thought process that everything is pretty consistent whether he was an even read it or not\nHe claims that that's a that's a very soon future you know playing out it was based in to to have a Nineteen you know what I mean not that good\nBut right were mentally getting more tyrannical logically advanced we have robots now and we have all that stuff that can be a thing in the next ten Fifteen Years you know who knows what I Hope\n\n\n\n\nWhat's your breaking a walk off track ally and Fox News the longest game in the world series history I think just a few

I grew up on the collection of Addams family\nBooks from I'm from Charles Adams the or the original cartoon and so I I Can't believe I slipped by me but you're exactly right and uh I glad we get the corruption in their seats but the truth of it still they're Gomez is still a great character you get the facts wrong when I said he was on the monsters\nAlready very good thank you limit you have a great deal to do\nFunny Joe is in a moderate California on coast to coast am Joe\n[noise] an evening pond and how you\nDoing doing very well open lines where do you want to go\nYes I Wish it would change in an open mind instead of open lines but that's okay [noise]\nUm artificial intelligence okay we're concerned about what we do with it and where it's going but we never considered that may be extraterrestrial had or is a victim of their own artificial intelligence\nAnd they may have progressed on our um well our understanding of concept [noise] I'm Still investigating this possibility by the way\nI don't know yet how do you investigate that\n[noise] okay um okay you know what an experience or oh\nYeah okay a un contacted yeah okay\nWell that's how I investigate as far as validating law vetting what I come up to ... what kind of so I'm kind of\nInformation I get [noise] 'cause I have to check out everything at least a from two different sources and her mother and her friends as well and maybe a knowledgeable in this area\nBecause it's a very compelling idea that that uh maybe if we're if we're worried on this planet that artificial intelligence could overrun us and deprive us of our humanity and eventually\nMake us into something other than what we are this is a servant to just simply not if they if they're going to happen here that we're worried about why don't we think it could happen\nSomewhere else and another and I think it's actually a really great idea for a movie that I think that's really it's really interesting\nYou might want to consider what if it did happen somewhere else and it came here and now it's running it's game on us and we're building the very thing that it is\nI'm game I'm In great ah interesting I don't think about that I Would think about it before I go to bed tonight or I won't sleep but I don't think you'd better over a cup of coffee tomorrow or let me go to a Tom who's in the Bronx and coast to coast Tom\nYou know thinking about over ... let me go to a Tom who's in the Bronx and coast to coast Tom\nHow are ya I I like to save it [noise] the cloud that's going around Mars\nIs a good possibility that every once in a while maybe there are like ... like coal volcanoes on Mars and maybe the uh they start to fire up like a boiler and maybe it pros or [noise]\nLike the like almost creating like a temporary atmosphere maybe that's trying to develop a Mars and these are volcanoes may go cold\nAnd the and it never succeed creating a full atmosphere\nInterested in is a good possibility\nI totally like totally and completely accept that as a possibility diverting idea Tom let me go to Wal who's in Pennsylvania on coast to coast am on a wildcard line before the bottom of the hour well\nBelow ... and it's nice to talk to your wife [laughter] I think you know why I\nTold God wanted to say something about the border but you started talking about the Bible I'm a college brought up as a Roman Catholic but I shuttles them subsequently become a ... I'm not so I don't know what to say to really\nAh [laughter] well I wasn't trying to hijack the show that way but it was just it you know a couple of callers mentioned something and next thing you know I'm I'm John away but it's the space I live in I live in a space during the week so that kinda bleeds through the air freight\nAnd your shirt or something when you said that job you know people come out of church and then they act like an atheist and the reason I'm an atheist this because ah\nI Can't possibly believe in God that show hypocrite or whether you're talking about the outrage over or all all the other guards up you know in the Bible or you know how can I possibly believe wage of ... when he kills children by the thousands while you're talking about Passover\nOr a son who was that the first one to chip change or the great flood\nOr Saddam and more of their own ... innocent children killed there so I mean like yeah I can I possibly believing that God like that\nSo you know I guess part of that again comes down to how much are we going to invest in a particular narrative\nAs being the defining story so I except what you're saying and I think don't get my point wrong about atheists I I I I I Know you're gently chiding me on the on the offending part but let me just say when I say atheist I really mean that in the strictest sense I think a lot of people live their life\nLike there is no God and then when they go to the to go to church somehow to hedge their bets and they look like they do that and but they never actually it doesn't actually make a change in what they do is all I mean and so you know everybody puts their faith in something\nJust put it that way well everybody puts their faith in something [noise] but you need the money for your seats in sex you put your faith in cars that everything these things are going to make you happy\nDial pound to fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word free bottle again dial pound to five zero and see the key word free bottle\nThe best use talk in billings news talk Ninety five point five [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIt's been lines on coast to coast and by the way things were let me come on and play again so it's fun when it gets it come on and hosted coming up tomorrow night will do it again Melissa is in South Carolina and coast to coast am military where do you want to take us\nI don't know I Am a question about it right but it is it that this year that I bought it at the last ... seconds left but I Want to ask are you in Manhattan, Kansas now\nNot yet but he ... I just I ... I'll be there soon I I'm Still back in the boxes I'm Still in Phoenix with the time being but I'm getting there\nOkay I'm from Kansas to younger line and so I I Know where you're going to treat you well\nWell it's funny I have a I have a property and I have a property and view for um South Carolina no I Love that area so I don't ... I don't get there very often but what are these days ...\nI'm a I'm a Hilton Head ... go yeah we're neighbors okay well\nThe caller brought up something about that it up a website where you mentioned that they called Jesus like an imaginary figure lets it go figure and then they went into my ...\nHe was a Lexus they asked they asked you know that's\nWhat it was yeah and and that's that's I hadn't heard that myself but that's what he\nThat's about heart but yes he did say that it's all immediately triggered him my brains I bought this perfect set of Encyclopedia Britannica from\nThe church mouse [laughter] or and I was so excited and when I got at home I opened it up I might have been the first person to ever open it and I write for a\nFirst part the first introductory part\nAnd it was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan\nWow I bet it is you're going to if you haven't stand is you would probably be ... by\nThe down and explain that this was a new format for Encyclopedia Britannica and they created\nThe alphabetical volumes and they they chose what to put it at links and that heart and then the index the other\nSelections at their discretion and so when you look at Jesus in this edition\nOf Encyclopedia Britannica\nHas just a few little paragraphs and it it calls from them that typical figure someone who might have live during a certain time period and then it represents there's a way to look in the end that are more information and then if you turn to Islam\nIt is like page after page after page in the regular section and still do you know anything about it\nNo it's very interesting it's very ... those are good looking over your shoulder will you talk to you you do now\nAnd it's in a box there you know and I just kind of put them away and that kind of feel\nLike like they're not really\nBeen like even if you don't you don't see the wrong here you do to reduce the idea\nThat I mean like the as you said\nI I Know there are still printing the must still be printing a version of you know they don't completely they don't want anything\nTo last or the second Alaskans low fat it to buy it gave them how to work at like at home and saw that in fact started looking up things and I thought who decided to to make it this way and so yeah you can find out I mean if you could do home or a\n... a breathing treatment that ideas so they'll have to wait maybe tomorrow night if I could figure out something between now tomorrow night\nOr I Will and I appreciate that and I'll get to ... if I Do it'll be in the first hour tomorrow night an otherwise I'm not sure it will be back on again things you may have to wait a while but most people do you do but they use really it's really very interesting let me go to\nKaren who is in Alaska on coast to coast AMA Karen\nHi um this link and with she was just saying and it definitely ties in with last night there was some gets and I'm In the show was shorter um first of all I wanted to stay you are by far my favorite show host and that has to gorge but you don't seem to be afraid of controversial subject\n[laughter] though because they love it [laughter]\nSo you know politically correct though we can't talk about it or they just you know\nYeah you know I I I guess that it's funny 'cause I I should listen more maybe I'm I'm Out of step maybe I should I should be more like you know you really you know used to say that oh no trail what what\nI wanted to change the subject to in like I said you may go along with what she would say and I'll tell you a few things I don't get off the air and everybody else and put in a sense where um the Mandela Effect first of all you've probably heard about it\nThere's a million dollars in memory to\nYeah will laugh about all these things called memory\nFirst of all you've probably heard about it\nThere's a million dollars to memory to\nYeah we'll ask about all they face off memory\nAnd everything in the world remembers that one way and then suddenly it or not and and last night the example they gave with them I Believe it was I stay out of love and sex and the Bible the wolf and the lamb\nVersus the way we grew up hearing about the lion and the land that a couple of other examples and and it's in any ... year can climb hey guess what I got a catalog in the mail today [laughter]\nAnd somebody had a prayer because he was saying last night that also changed the Lord's Prayer and maybe 'cause the catalog create like minded I don't know for our comfort her sister\nRemember what it was but anyway it was the way we were member dead so Luke I Am your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father um the things that have changed life with like a box of chocolate you watched that movie now Forrest Gump\nLife is like a box of chocolate Sally Field do you remember when she\nSaid her really liked me you like me or anything right\nNow they're saying if you watch it now says she says you really liked me now okay that's interesting when\nNo no when she was saying the encyclopedia how you have a couple of paragraphs about Jesus and pages and pages tomorrow that last night and I agree with this it's like I said I've been doing the research for a couple of year and a half maybe so they've been saying that third baby that they're they said something about their goal was to make a I don't know portal\nInto another dimension ... think demon into our yeah well they were doing say panic rituals outside that place I'm and I'm Wondering if maybe that's why they're diminishing Jesus now and and mom at the biggie 'cause we all know what he does you know the things he believes in the many way the\nOther things that we would do to do be there'll be a victim of the Mandela Effect well even as you're talking about it because it made me on on nightmares more\nBut here's here's what I Want to IRS when I propose to do the ... the thing I mentioned do about Islam and above bendel and about ... Mohammed is that what we often do and I think you're you're getting to this and that this is a completely fair point is that we we rely on other people to give us our memory\nAnd so we think we heard something we think we remember it away to hear somebody else and then somehow we insert their memory in two hours and and and whenever we may have held we might have originally thought of the line the way it was you know but the more people repeat it\nAnd that's the only way that you you know that that they can hear it so I think the Mandela Effect is very interesting I think it's compelling I'm Sorry I missed the show we brought a great examples [noise]\nUm I Will say when it comes to Bible translation just remember this\nIt you can't do a perfect translation into English from Hebrew in Greek ... from that era Hebrew enough that era Greek it's impossible to do a perfect translation there will always be changed\nAnd some of them are just as simple ones some of them are just you know pronouns and people in ... the name of the person that was talking because it's easier to follow the story but you are changing it you know just by dropping a pro known in putting a person's name and then others are much trickier because there are verbs that literally don't exist anymore\nUm and so we have to find quibble informed\nFacing was a verb for a long time I am facing and we just don't use that terminology so you know the fact of the translations keep changing that's great that's the way to be ... it up and I hope not politically correct purposes but because it's just a matter of getting it\nCorrect which I think is more interesting alright so\nBut I Hope not for politically correct purposes but because it's just a matter of getting it correct which I think is more interesting All right so let me go to um I'm Marty who's in Tulsa and the time we have left on goes to goes to a a Marty\nAnd a pleasure I'm honored uh first I've ever tried to call in the coast to coast I've been listening to her like others for years and years I had to hit the readout about fourteen times that I was surprised to be able to get on\nA leading right [noise] I had a and it's nice by the way to hear your back on coast once in a while I thought you had disappeared forever\nSo did I [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nWell they needed year hey I'm In a discussing or with a couple a gentleman earlier about the Bible\nYeah about thirty minutes ago or so you talked about how genes or um it's to pick it as being murdered and the ... but not in the Bible and I think that I Am a seminary student I'm a minister I studied and a couple of different Bible college's and uh [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nCivil clue hope bigger rest a drag Callahan Fox News director Christopher Wray\nSays a

the newspapers you ever played that seat game well back in back when I was a kid there was this decoding zodiac seat column ask each case seek and every day\nThere was a set of numbers that I had to decode the numbers made a sentence and the sentence was supposed to give me guidance and the symbols on this zodiac column\nWhere the moon and the sun and you had to seek the numbers to match with words reminded that this kind of you know the idea how to use numbers you had your letters and you had to figure out your messages like he's a ...\nI mean we were told not to play with that said I don't even know if anybody remembers that I mean I don't know why we had it in the newspapers that I had in my home state of Utah because so many Mormons are very very\nParticularly when it comes to using astrology but it was in the newspaper it's called seek and she was really intriguing to decode the numbers and where does she get your future\nBut now I think that it's difficult to um push anything about the spiritual side because\nThere's so much dog but now involved there's so much well we're right you're wrong thing and a lot of religious Douglas or fighting it out for dominance in what appears to be this apocalyptic\nAnd we're in right now it's taking too long to reaches fever pitch Halloween of course is is um it's become a pope hurry holiday where the meeting is lost or the

have no proof but how we was always a time for things to be bizarre chilling and not to leading and crew to something scary much of what is accepted they would be seen as bizarre years ago but I think things have happened in yesteryear and beyond time and now here we are\nI mean spiritualism or contacting the dead was considered\nHealthy normal back in the nineteenth century and today it's being argued it's akin to even worship but this is probably has usually argued by the same people who think that they're trick or treating it became the demon worship and everything else we can to even worship and you can't\nCan't be spiritual for a day or set aside some time to think about the dead or maybe even talk to the dead and looking for responses on all sides of the argument which is something that I think a lot of people should do and I would\nThink about the dead or maybe even talk to the dead and looking for responses on all sides of the argument which is something that I think a lot of people should do and I would say this I Would say that Nineteen Seventy three\nWas the year that the ... board became vilified it it was demonized because of The Exorcist than the idea of the contact ah but ah you know\nThe little girl had with captain ... which is this the spirit the zoo um or ... or ... you know there there are number Mesopotamia demons said they used to scare you and that's just a couple of them\nBut the the spiritual is the nature of the idea of contacting the dead using you know anything from ... to a crystal ball to pendulum so I mean all those things you know they they're basically the same ... you're using the same type of tactic\nUm you're using audio motor responses radio amateur responses\nWhere you\nHold on to something evil like for example holding a pendulum and you have these any ... any voter responses to it what is is that your hand is steady\nBut for some reason there seems to be this muscular a subtlety where something\nTell a path that goes through you into the hand or into like when the hands are on the plane ... board\nAnd this is how it all happens it's weird like that and and um I think that is\nYou know the more you learn about ... board I mean we really are not needed when it comes to something to do that because there are other ways in which human beings confined spirits or at least gathered together to conjure and communicate with the spirit world\nThe essay on ...\nIs the most effective way according to spirituals mediums that's the most effective way of communicating with the debt and then this matter messages from the departed could be passed on to the living and then the spirits could announced their presidents by manifesting displays of the supernatural\nMe during the heyday of spiritualism scientists and cyclical researchers investigated hundreds of say on says and unfortunately well majority of the physical mediums were caught hope sing phenomena the some point they were just\nExtending are exaggerated very few of them came away unscathed by the early investigators or the spiritual is moving a lot of them are ... and frauds\nBut of course the more people got together the more we were seeing these strange happenings going on\nSo when you had the ... doing the hoax then you had the people that were really interested in really wanted to make\nThese things happen to the Nineteen sixty the Nineteen\nSeventies and it wasn't until after the movie The Exorcist came out that the spiritual moving was put under the microscope by the born again Christian movement\nBut people are still rebelling in the sixties and seventies young people started to defy church leaders by participating what could be called party rituals\nWhere they were doing a lot of frightening rituals carried out by young people during sleep overs and parties and the ... board was one of those things [noise] and they always show up you know parents were directly say do not play with this don't touch but which board don't touch ... board [noise]\nThe other place themselves around him or her they each place one or two fingertips underneath the body\nUsually they asked us to put our ... under the body if I remember that correctly then the person is closest to the head of the other person laying there she\nSays she's looking ill and then somebody says she's looking worse she's looking ill she's looking worse\nAnd then you do the call and the repeat the call and the repeat these are all you know rituals so the call\nIs she's looking ill the repeat issues looking worse she's looking ill she's looking worse spoken repeated spoken\nRepeated the general direction of the call the repeat describes how the prone person the person who's flat out is looking worse and worse followed by saying she is dying than the call back is she is dead she is dying she is dead she is dying she is dead so\nAh and then\nWhat happens is you said now she's light as a feather\nShe's stiff as a board she's lived as a feather she's stiff as a board as you keep chatting begging for the call and the repeat light is a feather Stevens aboard\nThe entire group is chanting this except for the person laying there prone and what happens is with the call them to repeat the person laying there actually becomes fridge it and then\nWhat you do is all of the people surrounding the bodies caught doing the calling the repeat\nThey attempt to lift the person with their fingers are so we we did with our pinky fingers we lived through a pinky fingers and it's odd because you can lift the body together okay\nI don't know if anybody has done is I mean if anybody has done this give me a call triple a six seven three thirty seven hundred because\nThese are things I did when I was a kid you know we experimented with this\nI don't know if anybody has done is I mean if anybody has done this give me a call triple a six seven three thirty seven hundred because these are things I did when I was a kid we experimented with this stuff and I I think a lot of kids had this experience especially ones or you know our age right because when we were kids we were we were actually hearing about all this stuff because like our brothers\nAnd sisters are older brothers and sisters I was I was the oldest so I knew everything about it I had all their\nFriends they were doing this stuff lives of feathers difference of bored and you can lift the body of the person using your fingers as we did this and it just freaks out\n\nYou just read this out because ... it was weird because I remember the girl we did it with her name was ... and we were at my how should we did it and she actually turn pale\n\nShe was joining pale and she we could live to she was smaller than we were of course\nYou gotta figure you know you were lifting someone who is at least you know a hundred pounds really Ninety ... Ninety five pounds lifting her up when we were teenagers we were young kids you know live your pinky fingers saying live as a feather stiff as a board she's that she's dying you know\nThere's just basically you know chanting this\nAnd so you know you learn a lot about what the mind can do you know when you do these calls and repeats and you do these\nThey're kind of like incantation so I mean they're incantation they're simple or they're not uh they don't cause any harm\nBut they really really um you know they're really freaky if you if you if you do that now I'm a few years ago\nI was on the air talking about a demon conjuring game the kids were playing with a pencil called Charlie Charlie\n\nAnd are in fact I had a number of teachers called me and give me um ah they sent me emails telling me that they were so glad I talked about the topic because he was seeing kids in school teacher in particular so you're seeing kids in school\nAnd the kids were lining the pencils up into Charlie Charlie and they said that they that Charlie was a demon\nSo the idea was that the two pencils on a piece of paper in the shape of across any for yes and no on the paper\nAnd then once again the colon repeat Charlie Charlie can we played Charlie Charlie can we played Charlie Charlie can replay Charlie Charlie can we play\nThan of Charlie is there\nThe pencils will move to indicate an answer yes or no\nBut of course a lot of people so there's no real demon here there's no real demon answering the questions and so there are a lot of people who say it's basically ritualized version of playing the magic eight ball yes no yes no however there have been stories of people who have some and Charlie only to forget not to say goodbye\nAnd apparently Charlie seems to follow them at least that's you know what I hear I mean it's proper to say goodbye to spirits when you tried to contact\nThem if you don't want them to come at you you have to tell them I don't want you to come out of me I don't want you to be around that you have to say goodbye when ... going to cemeteries looking for a BP if they don't say goodbye to the spirits those spirits could follow them home\nYou have to say goodbye\nWhen you close to ... there's a reason why the words goodbye or on the way the world you have to close the ...\nBoard by saying goodbye it's vital that you say goodbye\nYou don't say goodbye to Charlie Charlie follows you whoever Charlie maybe\nSee all these weapons of communicating with his Garnett spirits can be explained with less complexity when he decided to acknowledge the

I just I was just happened to be a body when he died you know had a place in um [noise] I don't know if you know ... or the pine burns are in New Jersey\nNo I've only been to a ... actually I've been to growers milk\nOkay but there's a place called the pine barrens which are very kind of creepy but there's a place then in Tom's river and and it was near there that he had a\nPlace and then in his garage yet you had a lot of projects said he he was always doing some creative stuff when he settled down a little bit right and in this one letter bag was the board\nAnd it was the board because he felt guilty wanting to contact is dead victim's is that why you made the board\nThat's right he was he was very scary person\nAnd I I think he was up to a lot of things and he would always do my dad he said he would always show pictures of girls that he was dating all the time you know and my dad thought that that was totally because he said he was homosexual\nAnd he and he told me when I got older that he thought those people that he had done things to\nAll the pictures ... and so when we when he died we went to the places I just remember it was kind of like an average looking house on the edge of the ... and they had all his clothes and all that stuff and he had he was making posters to sell you know 'cause it's just like in the seventies system\nAnd um they threw at all that stuff but I asked my uncle was really like the cooking executor guy taking over the state of nothing of value but he let me have the board and he said this is explained\nThat this was the thing to think that he built for that reason because when he had a very bad car accident\nAnd um they thought he was going to make it but he didn't make it and it changed his personality and my dad said\nThat he got a conscience because he didn't have one even though he was like charming to us there was some scary about him and then when he had the uh the accident\nIt changed he changed ... that's when he made this you know he had some skill as an artist like a\nGraphic artist you know\nAnd\nThat's when he made the board\nAnd then he he basically left to you know it\nWas just in the garage part he didn't I took it took it\nIt relaxed he said that\nBob shed that close to every murder everything is in the board\nSo I've been I studied the board at all these years really since the seventies\nAnd I figure to a certain clues in the board there all these little if it's it's unusual if you look at the border all the all the little clues but I don't have the answers to to most of them the one I just got the longitude and latitude of one\nCrime scene is on the board\nThat that I see I think is true and then the uh he said the eyes monk all felt that the eyes all the sets of eyes\nBecause of the eyes will reach I was ... it was a victim citizen of eyes Seventeen eyes and that's on the license plate so I'm slowly putting down I mean I I I've used it and it's been effective\nFor me but I don't use it for evil right to say that\nYou're using it to try and figure out the crime is what you're trying to using as a way to figure out what happened\nHere that that I'm I'm very curious about that 'cause I'm trying to be a writer right now so that would make a good book but then\nIn terms of our use it to talk to friends that have departed not not like victims or anything like that but it's very effective it I've always talked to people if it really is my experience it might not ever worked for anybody else but it was worked for me\nKaren I'm you have a board or you have three of them of Bobby board a and a used ones for you and then the other two were they going now you said\nFor those boards overeating um um so\nYeah and part of the talking board Historical Society so one is going to be going to our museum or main museum ... museum they that travels and one's going to one of our collectors who does collect um oddities including serial killers ah stuff\nSo it's going they're going to good homes and uh uh ... were the one in my my home that I have will I Will keep it a added to my collection cause I proudly display all the boards a house and use them all and I also\nAnd work with the board myself and I use it mostly with a partner but I can use it by myself so I'm curious as to you am do you use it by yourself or with a partner\nOr both both 'cause I don't know that many friends that I have one really good friend and she she'll you know we use as you go there but I used to loan but I think the company ... anything\nYou didn't want anyone to really come here to\nReturn to use the bored at work or what have you ah what kind of messages it anything have you gotten from the border who have come through\nBecause I Know what foods and unconventional board I mean when you look at it it it's not like you know you're talking to the you have to ... you can't because there's nothing like one actually I mean it's got the the numbers in the letters and it has\nYou know a true falls within the U.S no\nOther number of other things on their to their little bit different than a unique and of course the friendship is not really plan shut but a pointer um it it is I guess I don't know whether you explained to me a little bit if I'm Talking of wide and you're just explain a little bit about the board and what kind of experience you've had\nOh sure so the the pointer the indicator looks like a hand and it hasn't finger pointing up as green and so that is what it points to points to the letters instead of having an opening like a lot of the traditional we plant you have to have an opening to um this one has to point or ... points to letters\nSo real interesting thing about this board people are listening along is that at this board is actually a collage\nSo what do you have family had was a collage of you know you may cut out letters and numbers out of you know out of magazines well that's of this this person did he cut them out and stuck into this board a and nothing was like a handwritten at all it's like everything was just cut out and I do see\nAt the very top left corner in the very bottom\nA bright corners of that latitude and longitude I did see that right away to there there are definitely some unique symbols on here are very cryptic in many regard but what it does have of course to have the full alphabet it's laid out very much like uh we should warn the fact that it does the arc\nEight through em on the first line in a second line is in Thursday that's a that's a good lay out to have\nA I can use any plan chat with this um because literally that pretty nicely that they're they're large enough to\nBut the numbers are above the letters and they're splitting parts and there's some interesting symbols on here there's a giant face in the middle of words that say I'm Sorry and then all the eyes that EM indicated\nSo what I did I just got this board yesterday and I typically work my partner my partner wasn't around to work this tool\nSo I went ahead and place my hands upon the green hand and it just ... what spelled out with where is Bob that was it was like a question to me for something for me to think about and that didn't get anything more than that\nAnd who I communicate mostly is not the dead I used to and I'll talk about that little bit further down the road but who I talk to now is just a group of guides\nICANN the guide their group of a theory old beans who I've never been incarnate it in a body and they come to their Everytime I use the board and that was their way to get us talking about this now I Will say this Clyde and em I plan next week I'm doing a a alive\nI Do plan on using this board on Halloween with my partner and see what kind of other messages we get from it that I can tell you that any single board I ever touching is never matter what they look like we're kind of symbol they have on it what kind of material it's made out and they all work and they all look the same for me every time\nI went with my partner they uh it's always the same guys that come through no matter what\nThe intentions of this board I as it was created you know\nHow ugly you're critical pop credit for different reasons it doesn't matter it will work for me on the level and which I intend to work and how I treat an incumbent aboard myself\nI'm and I'm looking over the board now I'm about to face I'm Clyde that's Bob space okay here's the\nPiece I can tell you he always would hit where half pieces\nSo we weren't too more more more common than you know right\nYou can tell that that's a week or something he's wearing on his face yes I'm always says it says you're speak closed door when finished so instead of saying goodbye you once you say close the door so you open the door first to talk to the board says closed the door I'm just looking at all the things that are on here there's a opposing the\nI think close to pull it all that ... that was his car that's a picture of his car uh-huh\nAnd then the eyes all over the board those are the guys with victims\nThat's what I thought I think is true\nAnd then longitude and latitude that's on there a cactus all all the different numbers some of the let us have have dots on them ... and those dots stole something\nWhat about huh okay really mhm okay\nThen then the two were says bugs and the two and west jeez\nYeah north south east west bugs yeah uh-huh\nI put in the ass for South I'm trying to put all that into a word [noise] I think it's so long I get frustrated but I think this is close to what he did dad was
