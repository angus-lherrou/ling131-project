rupture you warn are very expert paranormal investigator as we talk about several things including the psycho man see him which was popularized by\nOr different Raymond Moody the originator of the term near death experience and let us bring in Joshua ... worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight it's Halloween the event oh I Love it\nOr we're going to dig into this extremely creepy thing that's like a man you mirrors I also have an update for you about time warps in UFOs\nOr later on we're going to give away from free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday a there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with\nThe way I'm bum 'cause I've got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of me will be with you OK\nWell you know what when people say that to me it means something to think\nYou got that aren't the cycle man the of it's a small enclosed area set up with a chair dim lighting the mirror is angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nYes oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me and and um\nAnd in the cycle mantey um technique um and it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager because I started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the uh local newspaper and I found again and again\nWhen I go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and say this is the most talented room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I'd find a room that had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomenon um there are number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infant a tunnel\nRight like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light as electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of light which operates has some sort of a ...\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know what consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite puddle of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of the spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to describe why by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or Greek [noise] highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective of substance and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience Georgian and then I Want everybody to understand this I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state known them\nWhen you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied\nTangible three dimensional seemingly Corp portrayal figure that will appear right in front of your head to toe and this being can come up to you and not only speak to you but touch\nAnd so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho man the ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother\nAnd there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother than he would take you through a period of time that could be days\nWhere he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find the reminds you of her and he pictures\nAnd he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with the intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through now when this becomes\nVery scary it's when you have people who experiment or you know people talk about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble\nThat sort of thing you know you have people who go in there and they just say I don't care I just want to see something\nAnd when you go in there with that attitude that's a ...\nYou you are well you know you get what you ask for right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a cycle Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments\nWhere it was set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's\nVery real for the person who's sitting there and the chair and so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in front of\nIt and I bought that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and\nBlood you know all that kind of stuff yeah I think ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays LAPD laughed in the background\nAnd maybe some white noise I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with the and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through Sacramento him experience and I would say that a\nLot of people chores or is it is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody and a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent\nBut I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had\nThe full on it and that's dramatic Josh stay with us we'll come back and talk about time warps in some UFOs here's our first emerging artists Paul Ruben from Santa Barbara California was a song called winter when\nOne from Las Vegas\nOutside of Las Vegas Nevada and um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me\nUm it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas at area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in\nThe state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nAnd so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can uh capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um\nI mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way a very cool that you played a a a group from Ashville north\nCarolina regroup part\n[laughter] you know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting to play an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery\nIn context okay um\nAnd I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just coincidence or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is sort of a being\nHowever you want to view it\nThen of course I never believe in coincidence during\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe in that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and\nJust doesn't make sense does it ... new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip\nSo that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media\nWas not there was not\nNo I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop uh and this was a program that was a course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was who was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind uh okay so now let's move up to June of\nTwenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow [noise]\nNow later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and saw the very night\nThat I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force so here I Am next to Harry fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announced that there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around the same time George nap whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in the state of\nNevada and they're doing one\nHe is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine if any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings\nHe goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management and safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient\nHe goes on to say even more and this is the one that really gets me\nAssociated exotic knowledge of that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential\nIt affects by adversaries an unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here so he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise]\nHe's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's why we need we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is it didn't come from them new so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic\nWhere could have possibly come from um I also wanted to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to this where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project and some of these topics there's thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes in space time gravity wave communication work drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out\nRight around the same time and a ... with which July twenty fifth All right so that said\nNow we move up to August\nAugust of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville George ... the mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry\nWhich is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb\nAnd they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beach to a nail us air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore guests when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space force\nSo that said\nI Am of the impression here that there is some kind of amazing technology\nThat is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry that is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt when I'm telling you you can download the information for

got along very well and uh so I think you should also rest assured George that you played a big role probably\nAnd helping to educate people that there is something bad happens to you if you're disrespectful to the stall and if you're nice to have to do then you have nothing to worry about so I think he is much happier so to speak than ever\nNow originally to win the Dole was first given to the family years ago didn't people see the ... like in the window or running back and forth and weird stuff like that\nWell you know the the weirdest thing creepy his thing about the story of Robert The haunted Dahl is that he was given to a young boy a Robert Eugene auto which everybody called Eugene\nOre gene and gene\nObsessed with this dog when gene was only like maybe four or five years old\nAnd then Jean grew up to be a very successful man uh had had a wife that everybody loves had a nice big house but it didn't change is infatuation with the dog\nI mean uh you might think back when you were a kid maybe there is some point that was special to you and then there came a point when it just sort of drifted away that never happened for gene auto he kept this\nThis uh dial a till the end of his wife and treated it in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better than he treated his wife I mean how little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room\nAnd eventually moved to the addict at at the wife's insistence but you know they claimed that when finally Eugene died\nA and his wife moved out of the house and the house sat there abandoned for quite a few years waiting for a fire to come along and I actually did get to talk to some of the caretakers who ah worked in the house during that period of time who told me about just chilling experiences\nBut nonetheless people who were in the community said at night you can sometimes walk outside the windows and you'd look up by new new that house\nWas interview one new there ever read see little Robert de do running around the house George Back and forth in front of the windows\nI Love that next let's go to the time or in Asheville North Carolina first time caller for Tyler Tyler welcome to the program\nHey how you doing good good to be with us\nSo ah Joshua I was a up on the blue ridge parkway about\nFourteen years ago it was around uh August and I've spirits who crazy light on to make it to make a brief I was up a around like black ball some area me and my friends were just hanging out of there\nAnd then all of a sudden like this huge deep dark fog just kinda swept in in the afternoon like we're watching the sun to all of a sudden it's super thick fog just sat and\nThere were like six to eight what looked to be [noise] like jeep headlights often the distance saw nothing to do that about five to ten minutes later they started heading writer at like right at us we've got to thinking about it\nWe're at and overlooked there was no way it could have been linked jeeps or anything\nWe started watching them in like this belief at this point they get right up on us about two hundred feet away and then they dislike broke apart and just started like bugs and all around and we took off um come to find like for two years I thought I was crazy me and my two friends were like what the heck was that\nWhat's going on out there where he Josh ... it was\nIt was some wild stuff and then uh about a year or two later my my buddy send me a link it might have been from your website or something talking about it\nAnd uh it just like connect the dots I've I've been really trying to contact you we're not trying but you know willing to talk to you for about twelve years now to just see what you think about it\nWhat is that Josh well it's highly thank\nYou for that call always good to talk to a fellow Asheville in another tar hill and um you know right in\nNorth Carolina everybody of course focuses on brown mountains or the brown mountain lights because the ... mountain lights are the most famous example\nYou talked about them before Josh\nYeah of of this strange phenomenon where you have these balls of life that appear but actually this is widespread this goes beyond brown mountain\nThis goes all over as Tyler was saying the blue Ridge Mountains\nAnd ah you know which is of course part of the Appalachian chain Lena leading over to the great Smoky Mountains there are all kinds of spots where these balls of light appear now I Believe\nThat [noise] if you if you if you really want to get the scoop on this you can download a free PDF about it if you go to brown mountain lights dot com [noise]\nBut basically an eye on that website but um but what I can tell you is that there are places on earth\nThat produce an incredible amount of natural

when that electricity manifest and ... Iraq at in certain angles at certain cliff it can create what similar to to ball whitening\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy around western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these balls of white\nAre just merely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or if they might also have some sense of intelligence and ah this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua his website Joshua ... worn dot com you've got the information coming up with a Saturday Los Angeles event at his website it if you get there the first five to ten people will get free tickets there if you use the code that Tesla or by just typing that in there and uh\nThat's all they need to do when will they get notified Josh\nWhat you need to do is go to my website Joshua pie Warren dot com and I and sign up for my free e newsletter I'm going to send a newsletter out sometime this week and say the first five to ten people can reply to this newsletter with the word Tesla will get the free ticket\nLet's come back and just a moment here on coast to coast am it takes some final phone calls with Josh and the next hour we're talking haunted World War two\nSoldiers spirits ghost planes in strange synchronous cities with math they swing\nSo getting ready for that and don't forget the lights on Facebook followers on Twitter emailed me a George ... coast to coast am dot com here's our next emerging artists Christopher ... from around the rocket Texas with a song called morning over the aisle\n[noise]\n...

Warner\nBomb onto the world war two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us so Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you were originally gets started interior normal investigating what was that one catalysts that got you in doing\nOddly enough George it was really an incident that happened before I was born really\nUm 'cause I I come from a large family or my mother is the youngest of ten kids and my dad is one of seven kids while and I both both sides of my family they'd been in the mountains of western North Carolina since the late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nUh but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of the family\nIn the great depression or my mother is a mother was named to Virginia Calloway that was her maiden name and when she was about Thirteen Years old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big deal back to her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything in the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties uh named Claude came home from a small game hunting trip and she photograph them\nA holding up their squirrels and rabbits and stuff and when the picture develop my great uncle clogged Calloway her older brother did not have a head\nAnd they they knew that was weird but they weren't not able to understand enough about photography to realize just how weird it was so fast forward one month later a claud was sitting on the porch of the house\nAnd he was reading a copy of his favorite publication western magazine old gunslinger tails and uh his father Jack was in the kitchen fixing fixing lunch\nAnd they were conversing through an open window and at some point or jak said something to Claude called didn't answer and when the lunch was ready jak went outside and I'm here has claws magazine lying on the porch but there's no claws\nAnd a long story short my great uncle clogged Calloway was never seen or heard from again\nJeez I'm David ladies involved in the sun\nWell yeah well you know it's actually it's not too far from where there is a national uh part these days you know the ... national park area and and and what's even weirder is that you know I mean they did everything they got the authorities involved they got you know they were searching the woods\nAnd um you know hearing this fellow my great uncle who was waiting for his lunch you know in the middle of the story\nAnd reading a magazine ... how could he have disappeared was he abducted was the rapture way did he did he get caught up in a space time slip I mean we don't know but but you see it was compounded by the fact that this creepy photograph was taken\nOne month before and when I became an adult I went back to that area and did everything I could to try to find out what had happened and I mean I verify the whole story with\nElderly people and historians and but still there's there's no explanation for this and and you see this was a big tragedy in my family or they never got over it they never had closure\nAnd I got to grow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound that this created\nAnd it made me realize that some of these mysterious phenomena or they're not just legends or superstition or or old folk tales I mean the the paranormal if you want to call it that there's something very real that we have to\nThat inspired me to go out and sort of try to define fact ah versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties was what I really started seeing some bizarre stuff for myself with my own two eyes\nFor you let's go to the final goals here let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi merry go ahead\nI my birthday is November ... if you will go go ahead and I was one it was I if I Will\nAlso said yes and how does that relate to how all souls day in Halloween\n[noise] yeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth\nMy mother's birthday is November the third the day after yours and my sister's birthday is November the fifth and I can't tell you how many people I Know who have birthdays around Halloween including Dr Moulder who builds wishing machines his birthday is on Halloween\nAnd I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months it takes you kind of close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October [noise]\nBut um as far as your particular question is concerned so the the the basic tradition of Sao on which of course we now call Halloween is built around October thirty first and this is the product of the Catholic Church\nComing into the pagan areas of Europe and trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan beliefs into Christianity\nWith their own date well November ...\nWell they they realize that you know they weren't doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with a pagan\nAnd say instead of considering October thirty first um some kind of a pagan holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period\nAnd say that well this is the evening before the spirits of the saints comeback which would be November the first\nAnd so we will say November the first is the Halloween day\nAnd the evening before that is the Halloween evening or Halloween and so then uh they sort of combined the pagan beliefs of Halloween with all saints day on November first\nAnd then of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate the saints\nBut just celebrate all the soles of people who have died and so you end up with all souls day uh but this is one of those are interesting examples or it goes back to you know Christmas we're going to be hearing more stories about this in a probably is Christmas approaches where\nKnow the a lot of the patients will go out and worshipped trees you know the evergreen quality of trees and there was there was one of the um the higher ups in the Catholic Church is said look if we go out and we find a bunch of people who were worshipping a tree\nAnd we tell them you're all wrong and we cut the tree down\nAnd we punish them we're not going to win any friends\nInstead let's go and sanctify the tree and and then what they are already worshipping\nAt ... dot org\n... economy was raising the standard of living doesn't

really what would you say your some of the most dramatic stories that you put it in the book\n[noise] some of the most dramatic story\nEvery chapters riveting I got to say\nOh I appreciate that the one that moved me the most I found war the stories that happened uh uh in the Pacific theater and again when you're talking about World War two you're talking about a global conflict so these ghost stories crop up\nLiterally everywhere yeah yeah a\n... in Okinawa was that was the one story that stood out for me a and there's a story about a group of civilians who are committed suicide or en masse or right after the the American invasion of\nOkinawa and just to like cabins gate or something like that well it\nWasn't exactly like that or the story is uh that the Japanese military knew that ... what was kind of the last\nFour ... they had a ... in the Pacific if the Americans took over al ... Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring a most of Japan uh easily into the range of their of of the American bombers so what the Japanese did was they spread stories\nTo the civilians that if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and\nYou know God Knows what else civilians are enslave them\nScare the living daylights right\nAbsolutely terrified to when the Americans did invade the ah civilians were would run off the cliffs and commit suicide and then you know that's a documented piece of history\nJust a terrifying uh a story but now it there are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book\nIs that a group of tourists were at a peace museum near those cliffs and ah they were walking in a field near that that museum\nAnd they heard the sound of what they considered and they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything and then they felt a wind pass them and then later heard what they\nDescribed as cries and screams so that was\nPretty moving for me um\nAnother story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally um a heartbreaking and he would Jima it there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably buried alive because they were ... they were in a tunnel system a very intricate\nTunnel system under the island and um the the entrances caved in or or or the soldiers were actually burned alive or in the tunnels so there's a story\nThat uh one a Japanese civilian worker claims that every time he gets a call that he has to return to the mainland and he\nUh he gets a knock on the door\nAnd he claims that the spirits of these soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan to this or some pretty intense stories that a crop up and it's ... they're certainly not rare uh in in this volume middle\nEast what's interesting too mad is that they seem to be so prevalent all over the place something's going on\nYeah that's true and not only are they everywhere that the different one of the amazing aspects of of the world war two supernatural is that the goose don't even necessarily have to be people because there's actually goes planes that appear especially over England\nAlmost like the flying Dutch man the ship\nYeah absolutely exactly people see these planes and they're really not there\nYet this is I'm In and I'll tell you a little story from my own\nFamily do they hear them too\nWell some do and some do but there's one area or in the United kingdom um [noise] uh it's a northern section of of the u._k. called derby sheer\nAnd it's known as the Bermuda Triangle of um the u._k.\nIt it sounds pretty pastoral sounding so I don't know why there's such activity but there have been a lot of plane crashes there about fifty planes I think if have crashed in that area and it has quite a reputation but over the years there have been what they called ghost playing flaps\nSo for example in Nineteen eighty five\nI'm a bunch of people a claim to seeing this huge military aircraft flying overhead one couple was I'm\nDriving down the highway and they saw this very low flying bomber cruising over the highway or and they said that it didn't have any sound whatsoever which was remarkable because it was so big and uh you know I think they described it as a\nA for prop I'm an engine and it looked like a World War two bomber\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know a either a current military plane or possibly a um maybe a a bomb or going to an air show or something\nLike that was what they do what they thought you know\nYou write but to counter that a lot of these people that solve this first of all\nThere didn't seem to be a pattern a flight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a a a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft\nDisappeared in different areas throughout that region and a couple of the people that spotted this one in particular worked uh\nFor a an airfield during World War two was ... I Believe I'm\nA somewhat flight mechanic for the for the uh R. E. F.\nSo definitely would've known the difference between let's say a modern I guess like a Hercules aircraft and something like a B. twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it be twenty four bomber\nSo a pretty peculiar and and there have been other what they call goes plane flaps a throughout history and I think there was even one\nAs I was writing this book so to thousands Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave it\nI'm pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\n... the one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least I hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust like that yeah yeah like they want to do a different time warp or something right\nAnd the reason I looked into the these are a ghost plane stories is when I was young\nMy parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they\nWere starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy or you can make it sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Erie\nThat watch it with my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any\nAny story similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handles hundreds of and we're going to come back and talk more about how to World War two next hour you'll share your questions and stories as\nThe ... website is no conveniently optimized for mobile devices if you're a ghost inside or you can listen to live in his shoes right on your phone just as it goes to goes to um dot com on

little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest onto the world war two soldiers spirits ghost planes and strange synchronous these\nPearl Harbor isn't haunted or not\nIt's a extremely haunted according to a lot of the people that go there and uh\nMany of the people tourists people who are interested in history go there ah we'll talk about the feelings they have when they're touring Pearl Harbor especially the the USS Arizona memorial which is essentially a tune a mass grave\n'em and they'll tell you what a a moving experiences and again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself into the time and space around Pearl Harbor and the ghost stories that\nHave been told about that a famous area are pretty extensive there's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left his watch on the USS Arizona [noise] ah just briefly and then\nEr during that time where he left the ship it was attacked and sunk and now there's this story of this for Lauren looking sailor standing at the uh standing at the edge of the the memorial kind of looking out\nInto the bay where the Arizona ... an hour is uh so that goes story has been told\nA quite a bit um [noise] excuse me sir there's also a story of a level of\nLady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course the waves and the memorial and then when she looked at it\nThere seem to be faces in them into the picture\nIs a very uh in that went on online throughout\nAnd not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted with therapy and go stories at places like the show field barracks and hit them airbase areas that were a part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor\nAnd one place in particular in heck I'm a there was a headquarters building that\nUh supposedly served as a morgue after the attack and had some two hundred three hundred bodies in it\nAnd the places so haunted they said that they moved to\nThe ... desk which is usually inside the building they now say they post the guards outside of the building because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of this ghostly activity the sound\nIt now say they post the guards outside of the building because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of this ghostly activity the sound of people running up and down steps to such a degree that ah the steps the staircase itself would shake so it's a it's a pretty haunted place\nThe desert Fox rumble of the the Nazi hands or think leader and some incredible things happened to him to he died in Nineteen forty four mhm but what does he still haunts\n[noise] well that's probably the most interesting a story that I found a a when I when I started to research this book because I I did initially looks to see if I could find the\nThe ghosts of a lot of famous general's pat and Eisenhower as well as some of the the axis powers or and or when Romney has always been a kind of a subject of fascination for me so I started to [noise] you know try to find if there were any ghost stories about him\nUh I I thought he might be found in North Africa which is where he gained much of his fame as the desert Fox maybe on the shores of Normandy he would be among those many goes that appear\nIn Normandy he was really behind a a ... architecture the development of the fortifications there are in the constructions of the defenses along with what was considered the their Atlantic Wall\nOr maybe he would be in Germany but I actually found go stories about ... in the United states believe it or not\nSo one of the places as mount Hebron cemetery and Winchester, Virginia people claim to see this a figure\nA long trench coat a cap on a looking over the graves and and there are some people who say that he is actually at the\nThe graves or he's seen it the graves of some of patents a general patents ancestors and then there's a A N in West Virginia where they claimed that Romney will haunt so what's the story behind that there is a story that\nAre between the wars ... along with a few other German generals traveled on a secret trip\nTo America to visit some of the ... the battlefields of the civil war particularly they were looking at the way the Stonewall Jackson maneuvered through the Shenandoah Valley so this is why this story\nThat uh Irwin ... haunts these areas is is around today they think that uh he has left his spirit here because he once once visited the site now is there any historical basis for this\nI haven't been able to find any in most historians will tell you that it never had happened that the German generals never came here are people who believe these stories say it was a a secret\nMission and therefore there would be no historic record that was kind of the interesting one for me\nAnd what about other World War two infamous people who they are still show up on\nWell there's some really interesting stories uh for me there's there's one that Churchill still haunts a subway in a\nIn a in England and that once served as kind of a temporary bomb shelter and and and people have seen his spirit there I found the story that Churchill actually witness to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln in World War two to be fascinating ah he says\nThat Churchill actually witness to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln in World War two to be fascinating ah he said that he and I hate to lay this imagery on your listeners but\nA according to Churchill he had stepped out of the bathroom completely naked in what's now called the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House and he had traveled to the White House on several occasions to visit with\nA ... FDR Franklin Delano Roosevelt as well as other uh officials from the American side\nHe steps out of the the bathroom and there's Abraham Lincoln leaning against the mantle and I think Churchill says something like when Lincoln turns to face him Churchill said something like ah I see you've caught me at a disadvantage Mr President and then a Lincoln fades away so\nThat was kind of Lincoln probably faded away quickly\nYes I I would've I would've got out there as fast as I could he's Lincoln has gone through enough he didn't need the witness\nNot I'm not a new Winston Churchill ...\nSo there's some other stories about Eisenhower he haunts ah what's called the bullet which is a a train that's on display at the national railroad museum I think that's in in Green Bay Wisconsin\nOr we talked a little bit about the ghosts of Gettysburg and apparently he andme Amy maybe behind some of the haunting Z in the farmhouse that they used to own their so yeah there's a lot of um a famous go stories from uh some of the the bigger leaders\nOf uh the most famous leaders of World War two and do these continue these hunting\n[noise] yeah they do as a matter of fact uh you know the ... the bullet a I Believe has the story that some of the stories that I found out about that\nA war from the Nineteen nineties the two thousands one story is that I'm a custodian who was a vacuuming the carpet in the bullet\n... uh was halfway finished and decided to take a break left lock the door of the the train and uh went to lunch or or have a snack and then when he came back\nThe someone had completed\nThe vacuuming and he could tell because the lines of the vacuum cleaner were super straight up and down and according to some of the people who knew Eisenhower he was very meticulous and that's how he insisted on having his the bullet cleaned\nSo that story probably uh not too long ago\nAnd you know as we talked about the ghost plane flap they're happening probably even as we speak\nBack in World War two there were actually reports of UFOs they called them to fighters they were small little disc type objects flying all over the place that pilots reported seen did you come across anything like that\n[noise] yeah I actually did a whole section on it because they were so prevalent as you point out and and it's based on my research and my reading about that essentially the whole modern UFO UFO era\nOf the ... a Russian gives a coincidence that Trump wants to fifty percent for the first time in the day after he appears on your show I didn't want to say it I'm trying to dial back to ... but not as cold goal has raised the possibility how can I get from one thing Trump hasn't done\nAny appears on revealing bam out he jumps up three points you may be true in the Rasmussen daily tracking\nRush Limbaugh weekdays China and don't want to be a new tone Ninety five forty five ... says we're much she'd be you will a um nine Seventy buildings these huge each word and you're listening to news dawn Ninety five boys\n[noise]\nFlorida is getting ready I'm an ...

I thought wearing costumes\nOf the civil war and their faces and the expressions were just they were extremely song if they were just awfully awfully worried from their expressions and\nThe smell of something that I had to get away from so I went back in and our guide caught me and said have you been and I said\nI just went in and I I came out and they said we've been looking for you for the last half hour\nWhile while we are we going to have enough time to watch the filming those costumes are excellent so please explain to me how they were able to get that ... that's now hideous smell and they all looked at each other and they said there isn't anyone out there\nAre there are a lot of smells associated with some of these on teens man there is a ...\nOf a sense with um with ah some of these haunting sand or\nFor instance the er when ... I'm go story is really focused on uh the smell of a pipe that he allegedly used to smoke in this this haunted in to their their stories like that there are stories about people getting to\nA I think in the case of the heck I'm a airbase there's the scent of a rotting corpses that overwhelms people um the interesting thing for the when the caller reminded me that uh [noise] my history professor told me that one of the\nMost sought after um [noise] ah particles\nUh my history professor told me that one of the most sought after um [noise] ah particles are after Gettysburg for the civilians was a kind of um I I think it was I guess you would describe it almost as many drops that they used to put on their nostrils because the the scent was so\nBad and then you know that story certainly reminded me of that\nA couple more months we will be the seventies seventh anniversary of Pearl Harbor I guess there can't be many soldiers or seeming still left\nFrom the Nineteen forty one I mean that that was Seventy seven years ago right and if they were twenties they'd be Ninety seven there might be a few but I don't think there are many are there\nNo I don't think so and it's um it's sad because again that that's why I think the important thing is to make sure that these these stories are preserved and the memory goes on and if this book helps with that at all or maybe inspires people to look into um\n[noise] the the battle of of Pearl Harbor in particular I I think that it's done it's done its job\nBrian in Indianapolis is with us She's still the Rockies good morning bright hey

including the cycle mantey him which was popularized by or different of Raymond ... the originator of the term\nNear death experience and let us bring in Joshua ... worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nGeorge I am so excited to be on the program tonight\nIt's Halloween fees and all I Love it or we're going to dig into\nThis extremely creepy thing is I come at the mirrors I also have an update for you about time warps in UFOs\nThe extremely creepy thing it's like I'm anti of mirrors I also have an update for you\nAbout time warps in UFOs or later on we are going to give away some free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday a there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with your\n... and the way I'm bummed 'cause I got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your them but at least the spirit of me will be with you OK\nWell the you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank you\nGuys aren't the cycle meant the it's a small enclosed area set up with a cheer dim lighting the mirrors angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd the number of other people in person in the cycle anti um technique um and it it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager because\nI started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the or a local newspaper and I found again and again when\nI go into a haunted place someone would take me into a room and said this is the most talented room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I'd find a room that had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomenon\nUm there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have to Mir is facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infinite tunnel right like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light as electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of light which operates is some sort of a portal [noise]\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know what consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite tunnel of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of the spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to cry by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective substance and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience Georgian and then I Want everybody to understand this I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state known them\nWhen you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full\nStudied how to do this properly when you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional\nSeemingly Corp portrayal figure that will appear right in front of your head to toe and this being can come up to you and not only speak to you but touch\nAnd so the idea here is\nThat if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho man the ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased um other\nThan he would take you through a period of time that could be days where he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find that reminds you of her and he pictures\nAnd he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with that intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through now when this becomes\nVery scary when you have people who experiment or you know people talk about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble sort of thing yeah you have people who go in there\nAnd they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude that's a danger to\nYou you are well you know you get what you ask for right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a cycle Mandy\nBut you're convinced the work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments where you know we'll set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair\nAnd so the basic thing you need is a big mirror\nOn the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in front of\nIt and I'm not that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kind of stuff yeah I think we ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or a little nowadays LAPD lap in the background and maybe some white noise I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with a and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through Sacramento\nHim experience and I would say that a U.S alone with equal chores or is it is\nA lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody and a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent\nBut I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had\nThe full on it that's dramatic Josh with us we'll come back and talk about time warp since ...\nPaul Rubin from Santa Barbara California with a song called the winter when\nWhen\n... Las Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada and um\nI I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made the international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and the ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme\nHot spots in the state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred and so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can or capture something else but in the meantime here\nAnd um I mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way it was very cool that you played a a a group\nFrom Ashville North Carolina the group\n[laughter] you know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and er here that's where I have my mystery museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting declare an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context\nOkay um and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just incidents or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nAnd of course I never believed coincidences joins\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe in that would mean you'd believed there can be in effect without a cause and that\nJust doesn't make sense does the George new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media\nBut it was not it was not no I mean it was broken by the New York\nTimes so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop uh and this was a program that was a course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was who was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind\nUh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars in ... [noise]\nNow later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and solve the very night\nThat I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force so here I Am next to Harry fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announced that there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around that same time George nap whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in the state of\nNevada and a good one\nHe is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine if any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by you this advanced aerospace\nAnd I've got it in front of me and he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional\nAerospace related findings\nHe goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management and safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient he goes on to say even more\nAnd this is the one that really gets me\nAssociated exotic knowledge of that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries an unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here\nSo he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified live independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise]\nHe's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's why we need we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is it didn't come from them new so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic\nWhere could have possibly come from um I also want to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to Des where they go down the list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project in some of these topics there's thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes and space time gravity wave communication work drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and uh you know ... with which July twenty fifth All right so that said\nNow we move up to August August of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville joined\nThe mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry\nWhich is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb and they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beach to a nail us air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore guests when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space forced\nSo that said\nI Am of the impression here that there is some kind of\nThat is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry that as being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt what I'm telling you you can download the information for free if you go to Joshua ...

because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how\nYou have to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace\nAnd and I think it's in part\nThanks to people like you George you know you inspired me and gave me the opportunity to go down there to Key West and uh almost ten years ago\nAnd to do live reports and to really dig into this and I know you may or may not recall George I actually called into

you go to my Web site you can click around and find some of my video that I shot you know from the moment that I actually met Robert The home to do and I said look I'm Joshua pie Warren\nI have come here to understand you I'm going to report on what I find to a lot of people I'm asking for your permission and blah blah blah\nAnd so I think Robert and I got along very well and uh so I think you

like in the window we're running back and forth and weird stuff like that\nWell you know the the weirdest thing creepy his thing about the story of Robert The haunted Dahl is that he was given to a young boy a Robert Eugene auto which everybody called Eugene ore gene and gene\nBecame obsessed with this dog when gene was only like maybe four or five years old\nAnd then Jean grew up to be\nA very successful man uh had had a wife that everybody loves had a nice big house but it didn't change is infatuation with the dog I mean uh you might think back when you were a kid maybe there is some point that was special to you and then there came a point when it just sort of drifted away\nThat never happened for gene auto he kept this this\n... uh till the end of his wife and treated it in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better than he treated his wife I mean how little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room\nAnd eventually moved to the addict at at the wife's insistence but you know they claim that when finally Eugene died\nA and his wife moved out of the house and the house sat there abandoned for quite a few years waiting for a fire to come along and I actually did get to talk to some of the caretakers who ah worked in the house during that period of time who told me about just chilling experiences\nBut nonetheless people who were in the community said at night you could sometimes walk outside the windows and you'd look up by new new\nThat house was really one new their habit read see little Robert The do running around the house

two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us so Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you originally get started in pure normal\nCatalyst that got you in doing oddly enough George it was really an incident that happened before I was born really um yeah 'cause I I come from a large\nFamily or my mother is the youngest of ten kids and my dad is one of seven kids while and I both both sides of my family they'd been in the mountains of western North Carolina since the uh late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nUh but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of the family\nIn the great depression or my mother is a mother was named to Virginia Callaway that was her maiden name and when she was about Thirteen Years old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big deal back to her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything and the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties are named Claude came home from a small game hunting trip and she photographed them\nA holding up their squirrels and rabbits and stuff and when the picture develop my great uncle clogged Calloway her older brother did not have a head\nAnd they they knew that was weird but they were not able to understand enough about photography to realize just how weird it was so fast forward one month later\nA claud was sitting on the porch of the house\nAnd he was reading a copy of his favorite publication western magazine old gunslinger tails\nAnd uh his father Jack was in the kitchen fixing fixing lunch and they were conversing through an open window and at some point or jak said something to Claude called didn't answer and when the lunch was ready jak went outside and\nI'm here has claws magazine lying on the porch but there's no claws and a long story short my great uncle clogged Calloway was never seen or heard from again\nShe uh David ladies involved in the sun\nYeah well you know it's actually it's not too far from where there is a national uh part these days you know the ... national park area and and and what's even weirder is that you know I mean they did everything they got the authorities involved they got you know they were searching the woods\nAnd um you know hearing this fellow my great uncle who was waiting for his lunch you know in the middle of a story\nAnd reading a magazine ... how could he have disappeared was the abducted was the rapture way did he did he get caught up in a space time slip I mean we don't know but but you see it was compounded by the fact that this creepy photograph was taken\nOne month before and when I became an adult I went back to that area and did everything I could to try to find out what had happened and I mean I've verify the whole story with\nElderly people and ah historians and but still there's there's no explanation for this and and you see this was a big tragedy in my family or they never got over it they never had closure\nAnd I got to grow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound that this created\nAnd it made me realize that some of these mysterious phenomena or they're not just legends or superstition or or old folk tales I mean the the paranormal if you want to call it that\nThere's something very real that we have to take seriously and so that inspired me to go out and sort of try to define fact ah versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties was well I really started seeing\nThe defined fact ah versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties was well I really started seeing some bizarre stuff uh for myself with my own two eyes\nDo for you let's go to the final goals here let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi merry go ahead\nI Microsoft is November ... will go either go ahead and I was ... it was it will also say\nYes and how does that relate to how all souls and Halloween\n[noise] yeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth\nMy mother's birthday is November the third the day after yours and my sister's birthday is November the fifth and I can't tell you how many people I Know who have birthdays around Halloween including Dr Moulder who builds wishing machines his birthday is on Halloween\nAnd I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months that takes you kind of close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October [noise]\nBut um as far as your particular question is concerned so the the the basic tradition of Sao on which of course we now call Halloween is built around October thirty first and this is the product of the Catholic Church\nComing into the pagan areas of Europe and trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan beliefs into Christianity\nWith their own date well November ...\nWell they they realize that you know they weren't doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with a pagan\nAnd say instead of considering October thirty first um some kind of a pagan holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period\nAnd say that well this is the evening before the spirits of the saints comeback which would be November the first\nAnd so we will say November the first is the Halloween day\nAnd the evening before that is the Halloween evening or Halloween and so then uh they sort of combined the pagan beliefs of Halloween with all saints day on November first\nAnd then of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate the saints\nBut just celebrate all the soles of people who have died and so you end up with all souls day uh but this is one of those are interesting examples it goes back to you know Christmas we're going to be hearing more stories about this and uh probably is Christmas approaches where\nKnow the a lot of the patients will go out and worshipped trees you know the evergreen quality of trees and there was there was one of the um the higher ups in the Catholic Church is said look if we go out and we find a bunch of people who were

Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring\nA most of Japan uh easily into the range of their of of the American bombers so what the Japanese did was they spread stories to the civilians\nThat if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and you know God\nKnows what else civilians are enslave them\nScare the living daylights right\nAbsolutely terrified to when the Americans did invade the uh civilians were would run off of cliffs and commit suicide and then you know that's a documented piece of history\nJust a terrifying uh a story but now it there are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book\nIs that a group of tourists were added peace museum near those cliffs and ah they were walking in a field near that that museum and they heard the sound of what they considered and they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything\nAnd then they felt a wind pass them and then later heard what they described as cries and screams so that\nWas pretty moving for me um\nAnother story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally um a heartbreaking and he would Jima it there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably buried alive because they were ... they were in a tunnel system a very intricate\nTunnel system under the island and um the the entrances caved in or or or the soldiers were actually burned alive or in the tunnels\nSo there's a story that I write about that one\nA Japanese civilian worker claims that every time he gets a call that he has to return to the mainland and he uh he gets a knock on the door and he claims that these spirits of these are soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan\nAnd he claims that these spirits of these soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan to those are some pretty intense stories that a crop up and it's ... they're certainly not rare ah in in this volume middle\nEast what's interesting too man is that they seem to be so prevalent all over the place something's going on\nYeah that's true and not only are they everywhere that the different one of the amazing aspects of of of the world war two supernatural is that the goose don't even necessarily have to be people because there's actually goes planes that appear especially over England\nAlmost like the flying Dutch and the ship yeah absolutely exactly people see these planes and they're really not there\nYeah this is a and and I'll tell you a little story\nFrom my own family did they hear them too\nWell some do and some do but there's one area or in the United kingdom um [noise]\nUh it's a northern section of of the u._k. called derby sheer\nAnd it's known as the Bermuda Triangle of um the u._k.\nIt it sounds pretty pastoral sounding so I don't know why there's such activity but there have been a lot of plane crashes there about fifty planes I think if have crashed in that area and it has quite a reputation but over the years there have been what they called ghost plane flaps\nSo for example in Nineteen eighty five\nI'm a bunch of people a claim to seeing this huge military aircraft flying overhead one couple\nWas I'm driving down the highway\nAnd they saw this very low flying bomber cruising over the highway or and they said that it didn't have any sound whatsoever which was remarkable because it was so big and I you know I think they described it as a a for prop ... engine and it looked like a World War two bomb or\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know ... either a current military plane or possibly a um\nMaybe a a bomb or going to an air show or something\nLike that was what they want they thought you know\nYou write but to counter that a lot of these people that solve this first of all\nThere didn't seem to be a pattern a flight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a\nA a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft disappeared in different areas throughout that region and a couple of the people that spotted this one in particular worked uh\nFor a an airfield during World War two was ... I Believe I'm\nA somewhat flight mechanic for the for the ... uh R. E. F.\nSo definitely would have known the difference between let's say a modern I guess like a Hercules aircraft and something like a B. twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it would be twenty four bomber\nSo a pretty peculiar in and there have been other what they called ghost playing flaps\nA throughout history and I think there was even one as I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\n... the one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least to hear it and it just\nJust like that yeah yeah like they want to do a different time war or something right and\nThe reason I looked into the these are a ghost playing stories is when I was young my parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that\nAs they were starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy or you can make it found a winner overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Erie\nThat watch it with my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any\nAny story similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handles hundreds of and we're going to come back and talk more about how to World War two next hour you'll share your questions and stories\nGlucose website is no conveniently optimized ... says if you're a ... students ... you can listen to live in his

welcome back to coast to coast Matthew swing with us is website is linked up the coast to coast them dot com couple of his other books haunted rock and roll ghost some country music more hunt and rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest hunted in World War two soldiers spirits ghost planes and strange synchronous these\nPearl Harbor is it haunted or not\nIt's a extremely haunted according to a lot of the people that go there and uh\nMany of the people tourists people who are interested in history go there ah we'll talk about the feelings they have when they're touring Pearl Harbor especially the the USS Arizona memorial which is essentially a tomb a mass grave\n'em and they'll tell you what a a moving experiences and again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself into the time and space around Pearl Harbor and the ghost stories that are\nHave been told about that a famous area or are pretty extensive\nThere's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left\nHis watch on the USS Arizona I'm a just briefly and then ah during that time where he left the ship\nIt was attacked and sunk and now there's this story of this for Lauren looking sailor standing at the uh standing at the edge of the the memorial kind of looking out into the bay where the Arizona ... an hour is uh so that goes story has been told\nA quite a bit um [noise] excuse me sure there's also a story of a level of\nOne lady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course uh the waves in the memorial and then when she looked at it there seemed to be faces in them into the picture\nIs a very uh in that went on online throughout and not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted with therapy and go stories at places like the show field barracks and hit them airbase areas that were a part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor\nAnd one place in particular in heck I'm a there was the headquarters building that\nUh supposedly served as a morgue after the attack and had some two hundred three hundred bodies in it\nAnd the places so haunted they said that they moved to the ... desk which is usually inside the building they say now say they post the guards outside of the building because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of this ghostly activity the sound of people running up and down steps to such a degree that\nAh the steps the staircase itself would shake so it's a it's a pretty haunted place\nThe desert Fox rumble or the or the Nazi tens or tank leader man some incredible things happened to him to he died in Nineteen forty four mhm\nBut what does he still haunts\nWell that's probably the most interesting\nStory that I found a a when I when I started to research this book because I I did initially looks to see if I could find the\nThe ghosts of a lot of famous general's pat and Eisenhower as well as some of the the axis powers and Erwin ... has always been a kind of a subject of fascination for me so I started to [noise] you know try to find if there were any ghost stories about him\nUh I I thought he might be found in North Africa which is where he gained much of his fame as the desert Fox maybe on the shores of Normandy he would be among those many goes that appear\nIn Normandy he was really behind a a architecture the development of the fortifications there are in the construction of the defenses along with what was considered the their Atlantic Wall\nOr maybe he would be in Germany but I actually found go stories about ... in the United states believe it or not\nSo one of the places as mount Hebron cemetery and Winchester, Virginia people claim to see this a figure a long trench coat a cap on a looking over the graves and and there are some people who say that he is actually at the\nThe graves or he's seen at the graves of some of patents a general patents ancestors and then there's a A N in West Virginia where they claimed that Romney will haunt so what's the story behind that there is a story that\nAre between the wars ... along with a few other German generals traveled on a secret trip\nTo America to visit some of the ... the battlefields of the civil war particularly they were looking at the way the Stonewall Jackson maneuver through the Shenandoah Valley so this is why this\nStory that uh Irwin ... haunts these areas is is around today they think that uh he has left his spirit here because he once once visited the site now is there any historical basis for this\nI haven't been able to find any in most historians will tell you that it never had happened that the German generals never came here are people who believe these stories say it was a a secret\nMission and therefore there would be no historic record that was kind of the interesting one for me\nAnd what about other World War two infamous people do they still show up ponds\nWell there's some really interesting stories uh for me there's there's one that Churchill still haunts a subway in a\nIn a in London that once served as kind of a temporary bomb shelter and and\nAnd people have seen his spirit there I found the story that Churchill actually witness to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln in World War two to be fascinating ah he said that he and I hate to lay the imagery on your listeners but\nA according to Churchill he had to step down to the bathroom completely naked in what's now called the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House and he had traveled to the White House on several occasions to visit with a\nFDR Franklin Delano Roosevelt as well as other uh officials from the American side uh he steps out of the the bathroom and there's Abraham Lincoln leaning against the mantle and I think Churchill says something like when Lincoln turns to face him Churchill said something like ah I see you've caught me at all\nUntil and I think Churchill says something like when Lincoln turns to face him Churchill said something like ah I see you've caught me at a disadvantage Mr President and then a Lincoln fades\nAway so that was kind of\nLincoln probably faded away quickly\nYes I I would've I would've got out there as fast as I could he's Lincoln has gone through enough he didn't need to witness\nNot ... not a new Winston Churchill ...\nSo there's some other stories about Eisenhower he haunts ah what's called the bullet which is a a train that's on display at the national railroad museum I think that's in in Green Bay Wisconsin\nOr we talked a little bit about the ghosts of Gettysburg and apparently he andme Amy maybe behind some of the haunting ... in the farmhouse that they used to own their so yeah there's a lot of um a famous ghost stories from uh some of the the\nBigger leaders of uh the most famous leaders of World War two entities\nContinue these hunting\n[noise] yeah they do as a matter of fact uh you know the ... the bullet a I Believe there's the story that some of the stories that I found out about that a war from the Nineteen nineties the two thousands one story is that I'm\nA custodian who was a vacuuming the carpet in the bullet ... uh was halfway finished and decided to take a break left lock the door of the the train and uh went to lunch or or have a snack and then when he came back\nThe someone had completed\nThe vacuuming and he could tell because the lines of the vacuum cleaner were super straight up and down and according to some of the people who knew Eisenhower he was very meticulous and that's how he insisted on having his the bullet cleaned\nSo that story probably uh not too long ago\nAnd you know as we talked about the ghost plane flap they're happening probably even as we speak\nBack in World War two there were actually reports of UFOs they called them to fighters and they were small little disc type objects flying all over the place that pilots reported seen did you come across anything like that", "year":
