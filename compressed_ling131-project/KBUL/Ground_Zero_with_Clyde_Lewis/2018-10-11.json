goes up up up up and and we can't survive I think as a nation factional ... at this level eventually you'll Balkan eyes use a term for history will kind of break apart and so I think the ultimate thing is I I Can't you know I Can't solve all the political things here you got much bigger platform talk about politics than I Do\nI'm just trying to help Christians to say All right how do we react to how do we\nRespond and the answer is is not to take her identity from anything other than king Jesus and and and again I Know that's overtly spiritual but we're talking here in this\nIn his focus I mean so it's to take out any for Jesus Jesus is not coming back on air force one he's not riding a donkey or an elephant when he does\nAnd to acknowledge that I'm only all in as a Christian in following Christ and everything else is shaped around that my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom that's kind of our motto here we can college my identity is more to Christ and his kingdom than anything else\nSo I explain this yesterday that um you know the the so called Christians of the Westboro Baptist church\nYou know they they hold up signs you know God hates this got hates that blah blah blah they're just despicable you don't win\nBy by holding up signs no God hates view and shouting things back you win by listening by understanding by him racing them as a soul or a brother and sister not to do what they're doing standing up but people\nIn particular that actually left her own family in the Westboro Baptist church because somebody spoke to her with civil civility and said let's just reason here for a minute\nYeah that's okay I got on my desk actually right every front of me a name played because they actually protested at my church we went out and serve them coffee and doughnuts and they called me and the national news\nI Can't use one of the words probably on the radio but I'll lying the false prophet and so it's actually one of my staff made into a name played it says it says lined blank false prophet Westboro Baptist church which by the way it's either wrapped it was either Baptist church\nBut but in doing so I mean the question is how do we respond well somebody reached out I actually interviewed one of members of the family as well a Christian Today so somebody reached out and I will tell you I think that's what we can do right now with people who deeply disagree with us and\nThe book is filled with examples of Christians who actually build relationships with people who radically disagreed and in the process where able to come to maybe a better understanding of what examples for example is a is the president by all university which is a Christian university in California\nAre met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party of state legislature there in California\nThat was trying to change laws that would make it illegal for ... to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more well he ended up getting to understand each other better the will the bill was ultimately not moved forward but dropped and and and now we're at a very different place now I'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying\nThat Christians need to try to do that\nAnd I do think that in doing so well act a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians historically because the the moment we're in is not time for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and and as you said earlier to your caller I'm calling people to arms\nYet that's not I mean Glenn that's not an uncommon view and I know some of the some of the worst\nThings I see on social media I I click on a lake and I find go to the bio and it's the first things listen the thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like and I think that's what we need is a change in a lot of hearts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us this right now or the the victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained or as slaves or you know story after story after story of these Christians\nWho I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you\nI'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're going to come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit and we're gonna crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said\nWe understand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with Peter unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate 'cause you know victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about are trying to hold back the advance of course that he's a pagan\nAnd he says this a while the pagan preece\nNeglect the poor the hated galleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these in pious galleons empire ... not only feed their own poor but I was also welcome them into their a guy by\nThat's how big this company is wow they're going to be a the largest clothing retailer by twenty twenty\nUh they're already so more books than anybody on earth they've driven how many uh book retailers out of business um and there there are about to spend more on original programming than even Netflix or they're going to be the biggest Hollywood producer [laughter] to so many things is it time to\nI mean I don't know what you do about it do you favor as a capitalist breaking up a company that is what they did to Microsoft that's what they did to a or they tried to to Microsoft has what they did with mountain Val I'm\nGive it mountain bill was in with the government\nI mean that was that was protected by the government and part of a you know that was that was a protected property you couldn't you couldn't start anything against them right that's why yeah I mean you know you could start your own Amazon you're not able to compete\nWith each other are other options you know there are other options are just people you know the problem is Amazon does everything better than everybody else you know this is a real problem where we've been talking about small\nWeak is I don't I don't want you to change Amazon I like Amazon I like Amazon Prime I like the fact\nThat the yesterday we were trying to build a stupid volcano for um my daughter and\nTanya went and got a three percent hydrogen peroxide and and we're reading it I'm like I think thirty five percent is a different kind of peroxide and it is I didn't I mean it's a dangerous kind peroxide [noise]\nUm and we didn't have it so I go online and I'm like where can you get it Amazon [laughter] I mean it'll have you'll have tomorrow you know you had as others I mean it's I don't want them to change some of these things\nAnd and we're the same way with Google and Google's getting pretty intrusive things right but we we like their search engine\nIn the mail is great I mean like free and so we just we get it out who your real good minute ... from Google Amazon you may say Margaret Amazon controls I mean people are like oh well I buy a lot of things wrong with that and it's obviously a big part of their business when they're cloud computing is really the main thing driving all of their profit auto\nUm you know and it's a and so many places or use it every place you go on the Web based government young Amazon yeah I mean\nAnd it's like you know Alexa at this point is a it's a luxury a product of moderate\n... utility right like I mean I feel like it's fun to play with like we use it as a speaker you ask it the weather every once in a while I mean there's a couple of things you can do it but I mean like I don't know is Alexa changing my life no as a as I Know primal absolutely has changed my yes yeah I mean it's ... I I ... yeah\nPrime time can deliver to your door within an hour yeah I mean you could I think you could safely say Amazon has\nAlmost killed the them all\nYes yeah most of the ... right I mean it's you know it's an between Amazon and Google they have totally changed the world well yeah yeah like there's a there's a big mall near where we're doing the show in Texas and\nYou know it's it's still has tons and tons of stores in it but you start to notice the way it changes it's changing from a place to shop into a place for experience that yes there are lots of things for kids and lego stores and aquariums they took one of the big box stores\nAnd they made it into a giant um it's I think it's called the field house it's a giant gym with like twenty five basketball courts in all leagues going more as entertainment yeah let's see more of an entertainment complex has has to go yeah\nWell that's certainly a a bad thing I mean I don't get it's a cool you go somewhere and have an experience with other people and then people bring things to your door it's bedtime\nAnd so now I can I can I tell you about the experience I had last last week and I have to tell you it is\n[noise] okay\nThe only thing ... you get to be rich\nIt's the same problems just bigger K ... uh is there is one game changer and that is private air travel that changes your life entirely okay on that same\nMedia ... I've seen some things that are game changing in certain ways you know being able to do it online instead of and TV and it's a pretty big no no no I went to something called the void have you heard

Saturday meeting the\nSearch for extraterrestrial intelligence Institute and of course there is meant to be the messaging extraterrestrial intelligence international\nSaid he deals with searching for a Methodist from aliens many on the other hand there are signs of deals with the creation of messages that they want to send the aliens best SETI enmity proponents have quite different perspective cities scientists are in position to address only the question does active search for extraterrestrial intelligence makes sense\nIn other words would it be reasonable\nFor SETI successor the search freshly terrestrial intelligence success would it be reasonable to transmit with the object of attracting extraterrestrial intelligence the attention ... which we might be able to contact aliens instead of waiting to hear from them like SETI does\nHowever this does not mean bet organizations like many international are without ideas on how we might better listen to our potential structural intelligent after all a\nCommunication goes beyond mere messages and also requires the medium exists with which to convey the message they need something to decode or otherwise interpret the messages and so\nYou have the need for multiple methodologies to increase the odds of finding something and there's also the problem knowing what to look for\nBut we've been shown in many Hollywood movies how we should communicate or how we could communicate with extraterrestrial intelligence in the film close encounters of the third kind scientists communicated with music in light they had a music in light Oregon they played the elites respond in the movie a rival\nScientists had to use linguistics or linguists and a marine biologist to read the black communications what were called ... they were technical ... and there were technical creatures that are remaining environment suited for them and their space pots\nAnd that was amazing show I mean more so it was kind of dry to drag and wasn't really your typical science fiction but it was amazing to see how they came up with the idea how the aliens would communicate it was a special way to communicate and how linguist took like years\nMay no they don't necessarily I think demonstrate that\nThings would communicate there was a special way to communicate how linguist took like years may now they don't necessarily I think demonstrate that but they took years to come up with the idea on how to communicate with the alien\n\nAnd we've been shown or various ways that the aliens would make contact with us and uh\nMost of what we see in films are like radar blips you know we see this radar blip you know what is it oh the aliens trying to talk or we have sound signals that can be a decoded by the magic of computer tech in mathematics and remembering contact\nThey had that scraping noise\nAnd when they were able to do that because of scraping noise and sent back a video clip of the Olympics and they saw Hitler and everybody panicked and and uh because uh they didn't know that what they what they were getting was one of the first television programs\nThat was broadcast and ah this is what they saw and they send it back but it was saying oh they're not Caesar's based on my God I thought\nThat was pretty I I thought it was pretty scary actually I mean I think that you know the aliens first signals they send back to us or or signals from the you know German Olympics the Nineteen thirties so I mean\nWe show in various ways ah the aliens can talk to us through mathematics computer tech as well speaking through a computer ah this is another way that we've always imagine let's see this is where our imagination is limited especially now with apparently something has happened\nWhere both SETI enmity are beginning to act as though they are located something in space but they're not capable of explaining it to the public\nI get that feeling I don't know if you get that feeling but I get that feeling I get the feeling\nThat after their ah techno signatures workshop in Texas I get the feeling that after a members of the group like such show stacking and a singer named Jill Tarter they said well you know they bet in Irvine, California and they said we ... we need to rethink our position here as a\nAs astronomers and scientists and those who wanted to find communication we may have it already\nBut we have in the form of technological signatures we don't have in fact we don't have aliens chirping at us from another planet we don't have signals coming from the planet we have fast radio birds that are big flashes of light that come in that could be you know from spaceships they're saying alien spaceship skip produce vast radio burst but there's something else though\nOr something else we touched on a few few days ago or maybe in a week ago because ah from what I've been reading lately but take notice things your clothes are far more advanced had that we've been told\nWe also maybe under the control of some of these techno signatures as a human ear as picked up on the signal that they say maybe ... ... this was creepy okay\nThere are indications I don't want to panic you but there are indications that the aliens have been sending signals\nAnd only certain people have picked up on them because they're so faint or they they're they're they're buried in the noise of the cities and sometimes when you went in the mountains or you've got the desert you can hear the signals being sent\nSome people are far more acute they made their they have in ... and they're able to hear the sounds and their pulse things down okay [noise] um [noise]\nAnd this is where it gets weird because it makes you wonder if the aliens have been sending some sort of a sonic sound you know like those horns those angel horns we've been hearing [noise] well yeah they said that they were just solar storms and maybe they were the result of soda storms or maybe kind of a thunder caused by a ... a ... [noise]\nYeah how\nMany of you probably if your Internet ah enthused as it probably already heard that song because it's it's making the rounds 'cause it's an amazing sound especially when it's out in

do with the boom boom boom it's not that I that that happened before we somebody's like parked at a need my window willing sleeping and I can hear the low frequency homemade realize oh it's some guy you know\nPlaying his ... is a you know low base listening to either dumped step for something else so you know I have to go wow you know it's a little loud but this is in the middle of nowhere does way he's out in the middle of nowhere really it's out of the salt flats\nUm I Believe is in ... county so yeah since I've been there I've been to Doug way was escorted out of there by ah\nBy the security there I mean the military showed up told me that I needed to leave they were nicer to me\nBut then whacking hot showed up and the guy looked like some Nazi with it with a gun and he told me to get off the property ... the actually escorted us we were to care of and we're doing a a a TV documentary uh for the ... channel called the unknowns zone we were doing it as a pilot\nGot off the ground but uh we were there and doing the pilot and a were stopped by the military saying get away from the ... the area where like I said we what five hundred six hundred feet away from the gate\nWhere we're nowhere near the gate but apparently they said that we were looking suspicious they want us out of there and then of course whacking that stepped in and said you know we want you off the property and we're going to escort you out to all the county if you come back we'll bust you\nAnd so they drove is to the great Salt Lake and then that's all she wrote you know they turn around what the other direction but it's very quiet out that way I mean it's it's it's quiet you're you know you're out in the middle of nowhere and you don't you're birds you don't hear radios you don't hear anything\nOut there it's just just damn damn quiet\nI don't know if anybody if any have you been to every fifty one Rachel I haven't been to Rachel, Nevada but I hear it's also very quiet and Rachel's very quiet in a\nThe areas near area fifty one because it's something to build a desert so I'm sure you know you can pick up on these types of sounds and and like I said the pulse wave in northern Sweden do was in a place where the ... just fallen and uh\nSo that everybody's attention because you know while it's not all that any president not as I don't think it's as impressive as the one you're Doug way but it's still got that low frequency bit rattled the house listen to this\n[noise]\n\nNow it's really hot it's ah I actually took my headphones off and the big speakers in the studio ... it was like I could feel my whole body felt like my uh felt like my us buying was tingling or something so um yeah it's\nPretty amazing these homes okay alright started on this because we don't get the feedback that was weird okay ... feedback whatever speakers are so during the speakers off a catch ... experiment I own studio in Africa myself out\nSo the question is that good these Homs be connected to the task of secret spacecraft or is it a single is being sent from extraterrestrial intelligence and the form of gravity pulses that are picked up by people who are sensitive pulses\nIt'd be remembered yet does anybody remember the the recording I played\nOf two police officers was a cold morning about four thirty in the morning near saint Helens Oregon\nIt's a well known recording of up to police officers and they record the sound of a of a huge light sitting on the Columbia River and it's a UFO and they they basically key up their CB radio\nAnd it sounds it sounds almost the same right it sounds the same uh but you know they say something like a large diesel motor rubbing up and then of course taking off but he said it's just you know so compelling\nHere these officers you know you know talking with one another about what they're experiencing what they're seeing nothing was said during these\nTo Homs because they just wanted everybody to get the feeling of the home I'm sure that you want to say anything I mean there is a\nSequence if you look up the video up on the Internet there is a sequence where you hear a snowmobile go by which I think ruins the mood but I mean uh I'm sure the guy is Sylvia Earle didn't care is that the guy was doing when he was doing was there on the civil bill's really didn't hear it but in the quiet do you really can't hear that rumbled you'll be hearing\nRumbling in the sky [noise] so uh so this is where you know we have to wonder what are these rumbles we have to know what are these sounds\nYou know the bees are signals being sent to us from space [noise] are they actually ... aircraft or something else I mean but [noise] they they were saying ah just recently been the aliens could we trying to contact us by other means [noise] and I would\nSay that ah [noise] what's going on right now is the city is setting aside is setting us up to mayor setting us up for a yes follow up on the other day a week they're setting and stuff I think for disclosure or at least to tell us they have detected somebody but they do not know how to report it\nNor do they know how to identify but yet the sounds are skipping in these little rumbles these horn sounds all this stuff's happening makes you wonder if they're all connected Tripoli except at three thirty seven hundred will be back\nMike is on Facebook forward slash
