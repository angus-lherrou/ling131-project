and this group and this group\nThat they become the power um it it sounds like it's it's just not just the construction it is constructing something that is the authoritarian in nature\nThe I did that

and mistake liking for one's own traditions and culture and as I could say everybody else's and as a form of racism and all that she can nice and simplicity and\nBasic thing cool and and you do any of the ...\nSo we just spend a couple of minutes on a on what you guys did a a a ... to try to get nonsense published in peer reviewed uh and uh and you and you you know you are hoping maybe to get one but you had seven in a year\nAnd some of the topics were insane\nWhich one where you are responsible for\nWell I I took part in all of them I I listen I took\nThe lead on on one ... Chen code when the judge Sonia electricity that chick hate that and I'll get that\nThat there is not acceptable way to criticize a social justice scholarship and activism\nAnd that anybody who looked potato or did a ... or ... academic hoax of it was trying to possess them and and the prison itch and that one was accepted quite quicksand and was apparently a as an accent a contribution\n[laughter] so but you don't you you you guys found out that you couldn't just published nonsense\nAnd tradition to [laughter] so for you to you you guys found out that you couldn't just published nonsense exactly yeah that's a point to the\nRight you you you you actually had to\nUm to join in on the on the grievance club is that it is that accurate\nYes he is really have to understand and navigate a complex arrangement of\nOf rules so it is that we couldn't say anything that was was crazy but we had to stay there recently within orthodox and this developing body as Siri say sometimes yes we take a mad idea like and at this hour we'll take home pay among the dogs were\nTrained humans in the same men like dogs and\nThen we'd have to find some way to make it to the theory and in that case we looked at San assumptions about implicit bias and claimed that we could read it in humans and interactions with dogs\nAnd that was that the hook that enabled us to build and I love to see a way to support this plane and Fritz they accepted and then on that does exemplary scholarship [noise]\nUnbelievable what was what was the hum you took Adolf Hitler as mine calm and and how much of that tax did you leave in and what did you change\nBut that is quite that's quite difficult to explain and James ... to relate on that one so I'm not entirely clear on what to the end okay anyway thoughts\nThe important thing to ask you if you read it ... you would not immediately think they sounds just like Hitler you know it has been changed it to intersect snow feminine isn't that the point is that one was really to to draw on the and\nThe grief and it's and the totalitarian kind of feel of that but also we wanted to say you wanted to prove\nThat we could make Siri say absolutely anything if we just both in enough different\nThings and it said that one is incredibly complicated bringing in\nTheory from all over the place but in the end it it it builds up to two yes to to make that kind of we must all together in the right thing against a column that common enemy and narratives what\n... ... ... when this came out uh and uh I mean I Would think that this would be something that you know the uh the the\nThe world that you travel in would be outraged that those things were accepted a and you would you'd be viewed as a whistle blower hey wait a minute we've got a problem\nYou got have you have you had any response like that from your peers\nSurprisingly yes we we have I Would\nSay yeah we we were delighted for example that and the judge switches often and extremely critical of criticism of this and that is not the and the ... and sort of academic academics left isn't\nActually came down on our side and said at remained quite neutral and the old says often nine for Iran said yeah\nThe whole city on charitable\n[laughter]\nUh you know he didn't say anything with an English accent it's like a\nIt's like a uh it's it's it's like here in the Carolinas if you've ever come down in the

are more expensive because the steel terrorists so my point to chop is this isn't even creating factory jobs were going to lose factory jobs as a result of that so\nI disagree very strongly with the steel and aluminum tariffs I think they do more harm than good\nDoes he look like he's softening\nNow do you think\nI don't see I don't see it either and I remember in response to that question isn't it [laughter] you know he's not you know and I\n... at the rose garden last week he said how he was ... boasting about how all the steel jobs were created it's true we are creating steel jobs Mr President but we're losing jobs we're losing you know jobs in uh in other areas that manufacture a quip meant trucks and things you know those kinds of things that they use steel aluminum so\nIt's a it's a dumb policy I Wish you would reverse it and by the way the auto ... same thing even in the U.S auto industry that's a lot of the year ... you know there's so many of those supplies Tom from you know a country's abroad you know there's there was manufactured ... steel might have come from\nA you know Canada about the assembly might have come from Mexico the the parts might have come from Taiwan I mean there's just this is the modern American\nAnd global economy at work and and we put our ourselves at risk here but at the end of the day I think Trump is going to prevail on China I think I'll make a production within six months I think China's gonna come out in hand and make some real concessions to chew a Trump and uh and all of them if that happens is that you're going to see

sorry I signed up\nAnd uh my uh sorry my uh my daughter was born she was born a four months early and ah I ah my focus sweat from everything going on\nAround the world to what was going on in my house by house hold it and uh it was a\nSorry it was a challenging um we were\nShe was she was born of ever first and she was in the hospital and so on so Easter and she came home and she added ... to ... and um she was on oxygen and stuff like that but she was home um I Am\nRemarried and a B and my wife we have between us we had three three daughters and we tried for about ten years and stuff that never happened and that are out of the blue wife calls me and says uh we'd had a conversation\nAt a she told me that uh\nThat she was pregnant and uh\nIt's I don't know I I sympathize with the the the gentleman you you were talking with um because I I still have moments where I Want to get angry and stuff but then I stop and take a step back and brave at his bank of big of a daughter you know\nSo did you think did you can gain hope or did you gain perspective\nYes [laughter] a both I gave you a ... it's just I I had hoped because I Want I Want a better world for my daughter you know a\n... the great Jerome thank you for sharing that and thank you for um thanks for your honesty of emotion there um uh the the good thing is in this what I tried to um impress 'em or color yesterday after um he hung up unfortunately was\nWe're weaning we're winning commonsense is winning it doesn't feel like it but that's just because the power structure that you're used to\nIs no more\nAnd when you look at what's happened and you look at the Democrats saying the things that they're saying now that you know Eric Eric Holder today the latest\nIt's possible first of all I Would say Kavanaugh if\nIf the last two years have been any indication Kavanaugh will be ancient history by the time this election happens it's like three weeks from now I like these things go away for example ah the the Access Hollywood tape happened right about this time in two thousand sixteen\nRight about now we've got Tobar eighth or ninth in September eleventh that I\nUh and that by the time the election came as we saw had basically no impact on news ... minutes stuff goes away fast and I think there will I don't think this is because because it's not just Kavanaugh if they would've yeah left\nIt alone leclaire Williams but they're not they're doubling down Hillary Clinton yesterday we can't live with these people\nI'm a Eric Holder comes out that the news today that he says\nWhen when they go low we kick them and the crowd cheers and this and he follows it with this is who the new Democratic Party is amazing\nAmazing Michelle Obama pushed back on that today by the way kind of an interesting way um but you know what you see I think is if you are under control you can make these stories go away their craziness in the cabinet thing could probably be forgotten by a lot of voters if you look at it from the time that Donald Trump came down to the escalator to today\nProbably his cleanest months\nWas October two thousand sixteen after that that a tape came out\nHe was buttoned up for the rest of that time and made very few statements and wound up winning the election um because people were able to kind of forget about you know started this craziness and scandals that were going on and look more Hillary Clinton enters craziness and scandals\nUm so if you look at this ... they ... they could get it to go away doing things like we're going to kick them when they're when they go low\nA and a few people saying that's not a mob what are you talking about that sort of stuff is not going to help them no ... and so far since the cabinet saying what we've seen is really encouraging numbers for the GOP particularly in the Senate\nThe Senate has a you know we had a lot of reasons we talked about the um Robert Francis overworked versus a Ted Cruz situation where Cruz a that poll came out of fifty two forty three\nA nine point lead know Cruz had been there was one policy\nMost of them settled around three or four points with cruise leading\nUm that's expanded in multiple polls now to a nine or ten point I think it would be more than nine or ten point yeah the fat grey who are who are not in here with us today but he was talking on his show or he goes yesterday the day before\nBelieves that it's going to be over ten points you know I think it'll be I think it will be between fourteen in Eighteen points to another interesting poll that came out yesterday again from the New York times\nAnd this is the other during his life pulling thing I mentioned uh last hour\nHow many calls is it takes to get seven hundred and Seventy eight responses in Texas how many calls you have to make to get seven hundred and Seventy eight people to talk on the phone to you the number\nFifty one thousand one hundred and Ninety two oh my God they had to call fifty one thousand people to get seven hundred and Seventy eight to actually participate in the poll which is incredibly well you're calling Texas a and if it's marked with a New York number more in the New York times I understand that\nAh I mean it's this is ... overall like for example York they did they also pull the eastern Long Island district New York one\nAre and what they found a five hundred and two responses they had to make twenty seven thousand one hundred and Seventy ... or you answer and seriously do you know anybody that would take the time to answer that nobody does and that I wouldn't you know again if you take into account that factor which is totally changed over the last Twenty years with cell phones and and uh telemarketers and all those things\nIt's amazing these guys get even close to accurate results from polls because\nYour self selecting a group of people who want to participate him and it's a you know who knows if they're representing Google Home should include some sort of an F MRI so they can just read our brains and that would make it a lot of you who would make it a lot easier to come to your door that yeah I wanted to\nUm another interesting poll that came out of there are times though however was a protest of the Taylor Swift effect\nRemember Taylor Swift after all these are all the time being silent on on politics decided to dive into it and explicitly they\nRidiculously full or you know again like the almost feel like with her PR team if you're going to come out and do this at least have like sensible observations and don't be just bumper sticker you know a ... you know\nQuote tweeting Huffington Post write like that was the level of analysis she provided in her little post but again she's one of the biggest celebrities in the world how does this happen\nHow she's from Tennessee she came out in Tennessee race the biggest thing that she talked about was Marsha Blackburn saying how anti women she was and and how she didn't care about this she wanted to keep gaze at of stores and all these ridiculous things that aren't true\nI'm the first polls come out since that um and ... the most of the ... ... calls were uh after that\nUh fifty four to forty Blackburn leads fourteen points this was a race that was in the tossup category now if that polling holds I can think we could fit a safely or understand that more people care about what Kanye West thinks about politics than Taylor Swift a but we'll see if that holds or not\nSo we could look at\nSenate possibly a red wave in the Senate yeah I think you know so we talked about this a little while ago to which makes sense people know that where the Supreme Court is happening and also people are in red states right and they're going to become more excited to vote more passionate about voting\nThe ... the house we're seeing sort of a a slight turn to the opposite effect wear purple districts um sometimes it has been feeling a little bit Lou a little more blue\nNot much to tell from it I think all ready to houses in real real danger I mean I it would be a surprise at this point if the Republicans were able to pull out the house not impossible it would be a surprise um uh but for the Senate real quick\nWe had ten tossup races that we were talking about before um and I believe it was three or four that the ... the Republicans had to win to control the Senate\nA separate says that we were talking about before um and I believe it was three or four that the ... the Republicans had to win took control of a sudden I think it was three they'd with three of the tent at the time we talked about it but Ted Cruz race which which he was favored by only three points was the best\nCase best case right now that's changed dramatically since we talked about that a couple of weeks ago now I'm a Ted Cruz seems to be on solid ground uh and more than a three point lead\nA Heidi Heitkamp seems to be in massive danger I Would say it looks like two races were decided with the Kavanaugh hearings barring some other may major development ah Heidi Heitkamp voted against him she looks like she's toast and Arthur in North Dakota now I'm Joe Manchin voted for having all he looks like he's safe\nSo those two races are not even in the ... category anymore in my mind\nA leader and neither really has to cruise one which gets you down to about seven toss ups\nWhich the Republicans need to win one one of the seven will keep the Senate in Republican hands is much improved situation for even when it was just a couple of weeks ago the cabinet I think I think is a big part of it\nOr we don't know that for sure yet I think I Will play out in the next week or so when we really have a lot of results but it looks very promising in the Senate better than it's looked probably all year\nOr so that's a that's a good thing if you care about that\n... let me let me explain something this election\nCould mean that I Know I Know technically we have three branches of government but I Believe we kind of had five we have\nThe press and the people okay by the executive legislative um and a judicial are the three in the constitution then you have the fourth which is the press and the people I Believe what happens in this election could put all five branches into chaos\nIf they win the house the house will go nuts\nAnd they will impeach they will subpoena which those subpoenas we'll go to the Senate the Senate will be in chaos because of it because of the Democrats\nThey will put the administrative in chaos because it will be under impeachment and it will also ah have testimony that it has to give that it will fight to they're going to subpoena his tax records he will fight that which will go into the Supreme Court\nWhich the people will rise up and destabilize the fifth branch if you will the people as they stand up\nAnd they're starting to fight kind of back and forth in the streets you know not in a mob sort of way just in in ... sort of way they will the house will then again I think tried to impeach Kavanaugh\nOr at least get him to recuse himself from anything having to do with the administration you watch\nIt all and end the press is already in\nChaos all every piece of society could be in chaos based on this election\nTo be a fun couple of years it'll be fun apple year thanks to Williams or give us a quick report maybe every day here as things start to change yeah ah and ah give us a look on the bulls I'd also like you to\nSummarize the polls that I gave this morning on the people\nAbout the you know what is it eight percent of the people are progressive hardliners\nTwenty nine percent are a conservative hardliners and the rest are are being called uh the what was it the burned out a core or the or the ... the tired core the people that are in the middle saying I don't want to be\nA part of either of these [noise] it's pretty remarkable\nAnd the tired core the people that are in the middle saying I don't want to be a part of either

on conspiracy theory [noise] yeah [laughter] okay yeah well the ... theory [noise] the hypothesis it's a\nIt's based on a few you know mitigating facts is based on a few things okay but if you say I have a conspiracy\nI have I have put together the names and I put\nTogether the ideas I began to the ideology behind the conspiracy\nAnd\nIt's amazing way of looking at how we are headed ... which direction we're headed out our current trajectory\nOur nation's dynamic is going away completely and I think people know that the dynamic of what America is and what it's supposed to be has gone away\nOkay two nights ago I called my show new justice no peace and attempted to point out\nThe traditional way we think of civil war in this country is clouding the fact\nThat we are already in one and and and well no one will judge tribute school shootings that beats the gate shootings the Las Vegas attacks the symptoms of a civil war and progress\nOur leaders both left and right our knowledge in now that violence will be an inevitability in this country after the November midterm elections or this isn't me you know ... up the the emotion\nOkay 'cause I was putting so I put something up on my Facebook page oh yeah I put up with the Hillary Clinton said ... ... is no there no more time to be civil I put that up on my on my side because that is that prompted in New York Post to put up civil war under headline\nSo yesterday the headline on the New York post civil war and I talked about civil war the night before the post posted their civil war headline so and and they were pointing to what Hillary Clinton said the Christian on the poor CNN when she was interviewing her and she said something to the fact that\nUm you know we don't have to be civil to a government that doesn't respect us\nOkay\nBut the Trump of course President Trump warned that there will be violence if the Republican Party loses the November's midterm\nThat they cut deep both ways the media pays the president's threatened violence as wishful thinking on the president's part is if they know as a fact but this is what he wants and then they will magnify it in order to make him the poster child for his dream right wing views however the extremism became even more intense\nAfter CNN's Christie on on the poor sat down\nFor an interview with Hillary Clinton Clinton told everyone watching that the time of civility is over she says you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for and what you care about\n\nHe said that's why I Believe that we are fortunate enough to win back the White House and or the Senate that's wouldn't civility can start again so there you have it\nA declaration of civil war and a license for violence\nSee the motives of course he's getting what you want by any means necessary not that the vote matters just how much trouble intimidation and ... and ah and civility you can create to change the direction of the votes\nSo Donald Trump says there will be by there will be violence if the Republicans lose Hillary Clinton says no civility until we win\nNow that doesn't sound like\nCold War I don't know what does okay\nAnd and I mean the New York post agreed with me yesterday and was most disconcerting is while the media will say that Trump's words are to be expected they failed to expound upon the comments that Hillary Clinton made no one not even an interviewer stopped and asked her\nIf she was saying could be considered reckless or feeling the fire there was already started consequences be damned a civil war has to happen in order to take over the Senate that's what\nThat's what I got from both of them\nFrom says violence if we lose Hillary Clinton says violence until we win\nNow what should we do what should we do how are we supposed to vote either way we're screwed right he is a quagmire\nThis this this is a quagmire this we are we have two leaders okay\nAnd and the other is the leader I don't care what you say she's the leader of a group of people 'cause she's the leader of the\nResistance OK she says we will not be civil\nUntil we when Trump says if you win may ... uh the the the Republicans won't be so\n... we're at war with ourselves\nAnd the mob\nNamely those who have been attacking\nPoliticians namely those who've been in you know creating the road road blocks okay as those who have been pounding on the doors of Congress during the cabin on hearing all of this mob mentality he's is right now being contained\nBut one day it won't be contained okay and one day the mob will rule if the mob isn't ruling are already and you have two people should know better because what they're\nNow is they're meddling in our own election [noise] this is meddling OK Hillary Clinton is meddling Donald Trump is meddling they're both meddling [noise] and they're giving threats of violence if it doesn't go their way [noise]\nLeft wing conspiracy mirroring Hillary what you said about a vast right wing conspiracy so she's talking about history mirroring a rhyming like I said\nAnd then what you get is Hillary's response to listen to this\nKenny on Conway the presidential advisor talked about this process and she said it all started ... left wing conspiracy it echoes what you said about when your husband was being pursued by investigations back in the Nineteen ... white right wing conspiracy\nFirst of all your comment on that mirrored language and secondly these anyway even a conservative think who I was speaking of yesterday said the only way to repair America should try to get back to some divinity and to try to make it even if we have political disagreements we're not going to war with each other we're not trying to destroy each other\nWell certainly I Would love to see us return to civility listening to one another or working out our differences that is not the Republican Party that exist today and that is certainly not the administration that we have in power right now [noise]\nWhen the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland\nUm heard I think anything that they stole a justice from the ... I think they did I mean to keep the Supreme Court said open for a year or to deny it distinguish jurists they could have voted down they could have said well for ideological reasons philosophical reasons\nHi to deny it distinguishes Europe they could have voted down they could have said well for ideological reasons philosophical reasons or we're not going to vote for him but no they don't ...\nAnd that was such a breach a part of Africa and the constitutional responsibility of a Senate to advise on can harm a nomination [noise] that you cannot be several with a political party that wants to\nDestroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nHouse and or the channel that twin ... can start a gap\nThat sort of civility can start again is when we get the Senate\nOtherwise the time for civility is over but did you notice how a Christian of CNN Christian ... said\nA on before said that ah she's noticed the mirroring of of what's being said here this is a left wing conspiracy as opposed to what Hillary set about a vast right wing conspiracy\nSo okay so let's just eliminate for the moment the idea of a theory roads Hillary's theory or whether it's Kellyanne Conway theory he isn't mirroring of time and it is a conspiracy who\nIs behind the conspiracy who is joining up the emotion and hysteria\nTo put us into this moment in time where extremism is even more intense\nWhere we have to gin up the extremism and get everybody angry to everybody you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy you stand for what you care about\nThat's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that sensibility can start again\n\n[noise] see I see that as a declaration of civil war it's a license for violence\nThe motive of course is getting what you want by any means necessary and that is what it is you know consequences be damned you know this is what we want to this is what we need this is what we get\nAnd it has to happen in order for us to take over the Senate\nSo her claim\nThe civility can return when the Democrats have power is a mission that something is up if Donald Trump is saying well if we don't win there will be violence than he knows just exactly what happens\nOf course the mainstream media will continue to expose or at least exploited or Donald Trump is saying because they want that\nTo be used against them if and when violence breaks out at the election\nAnd we've been talking about the final blow for some time and maybe this is it maybe we're waiting for that happening in November maybe we're having later on but the response is what shows me the response to way Hillary Clinton had to say I mean the New York post headline yesterday declared civil war\nAnd published a number of articles pointing out the silliness of the country and civil war over the president\nIs they hate and a woman that resent the fact that she lost to a gym said running for the presidency\nAnd all the resentment of those who oppose her\nNow if you're one of the unfortunate wants to go to Facebook and rent your spleen on the matter you were either shadow band\nOr you were one of the unlucky ones it with an algorithm stick\nI'm being jammed so you know those are you there listening and you're hearing the jamming I Know what I'm getting mean Facebook said that today\nHundred us publishers and accounts\nFor what they say was flooding users what politically oriented content that violated the company's spam policies\n\nNow the timing couldn't have been more obvious in my opinion and there certainly was an OB swell up criticism against Hillary Clinton Facebook of course and I think that they utilize their thought police or the thought police algorithms to remove any and all of a speech that would create any bad press for the former secretary of state\nFacebook said it was removing the publishers and accounts not because of the type of content they posted\n\nBut because of the behaviors they engaged in including spanning Facebook groups with identical pieces of content and using fake profiles not that not only did they remove sites that we're focusing on the comments of Clinton\nBut they didn't so before the midterm elections\nOne of the pages nation and distress pitched itself as the first online publication to endorse president Donald Trump founded in twenty twelve and a mask more than three point two million lives in over three million followers according to a Washington Post review on Thursday\nAnd reason and posting photos\nAnd to criticize journalists for failing to report on Trump's approach to China and sharing a link to to a story that are called\nRepresentative ah Maxine Waters demented the page affiliated itself with a website called America's freedom fighters which appeared to post its own content and duplicate press releases ran by others about violent crime and gun rights all alongside a sidebar of ads\n\nSo that was the response at least from what I can gather that Facebook decided they want to remove the eight hundred pages there was another um\nAnother page called ... press had more than seven hundred thousand and followers and post attack Trump and referred to the Republicans as cheating scum bags\n\nIt said reasonable reasonable people unite was at that that was another one left leaning page that Facebook purged posted a screen shot from Twitter user who sent\nSomewhere in America a teenage girl is listening to her parents defend Brent Kavanaugh she's thinking to ourselves if something like that happens to me I have nowhere to go\nHowever the bigger picture of one wants to express any and all this and on the Internet pretty soon they'll have nowhere to go because the reason why I'm saying this is that\nThere was a Google memo that was linked today leaked to the press\nAbout their stance on the Internet censorship and how Google is now analyzing the turn of users rather than political views at the moment\n\nIs eighty five page briefing entitled the good sensor and advisors tech companies to police tone instead of content and to not take sides when censoring users\n\nThe document and miss in writing that make Silicon Valley companies now including Google have shifted toward censoring users moving away from their original values to not be evil more over the mission to create and\nOn mediated marketplace of ideas has become a plan by tech companies to create well orders spaces for safety and civility that's that's a that's from their document\n\nOnce again and internal leak within Google gives a rare glimpse into the company and its mindset [noise] so have you been hit with\nThe algorithms that you can understand why [noise]\nTriple A. and six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA thinks every three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and what we value [noise]\nThis is news talk Ninety five point
