you start wanting to power back up and leave it off for a couple of minutes and empower up the modem first and then the router\nBut you also want to make sure that you are getting the speed and so what happens is you're going to send out a pay\nA painting is how fast a response that you get back from a testing server and as far as download and they'll close speeds they're given in bits per second higher numbers are better okay and download speeds there's typically going to be much much faster than up ...\nAnd you want to compare these numbers that you get again speeds at your Internet service provider promises you and you want to run multiple tests over several days do it in the morning do it at night so some sites you want to check out first of all there's ... speed test there's

justice you were listening to news talk and I'd be five ... five [noise]\nOkay one of the worst things that you can do is you can go on to Google dot com and search\nNeed to make money on line quickly because there's so many scams\nWhile there's one scanned in particular that I Want you to be on the lookout for until you more about that and just a moment but first here's the phone number one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four is the way to join us and of course when you're calling in there's Andrew but been skiing that Kim commando show man cave hello there Andrew Kim\nEric used in Cincinnati, Ohio and this is the first I mean I've been answering phones here for a long time long you have to say how many years Seventeen was Seventeen no no sixteen years there's gonna be Seventeen then it's almost Seventy a\nLong time we should probably talk about you not being in turn anymore you know what I'm going with it OK yeah there's a lot of pressure on\n'em and like you ... when I said Seventy I Know we can see where you are kind of odd Andrew ... co so Eric yes or he wants to be able to anonymously put photos on the Internet\nAnd when someone normally call for that I usually have a one line like hey that sounds like you want to break the law we're not going to put you on the radio to break the law but he actually has a good ... you know what 'cause it sounds like revenge porn or sharing yeah it sounds like something shady yes uh but he has good reason he has to have four adopted foster kids and he wants their grandparents\nTo be able to see what they look like but he's not ready to fully dime in on the whole communication front is an interesting question\nYeah that is because it's so so Eric you want the grandparents to watch the kids grow up\n[laughter] yes that's exactly correct but\nI Know I was gonna say so is this an open adoption is that what happened\n[noise] no we adopted these children earlier this year they had been in foster care for four years prior to us getting them and we had them for a year before we adopted them so they've been out of the biological home for five or wow okay\nAnd this year the father of the biological father passed away in may I have though um [noise] we had some feelers out for people who have this to contact and they asked if we could bring the children to the funeral and we said no we're not ready to do that yet right\nUm but they said well is there any way that we can we do watch them grow up and so I was looking for some way that I could anonymously present them pictures that they could see but I also don't want to just throw them out on the Internet for any one thing I Want to be able to target who can say that\nI get that I get that you know first of all what big heart than you and your wife must have to take him for kids how old are the kids\nRight now they're seven eight and an eleven\n[laughter] wow okay it's a full household [laughter]\nIt's a full house for other kids of our own so now how we have eight [laughter] that's\nAwesome that's awesome uh a couple of thoughts come into mind uh of course when you post photos you're going to make sure that there is no identifiable characteristics you know\n... and so forth\nYeah I Would take out all the all the data and the E. X. I. F. data and you're going to have to use a photo editing program to strip all that out right sure\nUh because a lot of people don't realize and if you're like what the heck are these two people talking about is that if I put in a picture up on the Internet and I pull it down as that I can open up the hidden data and then pretty much see where that photo was taken what type of ...\nPretty much see where that photo was taken what type of camera and cetera or just on Google Map and so we want to make sure want to take all that stuff out a couple of thoughts you might want to consider I mean you if you have Google you out of school photos number one\nOr you can put them up there there's Yahoo Photos but one of the things that that came to mind when I was listening to your call is that if you go to say for example a photo sharing site like shutter fly okay\nShutter fly will allow you to create not just photo albums but a particular website if you will that contains all the photos\nAnd so if they had and you'd have to figure out the best way to get the grandparents the the Web address but if they had the Web address they could just keep going back there to refresh it or say once a week or once a month and so they could start seeing and then in addition to that you get a record of\nThem going to see it as well [noise] okay uh so just had ordered a shutter fly and then sign up for an account and again there's going to be some options when you do this that you're really looking for your own\nUnique website and then once you do that whoever knows that address that there'll be able to access all those photos and again aside from just the medical data is make sure that there is no identical characteristics with the kids as far as any type of school logos\nOr anything else that might show where they're actually physically located at any of those shots of course you can always use any photo editing program that just kind of race that stuff in the back and\n[noise] All right let's talk about one of our great sponsors Sarah works relieve their works relief\nLike many of us do you suffer from muscle cramps in your legs and your feet well to experience relieve do what I Do you want to use their works relieve\nFast acting phone get their or works relieve today it's into the pain relief file at your local pharmacy or at their works relief once again dot com\nOr before the back of your phone calls I got to tell you about a phone scam that's offering phony Amazon dot com jobs because especially this time of year\nAs a matter of fact we just did a pod cast command on demand about the whole gig economy different ways that you could earn some quick cash just in time for Christmas is that job scams they're claiming to be from Amazon or totally on the rise\nAnd here is how the scam works listen up you get a voice mail inviting you to apply for a job at Amazon it sounds like a pretty sweet set up by maybe you can earn anywhere from twenty dollars an hour to maybe even as much as six thousand dollars a month and catfish you're working from home\nUsually those are websites with fictitious names like a Amazon cash Amazon cash website Web store jobs you name it\nBut here's the catch when you go to fill out the online application you were asked to purchase a two hundred dollar enrollment kid and then once you make the payment poof\nCameras gone all your money your dream of telecommuting and earning cash and your bunny slippers so any job that issue for some sort of a front payment should should set off warning bells and if you are looking for the legitimate ways to earn extra cash maybe you want to be an online tutor\nA virtual assistant or maybe you want to even watch TV and take surveys yes you can make money doing that\nLive no further than the official home page I became commando show which is of course ...

the more interesting items that car across my desk and screen that you need to know about first to which\nThe state of California is banning weak passwords that's right\nIt's a new law the state of California you know all those Internet connected devices all around your home you have cameras in thermostats and routers garage doors the smart light bulbs the smart crock pot for some reason well most of them come with these ridiculously easy to crack\nPasswords for example many routers and Web cams to have a default admin password like admitting or password so the idea that when you set up your new gadget you should always change the default pass for\nMe to get something strong that the scammers won't be able to crack\nBut that doesn't always happen so too many people are just leaving the default password in place making themselves targets for criminals and hackers in scammers alright so lawmakers in California you're trying to make that stop they just passed a law that goes into effect the beginning of twenty twenty it makes it illegal for companies\nJust said week default passwords on devices but here's the gab yet made in the state\nThe problem is that in books to those Internet connected devices I just mentioned they're made in China\nSo the new law is going to require manufacturers to said complex unique passwords for all the devices they have to maybe come up with a startup procedure in place that forces the user\nTo change the password I mean this is a long time coming when you think about it I mean but how effective is really going to be ... probably not so much because as I mentioned everything's made in China\nOr a Google was in the news again this past week not just because they announced a whole slew new pixel phones because they had a major security breach\nWell they said it was a bug well that's what they always say it's a bug actually nobody was paying attention they expose the private information of about a half a million people for about three years thank you Google Google has its own social media site called Google Plus they announced between twenty Fifteen and march were twenty Eighteen\nAll right so we started talking about smart TV is the thing that makes the TV smart is that what it connects up to the Internet\nWell once you can make something up to the Internet I guess what else can happen yeah the hackers in scammers and the bad things can go on well this past week a big security alert for certain brand of television that they had to listen they had to they had to run down and install these firmer updates but the problem is that\nThey want you to install the former update so if you don't know about this update then you're sitting there just fed them unhappy watching TV and actors can be doing whatever they want\nGetting onto your TV and then onto the network so that's coming up and just a few moments but first the phone lines are open one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once again is the way to join us and as always there's Andrew but then the and the Kim commandos show ... but we for we talk about the call yes\nThat are coming in here it's third our this this weekend show\nUm I\nAm still wearing my apple watch you know you might recall it was probably what was it eight or nine months ago when I was really excited about having an apple watch and you got for three right I had a serious threat\nAnd you know both you and Mike or like my brother's right page so you've seen me embrace technology and throw it away\nOver the years so I was really super excited about having an apple watch and the first time I ward YouTube took that\nHow long were you where are we had the over under going yeah yeah okay and so ... what was that that I think it was two and a half we spent two weeks [laughter] and and then after two weeks that would be like wow I don't need that it was stupid thing right so I took the under that you would not last two weeks which would be you know two shows\nRight to ... and you'd be\nYou'd be to buy a mile I think you ward maybe seven eight shows in a row and then you do superior\nThey tapered off a little bit right okay um because what was happening is that I was getting like too much like like what am I stepped [noise] what is my ... pm you know 'cause I can be a little\nObsessive compulsive little seedy who and who would say that about it I mean we were\nJust upstairs and I am I I'm a little hungry sure and so we went up to the break room and what did I Do Michael\nMoore headed for the pizza [noise] but ah you I thought you were a guy thought holy cow Kim is going to eat pizza and I was ...\nDo you open the box she was just showing somebody where the pizza off [laughter]\nSo I went to my house and then I got an apple\nBlame ah I Know [laughter]\nAnd it's really funny because I had to go get my annual checkup this past week and so I was with my mail dock and I'm like oh look at my ... pm and this this and this right through showing them the app on your phone yes your doctor yes okay\nAnd I'm like looks like sometimes you know it's forty for a good resting heart rate [laughter] what did you say it's a she always ours and she says to me she goes that is like an excellent rest resting heart rate\nAnd she said you know what your cholesterol is right now\nDo you know what your cholesterol no idea what ... might do you know years is no idea how can you really need it let me tell you if you guys need to know what your claws\nAnd Scott Hi so uh we're good how do you know high because my doctor tells you know pick Herschel medication if it was high gimme bills right\nWell you have to have everything in your online portal oh yeah okay okay so that you can sign up and you can see that stuff\nAnyway so my cholesterol and I don't take anything it's like was like one twenty started\nWell two hundred is like good okay so yeah so and that's because I you can afford to have one piece of pizza you know but I can do it I Can't you know what I couldn't even do it it's it's it's a curse is what I'm telling you so anyway so the apple watch for that I have right now\nThat was the one where it'll tell people if you fall slip or slide I saw the\nPresentation yes and that it will get you know hasn't accelerated learning gyroscope they'll try to\nAnd so that you can hit a button which I think is

on the dial and so you'll be able to get a in east CGI have you on the you know 'cause it doesn't work yet it hasn't been ruled out\nAnd so that's kinda lame I think of apple that white white teases
