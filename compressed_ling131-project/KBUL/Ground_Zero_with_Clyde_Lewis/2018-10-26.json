she made her scandalous darker than it really is and people said that race\nAnd she went around for one I don't know how like how\n... amazing and is is that is such a\nQuestion that you should be drummed out of all society right\n... ... ... and that's what's amazing about this first of all we should point out that there's a lot of people in inside of NBC that wanted her out for other reasons oh my gosh you know eat and we use our yo yo yo skew suppose is now you can tell you this has nothing to do if she could have said that easily and Ben applauded\nHad she not come from Fox that she'd come from CNN or she was on the left or whatever that that crowd would have plotted her saying that and I think they are there's a lot of people that are mutated didn't appreciate her coming out against NBC personalities\nOn the sexual assault stuff as well but just just talking specifically about let's forget all that exist and talk about that but actual conversation her point is what is important when you're trying to decipher someone doing something that is racist for example is the motivation\nRight the motivation is one is important the words themselves can be bad or good but the motivation is what is important let's go further than black face for a second the N. word\nRight the N. word when said by someone carrying a torch in Charlottesville we all understand really bad mhm when Chris Rock says it\nNot so bad why because we know Chris Rock and motivation is not because he says terrible racist we know in Charlottesville the case is that they are terrible racist or in this been sorry for the city of Charlottesville who now if [laughter] they're named just sit on to this with racism but I mean you know we're talking about here\nThe the if you have an All right figure you have Richard Spencer you have some hardcore racist saying the N word it means something different and the motivation is different in that it's important\nLike it but I Will say this in ... it is still I\nI don't care who says the N word I think it's a disgusting word I Do too I don't I don't like that word used by anybody you don't get dropped out of society if you if you're if you're a Chris Rock because everybody knows that your motivation is not this deep hatred of racism and another example it's always sunny in Philadelphia\nIn a live action sitcom in us history it's fourteen season's going outside of the fourteenth season at least once and I think twice they've done entire episodes where they're white characters were in blackface\nK now their motivation as liberals right\nTheir motivation is to show that racism is really dumb and their characters are really dumb and their dressing up this way and they're showing how stupid they are and making the point that they think it's okay to dress up in blackface but they actually did it on camera multiple episodes this is a a liberal icon of our program\nOK totally okay for them to do it\nFor her to question it and say if it's a positive motivation is that okay well I don't remember I don't remember a lot of an outcry from the leftover it's always sunny and Philadelphia doing it multiple times they did an entire episode\n... which is one of the greatest television episodes of any series of all time called the gang turns black\nAnd they and they have a situation where they all wake up after like getting the electric or getting struck by lightning and they're all black and they have to live as black people for the day and they walk or an orderly amazing\nBut beyond that it is something that there's been no pushback on look at things like family guy you'll see that you know then the animation but still the same types of things happen\nBecause they believe and we all kind of like well the motivation there is that he he's that they're not trying to be racist an upstarting trying to say black people are inferior or anything like that they're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay\nWhat she's saying here is if the motivation is good let's say a child for example who thinks they want to dress up as a hero of there's a happens to be black and they don't want to be down to ... you want to be black and they don't understand the dynamics of blackface they would think OK well\nAnd you think the kids not racist their motivation is they're trying to look up to a hero and that's the only point you bring up it might not even be true\nWe may say as a society that we think black faces too far and we'd have to just some things but okay but the issue is her asking that question she's saying if it's a good motivation is not motivated by racism and therefore shouldn't be treated the same way as she loses her gig over that I mean\nSaid the president is acting unconstitutionally talk to the other branch you need to arrest him an exile him the other branch did so two branches of the government ousted him\nSaid that's not what we do\nWe don't want to be a Hugo Chavez Venezuela okay\nHe said ever since then we Hondurans have lived in chaos many things try to buy a ... and his a party to liberate which translates to Freedom Party to destabilize our country\nThis is just the latest stunned and ... a blames America and has also made America is now reaping what its own type statements\nHe has said that America must take in the migrants because America has supported the current administration that he now claims has caused all of the misery that we as Hondurans are living through\nThis is why they're marching with a Honduran flag because they blame us for their misery\nThis is nothing more she writes then a strong arm tactics to embarrass both Honduras and America sadly the migrants were lied to and had been told that America must accept them in\nIn one news report a lady who was interviewed told the Honduran reporter that they were promised buses to travel once they got to Guatemala\nBut there were no buses waiting on them that I could tell from the report some of the migrants have returned home one twenty two year old man died in Mexico for reasons unknown as of yet\nThis is really sad and frustrating because many migrants ... a has been a had been told that they will get in and they will get jobs once they arrive in America and therefore many are good with hopes of a better life\nHowever these are types of situations that criminals\nAre a might have been the organizers of the march we'll take advantage of\nPlease keep spreading the truth about this situation I enjoy all of your content and you're a podcast thanks
