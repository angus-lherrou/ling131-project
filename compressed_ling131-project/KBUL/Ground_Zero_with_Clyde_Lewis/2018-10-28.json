connection\n[laughter] Oh thank you very much for taking my question\nYou betcha alright so tell me what's going on\nOkay so we have a a hot spot that's like a jet act and we have unlimited planned [noise] ah we have twenty five gigabytes of data and we use Fifteen in like four hours and then and we let go\nTwenty five gigabytes of data and we use Fifteen in like four\nHours and then and we go down to the bottom and slow extremely slow pace of flour or ours wow\nYeah because I have two teenage boy it's you're updating their [laughter] video game um X. box and and what not and\nThen my husband and I like to look at things on the Internet and I know I have another one that has an eye pad and he likes to get games and it's just to the point where I was just\nI'm frustrated so I was wondering if a we boost for the home it's a cell phone signal booster that I've looked at and you plug it into one of the house and plug it into the other end of the house and I was just wondering if something like that would work fresh\n[noise] no [noise] no [noise] um\nIt's all it's doing at that point is it's boosting the signal okay and so it's amplifying\nThe signal so the whole idea is that if you don't have decent cellular coverage is that you can buy this booster and then instead of having like three bars you might have for bars okay\nUh and it does it by amplifying the connection with them in a certain area around you okay okay so so that's not gonna help you um [noise] I assume that you this is the only option\n[noise] well I'm that's why I'm calling you because it it's to the point where we've gone over to a friend's house the Internet to uh teach\nWhat you do what she 'cause you know it's you know you can get fifty gigs but if you're blowing through fifth you know Fifteen gigs in four hours I mean what's the sense right I mean the white there's a\nThere's always satellite\nAnd yeah we've tried well we've heard our neighbors to gripe about it\nYeah if you don't want specially when you're looking at games and you've got three guys in the house that are trying to do games that's not going to work or doesn't work very well it also crawls um have you looked into a DSL line\nAnd that comes from a company correct because we've called our uh TV company and\nThat is that those Bactrim\nYes okay back them an charter and nobody will come down our road was at fault them since two thousand for\nUm [noise] I just for giggles okay let me tell you let me tell you a couple of things from tech\nIs a a friend of mine recently purchased a home and north of uh there's probably isn't going to be moving to but north of Scottsdale, Arizona okay [noise]\nAnd so you have Phoenix you have Scottsdale and then you have like this stretch of road where there's nothing okay miles around and and she bought this beautiful house in the middle of five acres\nOkay All right it's in the house has like a thousand square feet but she likes it because there's she has no neighbors right right now she's also a doctor\nOn call [noise]\nAnd so before so she has a house in escrow and she's totally Cosby she freaks out she was like\nOh my God what am I going to do I don't think there's Internet\nAnd we I have this house in escrow\nSo I told her just to uh I did some homework for her and I found a a a a gentleman who lives about a mile away from her who who has a line and has set up a point to point Internet or\nThe neighbors OK okay and she pays fifty dollars a month and\nShe said she's got Netflix she's moved in she has no issues you know things like that her kids are now in college so she doesn't have to worry about you know three kids gaming she has five kids and no she was worried about that Brent [noise] but\nBut still she is able to get to to fight in and she has to look at you know X rays or whatever it may be she has to look at them in real time right mhm [noise]\nSo but she's able to do that through a point to point service so I'd see if there were any options in in a if you just Google your ZIP Code with point to point that's what it's called or sometimes it's called fixed point wireless and basically all you need you don't need any lines you need a line of sight\nOkay so is there a lot of mount or the ... mountains around you know OK okay\nSo so if they're sometimes if you have a lot of mountains that it doesn't work\nBut years ago is that I Believe it or not I live in the center of Phoenix and there who are the cable company wouldn't come down the street and I actually had to have a fixed point wireless lined put in on the roof\nBut I could go down to South Mountain from my house which I Know that doesn't mean luck to you but it's like twenty miles by the bird flies okay so um so I Would look around to see if there's any type of six point wireless I Would also call wins train\nIn your area or to see if they have any options for you as well you know other than that you know you don't waste your money on a booster a cause you you know these game updates could be a gig right there\nAnd then I start playing you know you're you're looking at even just a movie could be three gigs\nAnd uh\nSo you know and then and then of course you're going to have to tell the kids that you know there was a time not too long ago when you used to walk to school on the railroad tracks\nAnd [laughter] and it's no with no shoot the exactly [laughter] so they're just going to have to go to the library okay we'd been there at all out he needs [laughter] we should try that [laughter] I could just\nSee you're you're you're you're

box with a rock and yeah so I'm waiting for the punch line where there there was a total fat okay you know as a matter of fact when I ... and I you've heard me tell a story that when I was trying to syndicated show I called this guy CBS his name was Frank Murphy Hi Frank and casual listening\nAnd Frank told me that that a show about computers in the Internet would never work because it was going to be a fad a fad like the pet rock and I'll never forget that 'cause he said it was like a pet ... through my iPhone is just about rock sitting in my pocket speaker phone when's the last time you used a pay phone I don't even know do they even exist anymore or\nI saw them in Great Britain\nOkay summer no I I've been a long time and so I was standing there it's actually quite funny is I'm standing there like in front of the phone booth where there's a phone you know like in front of the phone booth were inside there's a pay phone and were you on your phone no and I was just standing there like being towards like Hi okay and end fuss out laughing\nAnd I said what are you laughing at okay behind me there were\nAll these naked women painting like on the phone booth like but their phone numbers early they found a use for the phone booth ... which is also the phone book\nBut isn't that something that's crazy yeah the phone book or the telephone operator yes the telephone technology for the longest time did not change\nAnd now we just ... fast forward and when when did the iPhone come out ten years ago two thousand seven that was ten years prior to that it was fifty years the same old phone okay did you have an Atari twenty six hundred yeah\nHow we're all generations video games game boys just had a game boy I say go CD again this generation I don't know anything about that no 'cause on their parents' phone if they don't know anything about a road atlas\nLike a map map yeah now now that would have as good right yeah okay I've never I never learned how to fold up a map and I I don't think I'm going to try now\nOkay America Online now you know I started the computer section at America Online usually yeah years and years ago do you remember when everywhere everywhere you turn around that somebody put an AOL disk and the cereal box that you went to store it was everywhere that was really genius marketing right there\nBecause how they did that behind the scenes is that and I can I can talk about it now I'm sure I'm not under any more non disclosure agreement says that we'll find out Tuesday [laughter] that with AOL is that if you gave a desk\nSometimes you'd make ten dollars at that person is that is that person use your desk to sign up for AOL you just made ten bucks\nWe always got them from another place that doesn't exist anymore and that was blockbuster video so you're telling me when we got our Fifteen hundred free hours of AOL's blockbuster was making my yes and then they would make money every single month I mean oh wow\nWhile I mean this is like in the early nineties I was I was banking like ten grand a month\nJust on AOL do ski yeah just how are you getting them in people's hands just standing on a corner of shocking to most people you know like I've\nBeen in the science [laughter] no I was I Would put him in like because I have the computer tutor videotapes oh okay I put 'em in the videotapes and then people would use them to sign that had to do one day they just said we're not doing this anymore we're not paying for this any more\n[noise] ... you know what happened is that so you know so I'm like I started the computers they actually got this whole AOL thing going on okay and then they changed managers at the top right and they actually called me up\nAnd that month I had gotten an assault numbers I've gotten a check for twenty five grand for the month just by people using the ... with the disc and then taken using the computer section okay and I I that I managed I mean this was my job right okay so all of a sudden\nThis guy calls me up but he says you know how like we've been paying you every month\nWell now we want you to pay us\nThat's a bit different that's a different character I said well that's not going to really work for me [laughter]\nAnd so that was when using key word commando instead of going to AOL that I mean we negotiate I had to go see it that it would go to commando dot com that's when you watch the website but that was also when I learned very valuable lesson\nIs not to depend upon the company\nFor the marketing of your company so that's why when Facebook came out I was so like I Am not sending anybody to Facebook because I already gotten screwed over by AOL right so why would I Do that which speaking of one last one can you make the sound of a dial up modem\n[laughter] [noise] what was that anyway [laughter]\nYeah one on one hand shakes like all the handshaking no ... [laughter] yes\nI mean it was so bad that you know sometimes we go away and and where there'd be no Internet or anything and I like walking around making that sound like you can only do they do that
