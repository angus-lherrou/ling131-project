[noise] not really running out we'd rather Merrick and always good to hear from Julie gun lock independent women's forum to see women have a dog in this fight because\nThink about your dad your husband your boyfriend your son your brother subjected title nine rules and regulations about due process rights so if you're a woman yes I generally believe they're women or men\nAnd I have to say they're gay or in danger zones and this woman would not do anything about it and she doesn't want anyone else to do it at the age to solve a problem\nAs a matter of fact that it should be quiet him because he doesn't understand how he's influence and black people he doesn't she doesn't want them to think for themselves and she was the ghettos\nShe made a promise to black people that the Republicans were trying to tear it on the project\nAnd and the ghettos right but she said I'm not gonna let Republicans doodads and not all that are not going to let them turn out to project I'm going to be more for you\nAnd making that kind of ... voters in her district while she's living in a four point three million dollar homes suburbs out to be concerned about the climate of violence that's happening in those areas\nHow is it possible that the worst place for an African American to live in America\nIsn't a black congressional district no matter where it is you take this twenty five or thirty blocks rational districts is the worst place for black folks to live anywhere in the country but there are so good at avoiding responsibility\nFor the implementation and the results of their policies yeah there are so good at blaming everyone but themselves\n... will black folk ever look at themselves and say look at our status or do you have to lose whatever Logan themselves in Los Angeles Chicago Cincinnati New York and saying wait a minute we have lousy education systems we have no job creation way of rampant crime rampart abortion\nNeither party's been here for fifty or sixty years and it's amazing to me you're going to have this little result blaming everyone else to take no responsibility like Maxine Waters\nAnd I can promise you that things are not going to get better for them until they do take a look at themselves and they have responsibility for their own lives\nAnd until they realize that the Democrats have been lying to them for Seventy years or so\nAnd uh they never intended and they never were doing the same for them they don't want them better they want them brainwashing jumped out at a more live because that's how you control them [laughter]\nYou can't control a more personal and more people you have to be more like you have to keep them angry and whatever the Democrats want more power whenever they want to get in\nA a vote they cry racism because they know if they could crowd is phony ideal racism that most of the guys that go into a hypnotic trance and walk right into the voting booth and vote for the Democrats that's why they keep using that\nAnd it's not going to change until the glass take responsibility and until white people stop being afraid of that phony words blacks are suffering not because those a lot of racism but due to the lack of moral character the destruction of the family and living on a supporter of the Democratic plantation bill\nWell you know in Chicago la corn McDonnell was a young man\nWho was threatening large numbers of people with a knife they didn't know what is it time he was with PCP which is a crazy drugs and then he was shot by cop who made a mistake the cops should not a shot him the way he was shot he was kind of walking away from the ... made a split second life and death decision that was wrong cops are taught\nThan somebody has a knife within Twenty one feet of your being it takes less than a second for them to take the ...\nSo now it looks like one lives in Chicago can be misused\nTo advance their political agenda which have jobs\nAt the same time seven hundred\nAmericans living in Chicago will be dead this year four thousand are going to get shot and including that boy put in a barrel and put on fire there is no marches no protests milk scream and holler none\nAbout the little boy and a barrel who wouldn't joined a gang ... that's like moves on but if you can find years ago I should go company may made a mistake\nThat becomes a fundraising tool\nAs a matter of fact when there's a black or white or black cop or white or black situation they celebrate that they love it when that happened because it open up as you just said is open up opportunities for fundraising\nThey can accuse white people making a lot and just see that but I think Kevin White people and it's all for the purpose of more power and wealth for themselves\nThey don't care about black people they don't care about white people they don't care about illegal aliens they don't care about their children they care about gaining power and wealth\nAnd so that's why they jump on those type of situation pushed it alive that the cops are called violent the police brutality\nAnd they support of like having a a cat for Nick they can put their thumb Neal and turning their backs on the fly around the country\nAre at the football games because they want the far right there there is to white Republicans but it's about power and wealth for the Democratic party and no one else\nWell Jesse you and I have a lot more yesterdays in tomorrow's yes and uh I like to engage of us from Cincinnati in from Los Angeles has a minimal impact\nAnd the lives of those who might want to listen and change in in Los Angeles is now overrun with illegal aliens which hurts black folks can you tell us in Los Angeles\nIn Los Angeles Chicago Memphis New York what is the status of African Americans in relationship to illegal aliens from Mexico\nIt's devastating if the world really knew\nHow destructive is over there are in South central LA style like cops and wives\nThat there'll be ... man that the the the police officer the government do something illegal alien gang members of upcoming and have come in first number one they're taking away day labor day job some blacks who can't get rid of the job because they're not educated don't know how to go out there and do it\nThe violence and drugs and crime that has crossed the borders into south central LA is beyond a worse is devastate a lot of blasts leaving sausage or our lady of moving back to the south they move into a Oregon and Arizona and places like that\nThey're looking for a safe haven because Maxine Waters and a black leadership over there would not do anything about it\nAnd media and others are given a false impression that blacks or Hispanics are getting all alone they are not they hate one another\nThey hate the fact that these people coming in and taking over their schools neighborhoods and jobs it's so bad that at one point the bus trip to the blood has joined forces to fight against illegal gay members because they they are supported by drug laws from Mexico\nAnd the other thing in the Los Angeles school system is a hundred of Nineteen different languages and dialects\nOne cannot function in an environment where every student\nWho is speaking a different language or dialect is entitled to under federal law that the person that they're said to translate everything happening in class point can imagine the chaos\nWhen you're in a classroom at thirty to forty students speaking maybe twenty or thirty different languages there was no one is understood in behavior and norms are not followed and mom and dad don't exist in the home front to back up the teacher yeah that's the one that's the reason black folks are being decimated Los Angeles\nAnd and I I work with a lot of black kids from those areas and a lot of them and just dropping out of school because they say that the teachers are put into focus on the one that kept me even if\nThey put into focus more focused on an illegal alien then they are the citizens\nAnd so and the parents are not paying attention to be caught mostly kids are coming from single parent homes or a black women who were born in America those who were born in this country\nSeventy seven percent of their children are born out of wedlock so they don't have parents who are paying attention and it is a feeling I loved and at home and asked who they're just drop it out at hardly a day goes by where there's not a fight between illegal aliens\nAnd the and the black kids there so it's a real it's devastating to build I Can't find or just when\nYou're an educated men maybe a lot of self taught like I Am but I cannot imagine being a black kid in Los Angeles or Chicago or Memphis or Denver Cincinnati or New York here sixteen years old\nYou have no functional family you know Europe functionally illiterate you can't go to high school because you're kicked out or do learn a damn thing nothing's being taught you have no job future you have no capability of forming a permanent relationship with a woman and getting married having a family and having your own property\nThat as devastating and that is the light and that is the life and a lot of literally tens of millions\nOf black and brown and poor white kids in America today and I don't see do you see anything changing\nA short of a miracle from God I don't see it you know my non profit organization bond the Brotherhood organization over new destiny for the last Twenty years now we have been rebuilding their family\nOf some of those boys from those areas but it's overwhelming at this point and especially since the government the ACLU and they in a CPA and others are covered it up because they just power well it just seemed like a hopeless situation right now\nAnd in fact in most almost all the urban areas in this country Donald Trump Republican\nPaul Ryan Mitch McConnell got nothing to do with running the large cities in this country they're all Democrats so if something's wrong educationally crime why something wrong with the welfare state something wrong with like a job creation oh what is in the media and lay down at the doorstep of the Democratic party\nBecause they ... they don't want to they look media is advocate for the Democratic party", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day":
