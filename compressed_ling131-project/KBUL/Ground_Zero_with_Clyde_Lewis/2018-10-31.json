not that I'm taking pride in this has this ... this emphasis because of the fact that almost every day is April Fools and every night is Halloween he'd just appears that way right now in the United states to go to Thomas in Illinois Hi Thomas you're on ground zero\n... are you doing man hey I just wanted to start and say uh I really appreciate you appreciate the show and are you talking about the topics that really need to reach us about more and uh that's a wonderful thing I think you\nJust said a couple of verses from the Bible that I thought were hurting it and I'm the first ones that as a fifty nine\nFourteen and says justice turned back and righteousness fans far away for a truce has stumbled in the street lights just this can not enter his truth is lacking and he turns aside from evil makes a self uh pray\nAnd I and as a\nMatter of time there are times that was actually reading a passage that I just thought you know\nVery good and uh you know there's another one I'm sixty two because they ship the synagogue yeah the channel that whoever kills you will think they're doing job service\nAnd that's what's been happening it's happening in the line is where the truth is the flaps and the majority they all they believe they're doing jobs surface ... not maybe the God of the fight over it\nAnd people are unprepared for some in the ... all those is a ... of God will will suffer persecution so badly gospel and all these topics you know it's it's happening so fast it's wrapping up it seems like time has gone by faster and um it's it's a it's a permanent thanks for the church\nThink it's important I think it's important to have you know a spiritual idea of both sides in order to have it in your arsenal so the knowledge of good\nPermeate throughout you put the knowledge of how bad operates are evil operates in what he's done to Clinton that evil that is\nI think very important and and that's why you know you just you know talking to some people have a hard time talking about it they don't want to\nEven open up or entertain any conversation about the devil revealed the devil is going to jump through the radio strangled him it'd be the holy hell out of them well that doesn't happen what happens is it they're like I said a couple of days ago there was a rule there are rules that demons play by not all demons play by those rules\nBut most of the time the dealers by certain rules and and and those rules when you break them the devil or demon or whatever it is is waiting for you that spiritual entity that parasitic infiltration\nIs waiting to happen and when he dies you know you're going to have to be prepared for how to get it out of you if it's like catching a cold it's like it's like catching a reoccurring cold or flu you know if you get at one time you know hopefully it goes away enough to deal with sometimes those things linger\nAnd you have to do you know some harsher remedies to get rid of it and I think that that when you're talking about exercises and when you're talking about possession\n... system is not just going and saying All right you're free that doesn't happen most exercises and take months most exercise is going to take forever and it's going to take a long time for us to exercise or at least try to purge from all of us just the ...\nThat's right you know it\nSays a young says my people parents were lack of knowledge and I think that's the big one is the spiritual warfare that people don't even know they're fighting and I think it starts with pride people are caught up they're distracted by their own little trinkets cell phones the movies in football games in a you know they're distracted and\nWell being Tom as you're doing I think people I think people should have entertainment I think people should have things that can can distracted for time it's not always I mean I'm not the guy to kind of person is going to say hey you know you shouldn't do that 'cause it's distracting from the real thing\nPeople should take time for the real thing and if you take time for entertainment that you take time for reading and take time for enjoying a lot of fun ah activities\nOr we're not you know we don't want to walk around being pious hideous\nBut we certainly want to be aware of what's going on around us we certainly want to be aware that does somebody who's a foot and we need to be able to defend ourselves when it comes down to down in Virginia Hi Dan you're on ground zero hey\nThis is Dan yes the by man I've got a special little deal here with you there for you now I never told anybody about this in regards to on a talk radio\nAnd I've got special twist on there so the first thing I Want to mention it to you is that from him in Nineteen eighty four clear on up to the almost the beginning of light Cain eighty six\nI was in a spiritual battle with an extended family\nOf black witches and we're talking about grandmothers and grandfathers and everything clear on both sides and they were affiliated with the Tulsa mob and I tried to help rescue this woman from them\nNow what I did is I set up some energy which kept them so confused about how to attack me that I knew that they loved to argue amongst one another\nSo the more that I kept them confused the more that they argued amongst one another\nAnd there are a whole group self destruct did just see\nSo what did you do put a ... D G words you say you\nKnow what I did as I said at this possible options in other words I trick them into thinking that I'm showing them vulnerabilities on how to attack me\nBut I set it up so that these windows that they would perceive\nWouldn't make them sulking few loose and overwhelmed by the different options that they could apply to attack me that they couldn't make up their minds what it is to do\nAnd then what happened was is they started arguing amongst themselves and then once I felt that vicious circle the argument all I did was speed it up\nAnd then that about it for when it finally to the cold and it took about a year and a half to do it\nWhat happened was is the whole group self destruct that some of them actually went to Christ because I found out because I had my own spies and some of them just retreated damage to themselves\nAnd so uh I've I I've been there you know\nWho you've done spiritual battle with which is\nSo yeah and also see I also have their own very wise or once that have done a magic myself at about nine\nAlso see I also have known otherwise uh once they've done a magic myself and about Ninety nine percent\nOf all kinds of practices along those lines deals with self knowledge and protection against aspects\nOf yourself [noise] Ninety nine percent of it has to do with that it doesn't have anything to do with a uh doing things apart others because you have to take care of yourself", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "Billings", "day": "31"}
