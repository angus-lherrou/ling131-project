eight eight to five fifty to fifty fours the way to join us and get some trusted advice because after all you can Google anything but you can Google trusted advisor that's the difference\nAs I said before we go back to all of your great phone calls this show some interesting items that crossed my screen\nInteresting item across my screen that you definitely don't want to miss out on like for example\nApple wants Syria to be your ultimate personal assistant that's right and you know what sir you can use or to set appointments and find something on the Web or sorry can give you directions you can send a tax send an email make a call order and Hoover you know you get the draft\nBut now you can add a surgery I'm getting pulled over a traitor to his skill set\nUsing an app called short cuts you could make Siri perform a series of commands like for example you can say ... theory\nAnd you can get a traffic report or weather forecast or all the above well one clever read it use or a guy by the name of Robert Peterson created the shortcut called police has been written about all over the Internet this past week\nIt sets off a series of actions first it will send a text to a friend to let them know that you're being pulled over and in that text you are going to give your friend your exact location\nThen it causes any music and using the phones front facing camera a record anything going on\nFinally the video send to drop box in iCloud so with a short cut on the phone you just say ... I'm getting pulled over now just a warning I tried it myself and here's what surgery that\nFine just listening to the Kim commandos show when there's so much more than one out and watch the whole show in high definition on your bones Chambliss or television so cool 'cause you're still nine or download the podcast in crystal clear digital\nAnd on your schedule driving exercising relax\nBefore on your for your made me pretty much go junior\nKim slump is so much more you also get security and data breach alerts priority calling in to the gym commander show my\nFavorite and does it all got somehow glad I get the hockey\nAnd Kim's global offers discounts for everyone over the former and current military and all service personnel he'd never been more affordable to be a ... member so stay up to date the easiest way because these days you can't know too much about technology\nTo your friend on the radio and I just think it's often\nGo now to club not commando dot com K. E. M. A. is Leo Slumdog commando dot com\nYour local better Business Bureau here in Montana is warning the public about robocalls\nYes those dreaded unrecognized numbers that could be important but turn out to be someone trying to steal from you rebel colors are getting more savvy and appearing to be calling from somewhere local but more than likely they're not in the area\nThey call posing as your credit card company or even have a pre recorded message telling you to contact them immediately or you will go to jail if you ever seen one of these calls please report them to the FCC and register for the do not call is ... just said if you receive a call from an unrecognized numbers do not pick\nUp if it is real they will leave a message to once you answer the phone oppressed any numbers you have activated your phone line to invite more Sam calls\nFor more information on robocalls or to report a scam\nPhoebe dot org forward slash amtrack or\nOr call for zero six three zero three three two nine six\nYang to the gym going to a new show on TALK about five forty five\nOn us our letter from our listener mail I'm Wondering if I can see everything that\nGoogle has tracked about me is that possible\nOr do I need a court order for that we're\nGoing to give you that answer against they'll become this hour that came commando show but the phone lines are open one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four wants to get it the way to join us and when you're calling again there's Andrew but been skiing the Kim commando show man\nCave Kim though there Andrew from Scott in Charleston South Carolina called him and he said I just got back from months in Europe and Russia and we're worried about Internet Security and ice and Scott you just got back\nShouldn't have been the hall humane foreign your when\nYou just you know just a little heads up Scott next time give us a call before\nYou go I mean he said yes I sure do but we're planning on going back and it got me thinking next time we go to Russia how can we prepare ourselves to be secure OK so a friend of mine who lives in London in Iraq or you know okay\nIs that um she was telling me that she went to Beijing\nAnd so she had her windows laptop they're connected to the hotel why fight okay and she said all of a sudden the the hard drive light\nLike when okay and\nIt stayed constantly illuminated for the next eight hours wonder why don't\nYou think there were copying the entire hard drive not the Chinese old they would not do that at all gosh God neither what the Russians what are you worried about\n[laughter] well I Would love to adoption you talk to you before we call\nWell I Would have loved to have the opportunity to talk to you before we called but that was not an option and in fact I have a kind of a two part question number one [noise] the the rumors always been ours devices or less vulnerable\nThan a Android or PCs now if you just confirmed that then I Want to talk about the peons\nOkay um [noise] ... the reason why that people say that Iowa devices are more secure is that there are ... that apple keeps a hold on everything okay\nSo in order for you to penetrate through the operating system is that you have to go through multiple levels of encryption you can jail break an iPhone or if he wanted to and basically take all the security and the trolls and right away\nBut if you are trying to get a piece of now we're onto an Iowa device that it is more difficult than say Android or window so yes that is true\n[noise] [noise] well what I did do [noise] sorry on this trip\nWas caught a little bit of a cold [laughter] not do us a dead set up a VPN but I wondered if that was enough or if there was more the I should be doing in a situation of [noise] what\nDid you do everything while you were overseas I mean did your bank can pay your credit cards and checked plays for in business and stuff like\nI did have to check my bank once or maybe twice but I Try to avoid that didn't do anything with credit cards except obviously to pay you know with the ... uh it was mainly just to check your email\nAnd then did you do everything through the VPN or did you fall like that where where you go like well I'm just going to take the melon\n[noise] it was so much that if there were several types it seemed like the the PM prohibited me from getting on the website and I don't mean that particular website it it just like anything getting on the Internet period\nEnding could do that depending upon what lockdown can be in a particular community and a particular country and so I'm a lot of VPN where if you look at their coverage maps and is that you want to make sure that they have multiple access points within one particular city\nAnd so that this way you can get out if you want it to ... you know it's it's a it's a really interesting topic because in my email this past week I also had a note from a gentleman who was in China and couldn't go anywhere because he was in China you know of course the they had the great firewall there\nAnd they're stealing anything that they can but that's a whole another topic\nWhen you are ... traveling in countries like Russia and you do come back you know the general rule is that number one before you go is that you make a complete backup of everything a so that this way if you need to restore that you'd be able to because sometimes coming back in the country are going to a country believe it or not that you may have your device confiscated\nAnd if it is confiscated weather here or abroad or three or six months you might be able to see it again but quite possibly a year Kaye and nobody wants that to happen so that was not your issue I Would recommend that you change all your passwords to any account that that you have had access to\nA especially your even though you didn't use a VPN because I wouldn't want you to take any unnecessary risks and then be sitting here thirty days after a trip and typically they're going to wait until you you're at home for thirty days and then you start seeing some weird stuff happening you know what I mean\nUm and if you haven't already set up some type of authentication on your bank account I Would\nStart seeing some weird stuff happening you know what I mean um and if you haven't already set up some type of authentication on your bank account I Would definitely encourage that but in my wallet I carry a\nAbout the size of a thumb drive I don't know if you've ever seen the news and the sun Dr has a rotating code on it even now I can tell you I can show you that there's a code on it and every thirty seconds I get a brand new code if you don't have that code you can't have access to my bank account so I Would try to\n... I Would encourage you to see if you can still some of that type of\nA extra layers of protection as well and fixing before you give us call we're here for you um but congratulations on a great trip in a safe return but again just spent some time and change all those passwords it listen I have to tell you if you haven't heard about the brand new commando ambassador program was super excited about this\nAt our commander dot com slash ambassador you refer to your friends to the Kim commando show and they came commando show newsletters and you can earn valuable prizes\nCan win a dash cam a laptop\nOr a blue to speak or I mean really great prizes you do not have to be a ... member to participate we're talking about commando dot com slash ambassador\nOr in your newsletter scroll down to the bottom you'll have a direct link to your particular page really excited about that the right where you are talking about the history of the cell phone now boring coming up here on the ...\nLord number two marriages digital\nTalk about five point five\nHere some exciting news as a company simply save is now valued at a billion dollars\nNot only that more than two million homes are not protected with an incredible simply say system simply say if this comprehensive protection for your home with round the clock professional monitoring that would bring the police anytime there's even the slightest hint of a problem and simply say is built for the unexpected\nSee yeah that that's crazy I didn't realize that it went that\nFar back I had no idea I would've guessed the late seventies most yeah I would've said the seventies in the seventies Motorola they came out with their first ever put public cell phone or that was available and they made their first ever public cell phone call on a device that weighed two and a half pounds\nThat's a big phone\nThat's a heavy phone imagine a cell phone if the technology did not advance and we were still carrying around a whole lot I got to get my phone [laughter] because you live there for me like back is killing me just hold it for just a sec okay\nSo we we jump forward another decade K in the late eighties the GSM standard I remember that the mobile standards were established world why\nWould you basically opened up the cell phone industry so it now it can begin to grow commercially so Nineteen Ninety two you know what happened in Nineteen Ninety two uh\nThe first text message was sent you just read that story [laughter] ...

[laughter] yeah and in that too yeah what it is it's a it's something you'd rather it seems like something revenue and so I just wanted to get the information out there that folks up because you know as you know hackers that are finding new ways to probe into your uh to access your money\nAnd now just a few weeks ago we got a phone call from our local law I'm I'm a credit union and they know our habits and the way they they they got to I'm a I'm check that said a so called purchase said it was near Fifteen thousand dollars from the popular a sporting goods chain\nAnd job they produced we went to go see in the back door they produce that they sell only up there's it's our check we don't use two minute checks\nBut somebody was able to take our check and others are there's there's or address there's are routing number there's our account number the the the check never was a little bit different\nBut there was it was like fourteen thousand dollar is from from this this place and I called back and say the name of the company yeah sure go ahead\nYeah it's a ... okay so I called them\nA lot older that's a lot of fishing gear by the way they are saying oh and I'm All right but wait\nWait before you continue I Want to know so the check looks really good\nIt was it was a it was\nOur check the only difference was that had a different name on it [noise] and uh yeah so yeah we had that so when I contacted\nWas it had a different name on it [noise] and uh yeah so yeah we had that so when I I I contacted a they they were most interested in and say what was going on because I told her I said that if it's it's not just one\nBut I suspect that there may be some other things going on maybe it's not only with our account but with other people for counts as well sure and sure enough yeah there was and so they they put a ... I'm a stop on it but the guy said that he had his or experience\nWas that this was the second or third ah like I'm a I'm a a problem that he had seen and so I don't know if this was if he had any awareness that there is something that you might be able to offer because\nThe next day here where the credit union and and to do the fraudulent paperwork and ... kind of good stuff well the the bank manager right then and there as she got some information and she says hey they just took nine hundred dollars from your checking\nOh gee they were\n... or so so that the number one I'm impressed that your credit union called you I mean that's really something right there I don't know a lot of banks that might do that a number two is that they were able to potentially pass this check through so what are what are the banks say that you could do as a precautionary means right now\n[laughter] well the only thing that we had to do was to actually shut down the the er account number and switch over to another one not the the routing number was invented thing I'm most certainly because we wanted to maintain a we've been there for years and that again they know our habits\nAnd that was a kind of a defensive player\nI so I guess the the big thing they take away message here is that a lot of people don't like to keep track of their checking accounts right I mean\n[laughter] well sometimes it's just very easy not to think about doing that and I and to be honest this caught us at off guard a bit because we were right smack in the camp right smack in the middle of but just saw her house and a lot of how we are we're right in the middle of moving I mean if it was like ... constant\nRain you know and then when you're moving like that I mean jeeze I mean the last thing you want to think about is if somebody's trying to steal from you know what I mean it's crazy\nUm you know what Randy thank you so much for your call today and thank you for spreading the word because there is any

calls just like what you're describing also liquid Randy called in probably about ten minutes ago right so we're in light of all of these things and then you just mentioned about technology and you mentioned about monitoring couch\nI'm them primary large amount of people that call and generally seniors are they tend to be a good target for fraudsters what do you think is probably the best reason\nFor them to get involved or stay involved on line with technology what's the biggest reason than your mind that wouldn't be beneficial to them\nAnd what why do you ask [laughter] I'm personally I've run into the worst um I've I've [laughter] I've\nSeen and heard it all over the many many years that have been doing this uh I've talked to many Rand is over the past um [laughter] I've dealt with the truck scams that you mentioned um banned all of those are very personal one universal\nUm I've dealt with the truck scams that you mentioned started um and all of those are very personal\nOne universal thing pretty much comes into play and unless something dramatic cap of ... so vast majority of these things I discovered after the faster they are somebody who still gets a paper statement then they get at the end of the month [laughter]\nIt's it's far the money's long gone and the ability to recover is is\nJust you know that that's a good point you're right Korea's position that that's a real\nChance that's a really good point is that I'm thinking of even my mother she gets a paper statement at the end of the month right by the time you get the statement your
