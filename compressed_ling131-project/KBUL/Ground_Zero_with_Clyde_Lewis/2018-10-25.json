[noise]\nOn going on [noise]\nOkay so yesterday we had a a a very perplexing conversation because there was a story that came out in the New York times\nAnd I\nI think what they're saying is what I've always\nBeen saying about transgender criticism and I thought this was politically incorrect and I don't know what the hell this even means now has is a well I don't I really honestly do not understand stew brought this up read the the times article that you brought up\nThe times article is anatomy does not determine gender experts say that's the title and now it's it's kind of seemed through discussion of this Trump planned to change the way people register on paper or you'd be registering as a as a effects you were born out not to sex you believe you are today\nSo that's kind of where it seemed it of course every piece of news must go through some sort of Trump's filter to see whether you can blame Trump or excused Trump or ... no one can just talk about an issue anymore but through at the ... about halfway through the story you get this and I was fascinated by this discussion\n'em how to define identity\nResearchers say gender identity comes from the brain not the body some put it more bluntly that originates between your ears not between your legs\nAnd so yes I Would say like that strikes me as I read it again almost like a conservative critique right of\nThat's come between us is not your leg right exactly right and this\nIs supposed to be what the researchers are saying and it struck me as I was reading this that we're discussing two different things like the reason why you would want someone to register as a male or female let's say on a government health care for right would be something because not because of the feeling in their brain\nAnd their brain right like that what they really are I like you would have to cover for example of you know birth right of something that a man can't do that again that stuff out of there probably are Raj oversee of of Obamacare and other things but the the point being\nYou know you were there was a reason to know these things in theory\nWith the government not because they're tracking how the feeling they're not tracking um how you feel in your brain right they're talking about specific things that that body parts can do\nAnd you know that is you know there might be a higher risk of breast cancer or higher risk of another site type of cancer that doesn't change because your mind feels like you're more like a boy\nThan you are girls gender has they have gotten away from one traditional definition of gender which is\nMale or female I'm On the other part of the definition of gender is describing traits\nThat is really kind of you know a feminine that is a traditional masculine gender may those traits the tomboy Tom boy that's a masculine gender trait okay right but those are traits\nBut if you really were the difficulty in politically incorrect question um if if if this more for your for instance is we waste\nIn Iraq sick because you are seeing your body and the way that is not reality and it's dangerous it doesn't it's not a healthy the outlook um we see the stats of people who have gender just there's more ... and the suicide rates are really bad\nHaving the sex change and everything else is not changing those suicide rates so why are we taking the the gender is more for you and say hey it's totally fine when it's not it's not the suicide rates are bad\nUh I Would agree but when we talk about his coma Betty I Do think many people who are coming out is transgender nowadays probably have some other psychiatric condition that isn't being diagnosed because clinicians aren't able to do their job properly\nSo if someone comes into your clinic and says that they are transgender I don't work with patients anymore but um if someone comes in Allen says that they're transgender a clinician really does have to take that at face value they're not really allowed to to ask her questions because that seen as trans Celtic so I think nowadays because it's seen as very trendy to the trends\nThat can be part of the end of someone who has another form of psychopathology it's manifesting as something that has to do gender even ... I think that you said um but with regards to why transitioning shouldn't be seen as something beneficial in research that show\nFor some people that can help I Do think if\nOthers things happened ruled out that it it can be beneficial for somebody um I think ultimately adults should be free to do what they want with their bodies\nSo so do I don't get me wrong so do I but I I I think was a a I was getting to and you just answered is\nWith this trends phobia of is this just hurting everybody into Ashville questions is dangerous it's just dangerous for people and and we we should look in the end you're an adult you get to do what you want to do and I'm fine with that\nBut just the silencing of thought and in this case science and medicine is is terrifying\nYeah but I mean going back to the difference between gender disorienting something like anorexia with people who are gender to support their brains has been partially either my school and I are feminine I\nWrite and direction I got out of that the gender they identify as right the thing is the studies that show that in the brain ... are also conflated with\nSexual orientation so if you have a study on trans women say so these are people who are born male that identifies female they are also attracted for the most part two men\nSo when you do these brain studies we're still not clear on it the differences we're seeing are due to then identifying female for due to them being sexually attracted to that because there are a very strong neural correlate that are associated with sexual orientation\nThat that's the other thing that people aren't talking about is that this has a lot to do with sexual orientation being gay\nAnd so the brain call it that people are talking so much about how transgender transgender is in the brain it's not really accurate because when we don't know for sure yet\nDr Deborah so thank you so much I appreciate it\nAlways enlightening to talk to somebody who was not politically correct\nAnd doesn't agree with everything that you say or you know you may not agree with everything she says good to have the conversation is healthy nursery all they're doing in your car in for an

that he shouldn't have dismissed Juanita broad Rick's accusation against a Bill Clinton\nNow this is coming from a columnist for the Washington Post whose name is Richard Cohen he's worked at the post things that I didn't sixty eight\n[noise] and he just wrote an opinion piece titled I thought Juanita Broderick was incredible\nI was wrong\nNot wanting to Broderick is the woman who alleges that Bill Clinton raped her when he was running for Arkansas governor in Nineteen Seventy eight but since the me too movement exploded over a year ago there's been a title shift in the culture culminating in the tug of war over allegations during the Kavanaugh hearings\nThat one of the biggest takeaways from those hearings according to those on the left is that you always must believe the victim\nDuring the hearings Anita Hill was once again in the spotlight brought up over and over again and her accusations against Clarence Thomas universally believed by the media yet somehow some of Bill Clinton's accusers still haven't been extended the same sympathy as Dr Blasey Ford and need a hill\n... that's really why is it so unusual to hear a Bill Clinton supporter admit that they may have been wrong about Broderick it's Twenty years later\nNow this has been obviously influenced by the me too movement\nBut Cohen now admits to dismissing Broderick claims during the Clinton presidency is just another wild accusation made by twisted Clinton haters\nNBC's Lisa Myers recently told slate I tested Broderick story every way I could again and again and again I'm quoting and no detail ever changed it never got better it never got worse it was always the same and quote\nCohen ... now wonders why Monica Lewinsky is now totally characterized as a victim while Broderick is ignored\nIsn't that interesting Monica Lewinsky who has always say she says she wasn't a victim\nIs now the victim and Broderick who is always claimed it was not consensual I was raped\nShe's ignored Cohen says it might have something to do with Broderick bring being a Trump supporter come on I couldn't have anything to do with it though and writes\nI remember refusing to deal with the Broderick allegations because I simply chose to believe Clinton was not a rapist my position has proved naive\nMe ask you a question unlike\nBroderick who had all of the evidence had witnesses unlike Keith Ellison who the witness is very credible has nothing to gain everything to lose the evidence is overwhelming\nThose two things you can look at and you can say there's evidence there you'd shoot you chose to ignore it with Kavanaugh there was no evidence but\nAnd you can say there's evidence there you'd shoot you chose to ignore it with Kavanaugh there was no evidence but if suddenly there was a bunch of evidence and it was presented\nI Would be fine with saying wow okay new information looks like Kavanaugh did it\nWhy is it that no one on the left is willing to do that\n\nWhether dealing with Clinton or the capital cases all political camps should\nTread carefully and their certainty about the truth certainty always seems to get us into trouble\nRequires a huge dose of something more elusive than the truth to be able to survive today\nAnd that is humility Cohen seems to be exercising humility and for that I think the Washington Post columnist\nThank you for being willing to step out of the crowd go against maybe some of your peers and say you know what I think we were wrong about this one thank you Richard Cohen\nIs a pretty big moment we recently went over the details that Broderick accusation like to have her on\nYeah she she would come on I think she it was interesting to see that because I honestly the same thing had a similar reaction to it at the time or in which a lot of the accusations about affairs and stuff seem to credible but you know rapist I mean the the\nThe accusation was really brutal or by the time she had five corroborating what does that she told at the time uh she talked about seeing a I think it was a prison\nOr in the outside of the window mhm um which was confirmed that prison was there she was confirmed to be at this nursing Congress that was there he was in town like I mean there was a lot of it was on like the she knew that she knew what hotel was at\nA and she knew the time period I don't know if you know the exact date but everything else you had pretty much locked down pretty ... I Will tell you\nAnd and the ... and the real shocking that Glenn is not only is that the case with technology and the prevalence but among young people where it's most prevalent Eighteen to twenty four year old men now the numbers show that\nThey view it as a morally acceptable choice or indifferent to it a majority so so what can I tell you something\nI mean you're a guy you're being told you can't look at women are sexually you can't notice what they're wearing you a rape is completely undefined I mean you know I asked you out\nYou said no I asked you out a second time and now I hear rapist yeah I'm a ... [laughter] I mean it's it's crazy and confusing\nAnd I don't know you know as a as a twenty something boy or a Seventeen year old boy well anyway\nWell it's and it would argue its consequences for it right like it's just yeah I I Am I getting real that by anybody I'm not getting in trouble with anybody I mean it was around I went for and it's not consequences for it right yeah\nNot at all um I mean the the pastors that are in this course some\nYou may remember glad I don't know if you know Doug Wilson but he um he got famous because he was debating Christopher Hitchens he went around and he was the he was the apology screen apologies that went around him and\nAnd so and so he lays that all out about how you know destructive this really is to relationships and how is the silent killer because there's a stigma with with pornography like if you go into you know your church into your testimony and there's some sort of\nYou know like a drug addiction or something like that you know there's a lot of sympathy for you and and people you know roll out the record but there's you know if you come up and you're the porn guy right now it's like you don't how many how many how many times have you seen that testimony your church I have never seen it right and so and so\nAnd actually the numbers in this study showed that even church leaders are are falling victim to to this so I Know there's a reason why they're not bringing it up there there's a fear that they're going to be found out to\nNo and you know in in in my church and you know my church is a good way to to you know right now do we drink milk [laughter]\nAnd it's the number one reason families are breaking up is the number one cause of of problem is pornography and starts out as pornography and adjust\nIf you're if you're ... you know if you're having a porn addiction issue like you're probably not going to want to stand up in front of your right because the stigma is big I think it's interesting about what you've done here is like ... that the same way that\nThe the negatives of what has happened with porn which is the stigma has been taken away 'cause you could just do it on line and her own right like this course that you have is kinda the same it takes away the stigma of having to admit it necessarily you can kind of go through and and hear these things without having to stand up for it in front of your shirt I don't know your neighbors\nOf honestly I mean I Know you're ready I Know it's really uh I Know it's I understand the stigma\nAbout it's the same kind of stigma as you would have as a as an alcoholic twenty five years ago you have to um there's it is\nThis is natural as you said God gave us the sex drive and it is different between men and women and men are driven by their eyes it ... and we just are we're very visual women or not is visual is we are when it comes to sex and so there's\nIt's it's normal EDS normal yeah you would have this Dr what makes us not an animal is trying to say okay some of that is good some of the too much of this is bad right\nRight and then what we're doing is like I said we're pressing the reset button and showing you where God has laid out because cultures gone so off the rails and it's that's part of that's been infused in the church I mean even the stuff you lead inside\nYou know the stuff we allow ourselves to watch I mean 'cause you can talk about pornography and say oh hard core pornography yes that's pornography but where do you watch it on Instagram which feeds are you looking at I mean is in ... I'm not like\nThe women in bikinis showing their butts right now I mean like only when I got it in the rain when you're just rolling that all the way through I mean and if you're not be considered part I think I think some people can make that case they make a strong case\nThis is an argument that it ... you know my wife and I have all the time a because there's almost nothing that you could watch on you know Netflix or Amazon\nThat unless it's an old TV series or something there's almost nothing that you can watch that doesn't have this you know so you know click click click you know go ahead and and um you know fast forward through some of that crap and that's the argument is on my wife like\nDon't stop watch and we have stopped watching this honey let's just zip ahead of this part you know\nBut [noise] is that right right is that right you know it's not because he\nIs the course like how does it have our recommendations for filters is it about that type of thing what would we mentioned those things because they are good like having Internet filters and accountability partners and you know things are good but what we do is we really just tried to get to the heart of it because those things are band aids they're they're right in the Bible says our hearts are deceitful above all out and so it's\nYour your heart's gonna find a way if you're still desiring that your heart's gonna find a way around your filter you're going to find another device you're going to know how to do this and that to get around it can be so we tried to rewire your heart and show you what God will give you a positive vision to shoot for you can't just say don't do it when I Do it right\nTo give me some of the stats [noise] um well I'm you know two thirds of all Christian men have you'd porn monthly they admit that I Would assume too that if that's the admitted to number it's ... it's probably not nearly just\nOn higher I think it was something like I don't have one in six church leaders have admitted to struggling with his best church while you're six and so you know nine percent of churches only ... only nine percent of churches actually have resources dedicated and I and I believe because ... is is just you know me\nSort of projecting this you know I'm guessing this but because of that and the ramp and you know numbers that are here I think that there's probably a little bit of fear and some of these leaders because they feel hypocritical you\nKnow coming out and saying let's fight this thing because they know\nBut I'll give you one more um\nAh kids are being exposed to porn I mean my kids went on Syria the other day and actually said something and they miss under Syria misunderstood and came back with like a sexual thing um and my son was like what's that all about and I'm so kids are accidentally or intentionally getting exposed at pornography as young as ten and eleven years old\nAnd they're getting married later so now think about that if you start getting into porn at ten eleven twelve years old and it becomes a habit for you\nUm and then you don't get married until you're twenty eight or twenty nine years old you've been poisoning your brain now in how you view women for ... you know two thirds of your life who thirds of your life and an hour and a diving these people to to be a good husband\nAnd it takes more and more to excite you\nYes I mean it just is a gateway it's a gateway did you start with porn and and we we look at affairs and that's the other thing that ... where does that usually start it didn't start just one day you wake up and say I'm going to have an affair with my secretary [laughter] started\nIn the house and your phone you know and like and we can talk about this but I\nGuarantee you our voices right now we're hitting the numbers don't lie the numbers don't lie we're hitting you were not hitting a neighbor were not hitting somebody else I guarantee you there's somebody sit in their car\nListening to this and and it's hitting home right now because it's the silent killer and you've been walking around with that would that shame and guilt and so that's why we made this course set free course dot com because\nYou know God wants you to be free from this he he wants you to live in you know shame free guilt free from this and he's given you the tools to fight it and so that's what we points to thank you very much Dan thank you thank you for having me\nYes he is he doing something with his life [laughter]\nAfter this\nSet free course dot com is the place to go get it and the Israel thing is coming up to where we have the ... documentary I was talking to Dan a little bit earlier today about some of the experiences of seeing the media as they cover the Palestinians versus the way they cover these lessons and old\nTo go over there now over the media and yet that's what this documentary became because the media was if you didn't stay with the gaggle\nYou actually knew actually observe something above the gaggle down that they're just never aware\nOf law and and even more shocking Glen is when the ... they're they get the story wrong I mean it was unbelievable to me you know because we went there to watch from you know actually do what the other presidents didn't do and and open the the us embassy there in in Jerusalem and so\nUm that's what we were therefore but then what we saw was how the media can toxin narrative that's completely false\nUm that I'll I'll tell you a quick story of as you don't know for some some context I downloaded a nap while I was there called red alert\nAnd so you can try this at home and test it and see if I'm if I'm I'm full of it\nBut it's called red alert and what it does is it you know you know those annoying alerts you get on your phone when they're little flooded it's like ... like really loud well it does that whenever a missile it or rocket has launched into Israel 'cause we wanted to follow okay there's rocket falling down right where we're going to go find where they are and so I downloaded this app and so it went off a few times over there\nOr I get home and you know\nAll of a sudden it like two in the morning like my my phone's just going bananas and like all day for like three days in a row like on and off I'm getting these I had to delete the app because it was so annoying that I was that these rockets were getting shot and Israel all the time\nAnd you know and then what is it might be a show ... that's the picture like there's the contacts like their rockets are flying in from Gaza all the time\nThat the media shows up and it's like look at these Israeli you know evil soldiers just gunning down innocent hapless and protesters there on the on the Gaza border ... why do you think the Israelis are taking it very seriously when they're burning tires\nWhen they're burning tires and they're\nTrying to break through the fence they're taking it seriously because all the rest of the days are getting rocket shot

it's hard when you have tons of stories coming out of your tons of speculation coming at you and you have to kind of like break it down I Know there were seven plus targets today\nWould be a unusually non explosive pipe bombs that were sent to um well for her first families the Obamas the Clintons near ...\nUh the headquarters of CNN in New York former attorney general Eric Holder there was a package address to rip a Republican or a sort of Republicans started she's not a Republican representative Maxine Waters\nThat was intercepted uh US Congress mail facility which is that located on site where the congresswoman works a\nLittle bomb that was sent to Eric Holder ended up being re routed to the return address of Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida and there was no package address to her but multiple packages had her address I as a return address on them so ah it looks like the CNN package got all the way to the mail room\nOne or more of the package is also contain envelopes that had an unknown white powder inside so not only was there this possibility of of a pipe bomb possibly a more rice and perhaps anthrax who knows\nA an ATF official said during a press conference at the device into CNN was a pipe bomb NYPD said the device sent to CNN was a lie of explosive device\nAnd the implication is that they that this ... and the other devices had the capacity to kill\n\nNone of the devices went off their lethality has not yet been confirmed by bomb technicians we have not heard the lethality of of these so called bombs how the feds wouldn't disclose a during any of the press conferences exactly what was in the packages they said well it's consistent with the other packages let's just put it that way\nSo we have the investigation is ongoing of\nSo many crazy things have been done a lot of what we call security theater happening I heard something about New York and the national guard being called out why how's that going to prevent the mail from\nRefining its destination it it's just I just find it interesting now do you remember back when we were doing the rice and report\nRemember that and I remember that I was talking about the rights to report and how it's going to you know all those people and I said wow this is a biological attack I guess I I I predicted and I was all over it and I was reporting it there was not really that much of any type of reporting going on in the mainstream\nFrom CNN or or or MSNBC or any group I I Know the Fox was all over it because this was an attack on the president but now this has happened to democratic leaders this has gotten you know this has got the most attention I've ever seen and the truth is is that\nThe rice and were sent to these uh to the mail rooms with these leaders was activity could've poison someone and made a few staff members that Ted Cruz's office sick\nBut not one of these bombs went off\nSo they were sending a pipe bomb with the triggering mechanism on it you know they weren't there those those bombs were in there to take anybody out there were there to scare people they were they were they were basically scare type of of tools they were there to ah they weren't there to a a kill anyone\nAnd ah and so that raises my my eyebrows just a little bit but I also saw the John\nBrennan or on the low for bombs below they they said the bomb below\nJohn Brennan Time Warner CNN [noise] ten Columbus Circle New York New York to set up there [noise] and uh apparently all we have are just maybe six stamps there are no post marks on the\nOn the package [noise] so I'm Wondering if it was courier hand delivered or what [noise]\nBut um [noise] it\nUh be a conspiracy analyst or misinformation buster okay these bombs elopes the bomb scares all that this is going to create a perfect storm for misinformation\nI mean what you get and that I Am I'm being kind of an an a and and\nDoing some analysis I mean the analysts here what you get as you get breaking news reports and we grapefruit we we've proven is with nine eleven the nine eleven shall we did a while back I wanted to I Want to just kind of reiterate this\nYou get breaking news reports which are always riddled with holes there's a lot of unanswered questions as a lot of a gag and going on where they they gag police officers and FBI\nI mean who said the packages were they address to what was inside where they really all bombs in central central ... and then the incidents involve\nHigh profile polarizing figures in American politics who already are the frequent subjects of misinformation who already spout in misinformation and then of course you have the networks that are constantly pushing misinformation to push the cognitive biased for their own constituents\nAnd here we are just what days away from his mid term election throw it all on social media\nAnyone can basically speculate anyone can say whatever without any of the facts put me on the air talking about it if I don't if I don't happy in New York I live by us I'm a wire in a shill\nThe ... or for the you know my Jewish cameras or whatever you\nHappy in New York I live by us I'm a liar and a shill\nFor the ... or for the you know my Jewish cameras or whatever you want to say I have I don't I I don't I just can't stand that stuff yeah we all know investigations take time but I Know that you know the way this all works\nThe FBI is going to say that they're more packages out there if they haven't said All right I mean I've been following the news since I did prep for the show I did everything I'm getting is just probably an hour or two before\nI went on the air tonight so it'd be more copycat situation is going on I can promise you that is a more of these reports being made people are claiming they're getting bombs uh it\nThe more of these reports arise it's imperative that you have to be vigilant you have to figure it out you have to say well you know now we have this going on we have to be aware of packages we have to be aware of\nYou know the packages that look kind of um ... suspicious because I I remember\nAh the Unabomber bombings uh they happened in Utah and there was also the Mormon document bombings or this guy who uh had the bombs actually his car blew up like a block away from my apartment\nSo I I Know that that this stuff is a same mad bombers are insane because people are always fighting bombs where they don't exist that they're trying to make up stories that don't exist you have all these people you know freaking out over this\n[noise] so\nLet me also tell you this okay if you were to look through history of you look through or anything that deals with civics\nYou know that these types of activities go on in the elections in third world countries and they do so to kind of shake up the government they shake up the regime they shake up\nWho they want out and who they want and it's all done to uh it's all done and it's all traced back to rogue intelligence or rogue military\n\nAnd what we're seeing here with the delivery of the rice and and the bombs are exercises and drills and then possibly even a a I guess you could call them cry wolf scenarios of a decapitation exercise\nBecause if you recall the rice and attacks were aimed at the president and military leaders the latest bomb attacks though were aimed at the Democrats mostly\nA\nLaw enforcement authorities said today that they believe potential explosive devices send to the former secretary of State Hillary Clinton or President Obama billionaire philanthropist George Soros and former CIA director John Brennan CNN or all linked\n\nThat's from Newsweek us Secret Service intercepted a device yesterday or last night actually send to the Clintons and a tropical on New York also another to bronco bomb and Washington DC in Manhattan CNN evacuated employees at the time Warner center this morning\nIn fact uh you can go online and ah it was during a one of the morning shows they were on the air and they heard the fire alarm and then they were immediately taken out with no questions\nI uh I just have a catch the ... the last bit of that today mental went into a Wolf Blitzer and everybody else making their commentary but you should have seen the hysterics\nAnd I thought where it was the hysterics for the rice and bombs and and and why is it that that didn't get much press but this is getting a lot more press why because this is political theater it's ...\nYou take something like this these bombs in go off nobody was hurt nobody was killed\n\nYou take something like this these bombs then go off nobody was hurt nobody was killed\n\nHe was reporting in San Diego union Tribune newspaper reporter its offices were evacuated this morning after a stack of suspicious looking packages was spotted outside the downtown building this gave ample opportunity for CNN and other news departments to blame Donald Trump\nFor his over the top political rhetoric tone it down Donald Trump he needs to tone it down and they and they were claiming that his political rhetoric\nHis rallies or whatever it is what he's doing is okay and there were no comments about the harassment of leadership like you know Mitch McConnell Nancy Pelosi was harassed you saw that to Ted Cruz\nSo you you see all these other leaders getting harassed then we're talking equal opportunity offensive here now that's why I threw a Nancy Pelosi Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz the president the generals\nBut it's it's all the I guess you could call it the incest you as few there they got attacked or at least were threatened today and now it's a big big deal\n\nThere were ... today it was all there was there was no mention\nAlso of the negating of leadership in several cities where my violence has been common like it here in Portland, Oregon in New York didn't even mentioned that they didn't say oh this is all culminating in one big message was all about their their their\nTheir leaders there was almost like a leader from like North Korea or you know they say the trumps of fascist or the Trump is a naturalist pig you\nLook at the way everybody is just like so into and love being in and finding over these guys when we've had this has been going on I mean it started with the shooting of all those congressman\nAwhile back\nThen there was no mention of an ... an insurrection tactics as a symptom of civil war in this country but it's best to review\nThat this is what is happening in America the truth is is that we have been having a plethora of homeland conflicts that have been asymmetrical distributed and diverse and we've seen the conflict with numerous dynamic factions organized by social media around ideological and affinity networks\nAntifa Proud Boys white supremacist\nAll part of the patchwork of affiliated insurgency groups and their counterparts engaging in skirmishes along overlapping edges of their networks everyone has a place in this faction of civil\nWar\nAnd just say it's not a civil war I think you're blind because after the attempted bombing today will be seeing occasional high value terror attacks against soft and hard targets\nMark my words\nAnd this is going to continue if we have bombs going off and we have we have a regular rice and being sent the leadership soon it will be schools again it will be it'll be neighborhoods\n\nAnd people tell me oh quite we're not in a civil war or do you want I mean this is one civil war is I mean I've lived through on an Argentine this civil war [noise]\nIt is [noise]\nAnd and it's done with the ... in the guise of oh we we don't know what's going on and what we've got a caravan coming see that look distraction distractions day we had a caravan coming [noise] oh well he got some bombs being sent to all of our people you\nKnow that this is an attack on the left [noise] what about the attack on the president and the generals and the staff and Ted Cruz what about policy what about I mean [noise] Maxine Waters saying what she says [noise]\nI don't know if anybody's paying attention they're just like everything is just like so spaced out do we think these are just isolated incidents no they're not isolated incidents [noise]\nThis is like ... and it's just like they live it's like the walking dead there is zombie that don't know if something is happening\nDrew them so they can see what's truly happening\nDribbling
