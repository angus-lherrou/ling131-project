the scripts or from the ah the four part series that I did years ago called the puppet master or George Soros\nBecause for some reason George Soros is being rehabilitated again in the press or and now they're ... they're taking it so far by saying that\nUm people are saying this caravan\nA is a is now being funded with Jewish money\nAnd when they said Jewish money what they're actually saying is George Soros they're saying that people said that George Soros is funded this but to make it sound more anti Semitic they're saying people are claiming that this is now being funded with Jewish money\nSo who's the anti Semite here who's the one line\nFirst of all this caravan we have absolutely no evidence that George Soros is involved in this or any of his money is going to fund or support any of this we have zero information\nWe do have information that two of the uh uh organizations that he helps fund were directly responsible for the last caravan in April\nBut ah probably next week we're going to go through a the puppet master and I'll bring you the absolute facts\nOn the Pentagon last year they're constantly hacking in to our our our Pentagon the government's servers it's like Ninety thousand hacks are on the government last year from China\nIt's it's ... it's it's it's staggering\nAnd nobody's talking about it they just got into a a a deal a few years back with a a wind generator from that was making these giant generators that you put on a on a windmill and they had a four hundred and\nNinety\n[noise] let's say ... billion dollar campaign four hundred and Ninety million dollar a bed and they had all of these turbines being built by this company and it was like four hundred and Ninety thousand dollars a foreigner Ninety million dollars over like five years\nWell the companies shipped out first I'm a turbine but the company was told by China hey we need to see everything we need to we need to know every step of the way what's going on\nWhat they did is they got access to the servers they hacked in they downloaded everything they got one generator\nThan they cancelled they said yeah we're good will they found out that China had hacked in\nGot all of the blueprints everything they had they had one that they were made by Americans and they brought it into their factories and said okay just make a bunch of these that's what they're doing to us all the time to me that's not a trade problem [laughter]\nI mean depending on what ... ... ah information you're accessing it's an act of war I mean it can be\nThey have access to our power grid they have access to I mean I'm telling you if we ever go to war it's going to be lights out that these with China and Russia this is what well boot and said World War three will be fought with ones and zeroes not bombs\nAnd China is doing the same exact thing so why don't we do more about this\n[noise] I think probably because we owe China's so much money nobody wants to make an enemy of China nobody wants to say anything we probably do some of this stuff not stealing things but I'm sure we are trying to hack into into their military as well\nSo I think it's one of those things where\nYou know everybody's listening to each other right you know so let's not talk about it will all deny it but we all know\nWhat China is a different animal China is is the wealth the largest\nChina is a different animal China is is\nThe ... the largest transfer of wealth in human history has happened in the last ten years and it's all fast from China what they have stole\nFrom our corporations the

that's separate from their rules like so China has a very restrictive rules in their country\nAnd they these are these are non tariff barriers rhyme mind which basically say hey you want the access to our ... billion and a half people access to this market where you're gonna have to do when you come over here is give us access to your technology\nAnd willingly top corporations do this all the time they go over there and they say well I mean I Want to have access to the market so I guess you could have it now that's a ... a terrible policy\nBy the choice but it's also been said he's chosen to do it that did it this theft this is them getting in like the wind turbine mhm okay getting in\nA having a basic access okay we're going to buy these will buy 'em for four hundred and Seventy million dollars or whatever it is well by those guys great send them over to us but we need access\nYou know we need to be able to see anything then going in the on the access that they said ... and grabbing
