[noise] and I have so many places I Would like to um a go with the new uh and and talk to the senator about we're going to run out of time uh I Would like to invite you to do a um an hour and a half uninterrupted podcast with me under when you have time\nUm because I think your voice needs to be hurt and understood and parts of it challenged I'm sure but uh uh I Would like to just pick up on this point so the number one driver of happiness is vocation your one guy that will understand that if that's true\nIn the next ten years we're in deep trouble\n[noise] we're headed toward a really interesting time\nIn the next ten years we're in deep trouble\n[noise] we're headed toward a really interesting time in human history and it's scary and fascinating so somebody some people's shorthand for this of the ... the economy I think the simpler way to think about it is just the average duration of people's jobs or their relationship from is going to get shorter than ever before in human history\nSo let's go macro for a minute hunter gatherers throughout most of human history\nYou don't have any conception of what your job is you pursue that buffalo right and then ten thousand years ago people settled down and started planting and harvesting and we we enter farm on a on a regular cycle and from ten thousand years ago two hundred and fifty years ago nobody had job choice they just did with grandma and grandpa and mom and dad and aunts and uncles had ever had done forever eternity past\nWith the industrial revolution we get jobs specialization and it was really disruptive\nBut when people took a job they still kept it till death of retirement to not everybody graduated high school at the beginning of the industrial revolution\nBy the end almost everybody does but you still get one job that sometime between Fifteen and twenty two years old and you keep it for all of your life I was born in the Nineteen seventies average duration at a farm for a primary breadwinner then was still twenty six years now it's four years and getting shorter and it's going to get shorter forever more\nMcKenzie a farm I used to work with believes that fifty percent of the American labor market by three years from now this is not Twenty years in the future\nThree years from now they think fifty percent of the labor market will be primarily freelancers meaning that most people will cobble together a bunch of different jobs not all of them are going to be ap enabled tech jobs like being a new driver with the right software that makes you more efficient than an old school Gabby but\nWhat's really going to happen is we're going to head toward a world where people are going to get disrupted out of their jobs at aged forty and forty five and fifty and fifty five\nForever more we've never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the banks of what's often called now the quarter life crisis\nThe sort of late adolescence crisis of trying to figure out your your role in life and how do you go from just being a consumer and mom and dad's house to be in a producer that cannot just put bread on the table for your kids but can actually have a sense of meaning that you're serving your neighbor that disruption that most people know in late adolescence working experience that again every three to five years for our whole life\nAnd that means there's a lot of new potential for upheaval and frankly for unhappiness there's going to be more economic output than it's ever been produced before in human history but it's not at all clear that it will redound to the median family and the median household and the media and worker or going to have to become a civilization of lifelong workers\nAble to get retrained when you're forty nobody's ever done that before\n[laughter] okay so there's about an hour of questions uh jumped on on that one uh but I've got about three minutes left can you give me\nA ... your take on the first real political upheaval that we're going to see that I think by twenty twenty you could change everything could start global wars the fakes\nYeah so one of the reasons I wrote them is because I spent a lot of time on intelligence issues and I'm In the intel community there are people who talk about the perfect storm of deep fakes that we have coming\nAnd the storm is these three ingredients number one new technology makes it possible to sort of narrow cast a world with fake audio and fake video where lots of people can be susceptible to being sort of\nUm a spoof or persuaded the things that aren't real are real there's always been enemies doing malicious actor you know information warfare since the beginning of time you can find it and ... and ... these are to sow discord in an enemies tent\nBut it used to require a prostitute now honey trapping a fake business partner in a bribery scheme\nAnd more for you to get people around people number one\nBut it used to require a prostitute now hunting trap at a fake business partner in a bribery scheme\nAnd more right you had to get people around people number one\nIs now we can use technology to surround someone and give them a fake experience and ... are fake audio and fake video that are going to seem real I can make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad at it the real reason we need to take the Russia\nType investigation so seriously as because China's right behind them reading scout team often I'm On them and ready to do\nBig deep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and business officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions about geography about race about um gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided\nThat we are susceptible to these kind of campaigns like Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they\nTry to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL dealing controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media and the first Seventy two hours after that flamed\nLast fall the majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taken the NFL most of it was Russian on both sides and so we're going to have a world where you're going to have things like the cabinet hearings where all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer's strategizing with Michael ...\nOr video will appear it'll be fake\nBut video will appear and it'll be having a party and hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake but in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be a potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them\nA why we hate each other is an awareness that there's actually national security exposures for this country and how much we hate each other around politics we need communities of people that live in the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise]\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\n[noise] ah it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere in a McDonald's right now who probably slap to an old man wearing a mock a hat\nAnd or that person is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of ... pecking\nAnd so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have well we've got thirty to thirty seconds I'm not getting even ask you I'm not even ask you I Would like to ask you to come down a band and and really unpack this uh because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood and I think in soundbites\nUm it's not to not always understood I'm so thank you very much\nFor them that good to be with your going but\nSenator Ben Sasse um why we hate each other and how to heal I really wanted that you really want to get into him on taking on your own\nOh I mean first of all the ... you know the press is a collection of individuals some of which do a good job some of which do not\nAh so it's important to make those decisions I think um and you know look at that is a this was just this is going on at our founding you know people were doing it at our founding and I know and and it at our founding but we've what we are we realize as when we were engaged and informed populace we chose correctly\nRight I mean I you know if we're not\nWell we know what the ... we know a republic if you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's going to fall apart we knew this was an experiment and that was the risk of it\nAnd I think we are seeing some some of those risks pop their heads up but I mean the whole foundation of this country is to let people come out and make their arguments\nAnd we have to make our back that does not mean I'm ... and I was so encourage I Hope you are too so encouraged by the ... a reaction from conservatives\nShe Nancy Pelosi shouted down a and I did not see a peep\nOf support from conservatives over the actions of the people protesting hurting I didn't see I was disgusted by I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't see any I didn't now I'm not saying there were none I'm sure people will show me a tweet if some you know not job who was like I think they should harass Nancy Pelosi at dinner\nBut I didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actions not one you could see if we can we played dozens of Democrat\nAnd you know here's here's here's one from Sean King I've said it before but I Need to say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so but I'm Glad we have people in this country who stand up to a fascist and a bigotry and are willing to confront ape face to face right and then you can there's nothing on\nI'm Glad we have people in this country who stand up to a fascist and bigotry and are willing to confront eight face to face right and then you've got there's nothing on the left there even prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened to ... and that's right\nAnd I'm Glad they mean that that shows that there's still you know even though we're divided and even though a lot of things come down to ... minute emotional politics that go minute to minute I'm Glad to see that there's still principles there so here's\nWhere I think Ben was wrong when he said to deal with anti ...\nUm she was right when he said you know it's a small group so small groom she's right\nIt is a very small group and they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media but it is a small group where I think he's wrong is ignore it\nHe said part of the solution is ignoring yeah and I think you know because you can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the alt right right you know the Charlottesville situation um you know\nThere's obviously a crime committed there that you can't ignore right um ... generally speaking when well bunch of Nazis or KKK members that's been happening forever these ... and go back ... bunch of KKK members walk through your town like ... you know largely speaking it's great to ignore them because they want attention and they run they\nMost that's not what we have now we have to a breaking laws you can't ignore the no you can't you can't ignore though I don't care if it's the Nazis or ... you can't ignore announce excess would argue\nNor that right I mean like I think he's saying that we get a little bit too wrapped up in the back and forth of viral videos and people who are not even really engaged in politics [noise]\nGetting freaked out over things that they're never going to have to necessarily deal with if you just missed a group like adjunct although that's how they grow\nOr and or at least arguably that's how they grow their own oppose you're seeing it happen in Portland right in the mayor is largely just ignoring what they're doing and getting worse and worse and worse and worse that does not mean our lives have to be ruled by anti though and I think that has been generalize argument he was going for well the the\nThe key here is what do you do about it and the\nSolution is to not do what people did in Florida\nWould than see below sea you don't do that because that doesn't give you a side to run to yeah you don't do what the Proud Boys are doing I'm Sorry but it's so I just\nWhen you talk to gabbing about that and yeah and I think Gavin is even you know\nLooking at things going again you know look we were we were doing things\nBecause you know it's funny a media yeah he's a comedian um but you\nKnow this this will grow out of control you just don't do that 'cause there's nowhere to go when you're watching that you're like well I don't like Well Nancy Pelosi is doing but I don't like whether they're doing\nSo\nWho do I go to and look at look how the press is treating Donald Trump look how the press treated Kavanaugh\nEverybody kind of hard and their positions didn't they\nEverybody just hardened their positions and got more outraged\n\nThe only the only thing that might have happened is independence\nLooked at that and said\nYou know what I don't want to be with those people left the left and I don't want to be with the I don't want to be with the left and then look over to the Republicans they weren't misbehaving during that\nBut what do we do\nAnd if you are kind of saying I don't want to be with those guys and then you see\nYou know you ... get out get out there pounding on ... and you're like okay I Know\nWe can't we can get to a place to where people disengage because if they do completely disengaged then it's just run the country is run by radicals\nWe need to be a safe haven we need to be a place of real thought real actual timed this um and real principles\nYeah I mean we have to present a rational logical alternative I mean that is one of the reasons I'm a conservative right right I saw the left you know early in my life as a group of\nPeople who made decisions emotionally yeah and that's not something I Want to be part of snow and we can't be a part of that we can't do that ourselves let me go to Andrew in Florida hello Andrew you're on the Glenn Beck program\nGoing good morning first time caller longtime listener high out during the day very good\nOh right yeah and you know I I just wanted to let you know I mean I'm here from Florida of an independent uh most of my adult life and I'm exactly what you guys just said a victory all on both sides it's so ridiculous I think a lot of the independent just stay out of it because it's so\nImmature and it makes everyone on both sides book that because they just can't talk to each other anymore it's just at far God now that being shed\nEvery one that I Know it's an independent and the state of Florida will be showing up for the conservatives\nNovember really are and why are you\nA simple reason she got people in office it off just right now out there that are fighting for lower taxes I might I'm bringing home over three thousand more dollars this year than I did last year which is a huge\nDeal for me I've got two little girls and I've got one more finally I got my first uncommon in eighth\nGrade [laughter] yeah I mean yeah and\n... there's there's things like that are going on and on and I'm a conservative Christian showed up at you when you're when you're talking about\nWhat these people represent and how they forced themselves into a restaurant that can hurt people when they're eating with their family\nOr most dependent and then think exactly the way I Do a church so disgusted with some of the rhetoric on both sides\nWe just ignore it and we've always been independent thinkers or we're going to stay that way but we also know what's wrong is wrong and what's right is right as far as ... concerned I think a lot of people are underestimating that\nWell Andrew I'm the EU if what you say is true ah than people are a ... than the Republicans will keep the house most likely\nA because it is so close and levels we've never seen of interest in participation in the mid term election ever a and it's it's within the margin of error between\nThe two that if the independents come out and they are that they could be the ones that make all the difference on which direction we go next so much Andrew ...\nIs so filled your mind is our

minutes a couple of weeks ago over the phone and uh\nI I was fascinated by you because you ... you think completely out of the box yes you're not thinking like a politician which is exactly what I think what we need to present\nYou are not being heard because for instance tomorrow they're having a debate and ... and you're not invited that's correct right they don't like me I don't know that I had it somebody like oh my God yeah right so um so how does somebody like you get elected\nLook it's it's just that Bush meant\nThe with establishment right the the established the establishment media stage with the establishment candidates right so that's what was happening when it comes to debate if they do that so\nIf you mentioned the idea that I have a ... a sea of Cortez right literally she's going to be my Congress person she's she's my district yes and quaint absolutely and I said this is a good thing and it's a good thing because it shows one thing it shows this is an anti establishment world right now\nShe didn't win because she was amazing and smart knew everything she wouldn't because she said I'm not established meant and people enter\nEvent and people are into her that's one of the reasons why Trump one that's one of the reasons why even Obama ones I was an eight I mean anti establishment is a thing that people tend to like now the advantage I have is I'm anti establishment\nHere saying how am I going to win if I Can't get the mainstream media by doing what I'm doing now doing pot and cash doing Facebook look Trump one of the reasons why Trump won was Twitter right that wasn't the reason but it was one of the reasons he use that tool and they didn't see him coming\nI use the same tools right I use Twitter I use Facebook I use podcast I use the same tools they don't like it makes them angry\nBut it's what I'm using they didn't see them coming they didn't see a court that's got me either and they won't see me coming out\nHowever with Cortez um she was she's been a real embraced by the establishment on the left the Democrats have become\nDemocratic socialist which is just because you can put the word Democrat and in for a democratic in front of it doesn't mean that it's a ... a really wonderful thing\nBut that's the thing you need to notice now here even though of course has one Nixon didn't\nAnd Nixon actually calls herself a socialist what happened once they said oh this protest person to a different person great let's vote for then they heard what you had to say\nAnd you found a lot of New Yorkers went you know what maybe this isn't right and people who voted for Cortez shifted and voted for our current governor\nHis magic sticking Andrew Cuomo the second ... so they voted for him again so they went back to establishment after her so I think that there was a little bit of buyer's remorse there there was an out I'll get you establish went oh wait a minute no not that much and I think they came back I think there was some

I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win yes ... ... yes really is as well get again remember at as third party in general the system is that against you\nAnd someone of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality could do this because every day I'm up against failure but the marine corps taught me\nTake the hill the captain shot take the hill the machine guns broken take the hill radios don't work take the hell are stopped giving excuses take the hell I get it and that's what I Do have to take the hill as a matter\nI get I I literally deal with failure everyday this woman every day and when I say that that's not an exaggeration that's every single day as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS\nAnd they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even though thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot\nWCBS they got him ... his name he there's decided nope Larry shop dozens of the on there he decided that the establishment as all that matters this is what I'm up against it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle we have to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that uh you think should be heard than you should probably\nUh maybe tweet storm what's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think that was ...\nSo this is a radio debate yes well there's gonna be televised also now okay we both televised on radio ... okay so yeah again and they're just deciding now we don't want them let me wrong there are three other people should be made should also be the Green Party and also the land party they should all be there\nBut this is the norm and we put up against this Web against is constantly and here's the the worst part\nWith all of this we're still growing and they're still going down that's that's the sad part they don't they don't they don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate how they're doing Larry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to get forty five thousand dollars you can't the maximum as forty four thousand [laughter] by New York state law so if you I Know what I Want to get like forty five thousand dollars sorry you can't do it forty four you only get forty four thousand it's all you can get a okay\nLarry sharp a dot com this with an e at the end of sharp um I Want I Want to talk to you about some of the issues of the day and and how we solve some of the things like for instance healthcare yes how to use all health care will do that coming up in a just a second\nWhen it yes it is so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they are pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent the New York state they being spent in Florida we're lily we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes so let's take pensions do sure pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's\nNo way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises jak people who work their whole life and were promised ally\nYep what do you do you see it here in Texas would you please for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you said already already happening a body of all the time\nIn New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation mhm so ... is a critical right now pending or about Fifteen or sixteen percent of our budget and a budget is a hundred and Seventy billion dollars it's double Florida and Florida has more people than us\nWow yes for about eighty five billion and the more people than us and we have a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget how about just massive\nAnd it's getting bigger the budget getting bigger and so are the percentages of the other pensions but on top of that a New York state has about three hundred million dollar debt and about a four to five day no deficit\nSo it's a bad bad bad and when you add that people always tell me about Lowry the pension fund is good they write the fund itself is doing relatively well some of the upstate ... up and you're doing very well some of the city wants or disaster but overall it's er and well they don't realize it's being also funded\nBy our tax base our budget that keeps putting money into it the problem is and the fun right now that's great the problem is the actual budget\nAt one point it gets so big that we simply can't pay me more as you're seeing in Dallas and my response time is about lotteries and the constitution yeah and I get that asked Detroit\nRight ass and Puerto Rico right Aspen is ... ... it was all legal for them to one there's no money it doesn't get funded when it doesn't get funded that eventually will collapse if that collapses if our pension fund collapsed near state we become Somali\nIt doesn't get funded when it doesn't get funded that eventually will collapse if that collapses if our pension fund collapsed near state we become Somalia overnight\nI don't want to become a Somali overnight I Want to stop that I'm the only guy talking about negotiating our pensions into the right which is some type of four one K. for it'd be something like that and I'm going to go shoot with every single union that will take forever I Know that's why I say it's a four year plan\nIs to for you plan to make us or what New York state is paying either a flat fee and or a flat percentage that sustainable because the issue we have is a a lot of people are pensions who no longer paying it any more mhm so we just simply have to keep paying them until they don't even use anymore so we have to do that also\nUsed to be like ten firefighters supporting one now it's one supporting tend to Iraq I think she was putting for for ... I think that's where I Am not sure but I was making them I think it's on I think I was born in three or four\nOr so yeah it's bad so now we have to make that change and the funny thing is people are attacking me saying light wants to get rid of our pensions I'm like I'm the only guy trying to keep them on the other one's talking about reality I'm Talking I was actually happening if you ever if you're ready for a pension now it's ten or Fifteen Years from now it's probably not going to be there for you\nBut why deal with that I mean it's human nature why deal with that if the two on the other side GOP and the Democrats are saying oh he's an extremist he's he's trying to spook you your pensions are fine it's human nature to follow them\nAgreed but I have a problem Glenn I care I have a problem I'm human\nI have a problem I Want people to stay in my state I Want people to stay in my state because if they don't my state's gonna collapse and I have to move\nAnd I don't want to move I'm born and raised in New York state my family and friends are in New York state I Love my state ... ... people love New York the heat in the U.S government New York state is very special it has served the largest city in the entire nation it has an amazing waterfall in Idaho Falls it as mountains as\nCool as Colorado and has farmland and all as yes I'm In New York ... no ... no farmland as cool as a mid\nWest it has amazing rivers and lakes and everything you could imagine a New York's the is there it's a beautiful diverse state and what destroying it because wedding one city run the entire state\nMost of my my ideas about happiness but the other part is decentralization it's about letting counties ... counties in regions be regions in towns towns right people upstate tend to get upset with people in New York City saying well they're running it and they are bad and cut them off\nIf you ran your own county you wouldn't care and that's what I Want to let people in New York City be New York city isn't by um W ... Rochester\nIsn't that what we're we're debating now over the electoral college the only reason why we're debating the electoral college is because it's the original debate I don't want New York city so tell me in the middle of the country\nHow to live my life yes don't let San Francisco bay San Francisco ... poop on the streets that's fine yes but we're different here\nYes and maybe you want to visit them once in a while right then ... look at the poop refined whatever whatever your thing is\nAnd they should be allowed to do to their city their county what they want to do\nA hundred percent true and it's not happening and the issue is we are getting more and more centralized control it happens in any large organization as I told you I'm a business guy right and I'm the guy who I Will come in sometimes and try to help businesses and fix them make things better and the last thing I say as iron fist\nIt's the last thing I say I hear all the time I go to a business owner and he goes my my leaders aren't doing with them what they should do I can't get to innovate I Can't get him to to take that you're taking your all your things and the last thing I say it's iron fist\nI say give them actually more freedom here's what I Know it's it's literally an equation [noise] personal freedom plus trends\nIt's hard and fast I say give them actually more freedom here's what I Know it's it's literally an equation personal freedom\nPlus transparency plus accountability equals innovation that happens all the time so you give that people get more freedom let the leaders take charge some will make mistakes but as ... as long as you try and ... you learn from them you become humbled by them which is fine we all make mistakes\nBut then what you don't want to see if they want to make a mistake blame someone else\nNow you see that these leaders you don't need which are the ones who will not make any mistakes there doing nothing those elite as you don't need you need the ones to get up try do well hit a couple of home runs strike out sometimes get better become humble to become better leaders in the long run that how you make a better organization we don't have that now [noise]\nLeary is going to join me for a a pod cast you'll hear a about Ninety minutes uninterrupted a and we'll put that out on Saturday um Larry sharp is his name and ah you you need to be a need to listen to him I I have a feeling\nThat if he doesn't win New York we're going to be seen him a again a perhaps the elsewhere but he is um he's worth your time to listen to and if you're in New York\nConsider voting for can't imagine\nI Can't imagine what would stop you because it's not working as it is but that's just me Larry sharp a S.

and switched to the one hundred percent fiber optic network\nOne hundred percent phenomenal [noise]\nYou weren't listening to ground zero [noise]\nFloating red chickens headless chickens in the news today [noise]\nActually it's the sea cucumbers [noise] but ah I was so blown away by the sand because I'm I'm I'm just terrified of chicken and as I said earlier there's actually a legendary [noise] they call it a legendary chicken rent [noise]\nI did a one time I was on the air some guy was calling because I was talking about fear and it was a Halloween ... ah after Halloween party I was on the you're talking about fear and I said one of my biggest fears with chickens I talked about this guy calls me tells me he says well you know if you if you kill a chicken\nYou know if you kill yourself and your pluck it yourself you'll be overcoming your fear because then you'll know that you could you can conquer it and I thought now telling me this story about how he killed a chicken\nAnd and everything you just made my skin crawl okay so we think about that floating headless chicken that they found out that article it's not really have a stricken they call the sea cucumber looks like a floating chicken\nBut anyway so I'm Talking to the guy and I told her I said no no no no this is creeping me I don't even go there don't talk about executing chickens don't talk about ... dropping chickens and having their heads chopped up running around squawking you don't ... they don't do it\nSo it kept doing it and I just got off of a Halloween party look I wasn't drunk but I was you know how it is when you're just bugs and you're capable of doing things and your heads kinda cloudy it was how I was feeling 'cause I was just coming off I figured I'd be fined by the time I get on the air and still feeling a little bit you know one of those if I Do a few cups of coffee I'll be fine after I was doing as low number copy\nA few cups of coffee I'll be fine after I was doing slowed down the copy the guy called the show here is a bit from the legendary chicken ran just to show you a where my head was at the time All right I'm creep\nThat's creepy he got over his fear by by just no you can't do that\nBeing an executioner of chickens does not change your fear no it does not\n\nIt does not change the fact that these things they are ruthless\nThey package you they go they make\nThat that clicking sound this just hideous you can you imagine you can you imagine being held in a chicken coop for a long period of time hearing the sounds of clocking every day and scratching and pecking\nThat would drive you nuts\nThat's how would knowing chickens are that's why we put them in buckets that will use eleven herbs and spices on them because they're scary\n\nWhen you had all these people out of the old airport defenseless chickens no one attack me when I was a little kid there not defenseless\nThey're not defenseless\nThey're scary poultry so if they are frightening foul he was what they are and they do fly you know that they do\nOkay don't let anybody tell you different chickens fly\nThey just don't like to fly obviously they're lazy good for nothing chickens and they only fly when they need to\nThey only fly when they wanna piss you off they only fly where they want to scare the hell out of you how one coming down swooping down on you and flying as they jump off the coup on to you that is when they decided to fly chickens fly\nAnd they attacked children they're worse than they're worse than those damn dogs those ... bulldogs are worse than pit bulls\nOkay so keep your chicken under lock and key [noise]\nFive oh three five three five ... back in the old days when the yo ... I was younger okay and ground zero was you know it is infancy and like I said I went to a party and this guy just you know he calls me and he starts talking about how it could be my fear\nOf chickens and he said I had to kill it nah I went into this chicken rant and people were like going I recorded bath [laughter] buddies sending me this this chicken dictionary and there's this chicken diction I call those chicken necks so uh anyway so that's my right about chickens once again they found this\nThey found the sea cucumber because the cucumber of all things\nActually swimming off of Antarctica or Australian group founded\nPut on video it looks like a flying I like swimming headless chicken and I was watching it today gave me the creeps I thought my God you know there are plenty of creatures that we don't know about and the scary and they're out there and they're freaky All right [noise] so uh especially a chicken with his head chopped up men nothing worse than that [noise]\nAnyway a lot of ended up a chicken ran [noise] ah [noise] it's very rare I pull out the chicken rent but I pulled it out there so you can see the [noise] yes in my younger days there's a reason why I wasn't a national talk show host\nKnow what is this where people why we thought it was the coolest thing\n[laughter] [laughter] I laugh ... what's that\nThat was another lifetime\nYeah that's what I think too it's another lifetime thank God I can uh you know lead you to have a ticket to the limit herbs and spices\n[laughter] when you're ... or ... ... ... barrels a day when the feathers and everything I Do it All right Tony man you made my nightmare thank you for each night\nKnow and that's the thing is that I did I went to the practical joker show and one of those guys on the show has a fear of cats I don't get it you know I mean I'm sure people don't get my fear of chickens\nBut I I Do I have I Am if you're at and you just heard what he said you've heard what you said about you know Jason what your blood all over us would come in and we thought they were actually that's exactly what they are they bleed everywhere and they chase you\nAnd and and and I actually someone actually sent me something once it was terrifying thing ever saw it was a chicken Parker\nAnd what it looked like it like a washing machine it was like he took the chicken and you put it like you to spin cycling what was done it was blocked and always come up with his with his feet\nIt was a chicken Parker and I'm thinking oh so that's where you know washing machines you shouldn't have chicken blockers okay I didn't want to do a whole show about chicken spot\n[noise] ah\nI just want you to know that the idea of a headless chicken monster caught on camera is the most terrifying thing floating in the waters off of Antarctica okay you know and you know this reminds me of and this is what I really want to get into tonight because it's like Halloween this\nKind of you know chicken scare me anyway and you just heard the story about you know hunting down chickens and having bleeding all over he's something of a horror film\nBut ah [noise] you know this whole idea of the headless chicken monster that is what scientists are calling and even though it does have a\nA stage name teams Z mia what name sounds like at the skin disease did you see the ...\nFloating around in the water cooler or a you know and that that is but anyways scientists\nScientists suggest\nThat a second genesis to place in its infancy where there is a fifty percent chance\nOther life forms which opposed the norm do exist\nAnd they hide within the normal biosphere\nNow I Know this is a radical hypothesis in a very high brow way of declaring that\nThere was a twilight zone seriously\nSay well this is science is limited to the study of a mirror world with different microbial\nThings in different\nPriya Demick creatures that may exist and made this turn up out of nowhere [noise] why don't we just stop with microbial sciences why don't we just stop with the you know these things that are hidden you know they ... and this is beyond the cryptic thing I mean yeah we can talk about ... men we can talk about big Ford we can talk about Chicago we can talk about all those things\nBut it's been many years\nSince\nI've discussed with my audience the reality of what can be called\nThe second genesis and it's a theory that when the earth was created\n\nThere was the story did we learn from our bibles and through science however there is this hypothesis that another genesis took place beside our own in another dimension\n\nNow from there it's proposed that there was a form of multiplicity ended the creation and the multi diversity is unseen the agents called it the underworld of course and others are called the abyss and in the TV show stranger things it was called the upside down\n\nNow the timeline of creation immigration mess that we adhere to are the ones that had been handed down through millennia each one is unique and its interpretation however it's basically the same concept\nAnd it's from these creation myth\nHear of gods and monsters were upon the earth in its infancy and some of the monsters being she passed since died out and while some have survived that are still considered predatory and dangerous\nSome like the shark and the alligators and crocodiles or all\nConsidered prehistoric and of course remember we talked about the ... megawatt on whether or not they think that Michael that don't exist but anyway recently there have been numerous reports and discoveries that indicate that there is in fact\nAn active shadow biosphere that exists in the same time and dimension as the one we see and living from day to day\nScientists regulate this strange organisms that might be alien in nature exist on the planet it isn't\nVery far jump\nTo suggest that stranger life exist on the planet and and that when you blow open the shadow biased here\nThey're lurks every monster and violence thing that no one wants to ever come in contact with\nNow when I'm Talking about is not big for it it's not the walk ness monsters it's beyond my man the fight with monsters beyond that you ...\n... been cited by many people and so far they're identified by some of their well reported trades me big puts a big hairy creature that walks around and then you have you know the mock man big red eyes and big wings and you have the Jupiter ... you know various ideas looks can be seated dog ... it sucks the blood out of you know\nShe you know it has certain traits but what if you come upon something fat ...\nNo one has seen before nobody's heard of like this had was chicken floating in the water that swims you know I look to I didn't even know what the hell was that it scared me because it looked like a headless chicken swimming in water\nWhen he was a sea cucumber all names but if you didn't know what a sea cucumber was you've been to so it's this thing on why is this thing\nSo when I'm Talking about\nAre creatures that have appeared what you've seen the do not fit the mold\nCreatures that come from somewhere [laughter] but they certainly don't belong here\nAt least so we know\nI saw something today on video I Wish I Would have said that because it was a big besides the chicken or something\nAnd I swear it was a familiar and will not matter if it was an armadillo but it wasn't it was some sort of a\nA a snake issue looking character with armored scales that was actually ripping apart the foundation of a house\nAnd somebody said oh that's one of those things I'm not going well I didn't look anything like a ... a senior and it was the second one I saw\nIt was the idea that uh you know something bizarre when he was trying to calm and someone's trying to call me and my phone to the other end of the room listen to that\n[noise] yeah [noise] nice doesn't always happen always get calls from on there [noise]\n[noise] yeah\nI'm going to turn them I found I didn't know I was charging it earlier that's why it's kinda scary in the middle of something your phone ring\nAnd just make sure it doesn't happen again anyway\nSo uh where was I okay I'm Talking about creatures that don't necessarily fit the mold and what I mean by that is is have you ever seen anything\nThat it's not a big foot not a big foot not a mouth men now ... you don't know what the hell it is and could you describe it for me\nBecause I've been thinking a lot about second genesis since I saw this creature today and its other creature too I've got to find that that the creature I'm obsessed\nBut uh [noise] I have so many also send me a pig [noise] some as in\nRock band really cool rock band I guess they wrote me I got to look this up to playing OCC was written Chilean creature like behind them and there's no reason for it to me there's no rhyme or reason to be [noise] and uh\nIn the next hour [noise] got a woman named Barbie who I met at a\nPress tour was unimpressed ... met her I was there you know to take pictures of people sign autographs and say hello to people and she comes up to me with these pictures [noise] floored me and everybody around around me wanting to get pictures they make everything stopped looking at these pictures and I have them also\nIn my article that where we can runs can be posting them on Facebook students even to the right to Facebook page and see these things [noise]\nBut once again these are things that don't fit the mold these are things that certainly don't belong here I don't know why they are [noise]\nDon't have an explanation for them\nAnd they're even more terrifying than the Boogie Man", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "Billings", "day": "23"}
