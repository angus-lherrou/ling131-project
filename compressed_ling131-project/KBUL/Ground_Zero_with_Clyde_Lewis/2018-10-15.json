and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we're just trying to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton to remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with southwest ...\nHow many jobs and talking to my Everytime I Can't I'm actually talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff\nThey make a big deal of if they have three hundred actually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent of the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nShip now I think they respect us more than they did before but now at least that's fair enough farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries they have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in during the Indians\nAnd we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a\nA piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair or we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing because because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said\nListen we are not call me back but are going to give you one more chance and in ... that's okay I'm going to actually cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nAnd they immediately helped in a plane and came over and talk to now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with them I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the\nWe'd go to China where five hundred million a year five trillion over ten we've built Shanghai we don't Beijing at some point we've got to start building America they got the new airports we don't have the new airport they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point in our money's got to come back to America\nYou're so right so China's been taken out of five hundred billion dollars you know people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President and she said we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been no effect not what people don't say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because it's at twenty five percent so we're taking in billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs\nNow some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the products here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it so China\nHas been looked China's the biggest civil mall by far probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost over the last few years an average of

the Democrats on this late and the Democrats owned slaves and the Republicans tried to free them\nAnd then after the war the Democrats Lynch blacks and the Republicans tried to save them and now here we are in twenty Eighteen the Democratic party has destroyed African Americans and the Republicans like Donald Trump Donald Trump is saving them but but but the media doesn't cover that why do they\nKnow they don't and I'm very upset because July this year I went to the sister who has cable and I heard or read court a man on Iran go early and and I had a\n... a woman in front of her Thirteen butter on dragged her into the woods and that and tell her I Would not report that on the news you know that was a black cat oh I Know now that we as a lay audience that are killing Americans

nonetheless a on a friday night a couple of nights ago he was in my hometown Arab Cincinnati\nAnd he got a hold of me on a on a four or five days at a time and ask about what's available to stop it and say hello when he's in town when the president asked you to do something especially one who's as charismatic as consequential as President Trump forty five actually have no problem doing it at some things schedule friday night said to heck with it\nI Want to be with the president and he's a warm carrying engaging person the way or the way it works the rope line are private time together our discussion\n... was fabulous and a and I'm going to share that the interview with you here coming up in about five or six minutes\nAnd I think you're going to find it very good because you get you're going to get a sense of the man and what he what lies ahead what the interview today I think tonight on sixty minutes I thought was ridiculous Leslie stall did a horrible lousy job I think my time with the president a couple of nights ago was much better\nSo I'm an air that interview or in a few minutes and the president also extremely complimentary things to say about me for which I'm most appreciative and also if it wasn't for I think Sean Hannity and my\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been\nBrutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed\nHow can we how can we take from the United states so the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions that come in during the onions\nAnd we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it so we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a\nA piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair or we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away\nAnd then ah with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we are not call me back but I'm going to give you one more chance and in ... that's okay I'm going to tax the cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right\nAnd they immediately have a plan and came over and talk to now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with them I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the\nRebuilding China where five hundred million a year five trillion over ten we filled Shanghai we built Beijing at some point we've got to start building America they got the new airports we don't have the new airports they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point in our money's got to come back to America\nYou're so right so China's been taken out of five hundred billion dollars you know people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President she said we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've now put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been no effect you know what people don't say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because it's at twenty five percent so we're taking in billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists\nThey're going to start building these plants here to make the products here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it so China\nHas been like China is the biggest civil mall by far probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost over the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade we lose with everybody those days are over\nBill
