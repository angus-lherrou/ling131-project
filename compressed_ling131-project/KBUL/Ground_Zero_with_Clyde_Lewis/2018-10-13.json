that your hair returning with us Steve days pat gray a stew or if deeper gear or executive producer and of course my charming self\nUh we're talking about are the Democrats in what they have done this week just with Hillary Clinton coming out and saying you can't have a civil conversation with these people\nI don't know who these people are that these people used to be a sign of racism uh but you can't talk about these people are and then Eric Holder in the week\nIn a protester ... um we have Eric Holder saying a kick 'em when they're down\nIs is the is this the\nOr is this the beginning of the end for the Democrats or is this the end of the beginning\n... ah um I I Hope it's the beginning of the end\nBecause um I I think most Americans with the ... with many sensibility left in them\nOr are being turned off by the Democrats right now I I think they've you know we talked about this many times I think maybe now they have overplay their hand we thought maybe that would have happened a year or two or three or four a bill but um I think after the Kavanaugh hearings an all that's going on now with disability thing\nThat they're completely uh uh issuing I think I think people have had enough of them\nSo is it important for us to change as I say I think people have had enough of the Democrats because of that blanket people who vote Democrat think wait I'm a Democrat or is it better to say I think people have enough of this leftist no movement\nI I think it's the latter mhm and I think that um you're you're watching I Know it's a popular term in another context these days but you're watching a transition happen\nAnd you know we kind of pretended as if on the right that just surrendering I'm America's youth ministry known as our education system to cultural Marxist for forty years um wasn't good to have any repercussions whatsoever\nAnd now you're watching the first fruits of that harvest are coming home to roost at the moment\nThere's nothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period who himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows this history very well\nWhen he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in a New Testament world and Romans one where he's when he's when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff that would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around I I think we do bad stuff\nBecause we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of been forces itself and so you're dealing with people that with the wind and the and the New Testament there when you exchange the truth for a ally so there's one big macro truth in in the universe\nAnd there's a lot but there's lots of eyes right or to buy supplies so when you change that truth for a while you're given over to a database to mine and that's what you're talking about and I go back you know one of my favorite movie ranch when I was a kid and it's probably a terribly placed analogy\nBut Donald presence rant and the first Halloween movie about Michael Meyers can't be killed it can't be stopped they can't be reason with right when he's going off about him and when he was like in the insane asylum\nThat's what you're dealing with here there is no talking look at the guy who ... who kicked drop kick the woman in Canada when he's wearing a pen a gram around his neck you to go look at his picture closely okay I mean that's just self awareness is dead in your face kind of stuff look at the way he talks to her piece really polite he's asking her what she thinks\nHe's totally Lou city's not craze he not raving roving mob okay and then when she said when she when she refuses to ... to the same idol that he is all he is worshipping the total countenance changes and he dropped kicks or look at this her own a woman from Hawaii that's on TV all the time now\nI mean her counting the way she looks she looks like when you take your bride to to Hawaii for a vacation or a honeymoon and you get off the plane she's there with a plate of sweet rolls ready to welcome you to the island she looks like the sweetest oh woman doesn't she then she starts talking about politics mad and\nShe opens her mouth and it's rooted vibe or stuff comes out yeah this is this is this is a nuisance sanity\nThat culture produce with I ...

percent I don't know if it's a little more now maybe it's less depending on\nWhat propaganda you\nYou decide to take him which will be this movie first man and I say it's fan\nFiction because it is I Believe it I Believe that when you see this film it's going to be a lot of fan fiction it's not going to be based on reality hell even the uh even the flag being planted in the lunar soil is nine you'll be depicted in this bill\nWhich has got a lot of people pissed off say this is not a patriotic found the whole patriotic achievement was planning on the moon how dare you not put the American fight even Buzz Aldrin was pissed\nBut the older now and he said what the hell no American flag and the and the and the regular last what kind of crap possess\nI'm an American I'm an American\nWe put the flag and ... and I know why they didn't put the flag\nIn the moon on a on the moon in this movie because they wanted they don't want to piss off the Chinese investors Hollywood's bought out by the Chinese and why and what we want to remove the American flag with the most important thing is that well there's plenty of flags on the astronauts coaches plenty of flags on the rockets there's plenty of ... okay sure\nWhat that moment in time where they put the American flag in the soil is you know it's I caught it gets kind of like\nIt's the same thing as as as having the soldiers putting the flag up at ... at the same thing as a fire fireman putting a flag up at nine eleven the the ground zero it's like\nBut you know but they've they've written it out and um\nI Know this is going to boost the interest again in space travel but you know when you look back at some of the movies that they made before a Hollywood is actually\nIn a lot of cases they been Mooney mirror America I mean does anybody remember the Nineteen Seventy one James Bond film diamonds Are Forever\nYeah in that film James Bond Sean Connery one of my favorite bonds or Sean Connery stumbled onto a moonscape set\nSo they're staging the moon landing on this moonscape set and James Bond breaks in the movie set in runs through the uh the whole set up\nRuining what they're trying to do if you remember that see I I couldn't believe it I mean that was like what Nineteen Seventy one how bowls of them in Nineteen Seventy one you know we were just pressure on the moon and already somebody in a ... on the set of diamonds Are Forever decided they decided that they really\nPut James Bond on the moon send making it looked like he broke in [noise] [laughter] but I kept recording one that was Nineteen Seventy eight right [noise]\nUh that's where NASA supposedly fake the landing on Mars [noise]\nOther uh other lives about the moon and uh it\nWas just me you know what if it was just saying what if it's not that I believed it totally I just had doubts\nSo having doubts I decided well I have lived out back and say okay I Want to present this to people and say oh man that was the ugliest thing I'd Jim overt\nFrom NASA right we are dirty letter I had\nI just thought what the hell of a gun you know what ... what did I Do\nSee at the time I was young and I didn't care the fact well or whatever you know now I'm older I care a lot about you know it was his views and [laughter] I just because I Love talking to people back then it was a man I'm just a young kid I don't care and then you know of course I had my cup it's when I had my\nCar blown to pieces by a pitcher and my beef but you know as I grew out of that really damn quick\nAnd decided I Would be a little bit more open a little more balanced but of course we have\nFox TV doing the special conspiracy theory did we land on the moon I started to see a pattern here and thinking what's going on then came by several\nAnd maybe you know several as he's this film maker is about as old as I Am actually he he was like what I call him he wanted to fly out to Oregon because he he\nSaid all just fly out to Oregon and be on your show I said but it's just a local show the time it was local item to I don't think I was on national the time I was on national\nNo not after two thousand one and I think that he wrote a he he did this a movie called a funny thing happened on the way to the moon\nAnd um and so when he did it uh I thought it was interesting cake and I wanted to talk to them about it he was ready to fly to Portland talk to me and I told no no no no no but if you remember Martin several he was the guy that ah\nPortland talk to me and I tell them no no no no no but if you remember ... several he was the guy that ah went around with ... with the Bible and he got into Buzz Aldrin space and he said I Want you to swear on and off it but you walked on the moon\nAnd altering when touched the Bible you see or a fraud that you're a liar you're a coward you're ... you're a thief and Buzz Aldrin wet\nFood punched him right in the face I Am a jock connected and ah it was then that I realized that the whole you know moon debate but then we went on the moon was literally and metaphorically getting a black guy and so I backed off for a while\nAnd even though I still had my doubts about the first moon landing there seemed to be some talk about going into the moon again and I thought I thank God I don't have to talk about this any more it was really ... is that if you look at you know some of the things uh\nIf you look at some of the things about me in some you know a biography of somebody sides to write about me if it's not about me being in a punk band and being an interior designer\nAh people write and say that I'm I'm a moon hoax a enthusiasts are on the moon hoax or ... I I'm a proponent of the moon hooks theory or I don't know if a\nProponent of the moon hopes theory but I have a person who has doubts and I've always had doubts and I think one of the things Penn Jillette had a had a radio show after you did the Showtime special it was a guy that came on and and kind of blew his mind a bit because you know of course Penn Jillette said it's all BS but then there was a show where Penn Jillette was kind of like going ooh\nNever thought about that never thought about that so\nEven though I still have my doubts about the first moon landing there seem to be some talk about going to the moon again and I was really exciting two thousand for\nPresident George W. Bush started the conversation about putting men back on the moon\nIn twenty Fifteen he said we should be able to do this by twenty Fifteen that's our goal he said that NASA adjusted new spacecraft to crush it was called the crew exploration vehicle by two thousand eight and to conduct the first manned mission\nNo later than twenty fourteen four years after the deadline and we still have and send them back to the moon if you remember during the inauguration parade of President Obama there was a new moon vehicle\nThey were driving through the parade and you know of course Michelle Obama said something under a breath and they didn't catch it but I Wish you know a bad liberating would have gotten it because it just seems to me that she said something really you know derogatory about you know this this vehicle and\nWe kept we kept hearing that the goal was going to be moved to twenty twenty ... twenty Fifteen twenty twenty two thousand nine we were told the NASA was carrying out of experiments to find water on the moon\nAnd they did this in order to facilitate the possibility of a moon base but that was ally okay simply ally no matter how many people would scream than the accusation was part of a conspiracy theory or that they're saying that the the mission was a lie it was becoming quite clear\nThat the mission was slated protests MySpace weapon it was space weapons technology they wanted to test on the moon had nothing to do with finding water\nTo put on and they actually put up a moon base what happened is NASA launched\nIt was said to be the first moon launch in ten years in two thousand nine first moon launching ten years the ... what they did is they set up a pair of on that man's science probes\nThat we're supposed to help determine where astronauts could land in colonizing the years to come Nasser received over five hundred million dollars\nFor something called the LCROSS mission LCROSS it was also a mission that was supposed to survey and map areas\nFor something called the LCROSS mission LCROSS\nIt was also a mission that was supposed to survey and map areas of the moon and then a senator rocket will be intentionally crashed into the moon's surface at twice the speed of the bullet and it was supposed to blow up at six miles crater and then before it would be cry\nOr wait for the whole rocket would crash there would be another spacecraft Calais shepherding craft and that would then determine if there was potential or potential ice particulates and the moon debris plume so they wanted to measure water in the moon degree and the moon ah debris plume ice particles to see if there was any water they could use to or\nPerhaps put a\nMoon base there while the liftoff occurred just one month and two days shy\nOf the ... anniversary of alleged first moon landing and the LCROSS mission was suspicious from the getting ... and as we prepared for the impact or others began to bring\nA they're they're they're bringing them some inconsistencies about the situation is very interesting\nFacts they were exposed to a lot of lies about this LCROSS mission some of them I I actually heard on the Howard Stern show which I thought was interesting that they even Howard Stern was saying or\nThey're going to blow up the earth above the mainland and they were saying you know and of course there were all laughing now they're going to blow up the ... they're going to do is to send a rocket to the moon and blow up a crater and\nLie upon lie upon live on line and um\nSo what was really interesting about the LCROSS mission NASA claimed the LCROSS mission was supposed to map out the moon for landing sites for new moon missions before the Apollo missions though there were orbiter set out to the moon and in Nineteen Ninety four\nHave you remember the Clementine was launched between February twenty six and April twenty second Nineteen Ninety four Clementine was able to deliver more than one point eight million digital images of the moon back to ground control including the ... satellite ground tracking station located in Maryland\nYou know these images that they got more quickly accessible to the general public via the Internet and one scientist reviewed the data from Clementine\nThey already found the possible existence of ice within some of the moon's graders so they knew that ice was their\nClementine it already told them about it Nineteen Ninety four so why do they have to make up the lie and say we're going to slam something in the end of the moon so we can see that as a ... there's ice it just doesn't make sense I mean think about it in two thousand nine NASA had just celebrated the ... anniversary of the moon landing and for some\nReason was not aware of the moon's topography with all the men missions enormously they've successfully completed doesn't\nMake any sense and with all the the mapping doesn't make any sense they they found ice on the moon long before they get to have a rocket do it for them in two thousand nine\nNASA was also a big about how fast the rockets would reach orbit around the moon the LCROSS rockets according to press releases\nWe're supposed to take a week to ten days to reach the moon\nNow the Apollo missions took three days and each mission at various times Powell eight to twenty hours to complete\nUm [noise] there was ten million or been\nTo that that's the ... uh basically are there two hours\nFor orbit average time two hours for orbit around the moon that's Apollo eight\nTwenty hours to complete ten moon orbits which is about two hours per orbit but yeah it took ten days when to sell cross rocket to get to the moon transferring the data that the other missions results also a time space from the moon to\nIt [laughter] it was just a public twelve ... twelve for example ... of how it twelve got to the moon in twenty six point five hours\nSeem took Seventy six hours it takes the space shuttle sixty six hours to reach the IOC says I don't want to ... are we going about a hundred and eighty five miles an hour\nOf beer\nSo I'm I'm just trying I mean maybe I'm about a map of thinking about that ten days to get to the moon will cross Apollo eight to twenty hours to complete ten moon orbits which you could do about two ... two hours from orbit\nAnd then you see the transference of data ... got to the moon twenty six point five opposed Seventeen Seventy six and a space shuttle take sixty six hours to reach the eye as that's going a hundred and eighty five miles movie or\n\n... needless to say the LCROSS mission was a failure
