issue that has me a puppet and rage tonight is the media coverage of the death\nOf ... and he wasn't a ... it wasn't a journalist he was an occasional columnist he wasn't an employer Washington Post he was an American\nAnd so let you and I assume for the sake of argument which the Saudis at this point more or less have confirmed that an unsuspecting Jamal ... walked into a Saudi a consulate in Istanbul, Turkey it's them both turkey to be tortured and killed over seven minute period\nAnd that's bad not good but\nThose things happen in that part of the world all the time if you steal something you chop off your hands men and women are hand or you source to chop their heads off on a regular basis the woman who commits adultery stoned to death in the public square\nNasty violence is happening all the time and that part of the world according to CNN especially we're now supposed to get twisted into knots\nAnd drop our support of the president didn't want to blow up America's relationship with Saudi Arabia which could cost us a half a trillion dollars now Saudi Arabia has a relationship with Israel as a counterbalance against Iran ... drop all that because a Saudi Arabian was killed in Turkey\nI don't get it I don't understand and the other thing\nThe moral outrage felt by CNN is not shared by them when a police officer is killed for example\nThe officer Jason Alice was killed in May of ah twenty uh Thirteen about five years ago his killer is not been apprehended CNN did not even report is death\nThis year in America about one hundred cops are going to be killed the great majority of the perpetrators will be located but on the other hand some what I'll be located\nYou mean to tell me that the death of ... ... cars show geek has more impacted my life and then the death of a police officer or the death of a truck driver or the murder of a college student in Iowa\nOr a school teacher or a child innocent kids or kidnapped and raped in America all the time young black men about seven hundred will be gone down in the south side of Chicago women are raped and brutalized tortured on a regular basis\n... inside of America much less in other parts of the world so why is the media focusing on a murder and turkey\nBecause if it's a journalist excuse me ... show was not a journalist there was a part time contributor to the Washington Post but even if he was quote a journalist\nDoes that have more value to me that a police officer or someone to someone I American soldier killed absolutely not\nYou know I I I'm\nWaiting for the outrage from CNN about forty Mexican journalist murdered in the past two years in Mexico by drug cartels have you heard about any of their you know who they are\nTo me because show narrative as a hustle it's fake news it's a ploy used to attack Donald J Trump to undermine his Middle East policy which is works so well\nUm to undermine his Middle East policy which is works so well they're exploring his death and weaponize is death as a cudgel against the Trump stir that's what's going on\nI guarantee you he his wife has no more value than a truck drivers lie for cops life a soldier's life or waitresses why for coal miners life a taxi drivers life all the might be murdered brutally tortured happens all the time\nIn America and elsewhere so why is the death of a Saudi Arabian in Turkey big news\nBecause the media wants to use that as a club against the president and his Middle East policy and I think there's those at CNN and mainstream media that do not do not like the fact that Israel now has a friend in Saudi Arabia\nThey don't like that and I thought the half million Syrians killed by Iran and by Russia by barrel bombs any of those lives have meaning to CNN no because they cannot be used as a weapon against this president they want to act as if\nWhen Trump says bad things about journalist so Maui indirectly cause the death of ... in Turkey who believes is crap\nIt's unbelievable but let's continue on\nThe line becomes available to never does one eight six six six or seven seven three three seven the thing is\nTonight if we can focus on illegal migrants swelling to ten thousand found to reach the U.S supported by the Democratic party incentivize rather mainstream media and the fact that ... if it was my father if he was my brother\nI'd be outrage at is that that was ... it should not have died\nSaudi Arabian students all the time Syrians Iranians Iraqis inside of America there are several hundred black guys killed every year in Chicago and one hundred dead cops can you name one cop killed in America this year give me the name and your mind ... give me the name of one cup right now\nI bet you can't\nBecause I made it uncovered you mean Jamal could show the a Saudi Arabian killed in Turkey is more important to us that a brave police officer who gave his life\nIs that what CNN believes the answer is yes\nPlus services African Business conference that Obama held\nFor fifty African leaders and I think that Bailey male newspaper looked at it and it was like whoa gallery of human rights violators and corrupt officials but you know the media like CNN and MSNBC and NPR they just falling over how the great or bomber was reaching out to Africa\nNot looking at the human rights background of this desk part\nFortress represent leaders so the whole thing is sick\nYou know and and you went over that quickly but use Pakistan had a leader\nWho would boil alive his political opponents and while that was going on Obama and Hillary reports the floating around with this guy and the media that that was no big deal right there boil alive your political opponents that's okay\nBecause Obama had the relationship and Hillary Heather relationship and use baggage than the media didn't cover that are all did they\nKnow and you know it's funny there are people on NPR that work to our two a two hour show every week and and they make\nThree hundred thousand dollars plus she's here now see that's fine except I don't want to subsidize it you know ... you know why should we pay for NPR PBS slut like Facebook and Google and Microsoft Starbucks and Amazon\nLet them pay for it or people that like it in San Francisco or Faust and for what is the average ... horrible taxpayer Haftar subsidized in the yard that the clowns they have one that that station on a regular basis work their little fire as a propaganda\nAnd then there's hundreds hundreds of rent their ears in thousand radio stations those five hundred television stations but we taxpayers subsidize PBS and NPR for what reason what what's the purpose is because they're left wing liberal Democrats and the Republican Party has no ... that's why it's done\nRight while I'm not for killing people but I mean he'll know works you know like it's not a nice\nAfter utopian world is like brick set a in a ... human life is very cheap around the world and you you know but people who pick and choose their atrocities and there does spots or should be condemned and and that's the the media thank you\nAnd your great thank you for your call let's go to Jim in Chicago the belly of the beast gym in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Jim go ahead\n[noise] things are just to let you know I uh I have a home in San Pedro Sula Honduras [laughter] and I'm also a resident of the country and I'm totally opposed to what's growing up going on\nAnd tell me you spent time in Honduras talking about the circumstances\nYou know it is it's it's kinda like you know because if you live in Chicago you can say I live in Chicago and all you hear about from people a lot of other places they ... they're talking about Al Capone about violence but it's like any section you know there's a lot of wonderful places there sure and there's a lot of civilian areas however\n[noise] part of the problem is the government there doesn't do things well they think like Obama they just want to raise taxes\nFor example if you go to a restaurant order food it's Fifteen Percent sales tax on food and if you order like a like a drink it's Eighteen percent tax for a drink at a restaurant you know and plus the value of the ... has been sliding to the dollar is up to twenty four limbs per dollar used to be just a few years ago it was like twenty\nOr June ... is the government democratically elected wanted\n[noise] well this last election there was a big uh uh this name as is his initials or jail wage\nBecause he used to be before Honduras just had one term for four years and then when the bomb was president he somehow was able to get the legislature to make a two terms and people didn't like that and there was a lot of writing in the streets in fact they closed on uh they're they're called the ... they're called welders\nAnd what they did is they closed down all the highways and stuff so people couldn't get to the airport and actually suspended flights in San Pedro a couple of times because of that [noise] and and what they did this last time he'll they have these these like toll booth leaving the city there's three ... three major toll booths [noise]\nUh and they they just burn them out they just destroyed the buildings and the toll booths were no longer collecting tolls and that's a that's a major hit [noise] you know and and that's that's just it's amazing when I was down there the one time I couldn't actually get home I had to wait for two days\nAnd you could hear the gunfire in the background 'cause San Pedro was like a huge valley surrounded by mountains\nOr do you do you want to live for the average Honduran oh what's it like well\nIf you have money you do well if you're poor you don't want to be there because there is no public assistance to the public hospitals are Laden with cockroaches [noise] but you know there's a lot of beautiful restaurants there the food is wonderful\nYou know it's it's so it's like it's mixed\nYou know I've been going there for thirty something years in fact my ex wife I'm a his from there and that was part of the trash and I went there and I have two daughters with her they're teenagers now and I'm Still good with my my in laws and things it's nice but you know you got to be careful you don't want to do bad business deal with anybody because it's a good chance we can get hurt\nYou know now you said you're again Honduran Guatemalans El Salvador and Nicaragua is coming to America while you were getting\nWell it doesn't serve a purpose you know the same energy and you see a lot of this has been funded by these left us you know George Soros types and and you know they should spend the same energy resource to try to fix what's wrong in their own\nGovernments stand your dream fix your own country while he's blind leading the best and the brightest might be leaving you leave behind those who can't function so it really in the long term mental and that's what\nHappens a lot of people with means a lot of Hondurans they should have gone to Spain\nAnd a lot of them come illegally here you know in fact I hate to say it's one of my good friends actually got killed about five years ago he was involved in a bad car deal the transaction [noise] and he got off right they got killed right before Christmas\nSo you know going in and you get a gun kill somebody\nYeah and his brother actually had a tourist season he\nLeft his you know he's been in California for the last five years he ... he gotta you're going to get married is gonna try to get his paper view that these are the marriage so a lot of people with resources have left wing come over here and then try to stay here you know by getting married he was doing something else to become legal\nRight now it's it's a big problem you know also\nDown there you know their energy consumption they keep raising the price for a for electricity it's all these little ...\nIt's it's a big problem he also down there you know their energy consumption they keep raising the price for for electricity it's all diesel powered a generation it's not efficient as expensive and they keep raising the price of energy [laughter] you know my water bill's gone up till like fifty percent of the last four or five years\nSo it's a broken society nothing's working and it's getting worse it's\nNothing but it could be a better manage just put it that way\nWell who's doing the ... is that a military democratically elected it doesn't matter and Honduras\nWell the president was actually reelected the second time but a lot of people thought he stole the election that's why there's a lot of writing the streets and that's why they had these strikes [noise] you know\nBut that's all kind of died down now but the problem is you know they keep raising the prices of everything [noise] so if you're if you're stuck down there and you're not you don't have a job where you can be tied into Dallas those big things keep getting out of sight it's just like that as well\nNo it's well jeez but it's the whole thing with inflation and try to keep up with stuff\nToys there's about thirty eight forty million people who live in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Nicaragua about thirty five to forty million how many would come to America given a choice and the Democrats got in charge and a complete open borders how many would come\nBy privacy mall [laughter] all of them when they're forty million right that would come [noise]\nBut you know it's it's funny because there's also a lot of there's a lot of a love for American ... stores like research you'll see an American flag you'll sit on the wall place there is so they're in fact I was even that does is getting off the site or a little bit I was thinking it would be good to make ... the first state of\nYou know like oh my God [laughter] the reason why is because people if we if we can come and run their country and get rid of look at\nIt with people would jump to that and they would be more patriotic\nThan it is I Jim

I came here I did everything legally I'm looking out here I'm like I might as well to even think of it it might have been faster to do it that way but no\nWe want to have policies and now that I'm here I can I can talk freely I can enjoy the free market system\nOr the western culture western civilization that really built something here and if you're wearing the idea that socialism if you do the math on his social does not work\nThey point to the Scandinavian countries of the holy that's working because we subsidize their military we all know that American military it's which is what she can no fault of their taxes or stroll yard and I can feel it here in Connecticut\nKeeping at a quote from their taxes or stroll young and I can feel it here in Connecticut\nOh no question there the reasons given him a country where\nIt's a capitalistic parts works in the socially toward doesn't and then the other reason is they have no military we spent about eight hundred billion dollars a year in the military to protect them and they spend nothing\nAnd that's why they're going to have ramping socialism socialism doesn't work in Venezuela or Cuba it doesn't work in the Scandinavian countries ultimately you run out of the ability to spend other people's money in Milton Friedman one the great signals of all time about Thirty years ago that you cannot have\nA first world country and open borders next to a grinding third world poverty eventually it'll blend together in old take down the first one of the country America will be taken down if millions of Central Americans who are poorly educated with no skills that we need\nCome airing collapses social welfare state and overrun the hospitals in the schools in the prison America cannot long succeed it's the failure of our country\nAnd it's amazing because when I come here and I see the fact that America launched some some some sovereignty\nI can respect that there is something that go on strike you as I come from Niger and the idea of some of them can never work there because it's a crime if they are we have and and the thing is everyone in the socialist sort of a society we believe this utopian thing you can you can work out no I'm Sorry human nature\n... plus works on human nature to drive the free market if you look at when um the fact that capitalism has brought half has cut global poverty in half and twelve years and sort of it is by the un standards and my twenty thirty\nBecause the capital is it's it's it's really a problem you can fire it's really probably the ... and it does appear in Connecticut I'm trying to get I I think education is the key\n'cause if if I'm able to tell people hey listen you don't like them but it will get the results I mean I live in an apartment it's the lowest in history I I'm like\nHow he got to look at Bill Clinton was in the ad for high end President Obama's record high welfare recipients and now Trump is like businesses small businesses up for a hundred percent um I'm\nI'm just looking at the numbers here and I'm like okay he wasn't called racist until he started running I'm like I'm looking at that you'll be I'm looking at what they're offering and they're offering actual things that can help oh where's socialism has this idea that just never just never panned out\nAnd ... and I'm ready to call it makes me a libertarian Iran call him where the Trump stir in New York City\nFor twenty Thirty years received every award then Al Sharpton and could give him at every award Jesse Jackson could give him he he was a humanitarian he was a civil rights act and all of a son who's running for the presidency certainly the aged Seventy becomes a racist\nOr brain I'm like well this is in a little tired of life he was caught everybody here we have left to Hamad hourly and Rosa Parks with the um winning the parents\nReally frankly he was a good friend he knows where he was a great friend I'm older and he gave money to Chuck Schumer he gave money to Hillary Clinton suddenly he becomes a beat they become it's ridiculous\nLasso apso and it's it's good to know that if if we can bridge the divide and like honestly the Democrats right now\nThey have such a stranglehold on the black community for no reason at age\nIf we can if we will get over that if we if we can because like for example to do is they had horrible historic event they walk through that the struggle to Japanese internment camps they ... through the U.S some reason I think it's because I'm immigrants so it's not exactly\nThe Japanese and how they want to leave them [noise] because I'm an immigrant so it's something that was a Coltrane and it's I mean if you go through the public schools I went to school\nBut they never talk about a hundred million in the comments that history just managers and and I think education is the key I definitely do\nWell ... we got to go but I Want you to stay alert stay alive keep preaching the faith in Connecticut it's one of the parts of the country that badly needs the shot of capitalism or conservatism\nThe worst run states in America are controlled by the Democratic party and the best run states in America are controlled by the Republican Party but thanks for your call let's continue with more\nI'm not for the call in or to Corey Lewandowski urine about five minutes see was the campaign manager for Donald Trump for like a year and a half\nAnd I'm going to ask him about the immigration crisis when I look at the Drudge Report tonight much stimuli call hills breaking loose and ABC and NBC and CNN thinks this is a vehicle they're going to drive for the next two weeks in two days to bring down the Republicans in Congress\nAnd I say oh contrary Ramon forever I Believe\nThe three reasons Trump got elected was number one the economy number two immigration number three federal judges has performed magnificently and all three areas\nAnd and I think this is the October surprise that will sink the Democratic party come or the next sixteen days let's continue with more of a line becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven coming up in about five minutes from Corey Lewandowski top of the next hour we have Kevin ... near the blacks fair\nIt it would be front page news for a week on and that rap the or the country artist\nWould have had his life probably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her\nNew you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was\nNo it was appropriate because she was an adult\nHe was president of the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the Congress Donald Trump had done that with during the media would be saying\nOh yeah they would give them an excuse drawn away and I'm sure the media was saying well she's an adult no big deal I mean the double standards amazing\nHas always been that way but the American people have seen through it and as you've referenced as it relates to Brett those Ninety two percent\nOf the media coverage of this president negative now I Would accept that if we were in the middle of twenty five percent unemployment a national crisis all over the place nobody working and the country moving in the wrong direction growing at point zero zero percent\nI Would expect that but we're not we are we are now back up on top where the most competitive country in the world again\nFor the first time in ten years and there is no credit for what the president's done let alone but twenty Americans who've been held hostage in other countries that he got returned not one plane loads of cash to our palette loads of money but on his own sharing went on to get these people back\nYou know you saw the pastor come back just a week or so ago and\nYou know that would make it was a blip on the radar screen the president has gotten twenty Americans either in North Korea or an Egypt or wherever they have been home that's part of his job and he gets no credit for that but in the mainstream media Brock Obama would have been in line for another Nobel Peace prize\nWell let's talk a little bit about what's happening in Honduras in Guatemala there's\nAt least three thousand the numbers are growing coming from a Honduras through Guatemala into Mexico and the mainstream media hates this kind of an issue percolating\nA little over two weeks from ... from the election because it reminds the American people one of the main reasons Trump was elected was to curtail illegal migration\nFrom Central America and Mexico into our country there's a I like Google this information there is a hundred and fifty million Mexicans Guatemalans Hondurans in El Salvador and hundred and fifty million now like to come to America if you throw in Venezuela and Colombia maybe Peru\nA Europe wide ... we're talking to a hundred and fifty million\nOr central and south Americans would love to come to America at what point is enough is enough and the mainstream media does not want to call it illegal immigration they talk about refugee status they talk about the factors moms and dads and children there in strollers\nHowever uh four or five months ago I fell off the couch one nine I'm watching sixty minutes and sixty minutes did a report on the reality of our southern border hundreds of dead bodies are found and the deserts of ...\nDiminish and sixty minutes did a report on the reality of our southern border\nHundreds of dead bodies are found and the deserts of northern Mexico because men are killed because they will become drug meals and that when these individuals\nPaying MS Thirteen literally millions of dollars to transport them from Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Mexico into America when this is funding and fueling MS Thirteen dries to make literally hundreds of millions of dollars\nEvery county so to speak they passed through in Mexico has a drug war order and somebody in charge of that county and that men have got to pay with money and women have to pay their bodies and sixty minutes made the point that the majority of young girls and women are raped on the way from Central America\nTo to the United states and when it's reported which is not done by the mainstream media that this is an extremely dangerous route that men are murdered and that women are raped and brutalized all the way up Fifteen hundred miles and then when they get a new American\nThat they're they're not released many times you go work in a bra stolen on an Austin you go to Baton Rouge and working abroad or if you're a man\nYou stand on street corners to sell drugs which is paying back your transit seat there there was one report on sixty minutes about the reality of what the Democratic Party's encouraging and it was disgusting why don't we have more media coverage Corey Lewandowski campaign manager for some of the reality\nOf what happens to the men and women incentivized to come to this country because what happens to them and so despicable that the Democratic party should be held accountable for some of this why does the media cover it objectively\nImmediate doesn't want to tell the real story they want to pretend that the only people who were coming to this country the porn impoverished that are seeking asylum and and look we're the greatest\nCountry in the world and not only do they to hundred and fifty million people from South and Central America want to come here people from all over the world who want to come here but we're not a country if we can't control our borders Ronald Reagan said it you know Thirty years ago we are the greatest country in the world than the greatest privilege we can get somebody to make them a citizen\nAnd there is a way to do that but just coming in and storming the borders doesn't work but your point is much more important what takes place with these people and they make this track from Honduras to Mexico and ultimately up\nTo the U.S border is\nThey did a sting display of gangs that take advantage of these people they raped women they kill them and and you're exactly right\nEven if they have the opportunity to make it into our country illegally people aren't free and we have to do something about human trafficking we have to make sure that doesn't continue the best way to do that is you're building a wall on the southern border and you say it you make it to the United states you will not make it into our country and\nThey were they process to come here and you follow the process we're a nation of laws and what we do as a Republican Party has to make sure that the immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have all the tools necessary to apprehend people coming across the border illegally\nUnlike the Democrats want to defund and illegitimate eyes the men and women who serve in ice everyday that protect us from the animals of MS Thirteen and those gangs\nCorey Lewandowski wide or the Democrats want this because there can be no change in the law\nUntil ten or so United States senators who are Democrats agree to the change which is build a wall brings him sanity I think we need temporary workers to come and go when you come you or do we know who you are ... we have a big wall with lots of doors in it and every legitimate person that wants to come here to\nTo work whatever ought to be able to do it\nIs that what we do a lemonade drug a heroin and math in Cincinnati in Austin in Tampa in Milwaukee by by doing it makes it more difficult for drugs to come in more difficult for him is Thirteen what is the real reason the Democratic party does not one controller southern border\nCould be because they love the political issue and they don't want to resolve\nThe issue look this president went out and say you give me the money for the wall and all the people that are here through no fault of their own which arguably called the dream where they came in through no fault of their own I Will give them the president said a pathway to citizenship and that was a long way to go for conservatives to be very honest with you there was a lot of consternation when he made that statement\nBut he gave the Democrats exactly what they've argued they wanted for a long time and they said no we're not going to give that to they want to have the political football they want to continue to make sure that the people are coming across the border illegally and going to\nSanctuary cities and centuries states have the opportunity to vote we now see this in Texas and we've seen in other places that they are targeting individuals who are not us citizens and asking them to go and vote and they they are bought\nAnd sold by the Democratic party those illegal immigrants coming in here and they want to keep that flow to continue it doesn't make sense to me is our first obligation is to the people in this country to make sure they are safe and secure and we\nAbsolutely need immigration there are jobs that we need them to come and fill on a temporary basis\nBut you're exactly right you come through the system your check you are authorized to come in you pay whatever fair share it is there is either vacation and then when your job is done you go back to your country and that's how it works that that was always work and we just need to do a better job enforcing that\nCorey Lewandowski Leslie there's been some speculation that a Hillary Clinton\nWho's making a run and twenty twenty you know I think Hillary Clinton doing a great job as first lady she was a wonderful United States senator she was a fabulous secretary's day and she was a wonderful candidates for the Democratic party in twenty sixteen I Would encourage you to run I Would help her get signatures maybe raised money for\nWould you encourage Hillary Clinton to become the Democratic party standard standard bearer in twenty twenty would you do a great job\nOh we love this look hundred and thirty two electoral votes two years ago that number is only going down she would be up for the greatest loss of an election since Ronald Reagan's re election effort when he destroyed his opponent and I think Donald Trump would end up with north of four hundred and\n... you have to remember he beat Donald Trump\nBeat her by Seventy four electoral votes and what your listeners remember is with it and when they woke up on

southern Mexico heading toward the United states after making his so called and run around Mexican agents who briefly block them\nThey're getting help but every term from sympathetic Mexicans offering food water and closing the coverage of our media indicates that uh they're joining it up against the Trump stir Armenia believes that somehow that this event with tens of thousands\nOf individuals coming from those violent countries on earth\nIs a net negative for the president I Do not believe that\nI think the main reason that Trump won the presidency and twenty sixteen and that Republicans will keep the house and when to keep the house and the Senate in about two weeks will be the fact that this immigration issue is you want to remind Americans what's at stake in this election\nAnd uh the coverage tonight on the nightly news and tomorrow or Monday Tuesday Wednesday going to be it's the same is going to be terribly negative\nTowards Trump sympathetic toward individuals largely young males the from the most violent countries on her [noise]\nAnd there are a number of examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so\nIf the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called edition forward it to they have to have the strength\nOf character development and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agencies [noise] then we can actually began to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time did not hot summer in Philadelphia and Seventeen eighty seven\nArticle one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instrument Talladega government because of the best reflects the will of the people\nIn reality at least for the past two years it was perceived Congress is number one\nIt was perceived the president's number two and they and the court system is number three in reality number one is not the Congress one might say it's the presidency is the most powerful number two is the current number three is the Congress the Congress\nIs feckless foolish any relevant and and so what were the founding fathers day if they were transported from Seventeen Ninety seven to twenty Eighteen and October twenty Eighteen and they looked at the situation today when that Congress is foolish and cyclists\nI think it would be amazed\nAmazed but when they studied it for a while I think they would understand why this happened and I think the reason is that the courts have given administrative agencies not to present it actually it's administrative agency which even the president doesn't control [noise] they'd given administrative agencies [noise] so\nSing laws that are very very general that are sort of goals oriented laws and that gives the agency's tremendous authority to make the major decisions that they should not be making Congress should make the major decisions the agencies should only be filling in\nThe details and owned unfortunately overtime because Congress has because the courts have not stepped in to stop this\nCongress has been encouraged to pass these very general laws then they go home to their constituents and they say you see I solve this problem for you and when the constituent complains about some new regulation that's come out the congressman says oh well I didn't vote for that\nThat's the administrative agency and what the what the constituent unfortunately doesn't recognize is that the congressman has to take responsibility has to be accountable for that because the Congress men did not vote for legislation that restricted\nThe independent agency in what it was able or what it was able to produce the laws with just two general and what will happen now if the court\nActs as I Hope they will ask you is that they will begin to look carefully at the underlying statutes and say this you did not have this authority you know you are not given this authority by Congress so you cannot make this\nRule that goes beyond what Congress intended\nAnd of course one of the things came up during the um during the hearings and the confirmation Brett Kavanaugh a couple of weeks ago was the fact\nThat uh the United States Congress is exceedingly weak and that really are because they're so weak\nThe liberals the progressive want to use the court system do impose like legislation on we the American people because they're so unpopular\nWhether it's gay marriage or abortion or whether it's immigration whatever it is there are certain things that are so unpopular in America and the Congress or foolish in fact I was\nThere for they look toward the court system to be a second legislature and that was never intended by anybody in fact one might argue to go back to your original point the administrative state is more powerful than the United States Congress\nAnd might be more powerful and the most powerful branch of government is doing it is the administrator state\nSomething called the deep state that have been in existence for years if not decades and what they want to do is simply outlast as president and outlast the court and continue to exist so is the administrator state right now more powerful than the Congress\nYeah I think undoubtedly it is it is making the rules that uh we live under and Congress was supposed to do that\n[noise] um and there is a way to address that it as I say and I think it's the courts where to step in and uh read the statute as they were written by Congress they would be able to say to administrative agencies you have gone too far and to the extent that they do that\nWe have some control over the administrative agencies and the effect that will be\nTo force Congress to begin to act because if what the administrative agency has done is something that the American people would like and the courts have said no you weren't given that authority by Congress the American people will then go to Congress and say we want\nLegislation that does this\nOr if it's something they didn't like then Congress won't be pressured and the agencies will will not be able to make the rule anyway but the point is we're a democracy and in a democracy the people's views should prevail and that's not what's happening in the under the current law system\nGive me an example and the one through four or five years ago Obama was saying look I'm the president I'm not the grand potent said I'm not the dictator\nAn example for four or five years ago Obama was saying look I'm the president I'm not the grand potent than I Am not the dictator I cannot give dreamers certain rights to be in this country because the laws against that\nBy the time a president or run away president in my view Obama was a runaway president when it came to legal immigration and it just created new laws out of a ... that had nothing to do with the Congress have all the time that gets up to the United States Supreme court it takes one to three years even get there\nAnd in the meantime the dreamers have done with the dreamers are going to do and you may like or dislike what Obama is doing but at the president is set that through the eyes or ins\nThe president can do anything you want why why can't the next president do anything he wants in other words it ended a substance it it's the rule making ability of the administrators state that ... that have been they've usurped their power that Congress\n[noise] yeah well you're you're correct as long as the courts and I'm here speaking principally the Supreme Court does not act one Supreme Court lays down their rules yes I'm that says\nThis is the as we are going to be reading statutes as they were written\nA then it gives all kinds of people who are who would like to challenge administrative rules or even presidential decisions an opportunity to go right into the district court and get a ruling and what we've seen in the last year\nMany times his district courts have been making rulings against the Trump Administration and the reason they are able to do that is that the Supreme Court has not has not\nPlaced any kind of strict limitations on what the court can do in fact what the what the Supreme Court has done in the so called Chevron case in the central he said to the to the court you should defer to what\nThe administrative agency [laughter] and interpreting their own law yeah\nAnd that of course has given them license to do whatever they want you know it has to stop\nI took home your book last night to read a ... page Ninety four I Know you have a chart beginning in Nineteen Ninety three which was not a long time ago on may twenty five years Clinton was in the White House doing what Clinton do the White House but uh Nineteen Ninety three there were four thousand three hundred and sixty nine\nOr rules forty ... rules which you know now is a lot well then [laughter] and twenty Seventeen the cumulative final rules publishing the federal register\nAs a hundred and one thousand three hundred and eighty so we go from forty three hundred under Clinton won a hundred and one thousand three hundred and eighty and it's like celery ranting at the rate at three to four thousand new rules every year and all the time another ten years go by it'll be two hundred thousand rules\n[noise] uh well that's entirely possible the way things are going right now of course a hundred thousand a hundred and one thousand is cumulative number ... since Friday since Nineteen Ninety three right um but yes it will continue to go on three thousand four thousand rules in any year\nBecause there is no discipline on the agencies right now because of this Chevron decision will Nineteen eighty four and because there isn't any a ruling from the Supreme Court that says\nCongress cannot pass to the agencies its own legislative power that's a violation of the separation of power in our country\nI Want to share of the American people people on on the thought on page Ninety five you say one recent study found that the cumulative cost of regulations between Nineteen eighty and twenty well which is why they uh thirty two year period reduced American economic growth by over twenty five percent\nWhich amounts to annually Thirteen thousand ...\nOr it reduced the American economic growth by over twenty five percent\nWhich amounts to annually Thirteen thousand per person in America annually and so this is gigantic it's huge it's growing and the only entity that can truly stop it and the president can stop it that Congress could stop it but there are ... and feckless individuals\nThe only entity in the world that can stop it it's not a state Supreme Court\nBecause can you imagine our economy twenty five percent larger", "show_name": "Ground
