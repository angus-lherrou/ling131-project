on a factor on a Fox I'm a good man a very sincere that job running a Ohio but John ...\nIs a theoretical guy he's not a real world guy and people want to know that\nSo he basically saying Americans we have to put ourselves in the position of somebody in Honduras who uh is poor and oppressed because the society down there as violent and out of control [noise]\nOkay but then what is the point of that exercise governor case that we allow everyone in Honduras to come to Ohio\nEvery one\nAnd the same thing with all the poor countries and the world because that's what your espousing by saying that the caravan people should be allowed to seek asylum in the United states that's what you're saying everyone can come here and do that\nWe would leave her ballot for night now California would be a foreign country within Eighteen months\nRight three year backlog right now of asylum um [noise]\nUh hearings and if you apply you are in the country you're here for three years at least okay what do

casing do not understand that\nSee I can and that's the debate I mean I just crush them in the bay 'cause he would have no answer for any of that\nFilm tell me who's behind this who's financing this\nWell I Do believe it's the progressive crew um the George Soros people um because that's who was on it in the past that we did a big thing on Bill O'Reilly dot com last night about Soros after CBS glorified em\nWe said no I'm the he's pumping in two thousand Eighteen this year alone tens of millions of dollars into the worst organizations and by that I mean they attack and smear anyone they disagree with David Brock runs one of them\nThat the media matters guy and I don't tell me that's you know this was a benevolent man so I Believe that these kinds of people I Can't prove it because there's no accountability and Honduras but I Believe they're behind a big ... big money behind it as everybody knows\nTo to uh read what even the president of ... saying\nI'm this is this is backed by a cube of ah Venezuela\nA and ousted president of Honduras are that are blaming the United states for all of the unrest ah the former president says that ah America's gonna have to pay for all of this uh they'll have to accept our citizens\nThis is just an ongoing internal battle\nA in Honduras that has quite honestly lied to many of their people\nUm and said that America's gonna have to take you and they're going to because they're responsible for this mess\nThis is a Marxist a revolutionary\nUh that uh has tried to take Honduras by force the Supreme Court two branches of their government\nFound what he was doing to be unconstitutional and kicked him out and he's been causing problems ever since and now\nHe Venezuela in Cuba are together and what was formerly known as all but but they are tested the United states and they're the ones financing at least the beginning of it\nThat's how it started now sorrows or others may be involved but I haven't seen any evidence of that yet but I Would not put it past them\nRight and and it would be interesting to see if there is a pipeline of cash going into ... so this is what I say I'm skeptical of everything and I agree with you there has been no hard evidence put forth of George Soros are people like him did this but if you know it's it's\nOne of his things they've done it in the past yes but the\nThe government of Honduras should be able to trace ... foreign money coming into that country back they should be able to show people this is what has arrived here\nSo\n... I Hope they do that if they if they believe Cuba and Venezuela actively involved in subverting their own country on doors and and by extension hurting the usa may have the ability to find that out\nThere or to let's go there are two other groups that are being formed now are two other waves that are supposedly following this one uh and I would love to hear when we come back what you think the president should do uh what do you think it looks like\nBecause it drains their infrastructure I mean this is an environmental disaster from Mexico these people only facilities are they are the water they need food Mexican\nPeople are poor there's not the infrastructure to support\nTheir so yeah so how do they would love shantytowns\nThere with ... mothers and babies and look at the United states they're rich and look at these people and let them in short but the Mexican government I'm telling you is under tremendous pressure by the Trump Administration not to allow any of this to happen\nSo so um how do you move seven to fourteen thousand people and just find enough water how is this not a humanitarian crisis\nDisaster but they have it set up where by there are tens who paid for those tents\nYou in the media would care\nNow [laughter] I\nDon't know it all they want to know no pictures of the poor baby in your older and you know but the mother known in a building you\nKnow they care so much about the humanitarian side of this you ... you might think that they would find out is there enough baby formula who's paying for it right\nOr ride it look we've been all that isn't over this over this we don't have a a honest press in America anymore which is enormous story\nThat is not being covered by the decide is probably not going to cover themselves so these guys like you and me we do it but you know the most of the American people feel that we do have a functioning on us press and we don't\nWant any level let me ask you this there was a story out this week and I know you touched on it about the um one for college students were in Korea all distress I ... in response to the Trump election twenty five percent said they felt like they had P.

arrested a suspect or in Florida it broke about an hour ago that they were bringing somebody in for questioning now it is a rash of a suspect\nOr his um is a fan is covered in stickers I mean the guy's not if I were to ask you before this can you sketch out what you think this guy's a band looks like you would have picked this yeah ah it covered in\nThe cows and seemingly political messages you get I Can't quite zoom in to see exactly what they say\nThat I uncovered the van there now covering it so with blue tarp so no one can see it yeah uh but uh the you we've had a blurry picture of it and it looks like it may be a guy on the right\nThere at least a ... you know it's hard to tell exactly there's certainly political messages all over and flags all over it does appear to be the ... picture of Trump when the presidential seal and they could it be or it could be either to me I don't like to have this guy's president right out of it you know again this is where people are speculating at this point it's it's ...\nI mean could it be a it could be either to be I don't like this guy's president right I mean I Know it you know again this is what people are speculating at this point it's hard to see honestly from the pictures you'll get a picture pretty soon though that's clear I'm sure\nI'm you know they were going to find this out relatively quickly yeah where this guy goes I mean this is a really quick arrest it does support the idea\nThat he was at an as does the fact that zero the bombs went off completely incompetent and crazy I mean the fact that you you mail bombs and they're finding this quickly is it you know shows a lack of level of sophisticated on it really does yeah so we'll see we're going to do fairly quickly I think\nOh this guy may be just a really bad incompetent version of the Bernie Sanders guy uh that was competent when he was trying to kill all the the Republicans are about a year ago looks like this maybe\nOur version of that guy fortunately our version if you will is a completely inept and incompetent and no one was hurt\n\nYeah I mean if if if that's true what the van ... and we do and should be noted of course he is absolutely not guy [laughter] you know I Know that it was but there were ever going to say he's not my guy either yeah but you know they're going to assign him as you know this is what a Trump supporter is like and\nBlah blah blah and you know there are those people on both sides and this is why it is so a terrifying it's not going to beat a rational person that causes these things they're not gonna be rational\nYou're going to be nuts they're going to be absolutely nuts uh and uh and that's what's\nFrightening is ... the media just puts all of the nut jobs on the right in as the regular person right when it comes to the left they don't even reports some but they certainly say well that's not\nThat's not you know that's not who Bernie Sanders is that's not a Bernie Sanders follower well I agree with you I agree with you why is this guy all of a sudden any less than the guy from Bernie but that was a Bernie Sanders volunteer\nAgain as we said at the time and Bernie Sanders is not responsible for shooting at a baseball fields and our style Trump responsible for this as any logical person that's ever seen anything to do with our legal system would be able to note um but you know again this is we were not going to know enough about this this is but this is a product\nTell you to move because you're a spoof did at all of the neighbors even the ... you could be living in the most anti ... you could be living in a neighborhood with the holy family ...\nAnd the pope and all of the pro life activist from all time right and you could drive one of those crazy anti\nAbortion bans into your driveway and those people are going to say you know we have standards yeah you're nuts\nI just really hope if Jesus comes back or he's not in the van [laughter]\nOr you know if he comes in a white van with you about your bumper stickers people are not going to buy it they're just trying to like I don't believe this guy there is no way back like that and again you're not supposed to know what's coming frail maybe that's how that's how he does he comes back maybe that's how the anti Christ comes with that I Would [laughter] [laughter] well no no no that wouldn't be slick enough he would have you know he'd\nBe oh my gosh well\nPlug years to broker he'd be the guy who would try to say we should round up all the people out of hand [laughter] anti Christ would be the first one to go [laughter]\nYou know these people are nuts will\nBe a good suspects I don't know why it's such an irrelevant for a while you that we care links to live out Tuesday night right [laughter] what a what I was certainly a settlement wow I didn't see that one coming that's like what like the really\nBad like lifetime movies where they're trying to give you the big the big switch through and like it's like a it's a you know it's a rape case and you know the whole time they put you to this one person and it's a very last second you know a guy she walked by for three seconds in the grocery stores the guy who\nDid it come out of course we didn't see that coming it's a nobody [laughter] well You're welcome on the Amtrak [laughter] there you go wow same plot twist\n[laughter] I don't know if I feel comfortable employing the anti Christ so I'm just going to concentrate on the mail bomb suspect that it's just\nBeen arrested in Florida yeah it's I I cannot believe there is not a journalist who's taking the high quality photo disadvantage\nHouse it's possible they're all bloomed out from you know the helicopters and you can't quite see exactly what it says I Will say you know by all appearances it does appear to be a pro Trump propaganda now it's it's sort of difficult to see\nYou know like for example a\nA shirt that was around in the elections are a lot that looked like a a Hillary a presidential shirt and then it said a message on dirt that said something like it\nThat was around in the elections are a lot that looked like a a Hillary a presidential shirt and then it said a message to under that said something like a lock her up twenty twenty or twenty sixteen\nThey get could theoretically be alive anti Trump stuff but I don't think you think they're starting to fish in pretty deep pier I Do this all the time for the uh for the level after you know like you try to find okay what is the one circumstance that we can be missing here and maybe that's it but it does seem to\nBe a a his face and a presidential seal pretty clearly on one of the windows but again you know\nThat the media going to try to make this out to be well from ... or you know evil bombers ... you know and and again we didn't do that with all Bernie Sanders supporter known they all people who have ... we didn't say that I was ... going to shoot someone on a on a on a field yeah and that guy was successful\nThat guy actually almost killed people this one didn't there's some didn't and we didn't say that when we could live with the Bernie Sanders guy\nAnd you know there's a couple of reasons why number one this stuff happens right right wing people do crazy things to there's there's plenty of them on the right as well that there are plenty of crazy does not go to one party when you get these fringe levels there are people on both sides who do it um there's a there's an ideology and we've talked a lot about this that affects many on the very harsh left\nOf going back to you know examples like Bill errors in the winter weather underground and we saw this with the Occupy Wall Street but there's some ID ideological reasons why certain types of violence come from the left more often but still there's crazy people\nAll over the spectrum you just say hey you don't want to do it because your sights probably knew something dumb leader and you're gonna get blamed for it but beyond that it's just ... correct\nWhen people people are responsible for their own actions when you were an individual you act as an individual and the person who says something that you listen to is not responsible for how you take that information and how you deal with it not to mention it may or not may have nothing to do that at all\nAnd it just because you happen to be a he happens to be a a a Trump supporter does that make ... make Trump's making Trump's fault that he's doing these terrible thing no and the same thing would apply as it did apply to a Bernie Sanders by the way that just a fan but campaign volunteer\nWorking to get the guy elected who then went and tried to shoot twenty five Republicans on a baseball field but again not Bernie Sanders fault yeah at all not his fault at I insult zero percent ... and the same thing would be it would apply here if this is how this thing turns out I tell you there's more to find out\nI I Will tell you this think how fortunate we are in a couple of things um\nGo back to the bombing of the bridge in Cleveland you remember that you remember that name remember anybody Mueller bealer you remember when Occupy Wall street was caught by the FBI on their way to the bridge I think they had part of it even why or did they have any of it wired\nBut they were going to blow up bridge in Cleveland ah and they had the capability of doing it and thank God the FBI caught them but that never made any news you know they would have made huge news of the Tea Party would have been doing that right for us they didn't\nThey you know Occupy Wall street all those are just crazy kids you know they're just they're in the Scooby Doo van there just crazy kids\nUm let's see how fortunate we are the that didn't happen how that could have torn apart [laughter] think about the blessings that not a single bomb went off that this guy\nMay have been so damn crazy that he really thought well I don't have any gunpowder by I'm pretty sure sand sand gets hot [laughter]\nUh you know this guy is is I mean you want to talk about incompetent\nUm how fortunate we are\nAh you know this guy is is I mean you want to talk about incompetent um how fortunate we are that none of these bombs went off if any of these bombs would have gone off and hurt or killed or maimed people from the other side\nThe world would be a different place today the media would be going crazy because look at how they're going crazy now\nWell [noise]\nGood news looks like we may have caught the guy yeah it's interesting and now they're starting to you know we're getting to that point where people are starting to share pictures of what appears to be the van which does appear to be very pro Trump also very pro soccer\nIf [laughter]\nIf it had a combination of things to me I was out I Would not assume guns a big soccer fan but who knows\nA but will ah [laughter]\nI Will say these things checkout again everyone said soccer people well we said

what the answer seems clear enough and and then when they didn't we were able to pray in secret without judgment is she divine intervention waves were unconventional without judgment and I remember when I was a kid\nAh my parents used to uh tell us not to\nPlay the game in the newspapers you ever play that game well back in back when I was a kid there was this ... call them ask each case seek and every day\nThere was a set of numbers that I had to decode the numbers made a sentence and the sentence was supposed to give me guidance and the symbols on this do you call them\nWhere the moon and the sun and you had to seek the numbers to match with words reminded did this kind of you know the idea of how to use numbers you have your letters and you had to figure out your messages like ...\nI mean we were told not to play with it so I don't even know if anybody remembers it I mean I don't know why we had it in the newspapers that I that I had in my home state of Utah because many Mormons are very very\nParticular when it comes to using astrology but it was in the newspaper called seek and she was really intriguing to decode the numbers and where does she get your future\nBut now I think that it's difficult to um push anything about the spiritual side because there's so much dog\nNow in Boulder so much well we're right you're wrong thing and a lot of religious Douglas reply to get out for dominance in what appears to be this apocalyptic\nAnd we're in right now it's taking too long to reach a fever pitch Halloween of course is is um it's become a corporate holiday where the meeting is lost for the spiritual perspective and for adults as just another excuse to get drunk go to parties are also meant over the women to decide that Halloween costumes consist of gardeners short skirts and cleavage\nUm got the Na'vi nurse the playboy bunny that naughty French made all that they don't go away every year it's the same thing\nYou know means best costume it's [laughter] sweat I mean I have no proof but how we do is always a time for things to be bizarre chilling and\nNot to leading and crude something scary I'm not sure what is accepted they would be seen as bizarre years ago but I think things have happened in yesteryear and be on time and now here we are I mean spiritualism or contacting the dead was considered healthy\nAnd normal back in the nineteenth century and today it's being argue that it's a kinda demon worship but that's you know this is usually argued by the same people who think that the trick or treating as a kid the demon worship and everything else we can the demon worship and you can't\nCan't be spiritual for a day or set aside some time to think about the dead or maybe even talk to the dead and looking for responses on all sides of the argument which is something that I think a lot of people should do and I would say this I Would say that Nineteen Seventy three\nWas the year that the ... board became vilified if it was demonized because of The Exorcist than the idea of the contact ah but ah you know\nThe little girl had with captain ... which is this the spirit the zoo um or ... or ... you know there there are a number of ... diem and said they used to scare you and that's just a couple of them\nBut see the spiritual is the nature of the idea of contacting the debt using you know anything from\nCable tapping into a crystal ball to pendulum so I mean all those things you know they they're basically the same ... you're using the same type of tactic um you're\nUsing audio motor responses or radio amateur responses\nWhere you\nHold on to something and you hold on for example holding a pendulum and you have these any ... any voter responses to it what is is that your hand is steady\nBut for some reason there seems to be this muscular\nA subtlety where something\nTell a path that goes through you into the hand or into like when the hands are on the plane ... board and this is how it all happens\nIt's weird like that and and um I think that is you know the more you learn about\nThe ... board I mean we ... really are not needed when it comes to something to that because there are other ways in which human beings can find spirits or at least gather together to conjure and communicate with the spirit world see essay on ...\nIs the most effective way according to spirituals mediums that's the most effective way of communicating with the debt and then this matter messages from the departed could be passed on to the living and then the spirits could announced their presidents by manifesting displays of the supernatural\nMe during the heyday of spiritualism scientists and cyclical researchers investigated hundreds of say on says and unfortunately well the majority of the physical mediums were caught hope sing phenomena some point and that they were just extending are exaggerated very few of them came away unscathed by the\nEarly investigators or the spiritual is moving a lot of them for ... and frauds\nBut of course the more people got together the more we\nWere seeing these strange happenings going on\nSo when you had the ... during the hopes that you had the people that were really interested in really wanted to make\nThese things happen to be Nineteen sixty the Nineteen\nSeventies and it wasn't until after the movie The Exorcist came out that the spiritual movement was put under the microscope by the born again Christian movement but people are still rebuilding in the sixties and seventies young people started to defy church leaders by participating what can be called party rituals\nWhere they were doing a lot of frightening rituals carried out by young people during sleep over some parties in the ... board was one of those things [noise] and they always show up you know parents were directly say do not play with this don't touch but which board don't touch ... board [noise]\nBut then [noise] you know came the improvisation then came the ritual is they can often effective ways\nShe's looking ill and then somebody says she's looking worse she's looking ill she's looking worse\nAnd then you do the call and the repeat the call and the repeat these are all you know rituals for the call is she's looking ill the repeat issues looking worse she's looking ill she's looking worse spoken repeated\nSpoken repeated and general direction of the call the repeat describes how the prone person the person is flat out is looking worse and worse followed by saying she is dying\nThan the call back is she is dead she is dying she is dead she is dying she is dead so ah and then what happens is you say now she's light as a feather\nShe's stiff as a board she's alive as a feather she's stiff as a board as you keep chatting that back and forth the call and the repeat light is a feather Stevens aboard\nThe entire group is chanting this except for the person laying there prone and what happens is when the call them to repeat the person laying there actually becomes frigid and then what you do is all of the people\nOn the repeat they attempt to lift\nThe person with their fingers are so we we did with our pinky fingers we lived through our pinky fingers and it's odd because you can lift the body together okay\nI don't know if anybody has done is I mean if anybody has done this give me a call triple eight six seven three thirty seven hundred because these are things I did when I was a kid you know we experimented with this stuff and I I think a lot of kids had this experience especially ones or you know our it dry because when we were kids\nWe were we were actually hearing about all this stuff because like our brothers and sisters are older brothers and sisters I was I was the oldest so I knew everything about it I had all their friends\nThey were doing this stuff why does have feathers difference of bored and you can lift the body of the person using your fingers as we did this and it just freaks out\n\nYou just read this out because it was weird because I remember the girl we did it with her name was ... and we were at my how should we did it and she actually turned pale\nShe was joining pale and she we could live to she was smaller than we are of course\nYou gotta figure you know you were lifting someone who is at least you know a hundred pounds Ninety ... Ninety five pounds\nLifting her up when we were teenagers or young kids you know live your pinky fingers saying live as a feather stiff as a board she's that she's dying you know there's\nJust

the air talking about a demon conjuring game that kids are playing with a pencil called Charlie Charlie\nAnd are in fact I had a number of teachers call me and give me um but they send me emails telling me that there were so glad I talked about the topic because he was seeing kids in school teacher in particular so you're seeing kids in school\nAnd the kids would align the pencils up and to

the colon repeat Charlie Charlie can we played Charlie Charlie can we played Charlie Charlie can we played Charlie Charlie can we play\nThan of Charlie's there\nThe pencils will move to indicate an

want you to be around me you have to say goodbye when goes to hunters going to cemeteries looking for a BPA if they don't say goodbye to the spirits those spirits could follow them home\nYou have to say goodbye\nWhen you close to ... there's a reason why the worst goodbye or on a wage war do you have to close the easy\nBoard by saying goodbye it's vital that you say goodbye\nFire on the way the world you have to close the weeds you bored\nBy saying goodbye it's vital that you say goodbye you\nKnow say goodbye to Charlie Charlie follows the whoever Charlie maybe see all these methods of communicating with discarded spirits can be explained with less complexity when he decided to acknowledge the mines capacity to manifest or conjure\nPowers that have been deemed supernatural we have that power you realize that you don't need a devil or a demon they give you that power because it's there already I mean it'd be confusing but we have to understand that there's so much about us that we did not know\n\nThe dreams gate maybe vital information about are being how time seems to be simultaneous and how we all feel in store images and sounds deep inside of us we we may even have stored\nIn inside of us past lives and possible paths and futures that can be extracted we already know the trauma\nIt's handed down from generation to generation it's in everybody's cells so
