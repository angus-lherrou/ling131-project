in this in lightened me to era we can all come together and say if a woman looks at you\nRight exactly I mean you know exactly right this is specially if she's been possessed by a gym I mean\nYou know this is the thing we were talking about this off the air a little bit because you know Donald Trump used the word nationalist yesterday when we're talking about nationalism and well in the definition of nationalism in history is is at times very disturbing lane um however you know I don't know I'm sure that's not obviously no one is citing\nThe really bad examples of nationalism as it as where we are trying to go if you're Donald Trump you're not saying all we want to be like those terrible countries he seems to be referring to it as like look where the best country and we were routed and we have a great the best you know culture and he went and we should be a you know patriotic and and and be a you know sure very excited about\nThat but when you talk like this that when you when you play a clip like that it's hard to kind of argue that we don't have a superior culture and a lot of ways you know like I kind of saying that because you've probably been possessed by a gym or\nCool this is the gym tolerated and now it's a different kind of a threat was I had a lot\nOf of ... or in my life I guess they there's trouble yeah it it it gets you into believing in the bottle adds up ... sixty\nShots of beer on a program recently alive on the air right can be an issue but I think I'm OK saying that a culture that embraces women as equals he's superior to a culture that that puts them but won't let them drive and and force them to address the specific way that you can't even see their face like that it that I mean\nHas to happen that way but I'll tell you what if you have if you have a must happen\nWhat do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be here and you have to chase them around and process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who are coming in worse for America can\nYou have a ... year you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in at entry points and to turn them away right there it's an invasion treat it as an invasion German way\nYou see this as an invading force these people they're not going to legally\n[noise] now the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is not an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor people away and I want you to listen\nTo all of the people on television that are now saying\nWe are a country that has always had open arms to migrants we're always the country that I mean our our values or have always our greatest strength is our tolerance and are welcoming spirit\nReally is coming from the left because I've\nAlways felt that way but you always told me that we have a rabid culture not a tolerance culture ... ... ... I've always thought we welcomed immigrants in but he you'll always told us that we have anything that is foreign I've always believed\nThat our our laws reflected a nation of immigrants but you'll have always said that our laws are racist and have from the beginning in a system of oppression\nSo which is it which is it how can you tell me that we've always been a country that is welcoming immigrants and our laws are set up as a nation of immigrants\nAnd yet telling me that we are the most depressive monstrous society ever that only embraces it raids culture\nYou can have it both ways which are we\nAre we a are we a\nCountry that is that embraces a a rape culture\nOr as or as any rational\nNon Marxist post modernist might say or are we a little of both\nAre we are we a country that tries to be this way and sometimes we fail to see you can't really say that because then you can throw the baby and the bath water out\nWhich is why we've been saying hey baby is a good thing the bath water may need to be changed but let's not throw the baby out too but that's not been your argument the radicals\nThose who don't believe in any kind of border security at all your the one leading the charge that we do this land\nThis land doesn't belong to us\nThat were all afraid because we're white people and white people are bad\nAnd now you're on TV saying\nThat we've always had this culture that welcomes immigrants\nWell see [noise] um [noise] it is\nAlways had this culture that welcomes immigrants\nWell see [noise] um [noise]\nIt is true we've always had a culture that has welcomed immigrants we are a nation of immigrants but we also felt that you've always needed to come here and not want to\nDismantle us that you came here because [noise] because you saw the American dream\nAnd most immigrants do most immigrants seeing the American dream and they've come from someplace else you noticed these guys are coming from Honduras they're not stopping in Mexico why they would probably have an easier life in Mexico just blending in\nThey speak the language why why would you come to America and why not just walk through America up to Canada they've got free health care\nThinking\n\nThey have all kinds of hate anti have laws in speech laws there a progressive utopia they have free universal healthcare why not just marched through us in go to Canada\nBecause one of two things either Canada is not the beacon\nAmerica is for all those who are the poor and the tired in the huddled masses\nOr this is a political move\n'cause you're not going to Canada because it's not about you your life the job\nIt's a political move\nTo destabilize to help push a country over the edge now I don't know which one it is but I Do know this\nSeventy five hundred people coming

minute what are you doing can't land here can't land here would you be okay with that\n\nOr would you think that might cause chaos and might be dangerous would you think that if Sea Tac airport cannot control the skies if they lose control of their airport they're not really an airport\nWhy does that work for an airport but it doesn't work for a country we lose control\nOf our borders and people are just coming whenever they want and they can just get a big huge mass of people because they're Seventy five hundred people can do it surely they can get twenty thousand and they will try twenty

right now I'm Out of them are source because she\nI Wish you well\nHave\nA ... not a not plentiful crowd I was going to say that I notice there there's a lot of empty seats I don't think anybody is really there's then there's the this oh it's a very small group of radicals\nThat are really dedicated to this kind of stuff and she asked ... I guess her tone wasn't acceptable to Alyssa\nUh but I mean you know she asked a very fair question since a woman who is supporting an ideology in a movement that is a brutal to women all over the world much worse than uh the certainly much worse than what you know ... or ... sorry did or Luis C K did\nA in a or the founders or the start\nAt ... or so oppressive really seems surreal law yeah it's\nNot not good ah so I mean I just it's a totally fair question and the fact that they continue to embrace windows are stories bizarre it's say hey you know once you bring to the table you know she's just they I guess you just crossed that line if you're going to be radical and you'll stand up and you'll keep saying radical things they will embrace you no matter what I remember\nWe did something years and years ago about why the\nUm the sar sewers and the Keith Ellison were brought into the movement a and it was a decision to ah make sure you didn't lose the Islamic vote in the future so they went out and they found it I'm not saying that those two but they went out and they found\nYou know connections to the Islamic community and brought them in and gave them positions are inside to make sure that we we lock up the Islamic vote and so that's at least how they got in is they were saying\nWell we have to have a broad chance we have to have a very big tent no no you really know nothing with people who are saying ... yeah no I don't think you're outside the tent ... really comes\nDown to the media has not held the movement accountable remembers is someone who uh you know and ... because there's many victims of really terrible things sometimes that occurs but it's more than that it's ideology you know one of the founders of the me too movement\nOr what has shown now that she also had a accusations against her from me and she did sleep with a very young cast made and one of her movies\nShe was a dating a Anthony Bourdain who we now know obviously killed himself later on but was at the time uh CNN employee paying off the person who's making the accusation\nI think that I mean it's amazing to me that no one has said\nDoes that contribute to his death I I've had the same thought I mean it's\nIt's I mean it's amazing to me that no one has said\nDoes that contribute to his death I I've had the same thought I mean it's you know in you know look suicide is unreasonable so you're not in your mind when you commit suicide but there are things that I'm ... that that can be sold\nDisjointed\nIn your head that you can never solve them you can never repair them\nIf if he is at CNN and he really does believe in the me too movement to end he really believes he's on the right side and he's having to go to work with a bunch of journalists who say you know we've got to throw these guys away and look they all do this and his girlfriend\nHas done it to a guy a kid and he's now paying a bribe to shut him up that concert that internal conflict in an unhealthy person has got to there's got to play a role\nThey're just waiting for that moment to be able to charge them get rid of him and here it is more here they've just now they're all reporting on how all of its finances are terrible there from all the background on his on his\nHis ah you know is settlements in court that all could've been done months like um you know there are no there isn't there also with him now there are many interesting didn't work out yeah so they moved down to something which is intriguing he'll be at the Planned Parenthood setting up his office I'm sure soon I'm sure\nThat cause and this is the way the media does these things right and listen to this now George Soros reportedly had an explosive device in his mailbox a over overnight mhm which needless to say but we should say in any way is a horrific idea if anyone were ever to do that and you are an awful person in every respect or if you\nWere to be responsible for social than other days for the rest of my entire life up until last five or six years\nI Would say it it goes beyond saying that this shouldn't happen but now\nYou have to news guy because if you don't say that well what does he look he was condoning it\nYeah and and be on this just goes to what we're talking about yesterday with Nancy Pelosi harassing Nancy Pelosi while she's out in the streets these are terrible terrible ideas heroin if he left\nDon't do the things they're doing we've seen that the left has been violent or ask people who were playing baseball this congressional baseball game\nOr you know we've seen that before we've seen uh the harassment of officials in places I Would much rather have the on our argument\nOr as as in our repertoire of argument that we're not we're not the ones doing that they are so don't plan to that I you know I Know no one in this audience would ... and we have no idea by the way who did this I mean certainly the speculation is is that George Soros opponent\nI'm somewhat on the on the right but I mean it would be his wife I'm just saying we have no idea who it is right\n[laughter] um but listen to this coverage from the New York times that look I get\nThat they are liberal I get it and I understand that they're not going to look at George Soros may be the same way that I Do [laughter] this is just to the point of like you've checked out mentally know write up a piece of a story that says this\nCome on [noise]\n[noise] oh Mr ... name has become a trigger for a subset of Republicans and conservatives but right off the bat you're just condescending right it's not that he's done anything you could possibly disagree might trigger a name and forget there several countries\nHave named him an enemy of freedom not like I've been room for people but like leaf pass\nLaws against a subset you know she was about six countries have named him in it you know a a a danger to their freedom in a band any of his money you know from coming into the country\nBut that's just a small subset so how do you have any country\nBecause the ... you know ... and the trigger think that's normal use conservative would say like some uh students here's a word they don't like and they go hide in a safe space that they were triggered right like it's a condescending term again for a talk show hosts for a ... for Huffington Post blogger in line to sort of like for the New York times\nToday uh the Mr sources name as a as a trigger a force subset of Republicans conservatives visited the airport here he is a\nHe has said that his main goal is a political activist was to see a return of bipartisanship\n[laughter] don't funders world do you have to believe that she course everybody says they want bipartisanship\nGeorge Soros is that a bipartisan figure\nHe is one of the largest donors in the history of the Democratic party and he ... he launched a foundation that is funneled money to every crazy left wing calls on the planet well we're supposed to without question there is not like an argument the only thing we hear from conservatives are triggered by his name\nWhat's his name George so you're sorry it's it's so it's just happens sometimes\nHe said if you know it's a crazy is you know who's more bipartisan the Koch brothers\nIt's just happens sometimes you said you know it's a crazy\nIs you know who's more bipartisan the Koch brothers totally further yeah they're they're they're not conservatives they're libertarian\nWhich means they give to both sides sometimes they're on this side sometimes they're on that site foreign socialist on social issues almost exclusively with them or they're not conservative now and yet they're not bipartisan very evil\nIt's actually it's\nIn comprehensive some of the coverage listen to this one this is from uh New York times as well this is their story about how anatomy does not determine gender experts say that's a headline\nLet me just say that again but then again anatomy does not determine gender experts say God and now this is a force to push back on Trump's policy to use biological sex as a as the ... factor and and I guess you don't get to just make it up anymore\nI'm listening I mean listen to this and I read this several times ... and it's actually changed and meaning as I've read it but listen to this how do you define identity researchers say gender identity comes from the brain\nNot the body some put it more bluntly it originates between your ears not between your legs now\nWhat they seem to be describing there is something different than we're describing what they're describing is a feeling\nRight like I feel like I'm a woman now you can feel like you're a woman I Believe ...\nAt one point felt like a woman\nAnd I'm actually still does I assume she does flu it but it's ... who knows a but like I just say that you feel that way is almost in a in a in a in a roundabout sort of way a criticism\nOf transgender ism right we're a conservative would say you're not transgendered you just feel like you're transgendered that's a different thing but I Would say that is what it is that would be in\nThe feeling which used to be\nCalled if I'm not mistaken gender this for ya and any that feeling it was a was categorized by medical scientists as something that was harmful to your mental health\nRight but I was there and and and certainly there are cases like that or where at least there used to be that there were admitted as a as a you know a real problem with in in mental health however there are other cases to wear like for example we used to use the term tomboy\nRight for a girl who\nSeemed to like to do a lot of the things that voice that maybe acted like a boy a little bit and you call that person a tomboy you didn't call them a an actual boy it was it was a nickname for someone who was a girl what acted like a boy and I guess my question\nHere would be if it's true gender comes from the brain not the body or a originates between your ears not between your legs why do they have surgery\nWhy do why did they change what is between their legs if it had nothing to do with what's between their legs why these two things associated all they seem to be talking about a collection of personality attributes right like I like I like sports I like you know\nI like action movies I like you know giant and prime rib eye have generally\nIssues that are interested or with a male therefore I'm male they're talking about male interests or something\nYou know who will to be able to explain this who's and be able to make sense one way or another explain both sides is a doctor Deborah so yes she'd be great let's call her up have her own tomorrow because I'd like an explanation of\nWhy bother getting your genitals changed if it's got nothing to derive genitals and isn't that just gender\nFor a a and haven't we at times said that's bad\nIt's shown us that it's not bad because suicide rate remains the same\nSo we we've ... you know we've said this what this was bad because the genders for your leads to all kinds of different things and general unhappiness okay so what research said that if we say that it's not bad\nAnd we go through with surgeries and everything that it will lead to a different outcome\nAnd I think that's an important piece of it I mean I think the outcomes are not all that positive but beyond that whether the outcome is good or bad there is truth\nI don't like I don't understand like the word gender meant sex organs\nForever mhm okay and if you want it instead of changing the word gender ... to mean something new\nThen in that and say okay actually this is an interesting a personality trait they ... they seem to see themselves as a man and and and isn't that interesting and they can do what the what they want I have no interest in what they're doing to themselves\nOr from a perspective from a libertarian perspective I think what's but like there is also a fact are\nSo let's get into this tomorrow because the fact on gender when you say well it used to be sex well yeah it used to mean sex but it doesn't now and the guy who changed it was a psychopath yeah oh yeah and uh we'll we'll start with that and let's see if we can get a doctor so on tomorrow's\nProgram to go over [noise] All right my patriotism lie [noise] why don't you think\nIs going to happen the stock market is down four hundred

Tammany\nThe blood line it was given demand directly from God so\nIt's the whole point of the garden of Eden right the whole point of the garden of Eden was the snake came in and the serpent came in\nAnd wanted to contaminate the bloodline and ever since that has been someone and they want to contaminate the Bud Light making man less of a man last human and more demonic more just beyond the limits of man I mean many scientists argue there's no reason why\nA second genesis might not have taken place and no reason why is this and that should not still be living among us this really mean that there could be an alien life former life well there I say a form of life that exists\nWhose main purpose is to invade a healthy host and proceed to Rob it of its life force and its ability to think and function within the norms of society the same can be said for enemies or even life forms that can and habit of building\nLike a house or or perhaps a a place where a murderer suicide took place it it can be said that these entities\nCan bring your food or even can find their way into your home giving you the impression that perhaps your house is haunted by polls are guys or some other pesticides and I've been\nReally really really into the show right now this um this show hunting uphill house I've been watching Netflix and I'm really enjoying the way these new horror\nShows are more psychological and deal with the darker areas of the soul that tend to be exploited in times of\nTrauma it's about trauma ... sets off\nIt sets off the chain reaction to bring this parasitic evil into play trauma and dread seem to water down the soul and make it right for hysteria fear it even possession now when\nI said possessed shit I could mean demonic possession or or now you can also\nPut forward the new theories that are being presented and that is demonic possession is actually a parasitic condition it still remains undecided in this case it in the rooms with the paranormal but it stops just short of being a parasitic infections spreads because of blood trauma to the consciousness blood trauma to the immune\nSystem brings about add new viruses in general viruses paralyzed kids kids that are sick kids die kids that are die from these parasitic infections\nOkay\nAnd hell knows what other parasitic infections can come into your home you know your home it's like a human your home is like I mean it's got a a system of pipes like veins water is going through the house it's got a uh it's got a brain system thermostat it's got all these other things that you control it's like controlling another environment\nOkay so our house can be haunted a body can be haunted by some sort of a virus that can keep it in ... that can be kept in hurting the body\nAnd then eventually it develops into some full fledged demonic possession it's like a demon wants to get out [noise] a demon wants to get out and it will kill you in the process [noise]\nThe dark side is very real [noise]\nDark side of the reason why it had no virus that normally doesn't kill children kills children\n\nI remember the text message that his mother had and a reporter just days before his death max and wrote to his mother your boys in trouble if anything happens to investigate\n\nMax was good friends with actor Orlando Bloom he lived in the United states for a few years he had returned to the u._k. to stay with his mother before heading off to Poland and\nHe was probing the lives\nOf well known figures in politics business entertainment it was sad that he was about ready to uncover some secret had filed group once again something that harms the children\nIs on his wing death the subsequent treatment of the authorities as many online followers convinced that he was killed by some strange\nSpell or curse some say government agents but you know the habit the way it is and um to look back at what we were talking about last night\nTalking about the uh second genesis what's going on in the other dimensions what's coming through from the other side of course you\nKnow trauma is what triggers all as we've been going through a lot of trauma lately\nAnd\nWhen you're looking at trauma and you look at how it affects people in these horror films in fact Halloween came out\nWhen so Halloween over the weekend and that is about trauma as well as about trauma family traumas handed down for forty years\nRight it was good ... Myers woman who was killed by Michael Meyers\nThen you have the strode Z and you have you have the Jamie Lee Curtis character that's actually now you know older she's no longer teenage babysitter she's older now and she's been waiting for the moment where she can confront\nThis character that's actually now you know older she's no longer teenage babysitter she's older now and she's been waiting for the moment where she can confront Michael\nAnd you know this is kind of like blow of all the other sequels this is the one that they should have waited and did it forty years later because it it it certainly is a well done film and shows the trauma it's something that activates\nActivates a lot of behaviors whether it be the protective behavior such as what we see in the movie to protect their behavior of the mother the grandmother and the predatory behavior browse long by Michael and we wonder\nYou know what possesses and in fact that's one of the thing is what possesses the predator to go after the prey and what possesses the prey to protect itself from the predator\n\nI mean we are perceiving the world today is being hostile and in some cases in a state of otherworldly control\nAnd with the prevailing eschatology and the protections of the world apocalypse\nWe're witnessing a critical mass of individuals giving up are becoming antagonistic because all they hear about\nIs how their future is going to end in a biblical cataclysm we had to earthquakes six point something or other off the candidate cos British Columbia Canada okay we have these earthquake the news the other day talking about another\nFault line near Mount Hood here in Portland here in Oregon right I'm having people writing me and telling me Clyde\nIt's been shaking Vancouver it's going to start shaking Seattle and then it's going to shake Portland get out of Portland not only that we have the riots in the streets that all the way of the shootings near my home we now have earthquakes waiting\nAnd people keep telling me Clyde remember what the skull said remember what the cube said remember what the school and the ... I'm going back and I'm going to listen to that show again I Want to know and try to remember what the cubes said and what the skull was saying through the cube\nIs a lot of people are telling me that what was said with the black Cuba or San Francisco is transpiring now I'm going to go back and I'm going to do the research to find out just what's going on\nAnd we'll get down to the bottom of whether or not that cube which speaking and that's the goal was telling us what is happening what is going on\n\nThe one of the biggest allies that people will tell themselves is that ah it's okay you know faithful pulled me through I'm All right I'm good\nIt's okay but see\nI don't think that I mean it you know they're they're they have the faith whopping are good\n\nThey have the faith because they're not being there not the ones in the crosshairs and not the ones being played by the demons where are the ones being played by the parasitic infestation of a dead no or add new viruses or or or Gerald viruses or planes or\nPest sons say they were saying oh ah where'd you boards what is the most ah what is the most a pervasive demon shows about ... who shows that we used ... whose positions are ... is the demon up ...\n\nDiem in the past ... is the demon shows up on ... so so ... ... it was the same team and that showed up but The Exorcist\nKept it how to use the same team ended apparently show up in the entity investigate\nIt was the same team and that showed up but The Exorcist\nCaptain how easy it was the same team ended apparently show up in the end and the investigation\n\nSo yeah you didn't tell you though I have faith everything's going to be fine but then you know when things get to the point where they're ugly\nThere'll be with their secretly dreading the advent of death through hell or of course the permanent and with no chance of rebirth re mortality and of course these are things that are chaotic\nTime it's sick cat I thought some similar attribute yeah they'll attribute them to ah the prompt things have the devil or daemon I mean even goes from a confident strict sturgeon the betray or of those you near the end of the temptations of robbed them of their hurt you\nAnd we're seeing that people who used to love life\nBegin to lose their zest for life and we begin to see children thinking about suicide they're thinking about killing\nPlaymates we're hearing about children who are sexually assaulted by other children\nAnd we're hearing about bullying and how those who are bullied have an audience on YouTube saying goodbye and some taking their lives for all the see social media has become a demon unto itself as unseen algorithms are guiding people are becoming Ruth was to each other highly behind the shield of a keyboard\nThat dark side apparently is winning over many people and we wonder if it's evidence of the magnum opus of Satan that something is breathing a new psychopathic ideology where the end result will be our own destruction\n\nScientists are calling it as the uh they're calling it a disease and yet the disease has not been detected under a microscope a road microscope and and so the technocrats have to dig a little deeper\nTheir quest is defining in sequencing the consciousness of human beings both the river inside the humble parts and the parts that are darker and chaotic\n\nSo there's a reason why the focus has been kind of changed the focus is on the consciousness\nThe focus is on the due out of your consciousness the good in the bad\nTrying to find some sort of scientific investigation or scientific method or scientific hypothesis is going to tell you what good and evil is\nHow the fact that as a disease rather than the facts and it's something that would be spiritual or something that psychological or disease or something that is parasitic that crawls into the body and consumes the body little by little burning it or eating it\nPiece by piece little by little until there is nothing left to put a husk nothing left for the hollowed out shell of a human beings because this is how dark it gets\nThat no one\nNo one he was even thinking about it right now and you know why 'cause we have the manipulations politics that are taking over right now all people didn't care about is the blue wave of the red way but the way for there to tell you there's a way of coming it's not blue it's not read it's black\nBut black wave is coming the dark wave is coming\nLike a storm it's moving like a cancer and we\nThose who need to be aware of those who are the storm crows have to see it coming and they have to tell people not like hysterical weirdos\nBut we have to see it for what it is\nThing I remember at the school saying he said the sickness is coming [noise]\n[noise] in the winter [noise]\nThe window of our discontent [noise] the winter of the dark parasite the parents of the ... the darkness released [noise]\nDark way [noise] more so than the reading [noise]\nAnd I'm not crazy for saying this because I think it certainly needs to be said [noise] especially this time we were thinking of running around [laughter] [noise]", "year": "2018",
