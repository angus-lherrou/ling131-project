to see that they didn't take those questions will go back to those that taught them and change that we literally we have a girl that came in that you know learned all sorts of stuff she went back to her professor started asking her professor questions he got all befuddled because he didn't know the answers\nHe now has asked her to be with him once a week and teach teach him what she learned and all these classes it's amazing it's amazing\nAnd and she said she wrote a report and he said you are either a liar and you're going to get an ass\nOr this is the best paper see me in my office that's

gonna have do since we're gonna have people\nThat are going to tell these individual stories about these people in the here on stage Nineteen as you've come through and they're\nThat we have argued as if these things were not settled long ago and we have argued a common language how dare you insist as if this was just some idea that a bunch of racist had\nThere been Franklin is a great example because Ben Franklin talked about how so many Germans from moving in Pennsylvania and they were\nAnd he said the problem is they're speaking their own language there started to create signs in German their truck started to create documents and German you can't have a nation if you don't speak the same language so Franklin was one of the first ones out that Thomas Jefferson the same thing\nHe said we have immigrants coming in which is great and by the way they were so pro immigration than in the declaration of independence one of the twenty seven grievances was were separating from Great Britain 'cause he's trying to stop immigration we won't immigration\nIt's just we wanted a simulation with immigration they were huge pro immigration\nSimulation I mean ... Thomas Jefferson they will bring with them the principles of the government they leave him by with their own early you involved in their early youth\nThese old principles with their language they will transmit to their children the proportion to their numbers they will share with us in legislation they will infuse it into their old spirit warp and biased it's directions and render it uh as heterogeneous incoherent\nAnd distracted mass he says the solution is thought better to discourage their settling together in large masses and they should distribute themselves sparsely among the native for a quick or assimilation\nThis goes right with with this it seems to me necessary this is Frank Clinton seems to be necessary to distribute the um the German there's the Germans a more equally mix them in with English established English schools that are now where they are now too sick leave settled I Am against\nThe it I Am not against the admission of Germans in general for they have virtues their industry for galaxy blah blah blah they're great farmers he's just saying we have to get them to be Americans this is the opposite of what we're doing\nNo Dearborn, Michigan I mean we we want people to simulate and we don't want them creating a parallel culture where there's almost a no go zone out for for police\nSomalians in in um Minnesota exactly\nAnd we've got groups in West Texas creating their own separate communities and that's not it it's assimilation you want to become an American you don't come to America to take over and move to whatever your country was\nYou come here to be an American now that's where the professors the elite groups really are into all America's really bad ... you know we need we need to be like Europe or whatever one way

about the rulings talking to us about the scandals I mean they're just basically puppets\nThat are answering to delete priesthood\nAnd some claim that they're the ...\nAnd unfortunately there weren't below ... paints everything with wide brush and so it's impossible to pinpoint just who may be responsible and who's pulling the strings here but someone\nWho claimed that this is our age put that bail arch at the Washington DC mall and they did it just the day before the hearings took place well you up and you know if I Want to be so bold as to identify some say panic alliance\n... and they basically would somehow influenced the rulers of the world we can say well it's a little bit on the plot\n\nAnd we could identify it as some ancient devotion to the gotta fortresses that calls a Saturn the cult of bail I mean look\nThe gods from the sky the gods of air bail is the God of a of the sky Baylor's or read all of these established connections with bail\nMe out and we we we now have to take into consideration there's there's a curious parallel between vests and other falls guides worshipped in earlier times it was when both\nThe ancient people's turned away from the upper hand of

with his Dark Tower this cancer\nWill grow\nAnd and what it will do is grant certain people that lead us the ability to work in tandem\nWith this dark sinister state\nAnd I talked about the dark stayed a while ago but the idea is to divide up the areas of the earth\nSo that\nMeans beings or whatever they may be the confidence tricks sure I've been talking about they can take over and we give

of the third temple I mean all of\nThese things seem to be coming together I mean can you see this coming together or am I just like losing my mind here because you know we have a rabbi on the show he had Paul Begley on the show we have another people commenting on all this\nAnd we're asking ourselves well somebody wanting to nudge the war between God and the devil in the future is this is this some sort of eschatology on a charade or play or some melodramatic play that they want to play out that the revelation of the Methodist what is going on I mean we're wired for this right\nAnd so to regular observers that don't know anything about the background of the arch\nThey'd say well what's the big deal when I say well look at the coincidence\nLook at the coincidence as to the arch of bail erected in Washington DC the day before they decide to go\nAnd have the testimony between Ford and Kavanaugh and what the testimony represents and what Kavanaugh represents as chief justice when he's confirmed\nThinking about what it all means\n\nPeople in these I guess you'd call them secret societal say ten of groups within our government within\nA places of power they know what these symbols mean to people and even though consciously you know people say oh it's just an arch no big deal but subconsciously we're wired for all of this we're wired for symbolic ...\nAnd ah there was a study was done again to prove that you know cellular a generational cellular hand off from generation to generation generation\nThat trauma and certain things are in our cells that triggers certain thoughts and means subconsciously to the body so when you're dealing with something when you're dealing with a symbol that symbolizes everything that I've talked about in everything is being talked about\nAt the Fort Kavanaugh hearings you have to take that into consideration some sort of\nSay panic power ploy\nIn Washington DC and it's being done for a reason it's being done as a beacon to draw in those principalities from the air the bail is orange the bales will lose the present always all the symbolism comes together and it it goes beyond\nCabin on it goes beyond forward believe it or not any data and I'll get into that later but see this is the beginning\nAnd the end is going to be dark obviously going to be dark because it was placed there to to guarantee a dark ending but\nYou think that looking at the origin of how the arch if he was he wrecked it terrorism don't you think that's a tale itself\nWell yeah I mean you know when you look at something that ah was first destroyed it was\nBasically a temple dedicated to the horn guy and then it's destroyed and then they look at it as they destroyed this monument we shall reelected and we will put on it but it's about peace and freedom and now it's never about peace and freedom regardless of who tore it down it was a symbol of what I said it was it's a symbol of bail\nThe horn God shout sacrifice sexual perversion all of these things that are being talked about in Washington DC today and all the things will be ruled upon by the FBI and by the Senate when they make their vote\nOr I thought it was all I got a thing I
