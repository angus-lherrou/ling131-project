ways that people are are now able to take credit cards that seems to be everywhere it's like you know I had to have airport in my tire and I paid for the gas and the guy says here you know you want it to me for putting air the tire with the gas and I'm like well what was that\nYou know I gave them a buck but still you know is a tipping becoming too much for talking about that as well and the phone lines are open one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for his way to join us when are you calling in there's Andrew but been skiing that came commando show man gave hello there Andrew\nKim we have a ... or I should say Dr Bonnie Dr Bonnie here in Chicago yes she is a doctor and she's going to start doing tele medicine\nSo like like seeing patients over Skype and costs time and things like that exactly I think that is amazing technology have you ever tried it no or never done okay I have and so you ought to look at the specially 'cause you have kids young kids\nIs that you know if the kids get sick and you have to take him to the pediatrician we did last night okay then there's like the clean you know that they're supposed to be like the the wealth side and the six side yeah there's about four feet of corporate separate or\nGet on your legs so the germs really aren't going to go from there to hear hey where do you think you're doing the acquaintance I Would say over there and then they give you that tend to use right a gate and you're like was that the Clinton side or the other side pen okay\nWhen doctors on call doctors on demand and you know you might even have that as part of your health care package 'cause we have it here at West star as part of our health care package is that you can\nGo on line download the app and you see a doctor right on your phone one thing I don't like your tonsils and stuff\nHello who's going to bomb and then they can prescribe antibiotics they can facilitate using another doctor it's absolutely amazing\nWell this is going to be a change for Dr Bonnie but she wants to know one of the technical side how before logging on and greeting a pack a patient can choose to make sure the lighting is right at the camera looks good I mean she looks good on camera before she jumps in and starts talking to a patient\nBecause you don't want to look bad no no you have to look you know\nHot [laughter] yes yes this is going to be quite a transition going from a brick and mortar office to my home office where I can either use my Mac laptop or even my eye\nPad and iPhone right yeah so um I just didn't know if there was a way that I can do a selfie check to see you know if the lighting is okay for me maybe the background the position that the camera\nI Know you're supposed to look into the eye of the camera and not the actual screen writing things like that so I did I wanted to know what I can do to prepare before you actually get out and start thinking\nWell you know the big thing is is that we want to make sure there's a good light on you okay\nAnd in Chicago you have sunny days and you have cloudy days right yes and you have a cold winter days I've been there like a good job so I'm the best case scenario is that you get what's called a ring light I don't know if you've heard of this and it's a it is a ring and\nI can put a link to one for you that I Would recommend free over at Amazon dot\nCom and so what does it has it's for\nA facial ... like portraits of people use that for it's also when you're on when you're using a webcam is that you have a tendency to be washed out okay\nWith the ring light is it exactly what it is is that it's going to illuminate your face K.\nAnd so that this way people are better able to see you and you'll actually you will actually look better lit up than dark a lot of people say oh no I look better in a dark restaurant\nNothing not so much K now when you're spaces illuminated within the background will appear darker OK okay and so you being a doctor\nI Would want to see your credentials on the wall meaning I I Want to see those diplomas you know what I mean even though I Can't I won't be able to read them I Want to see\nAll your awards I Want to know where you went to medical school I mean I I'm not gonna be able to look that closely but I can tell what they are right okay and of course you want to get rid of any junk behind you to you don't strike me as a person but you know we've interviewed people before like this guy you know for jobs here\nAnd you know and you look and they have this like there was a hoarders behind them and you're like ooh what is that pile that too right so we clean all that up\nNow there are ways when you have faced time for example that you can hit a button this was going to be hard but what I Would do is I Would just\nRecord say a couple of seconds and then you don't have to worry about just taking a picture so if you can record some video of yourself for thirty seconds\nThe big thing too that a lot of people don't realize body is that you want to smile OK okay and because when you smile you look welcoming\nAnd I'm sure you've done that you know where it's hard to deliver bad news but you might have a little bit of a smile\nYou know race a because there's a whole side of I mean I have a lot of friends who are doctors I hear a lot of the bad story but I also here are the good stories you know yeah and um but you know so being letting your personality comes through have you ever done this before\n[noise] uh only on Web in ours but not actually as a patient doctor saying\nThis is so cool I'm so excited for you um the ring lights are about\nSixty bucks okay and it makes like I said it makes total\nDifference you're going to love what you see when you record a couple of minutes of yourself because at that point they're going to say yes a little extra blush sometimes works too when you're on a webcam because uh you seem to get a little bit washed out even if you do have this ... and again thank you for your call a spade\nAnd can because uh you seem to get a little bit washed out even if you do have this ... and again thank you for your call [noise]\nHey speaking of let's talk about Sarah works

technology advisors\nI'm Kim commando now you and I both know there's nothing small about our businesses are reputation is always on the line and that's where the Dell small business technology advisors come in reliable del PCs with intel core processor or rock solid\nA a shoe at a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at\nSo if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want to put an ad but as an Arab draft\nBut sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat and I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at a Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThe ... percent point eight hundred dollars or something and they had to tip jars\nOkay and so you know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right\nOne was one said for all you Android people and the other ones had for all your iPhone people and the iPhone ... drivers like overflowing [laughter] and the Android One\nDidn't have anything yeah I was at a video game thing and they said if you think the X. box sucks to appear if you think the PlayStation ... it's just a ploy it's just like you said before guilt and people out of their money\nBut how about this one this is a little different when we ordered or my sister's kids came over for dinner or something like we should get a bunch of barbecue so we go on Amazon restaurants right a bunch of barbecue and\nI get the total and it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars sounds like that's a lot more than I was expecting right they automatically added on a twenty five per cent tip after also charging me a delivery fee okay that that's really tough because they don't even ask you\nYeah and you know door dashes notorious for that and also overeat because they'll say like pricing search okay and so they add another five dollars if you order something that's under ten dollars there'll be a small order and delivering charge you know or whatever maybe\nBut maybe it's like being a server at one point in my life\nI actually will tip the whole foods or the Amazon Prime driver or whatever it is I'll actually add more like he's like okay I got a whole foods and delivery yesterday\nAnd it was probably I think it was like a hundred and fifty dollars so you got two things yeah I had seven and broccoli [laughter]\nWhich is probably about it and some sushi okay and then the tip was a recommended to was twelve dollars\nPay and so I was ten percent okay I ... I gave the guy sixteen I gave him an extra\nFour or five I Wonder what I mean the research has got to be out there that this works otherwise the apps that are doing this the squares and stuff like that big wouldn't included\nWell and because you know remember they're making a percentage of the total even on a tip yes okay 'cause they charge square and the other one said two point nine percent two and a half percent of as a transaction fee of the total amount right okay so if they can get that total thinking about that so they can get the total amount\nUp by five dollars I Would think the tip of the dollar is no no no you pay the whole transaction than what the ... what is that what is the bottom line transaction then you have to pay a fee for them collecting the money and doing things like that\n... and in my mind I'm Still not tipping well I'll just\nAnd you have to pay a fee\nFor them collecting the money and doing things like that and he does have a minute I'm Still not tipping well it is hard it is hard and you know I I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm just a nicer more generous person than you are there's no maybe about uh the I think that you know but I Am but sometimes it is kind of awkward\nYou know tipping again for just like what is normally\nAnd what we should be considered like just part of the experience like somebody handing you a napkin [laughter] so here's ten percent ... instead of having an African images use the cash that you're expecting me to enjoy my ... something like that\n[noise] All right let me tell you something over the years epson printers

cold rather um it has a security camera physical\nKey because also the emails encrypted so it's not just five hundred bucks and there was a hundred dollar a year subscription fee and if you think

products we're talking about smart home technology yes was specifically ever you ever thought about how your couch fits into your home\nYour wish that your couch you can go up or down to ... earn recline maybe sync up with your smart light source sync up with your smart thermostat if you've got too hot or cold\nWell el she got together with an Italian ... furniture manufacturer by the name of ... and they created are you ready for the call off the oh smart so far yeah oh I Know I was glued to the speakers\nHurricanes thankfully or not it was\nTemperatures are dead or soon become we're all thinking about the reliability of our he says it was going to protest today to four or five twelve Twenty one year schedule service service in your first create safety and efficiency for system operation when you meet it led protests mechanical services keep you busy throughout the fall and winter seasons vis a\nPlus company as your best choice for all technically heating and air services they've been in business for twenty five years called protests mechanical today to four or five twelve Twenty one\nPlenty of every time you went out and you can cash in the capital in the ... you are in four percent cash back on dining and entertainment like celebrating every year the credentials [noise]\nWhen you when your crew or courtside during overtime [noise]\nFor going out now you have formal are introducing new favorite card from Catherine in line and four percent on mining and four percent I mean you can send your wallet terms apply capital one bank usa in a\nDemocracy after I hurt my neck\nI didn't know they'd be this addictive\nI didn't know how far act or to get more [noise]\nWith the kinds of things can happen after just five days and it was a true friend [noise]\nAll right so here's the deal and brand new iPhones are out the acts as the access max which is what I have\nAnd also now the ex are so is the acts are really truly worth the money it's actually cheap seven hundred and forty nights I Know you're you're saying Kim seven hundred and forty nine dollars is really expensive for a phone well not when you compare it to like eleven hundred for the latest iPhone\nAnyway just few luxury talking more about that but I really love to hear from you this show one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once again as a way to join us\nAnd then there's Andrew ... commando show men have hello there Andrew Kim\nWe're going to start with Karen and she is in spring grove Pennsylvania she lives spring\nGrowth that sounds like a nice place to lead doesn't it doesn't really horrible play ... I live in spring grows right next to the garbage\nTown Pennsylvania which is not very well populated not at all she uh she lives in rural areas and she just\nThe company that she was thinking about switching to use the rising towers so she's like oh well they use all the same stuff is going to be all the same kind of action and then she went [noise] what if it is one of his work\nAnd if it's ... I mean to call him and it's so frustrating though isn't it I mean\nWhen you don't have a decent connection in your house I mean you know we just talked about you buy a new house right\nNow if you're a lot of millennials especially millennials are you a millennial here and I know I think I missed it by yeah you're right on the U.S is that a lot of millennials won't be won't buy a new home if it doesn't have say a fiber optic\nNext I mean that is now a requirement it's like you know two and a half bathrooms three bedrooms and a fiber connection so that this way you don't have to worry about what's going on so so Karen you don't have all bars in all places that's what I'm hearing\nThat is correct [noise] and there's no way that you want to move to the big city ah no no we're going to stay right here okay so what was then when you complained of arise and what did they say\n[noise] um\nThey really can't get many answer I've been I've been within twenty twelve okay\nBut the past month it is just so slow here that the Internet's almost useless [laughter] so I'm looking at switching to Comcast for my Internet and income can't say well we also have mobile and so I thought well that might be a great stone service but\nI'm concerned that maybe it won't be because they do use the same right the towers and would switch between striking towers and Comcast hotspot [noise] you know I don't know I mean\nI I don't I don't find Lincoln switching between the hot spots um [noise] you you know what you okay ... you know what you could possibly get and I don't know of arise in you know would give you a deal on or sometimes if you complain loud enough you get it for free\nThat you may be able to get a little what's called a ... for your house and so it's kind of like a repeat or off of the cell tower itself\nAnd but the thing with the ... and this is why I kinda went I don't know about the Comcast is that if Comcast is using other ... cells to increase your reception and your bars I don't know if I like that either\nSo my first recommendation we go back to horizon and say listen I Need to have some type of Microsoft or something that you can I can put inside my house that will repeat the signal from the tower that you have nearest me so I get a stronger signal and then they'll say no we can't do that because you're only talking to a rap\nBut if you get up into a manager a supervisor level and explain to them that you're paying for the service and you're not getting everything that they promised sometimes you can get it for free if not that it's like a hundred maybe two hundred\nBucks okay okay now let's talk a little bit about the cell phone towers is that\nEven though like for rising and AT and T and Comcast or maybe they can share cell towers they often use different frequencies in technologies so they're not actually sharing the hardware on the tower makes sense\nOkay huh um\nAnd they're usually own now the towers are owned by a leasing company not even by the provider anymore because the providers figured out that they could sell the uh the towers and they don't have to carry that debt and they can make more money so the thing that you couldn't go back to Comcast with his day you know\n... which frequency is Comcast on the tower and how does that compare of arrives in so that this is not that you're going to know what all this means but just this way if the numbers are different than you know that that it should be\nYou might be better in ...\nAnd Comcast senses of cable companies some of this band with maybe coming off the cable to now there is hope on the horizon\nAnd the hope on the horizon is five gee\nAnd it's supposed to get better for all of us that are having cell phone problems um because basically you're talking on for gee you're talking about one gig in bed or per second speed versus\nOn five gee you're talking about multiple database and so you know couple of solutions that you might wanna try before you just dumped ... do you think you could call ask one of your neighbors if they have Comcast\n[noise] I could try that we don't have real real close neighbor from afraid of on [laughter] I knew that we know but um [noise] but I could try that\nBecause sometimes you know and and of course you know they may say it's great and then you get it and then you're mileage make very right if I could be you know here's where I'm at you know what you might want to do\nIs explain Comcast what the problem is have Comcast to turn turn on the line you try it for a couple of days see how it works\nExplained to them I don't want to sign up for a long term contract right now I Want to be able to at least ten and put my tone or see what I'm getting and you know let me tell you something the cable companies are struggling right now they'll do anything to keep occurring customers to get a customer so again you might have to escalate this a little\nBit up higher but it's definitely\nSomething that you might want to take a look at doing just having a conversation\nAnd Karen thank you so much for your call Gary in South bend hello there Gary what's going on\n[noise] are you doing I'm looking for an app that I can securely son among to a private party\nUm [noise] I was in a small car accident and rather than go through the insurance on career center it's a ... it's a friend of mine who like to take care of it Kurt solely sure I'm I'm just sort of course secure after that I can send her all payments or I'm\nNot not something that I'll use all the time that\nSomething I can periodicals down here in the ...\nUh you know a couple of ways you can do it you know [noise]\nJust just a rule of thumb was when you're sending money to friends be you know you have to be really careful make sure that you have everything done correctly because they don't issue refunds okay\nA couple of options you've have Google Wallet you'll have pay pal and one of the most popular ones out there now is something called the ... and all of them charged two point nine percent as far as to make this wire transfer a busy exceptional pay pal they charge two point nine percent plus thirty cents\nBut if you're looking for a safe secure way you don't want to give out your checks or maybe you don't even have a bank account anymore\nAnd that you want to take a look at as I mentioned Google Wallet probably pay pal is the one that's most commonly used then mow it seems to be getting a lot of traction though as time goes on Gary thank you for your call it the right where you are we have our money to coming up and more of your phone calls that you don't want to miss here on the Kim commando show [noise]\nLord memory on merit digital cameras\n\nOver the years I've tried and tested every way that average people can and should back of the debt on their computers\nI'll tell you that I drive is simply the best climbed back upstairs there is for big reasons why first it's the easiest to use I back up everything all my computers smartphones I pass tablets everything to one single I drive a ... second it's the most secure with Dr ...\nAnd then you buy the lock and then it connects to a hub okay so you have like a smart things have or you have what would I have is the next year up okay\nThen within the next year Hubbard is where things have you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like if you wanted certain lights to come on and the middle you know say from eleven PM to six am when nobody's there so at least illuminates maybe it's less likely for somebody to break in\nIs that you can program the lives for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nAnd that there are water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so once you once you get the hub Charlie's what I'm saying is that once you get the hobby started thinking about OK\nWhat more can I add to that sprang it is so good absolutely\nYou know so if there are there any other things that we can for a couple of hundred bucks because that's all you're talking about\nRight that they are that's awesome idea\nYeah then it might be worth it okay so when you start looking at different products the smart thing so this is where it gets confusing is that you've got the wave and dignity\nThose are different standards\nIn different products the smart things so this is where it gets confusing is that you've got the wave and dignity and those are different standards\nAre ... and that works with the smartest things next yeah everything works like um I have a a train air conditioner that I can control remotely you know on the next year or so so\nSo that's what I'm trying to it so I'm trying to expand your horizons so once we have the hub what else can we do is that a\nLot of things yeah it's exciting I mean it's really cool to doctors all states with the holograms charter Allegra\nAndhra don't you think that you and I would be excellent at doing like a theatre version of the game commando show absolutely agree making a musical\nWell I don't know I can think commando them he was that one but I don't [laughter]\nI don't think we'd go past one I have no memory just so anyway popular demand one that I don't think in in great in Canada that was [laughter] we didn't even make into like Lincoln Broadway in Tempe that was it that's off off off off horses\nRuns wet or the ... it's more intimate but but yeah absolutely [laughter]\nAll right so the next the assistance going to set you back eight dollars and Ninety nine cents a month or I'd say that's it not a big deal so I'll take a look at the there's the the ... cents and connect\nOK okay the next ... about sixty bucks the lock is going to set you back a hundred and fifty and then you're looking at say just for giggles ten bucks a month and then\nIt allows you to program all those codes get reports whose common and what's going on with that and then if you could set it for twenty four hours and then and if somebody does do you think something was wrong you can just kill that code it killed it automatically there's no delay\nYou can also un slit\nYeah you can set up a code really ... you know if you're if you're doing anything remotely\nA really makes sense that you start looking at smart stuff an order to be notified and get alerts and good things like that hey Charlie thank you for your call and keep us posted on what's going on and
