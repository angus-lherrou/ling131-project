the book is about evil and and my contention is that most Americans don't understand evil my mother didn't she lived a very I I\nRead your life yeah cheese on me which is obviously\nBut she loved me and thought I was good\nSo they didn't understand evil right right\nSo we're seeing so much evil in America are we not um you know people walking into schools and gunning down kids or clerics abusing children um Chicago where thousands of people are shot by drug gangs and nothing's done opioid epidemic through the roof\nThis is all evil it centered on evil and so I wrote that says with an eye on explaining to the reader\nI mean I Can't speculate on that I can just I Know I'm pretty good at at a value waiting the\nMood of the country and you may remember that five days before the election of two thousand sixteen I predicted Trump would win and I predict it because people didn't like Hillary Clinton and would stay home I mean a that was my\nBest that I ever did in ... right now I Am feeling it\nEverywhere I go I Know a lot of people I'm Around okay that the regular folks know this was a sham and they know the cabin on his family were damaged very badly by people who didn't care to see the truth they know that\nThat I think will play out at all politics but you got to remember is a powerful powerful corrupt lobby that is driving me to thing and the media\nIs like what ... what was like this is still a brand new but then the second\nMr Grassley\nHis hair was that I I Believe okay also to\nMishaps and\nUm\nYou have to understand that the media in conjunction with the fanatics Israel and powerful powerful to drive\nSay can I only have to hold on to stop hold on\nJust or hell or she's a no campus ... yes being is the big one\nMurkowski coming in ...\n... and\nIs there a gym\nDistrict Kennedy\nHow's he was a big one is clear which or\nMr marking the ... what did you mentioned\nThis is McCaskill Murkowski\nInstrument end as almost there\nThis summer and coming right\nSilence so we do nothing Murphy will know soon which you know we didn't\nKnow on a mansion or Murkowski those are the two very interesting\nOne is is strange I'm watching all of the networks and none of them are catching the vote so no one is\nYeah\nNorth of New York times or we're looking at all the sites right now to see what the nobody knows\nDon't know yeah yeah yeah have you on this kind of has a you know they're going to the closed debate\nBaltimore all and I do believe a cabinet will be confirmed [noise] um nobody wants to be on the wrong side of this and the winds are blowing against the Democrats now the winds have shifted\nBill is on the on the winds shifting don't you think I mean this the first time I've ever seen this tactic by the Democrats backfire on them\nI don't know the Clarence Thomas stuff was pretty rough um and I think that\nA African Americans at the time will pretty angry about it but it that of course the dissipated once he got on the court the question is if Kavanaugh is confirmed more or less all go away we'll people just say okay the good guys one and then we're not\nReal are interested in punishing the Democrats I don't think so anymore I don't think I just think people are so furious I think they're gonna they're gonna take it out on the\n... I think the Democrats think that they control the bees the activist they really think that they can you know ... you know turn 'em on and turn them off you know I Know they do but I think they're approaching a time when they're not going to be able to turn them off\nA ... I don't see it that way there's a there is very well organized you're going to get individuals that confront people in restaurants or ... like\nThat you're going to have that and somebody might get hurt\nBut are they organized front these people are very disappointing and there's about a dozen organizations now that we're money's flooding into disrupt the process on the part\nOf the far left then by the ... Iraq yet with um one thing a couple of things here are Collins one of the big ones are yes ... and ... so yeah and in the ass so\nI'm I'm sure Murkowski was a yes and mentioned I don't know that that's an interesting\nOr in the middle of looking at that right now and bill do you think that they just overplayed their hand oh yeah I really like they could have had it they could have had Murkowski they could have had Collins if they really played this seriously but instead they overplay their hand to an incredible generally\nAbsolutely and they didn't have what they didn't have 'em look I went through this and and all the all of a sudden I Everytime I turned around there was somebody else and the ...\nYou know was a true mhm All right so what they thought would that more people were going to come out\nAnd and point a finger at them and and or somebody was going to bolster Ford's party statement about oh yeah I was at that party and I saw this happen where do they have the Lou how he threw it out there the less accepted it as fact and made it easier for people to come through and then you add avid ... and all these other crazy people\nPiling on and and the and the left said look this is what usually happens but here um you know with the FBI involvement and you know pretty strong statement by Kavanaugh\nKavanaugh saved himself he ate it and you know one of the things that I couldn't do in a way to save myself because they didn't want they being far need to address it yes ma'am I couldn't save myself cabin or did\nYou uh we had a ... I live with turned it really does look like a ... mansion has voted yes on Kavanaugh\nSays that means that having a that mansions gonna vote to confirm him mhm and the reason mansions doing that is because if he voted against quicker cabinet along that he might lose the\nElection or the people of West Virginia now do we do have one no vote from Lisa Murkowski Murkowski's out a mansion is in playing in Collins is in a this would just should be enough for him to get confirmed\nBecause if it's a tie and Pence breaks it\nMurkowski votes against Kavanaugh she's through in the Republican Party\nShe's finished won't get a nickel I'm from any Republican and I believe that ... or send a clear will be over I think of the people of Alaska very conservative state will throw her out\nDo you think Joe or do you think a bill that we have with a um with Murkowski the situation where she knew it was going to go through we wanted to vote no was able to vote no because she knew they had the fifty votes\n[noise] doesn't matter just a no vote going against every single one of her colleagues\nMhm\nIsolates her and puts her as a poli a word of the day I Am\nA and the Republican Party has and came\nThat that's an amazing situation I didn't think Murkowski was put her entire career risk ... over this\nBut I'm currently she uh she could vote yes tomorrow\nHow how though she's voting not to advance the nomination to the floor\nWell now she voted yes I Want to confirm it\nBecause I didn't think that it should go forward but now it's gone forward and so now I'm going to because a lot of people are calling my office and I'm afraid I'm afraid for my career I Do I'm going to vote yes\nMaybe ... a a that's a pretty tough line and yeah I don't think is going to do it\nAnd it's interesting point him in that one of the most shocking vote results of that I can remember my entire lifetime was Lisa Murkowski beating Joe Miller on a write in ballots are in that Senate campaign in several years ago does Alaska reward Murkowski after this with another election I mean I don't\nThink so I don't think so they are very independent they are conservative but they're very independent uh and we'll wait and see Bill thanks so much Bill O'Reilly does have a good weekend you guys go talk to you next week alright [noise] let me tell you about the greatest chair of all time is\nVX chair a the ex chair is a an office chair I have for uh my other studio we had to get another chair for the studio\nBought the next year they have become advertisers are in the in the around the same time and now we have them in here as well no difference I was sitting in the yesterday I was doing the live TV show\nAnd I was sitting in a chair and I thought this is the most comfortable chair I think I've ever sat him for an office chair where you're you know you want to be supportive and set up I mean\nYou know I don't know if you've tried the cloud which is this the worst looking couch ever\nA because it just looks like a bean bag chair but it's really really comfortable with no support\nThat's comfortable this is great if you are sitting in it for work because you're just sitting up naturally you're sitting up straight and its supportive and comfortable and it looks great too it was a big difference I mean\n... drawn in ... raising the standard of living doesn't matter and Rush Limbaugh increasing the number of people at work and raising wages bonuses being granted and\nNone of those things I decided which at for additional event and the magic you gotta have today we're told doesn't that Rush Limbaugh and no one via a news tone Ninety five point five\nFrom the ... environments duty a CD you well am nine Seventy ...

not care yeah you just don't carry your skill in pain you just don't care as\nManaging and there does seem to be a legitimate medical use for a lot of people to use opioids in that if you do get a different than you you can get addicted to oil they can't hit me I can do your body it's only normal your body gets addicted\nAnd it's held to get off of it I don't know about you but my doctors are

guess and getting drugs from somebody else and you don't have anything in your system but what's supposed to be there almost every time I go I get a drug test\nSeriously ha ha ... and ... how interesting allegation right yeah the idea that different doctors would have different approaches to a particular medical ailment is not surprising right like\nYou would go to a doctor because you think they're treating it better than maybe somebody else no there's no doctor shopping I well that's what that what I'm saying is the search for doctor shopping allegations can sometimes encompass some people\nWho are yeah do you own something legitimate yeah yeah but there are a lot of people who will go and try to get you know whatever they can from somebody or their their pernicious drugs but it's like anything is the Internet bad no right it can be\nCan be are are these opioids bad and you know be it can be I mean it's it's like anything with real power\nAnd in the hands of each human you have the choice you can use them to alleviate pain or you can use them the way they're not supposed to be used and it's a very hard thing but you just gotta be rock solid and it it it is hard it's

and\nAs I was looking through esoteric 'cause you're Montreal and as I was looking at the sacred numbers and the techno signatures of God in the Old Testament I realized\nThat the numbers to sixteen

beginning and again that equals to sixteen and full reduction English\n... and so you go down the list and you look at the one hundred and forty four thousand American Signature in the book of revelation has been interpreters twelve thousand anointed\nOnes that are representing the twelve tribes these numbers are connected to what happens after the opening of the six seal the dispensation

six six to sixteen to sixteen to sixteen adding food items so the numbers when you put them altogether creates the big black Cuba\nOr the oracle of God some say it's the either the benevolent God some say it has the eyes of Saturn Ryan gave all with us on ground zero you know there's a lot of ah indications that he sat in return or or something is about the fall of his country we're looking at uh the changing of the guard and the beginning of what is called the war footing\n... what do you see in the future and what and and how does the black Cuba apply here\nWhile the black keep applies to Saturn specifically because for many reasons one NASA J. P. L. Cal Tech\nTook an image in fact many many scientists have or have had a look at these images many researchers had a look at these images and found the famous hexagon storm on the north pole of the planet Saturn that was photographed by Cassini the one I'm looking at here in two thousand and twelve\nAnd this is a huge massive hexagon storm while the hexagon has six sides and inside of that if you take the corners then you draw a line to them you get the ... the six sided star the number of man is six six sided star otherwise known as the star of David\nIs combining of the upright and the downward triangle\nThe F word in the downward triangle represent the Dallas and the challenges\nThey represent alpha and omega the merging of the masculine and feminine it's a symbol of alchemy it's the symbol of the emerging of two polar opposites that come together for a unified oh and that is the\nGoal of alpha [noise] to move through these like the seven classic planted the seven to ... to move through these different gates in order to be stripped of worldly or desires and worldly things materialism\nSymbol of lead it is the ... of Saturn the star of David and this is a combination Clyde of male and female energy it's a combination of fire and water the fallacy of the challenges and so\nIt is the goal of the outcome is to transform the base metal led into gold or to slay the great niece and achieve in late ... through this trans mutation and so what all this means\nIs the base metal is the base shock rough and through that rising of consciousness that some called the Qunu leaning students are able to transmit led into gold noticed the ... and the rising of this consciousness is the movement of the solar spirit\nThrough the seven spheres or gates of the classical planets from beginning to end alpha and omega and it is the distortion\nOf this power that suppresses man so that there are those\nThings those entities those things we talk about Clyde those parasites that feed like of empires off of the depravity right and I think as you were talking about earlier on on Alex Jones a show I think that is what is suppressing mankind and we're being suppressed from this understanding\nAnd that's why what we see these types of things in movies and TV and entertainment we give our attention and energy to it but we see distorted versions of it and we're scared of things like the Pentagon were scared of things that otherwise are very powerful symbols that could help\nTo break the constraints that this system has over our mind body and soul\nMany of these symbols have been associated with that even the crosses associate or death\nIt would have MS go is associated with that but yet all of these deaths symbols have always had their connections to life as I was talking while I was actually relating in my article I said isn't it interesting that\nSalvador Dali in Nineteen fifty four did a a a painting called crucifixion corpus hyper Cuba X or high ... high recoup Cuba is\nAnd in it he basically hung what looked like a a you know as it is the fiction of Christ and across across was a ... but it was a Cuban cross it wasn't a a regular cross it showed the dimensions of the cube and if you look at a word of the cross was\nIn in a relationship to history it was on a show called calvary\nAnd Calgary was a representation of across now ... and the ... the skull and as I was reading on I realized that the school they're talking about a calorie is the scope of Goliath and Goliath was in ... and the Napoli was a descendant of the dark of the of the fallen angels\nAnd so when it said that Christ was on the cross and the skull was below speed he literally bruised the head of the descendants of the fallen ones and and so are these symbols of the cross the cube the skull all of them are sacred symbols that have been perverted and distorted over the over time\nAnd the cross also if you turn it sideways you get the ax and what the axis is a combination before they're superimposed over each other\nOf the upside down and the upright triangle which is the male and the female and the scholar bones interestingly enough if you look at where that comes from it comes from the temple lawyers many temp players were buried and since\nThey were buried in smaller ... the bones would be taken the thigh bones and they'd be placed up near the skull so you'd have a skull and you'd have the crossbones the Johnny run and win that Ted samplers began robbing British ships they flew the skull and bones as a symbol of death and in Scotland bones at Yale University and the frame of sonic order\nThey use the skeleton they use Ellen bones but it's not a worshipping of death it's actually a very humbling usage of this symbolism because it's a reminder to live life morally to live life well the death it'd be around the corner so it's not an evil symbol as you said ...\nIt's ... it's symbolic though of of how\nBoth the uh the sacred and the profane come together in confusion and with the confusion comes division ... division comes perversion and this is why I think it's important that these symbols are as as they're showing themselves now they're giving us indication of and like I said on our show the show today I said it's giving us an indication\nOf a war footing and we don't know if it's brinkmanship we'd over saber rattling but it's certainly a war or division of some kind that would certainly bring turmoil for at least\nMaybe who knows how long but it just seems that we are in a time of tension and we need to rely on prophecy we need to rely on ah the numbers the symbols and and use them as a I guess you could call them or uncles to find a way out of this darkness\nYeah and it's interesting because I read through your your your introduction your monologue and I was thinking about what you were writing in there and also what you said today earlier on the radio and I've said this for many years institutional religion promises us salvation through faith\nInstitutional science likewise promises a salvation through faith but more specifically salvation through technology and it seems to be no matter where we look for salvation we're always looking ex turn a labor looking or vicarious atonement their ex turn all means\nAnd in the essence of the mysteries the cult teaching the esoteric teaching the secret teachings that focuses on the elevation of the soul spirit for materialism to ... and if you will trends mutation ... and it does that internally because for example science is the study and structure of the physical\nIt's anti science it's not the same kind of science as mainstream orthodoxy because mythology for example is a form of science all the branches of mythology all the symbols all the character types all the arc types\nAll those methodologies are just ... from a single source is what is called a complex polytheism all of the different gods and goddesses\nAre really branches of the same tree and because of that Clyde if we define the word life I always found this interesting life\nIs defined as the capacity for growth reproduction functional activity and continue will change proceeding death\nBy that definition fire air water earth all our lives and they were all given\nCharacteristics and the form of the salamander this lift the wounding and the no right and the mythological characters quite as I'm sure you know have just been carried over today and the science nitrogen oxygen hydrogen and carbon\nAnd once again to go back to the carbon base of mankind's these protons neutrons and electrons which of course the numbers\nTo sixteen the number of God the numbers cube the number of demand the number of the beast and the number of the false prophet all of these things come together and we need to pay attention to these numbers and symbols and we need to use them for good rather than perverting them for the evil and about in the world\nThat's exactly right and that is the essence of all of the mystery schools and all the secret teachings before they were perverted by those same sources that today promises salvation through technology through faith or some external means that further traps the sole spirit in the material world in the black cue\nAnd using it it was like he was a metaphor for space the metaphor for the universe the metaphor of of the city of God even ah we we neglected that we we talked about the more we talked about all these other things we see in science fiction for the city of God you must remember is a Cuba\nAnd and the and the symbol ah represents a destruction in some regard and rebuilding in genesis and another so the re genesis rebuilding after the destruction is the most important theme of all the resurrection envy coming together\nDeath and then the resurrection of coming together and the ... refurbishing and renewing and and paradise if you will have the promise that will be with all the numbers as they create the sum total of all things in the universe\nAnd Saturn is a God of destruction but it is a necessary destruction and a necessary evil the stories in mythology of Saturn sitting in the field and\nWatching a flower die but once the flower dies Saturn makes room for more flowers to bloom in blossom now that is a necessary evil however I think like many people have hijacked\nThat concept they have hijacked\nThat idea and they have applied those ideas through science and through many other means\nSo that what is a natural has been made into something synthetic\nAnd so as you were saying earlier that's why I don't want to say scientists but that's why the engineers and the scientists behind things like AI\nContinue sport despite all the warnings even within their own community because they are playing God they want to be Saturn but they are not a Saturn that will decide what lives and dies to bring about new life it is a Saturn that decides I Will live and everybody else will be subservient to me that and that is\nIs true and and you know a lot of people don't realize that when we are approaching Halloween and we approached Thanksgiving we approach the feast of the winter and of course Christmas\nAll of those holidays will actually the new year Christmas or not withstanding with all the holidays combined or what we're actually the holidays is the SAT in return
