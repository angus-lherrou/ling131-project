October Fifteen you're listening to that Glenn Beck program\nAcademic grieving studies and the corruption of scholarship\nPart one introduction something has gone wrong in the university especially in certain fields within the humanities scholarship at base less up on finding truth and more upon attending to social grievances\nHas become firmly established if not fully dominant within these fields and there are scholars increasingly that bully students administrators and other departments into adhering to their world view\nSo Dr James Lindsey a along with a couple of other friends decided you know I let's find out what this is all about let's see what the lines are and they learned an awful lot um they learned something\nA quite valuable that you just can't get away with anything you have to fall into a a set pattern really Dr James Lindsey a is joining us now he is a thinker he's not a philosopher but he is a thinker which I like a doctorate in math\nOr background or in physics uh James how are you sir\nGood Glenn how are you\nHave good um so tell us what you were tell us what you were trying to do what were you trying to prove\nWell we were looking into these fields to find out whether or not their scholarship has gotten so kind of ideological bias that if we put forth I'm really absurd arguments or that they might you\nBe willing to publish though so long as they've felt fell in line with the political views that they seem to be forwarding and plays a scholarship\nSo the first you didn't you didn't really understand the political view part right because the first few the studies that you use submitted a you've got back they were rejected\nYeah um well it's not quite that actually we I think we understood the and the need for a scholarship we started this project out and as you said we got the first several papers are back rejected we started in August by Thanksgiving ... literally Thanksgiving a\nDay of are we really realized we were in trouble um we weren't getting anywhere with trying to hope that the problem wasn't we didn't understand the politics so much although there's still a lot to\nThere and there was for us to a very complicated they call it a matrix of domination that you have to understand um but it was more that we actually we're not trying to work their scholarship and so there are two things that are needed\nTo to get these papers and one is that you actually have to understand what they call scholarship you have to do it according to their rules you you have to understand the concepts you're working with\nThey have to understand what they call scholarship you have to do it according to their rules you you have to understand the concepts you're working with\nAnd present them ineligible eat and then you also have to

came up with this or how you guys came up with these ah but they're fantastic oh let's go through some of them one by one let's start with the first one dog park\nThe or the thesis is dog parks are re rape condoning spaces\nTell me ... tell me about it\nWas kind of funny actually I'm I'll tell ya story um when I went to we we all got together to to have this ... public as best we could so I went to Portland we all went to Portland, Oregon\nToo I'm\nReady for this project to come out to the public can we went to the dog park on the first day I got there almost right I got off the plane I took over next\nThing you know I'm walking Peters out there for the dog park\nWith a filmmaker and uh we get to the dog park and there's this just dogs they're living out the paper it was crazy this dog was fighting the other dog's hunting them down\nHunting them left right and center the the owner comes over ... the things the ball thrower at now he wasn't being abusive and then he says stop hunting and then we get to as I lean over to the filmmaker and kind of monitor\nThat gets a little too loudly that maybe we should start interrogating people about their sexuality given much is going down here and then this lady yells out to me oh no no it's okay she's the girl dog and I was like oh man this papers happening for real\n[laughter] so what is what is the thesis\nSays the thesis was all the original idea behind a thesis was that we should write a feminist paper arguing that we should train man the way that we train dogs to prevent rape culture and so\nI thought that they thought it was pretty funny when I was brainstorming ideas for papers sure\nTo Peter Peter takes his dog the dog park every day\nI'm ... said let's work and some of the stuff from the dog park and as we started working in just you know absolutely absurd ideas from what might be considered the most ridiculous dog park in the world\nOr the paper grew into that and so we made it about so called queer performed a pivotal in human reactions at the park and then ended up including things like that ... we we should build a leash man likely least dogs ...\nTo prevent rape except if not politically feasible and uh gosh it would be great if we could could put shot colors on men\nBut that's not okay either so we have to shock them out of you know hitting on women by screaming at them to scare them and get them from their behavior we the thesis of the paper was though that humans\nReacted differently to gay dog hunting as opposed to stray dog hunting and men were far worse about this than women\nThen we concluded that this is indicative of race culture and we called the dog park rape condoning a St Louis\nNightclubs we said rate nightclubs are also rape condoning spaces was no evidence for that whatsoever\nWe [laughter] um\nSo that was pretty out there um that one was was really out there I think it's I don't know maybe the one about the the\nFeminist spiritual spirituality meetings and poetry is a little more out there but it's probably close to the most\nWell LOU LOU finished the dog park this one was accepted and reviewed uh some of the reviews is a wonderful paper incredibly innovative rich and analysis extremely well written in organized\nA yadda yadda I Believe this ah intellectually and imperial ... exciting paper must be published and congratulated the author on the research done\nAnd in the writer and in the right yeah yeah that that load of the most disturbing parts of this I feel like because ... again it wasn't like these ... these journals looked at this and didn't really go through it and kind of just ... it made its way through the process there are very specific comments from dozens\nOf reviewers who are on the ... who are doing peer review in saying specific things that you wrote that are completely ridiculous are amazing new accomplishments in the field I mean that had to be wild funny and improved your point had to be really disturbing as well\nOh yeah that that's by far what we consider to be the most important evidence that we gathered in the process of of this project with that the papers got published or that they got awards in some cases they're one case and all of this is fine and it says a lot and it's disturbing\nBut the reviewers comments show that these were peer reviewers which really worked out between two and four or five or paper so we ended up with something like forty five or fifty total a set of comments\nThey they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they ... ...\nSet our analysis was good winter analysis was terrible they didn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that um you know the dog park paper contains\nA bit of a completely irrelevant evidence about where dogs go to the bathroom and unauthorized ways as we were today and it's completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody raised\nAn eyebrow about how ridiculous that is um they were concerned however that we indicates that we're human not dogs so that we can be sure that we don't\nClaim that when a dog there was a ... ... thing of another dog whether or not the dogs they go home to want it or not because how could\nWe know that as being [noise] ... [noise] and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little\nVideo we put out to announce the project they're really concerned with the fact\nThat we respect that dogs privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um [laughter]\nAnd we went out and right now [laughter] so what what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... what I mean\nYou got me man\n[laughter] and then it was done in the privacy of a of a veterinary office I Know [laughter] okay\nUm let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nAre the the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which that is displayed politically so the fat as just considered another to issue a that equal with muscle and to say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people\nFat phobic as they call it [laughter] ... and that was accepted\nThat was accepted that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um especially because\nExcept it yeah that was accepted that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar let us use his identity who wrote that reclaim drove the paper you actually as a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind to this guy being the author of this paper for a body building was just kind of all areas\n[laughter] because that's another thing to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking ... wouldn't have\nI think so I mean those kind of a this is a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the to the we use here but honestly scholarship to stand or fall on its merit you know on who did it and so\nA lot of people are are making that point and we deliberately chose names that would be hard to find in a Google Search in effect which was very common names on purpose I actually used\nA or a roll dice to pick it up for off of a list of\nThe most common name for a certain years than some of the way that would blend in with lots of people up here you hang on hang on I got to take another break and come back and and finished about why ... why you thought that was important that can go through some of the\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom and got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo they decided it didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working and social justice\nSide or the fields topics\nCourses I guess is the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff who would take up some degree of these suggestions as\nYou know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to the gold standard journal this wasn't some fringe of journal in education and this was the gold entered feminists philosophy journal had Asia that we were working with here\nWhich is where a lot of the literature this like this already exists which you don't mind me going on a little bit this this kind of what's happening I'm we think that what's happening here is kind of in the equivalent with ideas of money laundering ... called idea laundry\nOh so they take they take these these bad\nIdeas some of which are just\nOpinion some of them are prejudiced some of them are genuinely terrifying like this educational thing\nAnd then they launder them through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge so you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or we've basis program on studies that show well that's fine when the studies or could but when the studies\nAre coming from a place they can't tell a truth from from prejudice and opinion it becomes a real problem\n[noise] teams one of the other ones I found um disturbing or was the uh H. O. H. two ... two was was accepted can you explain get explained this one\nYeah that paper was accepted by high pay showed the singer and I was just mentioning that patriot stood for folks on hoaxes so it was a hoax paper we wrote that was about writing academic hoaxes that code namely gave for convenience or they argue is that that you can only properly criticize\nThings that go against social justice and in particular you can only use humor to make fun of or or do satire to deflate\nThat which goes against social justice if you use humor against social justice if you criticize social justice what that means as you never really properly engaged consider your criticism and that's one of the ... it's just a set of of\nFields is that they don't accept criticism if you tried to criticize them they say that it's a privilege preserving epidemic pushback that a scholar named Allison bally hoos huge\nIn the education of literature they say it's white fragility that's Robin to Angelo who has just had a big book published on that this year but it introduced the concept in twenty eleven which says that if\nI'm somebody with privilege it's been particularly white people for her work uh is challenged so that their privileges putting the question that they are fragile and don't know how to deal with it because their privilege made them weak they don't know how to psychologically deal with having that challenge and they act out in anger or grief or something like that\nAnd trying to maintain their privilege and so\nThese ideas are already getting out there who just took him to step further\nAnd didn't ... yeah it's interesting guy because the one about hoaxes he is interesting in that if ... to criticize what you guys did they would almost half just cite your paper as that was the idea yeah\nAnd ... and I've asked ... to stand by the paper that they accept it and publish or right names they haven't responded yet but we'll see what they do I'm that way indeed people who want to criticize our project from a position of interest in all salmon has some will need to cite cost in order to criticize us\n[laughter] I can we get one more to Glen ... on the you talked about this on the scary front at the feminist mine pomp a\nWell you also did the white man mine copied it to one of his was accepted in the white man wasn't\nRight correct correct tell me about them\nSo I'll do though the white one first because they didn't get in it was much more frightening it was written in from the position of an auto West Nile graffiti where the researcher is reflecting on in the states her own experience\nAs a white ... her own white mass and it was rejected partly because the scholarship wasn't quite er which is the case in all of the papers but also because the position that the author as a good white\nRather than being sufficiently ... or whatever to critical race Amir eats 'em so there was there was an explicitly political reasoning behind why it was was rejected and it was that the the author as a white woman was trying to make herself look good\nBy criticizing her own white asked was was one of the main reason the feminist one was\nWell hold on just a second hold on just saying then that took mind the parts of mine come where he was talking about Jews and replace the words Jews with ah with whites\nYeah in that case it was either whites are white and this and then we edited the text around it and added a whole bunch of literature and rewarded things so get past plagiarism\nCheck and things like that so yeah that was a bit started with scanning through my income\nPicking out passages about the Jews and replacing Jews with whites are white mass\nShootings and editing around it uh the feminist one didn't do it quite the same way the feminist one was not about it didn't take Jews out and replace it with with men for example that\nIncome where Hitler explains the need for the Nazi Party as chapter twelve and what its members would be expected to a whole to and including especially the sacrifices that they have to make to the Nazis\nAnd we replaced our movement the party et cetera he doesn't mention Nazis specifically in that chapter or we replace that with intersection of feminism more solidarity or ally ... something to do with with the feminist movement and criticize the idea that uh some feminists do\nWhat they call choice feminism which is the idea that if a woman is living her own life the way she wants to and considers that to be a statement of feminism\nThan she is doing feminism it feminist for women to have you know full agency and make their own choices in the world that's what this paper was criticizing\nSaying that no no responsibility if they really want to consider themselves feminists is to be to make sacrifices and stand in solidarity with other oppressed people particularly of you know women of color or women of other marginalized status as\nJames [noise] couple of quick questions um they\nHad to be one of those things that you entered into and hope that you were wrong and when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later going\nGood God this is bad am I right\nThat is exactly that is exactly right so especially with the ... paper I think the one that got accepted um\nThe idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine copy of course do I mean as you are one to one thing uh\nThe ... the the politics\nI'm Glad I get to talk to you about that if I can because politics of grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic left as we were trying to demonstrate we called the stuffed grievance studies we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided a politically right now I was\nReally happy to talk to you because I mean I don't want to get in touch with you but you're real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this all May of ...\nAbout how things were going where you are under Obama's time and I thought that was huge and I was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation it's on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know or people on the left were left liberals I'm not ashamed to say that I Know you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right\nThat's great I'm we're on the left me to take responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that\nYou know or left wing people who want the left to come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all star I think you know people in general I get a lot of sense that people send me emails about this now all the time especially um\nWe're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to production politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media sphere as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't ... remember you know you are an American I'm an American your person I'm a person we have ... most of the things that we think income and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences\nBut I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society in a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working at the details and I really hope that you know that our projects kinda reaches reaches that point does that make sense\nIt totally does I I Am I I hate to say that too I'm Out of time it could I invite you to come down and uh and do a pod cast with me from you know when you spend an hour and a half uninterrupted a and just\nStart where we've just left off yeah I Would love that it would be great great\nJames thank you so much a for\nFrom a line on the line from Miami is going\nTo rush

the polling models that they have working right now uh five thirty eight has one which they have um the ... the chance of Republicans maintaining their current amount of seats at less than zero point one percent\nOr you might say oh well they've gotten you know there was issues with dating a Trump right which is a big thing every time I talk about polls were like oh well they didn't get truck right well first of all the national polls were almost exactly dead on for Donald Trump or it just didn't get the ah electoral college right but that also wasn't what they were pulling and right and some of the states were were obviously wrong\nBut for example uh five thirty I Believe had about thirty percent chance that they thought Donald Trump or when they're saying there was a point one percent less than a point one percent chance that the Republicans will maintain the same amount of house seats in the house in fact they are saying the\nEqual chance that Republicans maintain the same amount of seats as Democrats gaining eighty three seats\nNow both of those are extreme outliers right like I don't think either one of those is going to happen right but the chances of of of the of the Democrats just controlling the houses are about eighty percent again more certain if you want to use those words\nA law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff started reading\nKicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and and the mayor\n... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police this decision not to intervene how\nHow how can you how can you support that decision I I don't\nI mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any worse he's trying to make it\nSound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right\nThey they act and they're just thugs they don't act and their do nothing's\nSo they have no way to win\nA great observation there are two a political parties and whatever you do one of them might criticize you yes that you that this is the job of being a mayor I get the job of being a leader you're supposed to\nActually have an idea and do something in which I think he did by the way I think you're right it would you would not speak is dismayed right when you say for public consumption that is exactly what he's doing yes his his opinion is oh jeez where we're damned if we do damned if we don't\nBut in reality what he wants is a is much more on this side but yeah the ...\nMore on the ads up outside and you can back that up with how he reacted to the FBI\nThe FBI building in Portland is ... is under siege for ... to ... I mean think of the balls on these guys they take the FBI building and block it off so FBI agents are are now trapped inside the building\nThey say uh we've got a call the mayor why I'm calling you dispatch police we have to call the mayor the mayor goes on and says if the FBI thinks that this city is going to back them up there in the wrong city\n... excuse me what what ... so the FBI\nHad to get federal officers to come in and get everybody out of that building and into safety\nSounded nothing Portland did nothing to these guys that I mean whoa what is this\nIt's a I mean it's it's close to anarchy right and certainly the way that that you think it would come if it does it say you know the idea that you the FBI can't depend on police officer forget the FBI just these are people are these are actual real individuals who are in danger or and\nThat was a woman who has the food carts across the street from the FBI um she was a a threatened with an inch of her life\nThat I think they've had to move out of the city her and her family um they took her stuff destroyed it or threatened the neighbors who are coming down trying to you know stick up for\nI mean they're just that they've become animals they become animals and their claim these are they're streets now they're not\nThey're not punk it'd be paid for them\nBecause I think a lot of the people who are trying to make it to work are the ones who actually paid for it your streets since when\nBut read enough history\nUsually people are who are um\nYou know national socialists or Marxist radicals of some sort they're in power and they let this they let this stuff and go until the people have had enough\nAnd then they do what they want with those people and they you know use those people as cover to seize even more power that's the way it works on a national scale I have no idea what this Portland mayor is doing\nBut it's insane meanwhile Alex ... Alec Baldwin who uh has a new show on where where's this new show starting to you know\nA head to own top the top of my head I think it's yeah it's got a new show ABC ABC jeez yeah so he's got a new show on ABC that of course he's on NBC all the time a he's a he was just giving a speech or over the weekend and he was talking about you know\n... you know the elections I Want to make sure it's a clear it's elections but he did say we need to overthrow this government and the government of Donald Trump\nMaybe we should watch what we're saying\nFor most Americans your home is the biggest investment that you will ever make and that's why a real estate agents I trust dot com is working right there with you\nThey'll make a significant difference in the outcome of buying or selling your home with over Fifteen hundred agents nationwide who have who share your sensibilities and we've all been personally vetted and hand picked for their knowledge their skill and their track record\nA there these are the people that are going to sell your home I just saw a report today that the number one job that people have as a second job of you know I'm just going to do this on the side\nIs real estate\nYou don't do don't work with somebody who's doing this part time they're doing it part time for a reason find the person who is the best\nAt selling homes in your area and you will find them at real estate agents I trust dot com that's real estate agents I trust dot com [noise]\nThis is the Glenn Beck and little room used on money money money money\nIs your job sucking the life out of you wake up\nYou can do something else information technology I Know what you're thinking but I'm not a math and science person no problem no excuses it's not rocket science it's my computer to rear\nGo to my computer career dot edu and take the free career evaluation today you can start your new life as an IT pro in as little as four months my computer career dot edu that's my computer career dot edu\nHi Michelle mocking here one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was the trial of abortion doctor Kermit gods now how the woman goes into a clinic\nComes out data there is no police report I helped exposed crimes the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions not suspect of course the gods new movie is amazing Cormac God's know is perhaps\nThe most holistic serial killer in America who brings friends and family you do not want to pass up the unique opportunity to change of heart and mind about abortion does know\nRated PG Thirteen no play\nOptics move crazy amounts of data at even crazier speeds and fighters by rising as the one hundred percent fiber optic network\n... gigabytes connection you'll get the fastest Internet available download speeds up to nine hundred and forty ...\nTV phone added to your price guarantee all for Seventy nine Ninety nine per month with a two year agreement\nPlus get two hundred dollars toward a range of Google and that's smart um devices and a one hundred dollar visa prepaid card when you order online\nHurry opera ends October thirty first go to get ... switch to the one hundred percent fiber optic network\nOne hundred percent phenomenal\nPlenty every time you went out you can cash in now is the capital in secret card you are in four percent cash back on dining and entertainment like celebrating every year the credentials\nWhen you and your crew or courtside during overtime [noise]\nOf going out now you have four more introducing new favorite card from capital and four percent on mining and Fort present time and you can send your wallet terms apply capital one bank usa in a\nBatter up ensured it'd be a great season they blame the featuring the legendary MVP lined up live by the ... best Hoboken hero and the blimp pretty delicious Italian classics to drive home team subs winning stats including fresh sliced meat premium cheeses it all started topping stuff while you're in neighborhoods Lippi and knock it\nPar with Whoopi MVPs get a dollar off it might be dot com forward slash streaming or quick now only a politically America's sub shop [noise]\nHuge savings I knew and previously leads furnishings math right huge savings and court furniture planned center to the time I wide variety of new and previously in these furniture and acorn for your home run off and you'll find so friends from one Ninety nine Ninety nine animal and everything in our nine thousand square foot she'll run its course started by guaranteed and in stock money for delivery or to take on today\nThat are handling course furniture Syrian center at one three nine for six ...

the\nCountry a check out the list I think it's gonna be a fun way of looking at the lush little different than what you get from cold there for example if they had different way different lens might be a\nI started doing things out of my comfort zone like presenting the truth is it had been a while since I had been having fun it started I started to worry about ticket sales for my tours\nWhat the critics said what the perception of bite me might be I felt like I was living with this over my face and near a and the reality I was seeing was all blurred by it\nI decided I never wanted to read my name and print again never read a review and I never have I decided I'd never use social media again and I never have but the diagnosis made me realize how stupid I had been to worry about all of these unimportant things I was embarrassed by my ego\n[noise] I was embarrassed that has allowed this in security I realized that for many years I couldn't believe I was on the same state\n[noise] I was embarrassed that has allowed this in security\nI realized that for many years I couldn't believe I was on the same stage as my heroes I couldn't believe I was looking cross somebody like Paul McCartney and saying things like it's hard\nTo get here but my God it's harder to stay here than I woke up and sought after ten years of trying to get here in five years of being scared that it would go away I think I can enjoy it\nAfter his son's illness he says I just don't have the stomach for it anymore the celebrity narcissism it started I started to crumble but then I started to wonder why I wanted to do it in the first place\nI had forgotten that it was all about souls connecting because I'd become so anxious there were people in my business life saying if you hadn't done this or that if you've written do better song tickets might be selling quicker they started to take all of that on board\nAnd no one wanted to take any responsibility is just so much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was since insecure enough already\nI Would digested and say it's my fault time rubbish it affected me and I started to think it's all going to go I'm going to lose everything\nIt is\nFascinating to read these things from him because what I've always felt about Michael ... was she was just having fun\nHe was just living a dream and I wondered and I never spotted in him I just wondered\nIf it was ever going to get old to him because what makes him I think the best performer I've ever seen on stage is that joy he just has a joy of performance and it is a it is so in fact she was\nYeah he loves it I mean you can tell when you see him why if you can tell he just absolutely loves doing it or at least did at one point but they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports that he's actually thinking about stopping it completely\nHe says I was learning with passion that I was afraid I'd become a mere poor photo copy of my heroes but when I come back from this terrible time I realized I'm not a mere photocopy I've learned everything I can from them taking it found my own soul my own voice my own style and now know critic can take that away\nIt needed clarifying now I'm just seeing the music I Love maybe when you let go that's when it comes back to you it's a lot like love\nHe is um he he I think he's joking about he's because he says I miss the guys in my band so when my wife had to go back to Argentina I said to the guys come on over to the house let's have a drink orders a pizza place some video games and jam\nThey came over and we partied and I said let's play some music and I thought wow this is fun it was then that I realized I missed making music I didn't even know I missed it that was about a year ago so why would he possibly be saying that he is now\nIt seems like it might be one of those situations where the Internet has taken a somewhat a sarcastic comment and turn it into reality has his spokespeople are coming out today and saying that he's not actually going to retire because he's in the middle of a tour in a book or their album released and all that other stuff so here's what he ... here's what he says\nExactly to the reporter he pauses there are three reasons I wanted to do this album one because I felt a debt of gratitude to deeper than I can explain to the millions of people all over the world who prayed for us and showed us compassion that gave me faith in humanity to because I Love music and I feel I can continue the legacy of\nFor us and showed us compassion that gave me faith in humanity to because I Love music and I feel I can continue the legacy of my idols and three because of the world was ending not just my own personal hell but watching the political\nTurmoil in America and watching Europe breakup there's never a better time for music then he suddenly stops\nQuote this is my last interview he says quite solemnly I'm retiring from the business of made the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top end quote somehow though the writer says I don't think he really means it\nIt's unbelievable because uh you know that it was put all over the media as if he was retiring well he said it was his last interview he got other interviews scheduled\nRight like he's had a whole press tour for this album is just silly and most important thing though is is looking at that and saying that is really the type of thing that ... that changes your perspective completely right you go through something like that and you stop and you examine all the nonsensical idiocy that you you participate in every day\nUh and you can re prioritize you don't want to have to go through that to do it but sometimes it's the only thing that makes you kind of re prioritize the things you're doing in your life\nOr and and he seems to have I mean he he is making thirty five million dollars a year if he's out there a touring and stuff and he's able to walk away from that\nUm because he just wants to spend time with us on how many times do we hear those excuses um according to our time with my family that was completely real guy yeah it's nice to see somebody who actually you know kind of nice to see\nThat he he got through it and has made it into a good thing\nYou know I I have I have\n... probably more respect for Michael bootleg than any other professional that I ever met in the entertainment because he has found a way to keep his feet on the ground and he was afraid I mean when everybody when everyone it was very popular to hate me\nShe didn't mean it ... it you know but he but he would and he was never taking a stand for me he just wouldn't\nHe just didn't understand and he's like look I'm I'm not in politics I'm Canadian why do I care and then you get out of it and then again a fight at a ... yeah he said the guy turned around and said I\nCould leave you look back and he's like I'm Canadian I don't vote what what does it matter what does it matter to you and the guy for real posh and he said I threw punches back and he said I got to do it I got to do a hockey fight [laughter] you got to do a hockey fight [laughter]\nI Am so happy to hear that his ah family is um\nIs doing better and his son has made this miraculous turn and ah Michael bubbly you've given enough if you want to give more we will certainly take it\nBut uh do what's right for you do what's right for you and for your family and\nYour real fans will be thrilled no matter what you decide\n[noise]\nI mean unless it's leaving music business then were pissed off [laughter] by the way his new album is out in a few weeks a couple of tracks on it I'm already been released and they're really good really good really really good [noise]\nAlright sponsored this half hour really factor a relief factor is a way for you to escape the pain naturally did you by ... by any chance listen to the um a podcast this weekend [noise]\nAh the one from you ... ...

I mean I've heard a I I mean they were there when we were recording\nAt all I listen to it again this weekend with my wife and uh he is the end just think he's wrong on this I mean I you know how do you say this to a to a father even though I did that lost his son to opioids a because he's saying there's no reason for any of these opioids we shouldn't have any of them oxycontin Vicodin none of it should be available\nAt all and um I just think that's really really wrong or 'cause we have a lot of people\nCertainly understand that the position he's coming from from his position yes but I mean look at Pat Pat\nIf he didn't have drugs I don't know what drugs these on but if he didn't have drier when there are many heroin yeah there are many days he wouldn't he wouldn't make it to the middle of the street to meet his dealer no he wouldn't make it to work he wouldn't be able to get out of bed yeah\nNow if you are in a situation where you want your life back and you've tried everything may

I mean look it can be said that after the attacks of September eleventh what we saw\nWas a never ending war that is imperiled rather than advanced American ideals by becoming about dominance rather than freedom\nIt's all about dominance\nHas nothing to do with liberty or freedom has everything to do with who's bigger who's bigger who's smarter who has the best ideas who could ratchet up the emotions you get people to think like they do\nMean the whole future after nine eleven happened was an open ended future of war without end and political division over the implementation of state socialism all over the world\nSo it is just showing up that way I mean it's as simple as that the minute the discussion started about state socialism\nThe minute we started talking about who has who has been made it we start talking about who was victimized and who wasn't victimize the division began\n\nAnd so you have this but Trump but Hillary thing going on right now but Trump by Trump but Hillary but Hillary but George Bush who's heat ...\nDon't don't talk about bronco by just talk about about Trump Hillary if somebody has done nothing happened\nBefore about Trump and Hillary nothing [noise]\nBecause you you talk to me that's all that's all they want to talk about about Trump and Hillary but Trump bud Hillary Trump buddy Hillary but but but but but but ... but they were smaller bus coming oh it's about Hillary no and I was about Trump this is where we are now and it never used to be that way [noise] it's all about but [noise]\nOmnipresent surveillance and military deployment some thirty seven count them thirty seven countries\n\nThe war on terrorism in the U.S presidency a threat to its citizens in democracy presidents George W. Bush in rock Obama drastically expanded executive powers by combining secrecy with new technologies to incarcerate and kill hundreds of people including numerous Americans were little public oversight\nBelieves that ever talked about no it's not is it not oh why because we're too busy hating on each other for choosing one on one candidate or the other when we forget how far away and how the same we are the same time\n\nThis is how we demand engagement without question\n\nAll of this all of this division ... it create a we created or the deep state and those who are behind making these proposals and pushing the president's leaves directions it created the division that we're experiencing now because of propaganda demanded that people choose aside you're either with us or you're with the terrorists\nEngagement without question the biggest\nEnemy of the state is question we're told who the enemy was we were told who the enemy was within minutes of the attack on a on the on the towers and the Pentagon and then we were warned that anyone who engaged\nIn conspiracy theory which jeopardizing freedom\n\nHow we engage their enemies mattered enormously for our society evolves and now our society has grown more fragmented and unequal because that is how we have chosen to fight\nWe're not we're not fighting\nAgainst the real enemies of the states were fighting against each other so basically it's a fact that we're all enemies to each other we're all enemies of the state and one day someone's going to wake up and go hey you know we ought to do with these guys since they're all bad to each other well just label all terrorists and won't put up a gulag Joel put up the walls and the ...\nWake up and go hey you know we ought to do with these guys are just they're all bad to each other well just label them all terrorists and won't put up a gulag snow put up the walls and the and and one of the barbed wire keep everybody in America and not let them get out\n\nFreedom has become an empty use the concept of sacrificing our current political rhetoric\n\nAnd this is a product of a treacherous couple but there's no concern for you they only have a concern to bump their empire international order\nAnd now we have a president wants to put America First summer's worldwide beep sick of all they won't have but they don't want it\n\nThe world intelligence agencies have control of the world now\nAnd he will use any means necessary to cover their tracks and this dates back to the time when the project for the new American Century was first drafted\nThe arising about a new Pearl Harbor to justify an open it'd be boring to create chaos inland who's freedom and liberty seem them breakable\nTruth is the majority of Americans are on or wherever the majority of our country and its constitutional values so the minute you start putting me in a sand box will be other kids playing\nYou that you get you that you this you that you'd be as\nTrump and Hillary but Trump buddy Holly yeah go ahead and play that game\nI don't because I Know that it's deeper than that\nBut I've been trying to convey this now for nearly twenty five years\n\nTo go to Julie Julie on ground zero [noise]\nUm [noise] right I agree with you completely but as ISIS or something and you're not answering\nA climate here is that a patient care anything are
