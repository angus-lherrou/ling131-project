important point and that is that over ... identifies as Hispanic [noise] uh therefore ... he must be believe\nWow there's a great point here is again we're learning today yeah I forgot that was the standard how insensitive of us mhm\nHow hateful and a downright ugly that is that we haven't spoken about how he does identify yeah and it must\nBe as Hispanic [laughter] jak bags it's it's interesting with that sort of talk it's like you know the the Elizabeth Warren is of essentially identifying as Native American without real evidence that she is she's getting beat up I mean this has been one of the biggest political disasters of all time\nHer coming out and trying to say that she actually is Hispanic or lend Native American short approved it by going back ... generation trying to prove it one one thousand twenty four yeah that's what makes it a left hates it through like this is this is playing into the worst of our\nUh beliefs about you know blood being the determining factor and these things and they they hate it they're\nThey have destroyed her over the she handled it terribly I mean it's almost like one of those things I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out and doing this this is amazing\nAh but the identifying thing there's two parts of that like I said as a you know say that you know the libertarian side of me like I don't care what people say they are right like it makes no difference to me if she says she's Native American or not I don't care\nBut beyond that there is an actual truth you know if if we do all those all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean King wants to come out and say he's black when they're not black it it does that matter to me I don't care what they're doing there I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason but that doesn't mean it affects me in any way\nHowever we have to be able to stand up for the truth the truth is that Sean King is white but the truth is Rachel does all is white and the truth is that Beto O'Rourke as white as white\nAnd what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick saying that black people are being unfairly accused without evidence and being shot in the streets for no reason because ah for for crimes they didn't commit\nAt the same time we're supposed to get on board if you're on the left are supposed to get on board with\n... with the with a new standard\nIn which any white woman can accuse the man over if and we're just supposed to believer that is not going to work out well for African Americans or any ... any race of mail but this is the type of thing that makes no sense I mean there are real cases of this this isn't a fake thing go back to you know we talked about till town go back to Emmett Till\nI mean this goes back a long way where black people were accused of doing terrible things to white people when they get into\nAn entire communities went and attack to the black person\nThis is obviously going back quite a ways but it is something that legitimately as part of our history\nAnd it's surprising at the least if liberals actually cared about black people in black men like they say that they do that they would want to embrace the standard like this\nSo the point behind the at I think is is relatively fair and it's something that should be communicated I think to the the African American community that ... the criticism is perhaps over done little of her done potentially the criticism here [laughter] interesting 'cause I don't think it's a\nIt's not it does not I don't know the the uh for sure on this but what I ... my understanding is that these are the people who are recorded this are African American that there is not like a white person doing a black voice quote unquote is you're African Americans are talking\nA and I guess the idea is that they have picked the stereotypical African Americans to do the commercial it's very uncomfortable\nOr I don't think that this is something that French ... necessarily bracing or by any means but it is a something that's making a lot of a ...\nWell uh I don't think that this is something that French ill necessarily bracing or by any means but it is a something that's making a lot of uh a lot of waves in the media because they're trying to make it seem like well this is just this Republican and who was a racist\nI I mean\nHey he didn't have anything to do with the ad but besides that or is it it's an interesting\nDouble standards that we find ourselves dealing with the always yeah and and we get that double standard in\nA way to the tenth power and you know I'm I guess we get kind of used to it by now I'm just sort of used to the double standard and to the point where you almost feel silly bringing out the double standard it happens so much\nIt is and it's so obvious sometimes you have to for example does anyone I mean if you don't live in French hills district you know French Hill is is not a major if I actually don't yeah he's not a major national figure as a Congress a person\nUm so you know like I I think this wouldn't be a big national story it is a big national story today what is not a big national story is a name that almost everyone does Louis Farrakhan\nLouis Farrakhan is not a big national story today he's making no waves at all for his comments\nA yet again about Jews now this is a person who has met with you know people like a Keith Ellison\nHe has met with several congressmen he's been embraced many times but even you know fairly recently uh people meeting with him we know the Iraq Obama at one point apparently had met with him we didn't find that out until like you out of office you know how that how that happens it's amazing\nBut here's the latest from Louis Farrakhan\n... every not\nSo when they talk about for con [noise]\nCall me I have to\nDo [noise] calm in an anti Semite [noise]\nStop it [noise] um and do you turn my [noise]\nI don't know nothing about pay somebody because of their religious preference\nOkay right yeah you know anything about hating somebody because of their religion really really you just ... you seemingly just called Jewish people termites yeah you don't know nothing about hey said more clearly than that the best what he's talking about another speeches wow a\nFor pretty amazing it to the other thing is that ... that's interesting about Louis Farrakhan is nobody loves the Louis Farrakhan more than ... I mean this guy thinks he's really clever yeah every every rhyming ally and he's got this gigantic smile on his face like he's uncovered some deep historical truth [laughter]\nOr or or or solved you know a perpetual motion machine and the guy is like he put\nEverybody in their place just now white slamming them down I don't know nothing about hate no religious group\nThat as I might I manage a turbine it like he thinks that oh that's a yeah he does he's really excited about himself but he ... both of those words and in ... but he was an ... should do it [laughter]\nAnother he's hanging around and he's like I don't I don't have any speech is scheduled schedule one we need a speech just for this long [laughter] how excited he loves when he delivers bat [laughter] things are really up about it and I don't think he got the requisite\nReaction from the crowd and I think he wanted more of a you know a gas or I laugh or something you just kinda got in a way it I don't know how to respond to that those kind of a bad state yeah I don't think I think he's going to be in trouble for that\nI'll give them is though the the words do ended in similar fashion they do that is something that he was able to do ha ha yeah might in semi [laughter] so that's why that's why\nAnd they still do the words do ended a similar fashion they do that is something that he was able to do uh-huh yeah my semi [noise] so that's why that's why says that way our full\nPowerful [laughter] it's really funny man he just keeps so happy she looks so happy as either livers I Can't wait to deliver genocide above the Jews are just big smiles [laughter]\nAs long as he could come up with something that rhyme you know people have simple pleasures and I think that you know he got a couple of things he's asking for rhyming words and killing the Jews other than that yeah I just come on you know maybe a good cup of ice tea [laughter] you know something something simple pleasures beyond that\nI mean he's he's he's said some pretty outrageous things that get very little coverage and this was another one um people just they seem to kind of ignore him and act like a he's not there supporting Democrats he's kind of not there you know what the very edge of the left\nA but\nIf anybody on the right again this was the double standard hadn't said anything approaching that ... uh about any ... can you imagine if somebody on the right had said something like that about Muslims would that be everywhere it would be everywhere are on the mainstream media\nUm but he for some reason kind of flies under the radar and gets away with all this stuff ah I mean I still haven't really suffered any consequences from talking about killing Malcolm X. even ... um\nShe pretty much it meant you pretty much

things over that's all [laughter] we've talked a little bit about the elections said today or this this update is kind of fascinating um\nThink if you want it to boil down quick version of where we stand at this very moment it looks very likely that the GOP will hold the Senate it looks very likely that the people will lose the house or the you know because governors there was a bunch of stories there there's a lot of individual stories on both sides but if you're just going to summarize\nOf individual stories on both sides but if you're just going to summarize overall\nThat's likely what we're looking at right now things can change as we know I don't it's not a lock on either one of them I'm a things things can change in significant ways there's one thing that will not change however in this race which is the Democrats have found a way to milk there are people out of a lot\nOf money a lot of money\nNow this is of course the party that constantly tells us they want money out of politics they just they can't do it\nThey don't they do not want people buying elections they don't want to do anything they constantly are out raising a Republicans in these big high profile races you know the presidency and things like that we bronco by most famously\nI'm outraged everybody in the universe and you know Donald Trump spent like nothing on his campaign twenty sixteen yeah it's a it's an under told story of that election Hillary the if the idea if it's true that you can buy elections Hillary Clinton absolutely would have won\nWhen she had way more money far more resources\nOr because you know Donald Trump didn't throw us a lot of his own money into the race they just ran it on a shoestring promote much of the time and they were still able to win it kind of just proves every liberal theory about money in politics\n'cause he was going and going on the theory that he didn't need anybody else's money so he didn't he sort of didn't try to fund raise much you know I mean he ... he he raise some money and a little bit yeah and he used some of his own money and it wasn't like a billion dollars like she did know it wasn't even close um and this is\nLike ... you know part of that if he's a big celebrity right like he was a celebrity before he was a candidate so he's able to get a lot of TV Time for free and and everybody was covering him all the time you could see now I mean even after each president that the media the media is absolutely obsessed with him as a person\nI just they cannot get enough of him talking about anything every single story you know Saudi Saudi Arabia murders or is all about Trump every story is all about Trump all the time\nAs long as you keep renting a massive deficit you'll get all those\nBills through yeah just just keep spending money and they'll vote for it yeah uh not a problem to show you the house at how dramatic it is at least by the polls look and I know you're going to say well the polls got the last thing wrong well some of it they got right\nA and a lot of it they got writing including the popular vote by the way which is what they were actually trying to predict in the national polls some of the staples were totally off though so we don't know what this whole we're not sure but right now the models are showing\n'em there's a like a point one percent chance that the Democrats could pick up eighty three seats now it's a point one percent chance to really unlikely like you say that an absolute\nNo it's not going to get to eighty three right ...\n... the models are also showing there's a point one chance for Republicans\nTo hold the same amount of seats they have now\nIt's that bad and environment at the same same percentage chance the the crazy outlier possibility is Democrats plus eighty three Republicans plus zero what is the chance of\nNot holding the same amount of seats by keeping the majority about twenty percent they're saying about uh twenty percent chance that can keep the majority right now while about about the same percentage chance that Democrats can get to set it\n[laughter] so I mean ... look and if they get the house if she doesn't have all the Democrats do is get the house they're going to be a little lunch investigations like crazy right they're going to it's going to be a nightmare almost certainly impeach they well impeach him right now we're going to be convicted no no the land I won't be no chance of ...\nUnless something dramatic were to happen right because you have to get to sixty seven seats pay another step better than I make the seven seats in ... and they're not gonna get anywhere close to that even if they get the majority in the Senate they're not going to be able to do that but they will have a subpoena power they will they will bogged down the administration in constant investigations Adam look\nInvestigating something that's real is fine\nWhat they are going to do is not and but ... it's going to be ridiculous they're gonna investigate it'd be a nightmare you know there's a new story up today that Ivanka Trump may have committed a crime if you heard this no\nBecause when she was promoting the sale of real estate or in a when she was back in the day and you know do her job was with the Trump Organization ... she said things like well it says oh well this one's almost sold out\nAnd it was not almost sold out like were they saying like our new building in a in in New York or you should get it now 'cause it's almost sold out and in reality was only like twenty percent sold out\nNow look there's a lot of guys the gate to be made right like you shouldn't say that because if someone's investing in Iraq I ended investigation and these wind up going bankrupt their humanity you joke it's happening [laughter] believe it I Believe there's a huge report that came out from a left wing media sources should be going on in New York has investigated them a bunch of times already\nThey're going to go after the house and the Senate if they get control of it will have launched investigation after investigation after investigation and nothing\nHappen in this guy will do it in ... as to why Donald Trump doesn't talk about his daughter Tiffany as much as he does a bunker investigation would act I wanted to see the results of that one though I really don't know where they're Tiffany I own the uncommitted in anything\nThere's people probably right now saying wait he has a daughter named Tiffany yeah yeah yeah and and that so that was\nIt's the only one from went Yvonne a Trump which you've got a vodka and done junior and Eric right then she got married to Marla Maples and it was just Tiffany\nAnd then and then this with ... with ... with Barron Barron yeah so what twelve or Thirteen now we always hear

and suddenly the majority realized that they were in the throes of evil\nSee\nWe now observe helplessly\nAs all of this darkness builds then grows and eventually there's this disruptive blow the gives way to be picked for me of darkness\nYou begin to realize that you no longer want to participate in morality the majority believes is helping positive however you find it hard to speak out against it something called argument them at ... you want to speak out again\nAnymore for telling the truth\nIs revolutionary act critical thinking tells you that just because large numbers of people believe a given thing is not Ukrainians to it's true and we realized that there are a great number of people that are falling\nFor bandwagon fantasy\nThey're following for bumper sticker patriotism they're falling for all of these ways that they can be God believing in holding fast to great lies\nStart generating these beams start generating these thoughts these thought forms\nOnce you generate these ... these thought forms these ideas these means they can take on an identity all of their own\nAnd with mass confusion anger come the manifestations of monsters bogeyman that we think are all part of our collective imagination\nThings begin to unravel we started seeing the unraveling where the apocalypse everything happens at alarming rates and synchronous these create an air of mysticism and

bit of quantum mechanics we work in quantum mechanics and things like that in the mix in order to avoid sounding absolutely nuts but it's time to admit\nThat somewhere out there\nWe can hypothesize that histories and rules are being rewritten in order to accommodate what is unfolding in this unpredictable world\nLast night we tried to demonstrate to you that the game is changing and human consciousness as being prepped and ready for a new sphere of influence that seems to be a bit more chaotic from a darker realm of existence the frightening thing is\nIs as the darkness gathers\nMay find ourselves believing that we're in some strange situation horror situation I mean some plot of the devil or so I mean reality we're actually seeing a more intimate view\nOf darker view of the true inner core\nOf the human psyche made it can be argued that the devils and all of us and sometimes\nAre responsible for conjuring our own demons and building are obese\nSometimes we're the ones that magicians and we're the ones casting spells and developing the curses and we have to be careful what we say because words are very powerful and ideas and thoughts are being weaponized\nWelcome to the dark side triple eight\nSix seven three thirty seven hundred that's triple eight six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise] I'm quite Lewis you are listening to ground zero and we'll fat [noise]\nWas a group of Canadian pair of psychologists who aimed to conduct an experiment it would create a ghost in doing so it would prove their theory that those unexplained bumps in the night or actually products of the human mind\nThere was a ... guys the expert by the name of Dr Allen Robert George over and then he created a group called the Toronto society for ... a ... a ... a cyclical research and um\nThere are eight people in the group and Dr Owens wife was involved there was an industrial designer to counter housewife a bookkeeper and associate sociology student and so ah there was a psychologist named Dr Joel Wit and who also tend to many of the experiments as an observer well\nThis experiment was known as the Philip experiment and it was a film I Believe that uh did this experiment happened in Nineteen Seventy two what had happened is they created a fictional historical character\nOr they pulled facts out of thin air to attach this guy this physical good there's this fictional character and then basically they gave it to the study group okay they had an a or they may handed him a biography and they said that he\nWas like the seventeenth century English noble man who was married to a beautiful it cold and unfriendly wife and then one day he ran into a beautiful gypsy girl named Margot and they fell in love and and so\nYou know they were trying to keep their love a secret but of course the secrets go didn't last forever because his wife Dorothy up found out about Margot and accused her of witchcraft okay so\nThey shouldn't he didn't protests the idea of Margot being a witch and that resulted in her being burned at the stake and event later was stricken with remorse in which the only way you could deal with it was to fight in some battle and then one morning he was found dead on the battlefield\nAnd the guy Phillip or Philip veils for his what his name was he was no more well the only group they didn't stop at a biography or one of the members sketched a portrait of them they they it was this segment of their imagination they created this character this Philip guy and so\nThey got immersed in that character they started making up a mythology about him and they acted as though he was real I mean they they've taught him up they thought he was real and they were they were trying to conjure this guy\nSo for months for months they would do sounds is trying to find this guy this Philip character\nAnd what they were doing is they were trying to trying to actually demonstrate how the mind has the power to conjure\nSomething out of there whether it be an imaginary goes to it'd be a real entity that may be in the subconscious right so for months they didn't get any contact with a ghost named Phillip and then one day during a say on\nAn entity came through whose name was filling\nAny terrorize the group of scientists or the few aggressive moves you would move furniture around the ... electric light bulbs to explode he would pound loudly on the doors and so um there was a documentary that was made on the experiment um we never saw fill up all we got to see what his powers can do\nSome claim that what the experiment was proving is that goes do not exist and they simply are created by our minds but know what was lost on everybody was the remarkable probability that you can actually thinks something into reality that means that magic\nOr causal engineering whatever they call it it's not a fallacy okay\nWhat we might might have as an idea you're taking idea\nYou empower it you magnify it you released into the ether and then if the mind brings will chew it to fire it up\nYou can well we can conclude that there are all sorts of reality is behind to simply imploding all around us but then in front of us is the reality and that's a reality we know just beyond our feet but this is a great world of esoteric and strange things\nAnd it's hard to explain to people unfamiliar\nBut there are some that are smarter than others and there were some that know how to walk in the multi averse and it's hard to describe the multiverse and then you get into this bridge your bridging this area between what is reality and what his witchcraft\nWhenever the subject of witchcraft comes up or even sorcery there are many people who already presume\nBut at the core of all witchcraft and sorcery is a demon or devil this cast a curse into the ether\nSimple magic simple magic and the use of power brought in by the\nNatural elements that have been around for thousands of years um I Know that there are many opinions that fly\nAnd there's considerable division among people relatives of the term which in some equated with the devil or should the devil worship they equated with daemon conjuring which of course has been done by the ... of those reading the abyss however there are many other forms of magic in which ... which\nSomeone wants to employ to describe the workings of angel\nNow lately there have been depictions of good which is like in Harry Potter you know Harry Potter fighting against the evil which is that are\nBy an evil wizard named Baltimore there's also a new movie called\nA house with clocks in the malls\nOr there which is too and they're fighting evil which is so they're the good which is try to eat what you see in the middle ages in Europe there were there was great activity\nIn witchcraft and conjuring and then came a time\nWhen the pope's\nTook cognizance of the practices to which the lame into the church and the outsiders were practicing and condemned it because certain functions rituals and ceremonies were generally reserved for the priesthood\nSo no you couldn't be practicing what they called priesthood that was witchcraft\nEarliest settlers of America the Spanish English Dutch Swedes French and Germans all had a working knowledge generally speaking of religious backgrounds especially respecting good and bad angels in witches and most of the books brought to America\nWherever religious nature seven more of a conjuring nature somewhat more about witchcraft I mean having of course general rules for the religious behavior of course but uh that the idea of using moral and civil behaviors when a bridge with things like witchcraft\nNow the Bible was the staple\nIn religion or the Puritans came to the United states bibles brought over from the from there to the United states the old myth is though that these pilgrims or whoever they were were only seeking religious freedom is if they were being persecuted for their belief in\nGod the truth is that there were the puritan settlers or religious fanatics and of course there were those who practiced folk magic alongside those who favor traditional Christianity and the thing that would surprise most Americans is is that before the settlement in Plymouth\nThere was a settlement of Jamestown where it was believed that the small group of newly formed secrets societies actually were coming to America to establish world order in America\nAnd the founders of Jamestown had thoroughly well bad different values than the Puritans and the separatists pilgrims many performed may sonic rituals and conducted magical ceremonies while still participating in Christian right\nThere may suddenly beliefs indelibly shaped American culture and America's future like today they're they're like\nToday where the you know where we have a ... a polarization of the people division there were the same polarization divisions than there were the people of the villages which consisted mostly the poor farmers and then we had the elite masons were merchants and\nOkay and the merchants are the merchants than the bankers prospered alive they made a lot of money kept making money which created this schism where many believe that if you were if you were actually prospering\nThat this was going against appeared and faith in that you were in league with the devil said the puritan pilgrims lumping them because they despise King James and yet we're told that many Christians\nThe pilgrim principles and their religious freedoms or based on\nPrecepts detail in the king James Bible that's a myth because when James the first became king of England and eat it actually sixty three there were two translations of the Bible and use the Geneva Bible was the most popular and the bishop's Bible was the one that was used for reading and churches and their parents were intolerable zealots\nAnd created all sorts of nasty conspiracy theories about the new settlements including the conspiracy\nAbout which is that that were used to gain power and destroy the secret societies that were said to be the work with the devil\nThrough Christian fundamentalists want you to send the political spirituality of the of the neo called aspects the United states\nThey often refer to America as a Judeo Christian nation basically nation build on Judeo Christian principles but they tend to forget that would America was being established when the colonies were being founded by a puritan pilgrims at Plymouth or secret suicidal ds from Jamestown or whatever Judeo Christian values were just barely being defined and the Bible that most Christians believed in\nSo the old time conception of what may have happened didn't happen the way we think and there was a lot\nOf magic and a lot of myths and a lot of conjuring in a lot of powers that were being utilized\nIn order to establish the United states of America [noise] so we are a country that's deep rooted in conspiracy\nDeep rooted in prayer deep rooted in the supernatural\nAnd deep rooted in magic whether it'd be good bad orthodoxy urine orthodoxy we are what America is and our forefathers did a lot of magical workings in order to make this country happen and it still happens today so when you're warned them in dark", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "Billings", "day": "20"}
