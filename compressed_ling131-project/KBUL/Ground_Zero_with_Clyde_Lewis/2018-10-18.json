I think you did and I've got a lot to ask you about on this but let me let me start with this\n[noise] [noise] why do you suppose that\nThere isn't a an uprising a ... in Portland or they are the\nBlind to it for some reason or do they actually supported are they afraid to come out what is the what's the real readership\nIn in in Montgomery County so you\nIf I were still working on channel two I be doing commentary going okay I'm going to be out uh on the banks of the war I'm it wherever I'm going to be there at the turn in the morning on a Saturday I Want to all come out and support what I'm doing okay nobody's going to do that there's nobody in town going to do that with any visibility it'll\nIt'll be two um unfortunately\nBecause there are many many many good people in Portland in ... county and I have friends there most people are selfish\nAlright they're into their own pursuits they're doing whatever they want to do and you know what this is the New Orleans but I don't really want to spend time on this and then maybe there are a lot like me and maybe\nAnd teeth all hit me or I'm not going to do it\nIt's a selfish thing and it's not just in Portland, Oregon\nI mean we have to really as as a people we really have to start to rise up and say hey you know what we want to process we want a presumption of innocence we don't want ... on the streets and mass beating people up and telling women that there has been should rotten a grave it we don't want that\nOkay so important when do we have any democratic 'cause it's all Democrats a hundred percent got any politicians here the governor of Oregon doing anything about this saying anything about it no no no no ... and that's how far we've come that's how far we've declined\nSo bill I Want to talk to a little bit more about this and just one thing on and when you say we've got to stand up and fight this I'd like to hear your opinion on on what exactly that means a but also when we come back I Want to take you to Saudi Arabia\nThings have gotten even more bizarre and now they're now they're saying that the ... he was alive\nOkay I'm not going to seek out for Saudi Arabia is bad\nBut Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran in the middle east\nIt's the leader of\nJordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt Iran is terrorism and destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading that charge so why on earth is the American laugh wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we outlawed herself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you why not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that\nAnd then not trade with them the sanction them boycott them all of that and then you turn around and go the unintended consequences of that is that the whole alliance against Iran falls apart at a wine is empowered eight times as much as they are now\nAnd so on and Brotherhood\nYeah and and the and the left wing press doesn't care what happened ISIS did have you seen one article\nFrom the mainstream media about how the Trump Administration destroyed ISIS\nNo have you seen Wanda no under Obama ISIS ran wild and killed tens of thousands of innocent people\nFor eight years for eight years Trump gets in there and the first year he wipes them out because of math is the defense secretary and he didn't do it in a very public way it was all done behind the scenes but you can get\nThose articles you can get those stories All right now to even try to get them\nAll right so bill here's here's the problem with with Saudi Arabia as I said you're exactly right you know we're in we're in a no win situation in fact I think we're going to lose lose situation here standing with people\nThey do this kind of thing all the time yeah ah they're bad people we shouldn't have been in bed with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the first place but we were and now they're they're I'm a strong ally that is one of the only ones that is standing up for his real at least quietly\nFighting the Muslim Brotherhood and fighting Iran they we have a lot of aligned interest even though I don't want to be in bed with them\nBut now how do you get out if if a kid out well but wait a minute\nSaudi Arabia this is different because if there is a tape of this guy being\nDismembered while he was alive this will set the world on fire it's different\nAnd any new sanctions Saudi Arabia in a way that hurts them but doesn't destroy\nThe kingdom match what you have to do so I'm at but look\nTrump does have the Hartford is he doesn't want to cancel the arms deals that are rich America didn't want to do it and the reason that we're we have a relationship with Saudi Arabia anyways because they headed OPEC we needed that oil in the in the sixties and seventies and eighties\nDead zone anymore but now Silicon Valley takes a lot of their money\nRight so I had I say punish them\nYou know when when it comes out and I believe firmly they did it\nI Do I don't think there's any doubt that they did at\nThis guy walked into the counseling and assemble Saudi council it and he was butchered or whatever\nOkay they did it and I believe that salt and the guy running the place he ordered it right to the top so when it comes out than Trump has to say we're going to do this and figure out a way to punish them\nUm but not destroy them that's what has to happen for the good of America\nAnd do you think they'll take that punishment they've said that if we run on it and they have to right\nYeah yeah I mean it's just like turkey when a letting the pastor out or the guys are going to let them out while he's out I mean Saudi Arabia can't exist without the United states they can't exist without the United states because Iran will go in there and\nCause so much trouble yeah that'd be the place will collapse and\nSo they need the United states can say whatever they want to say they need us\nAnd they've got to pay a price for this they absolutely have to pay a price for it\nDo you think turkey has the tape or is this\nLast I how can I possibly know back in the turkey or three times\nAll right ah I don't know what tape they have what channel I watch I don't know anything\nWhat I I I Would think the leading national thank you try to just in politics we have some ideas I'm a little on the gas on it I mean I Would think so too I mean\nIn the Saudi a council it is Saudi Arabian territory the Turks have no access they did go in by the way which is interesting and they say yeah we found some chemical agents of and then somebody paint that something [noise] but let's just wait but I don't think anybody listening to us right now I should have any doubt\nThat this guy was assassinated by the Saudi Government\nIt's amazing how close to this is to rear window or the Hitchcock movie I mean it's it's really I mean as you know if the Muslim Brotherhood and try and swords were involved\nUm a bill always good to talk

an email from was with a couple of months ago I think um and\nHe has put out a new book called city of death humanitarian warriors in the battle of Mosul yeah a welcome glad that you're having back on the bed so tell me a little bit about the battle in recap where we've been together before or was this books will tell the story\nOK so last time I was on we talked about that we talked about the book and we talked about the ... fund\nUm so the book is about a a a journey I basically went on last year a humanitarian work I did in a in a in northern Iraq to help\n'em with the fight against ISIS so as a former seal it was a natural fit for me to go and um and help but now I originally thought I was just going to be doing you know the the standard humanitarian thing of handing out water bottles doing a little bit of medical aid well when I got in there um the ... with a group called the free Burma rangers\nWe we ended up embedding with the Iraqi Army and um basically becoming their frontline medical support because they just don't have the resources to to do that themselves\nAnd so and I was not a medic how was it was a sniper and uh but I had a pretty good medical training for my time is a seal and so we actually ended up being involved in the direction of salt into Mosul um to open up the um to open up the western front in Mosul and finally collapse of the caliphate in in Mosul\nAnd we were in the city for about thirty days from from the data we entered the city to the day that I ended up getting shot down a rescue mission was was exactly thirty days and what happened\nAnd what happened in in Mosul was just it was something I thought I Would never see in my lifetime UC evil you see pictures of World War two you see Killing Fields you you see these\nBlack and white photos and you think I Will never see something like that you know there's a certain amount of denial that you have well I saw it and it was real\nAnd so in the city of death I talk about my experience of going

looked up at CNN\nTrump says he's not to blame if GOP loses but who cares I mean CNN or can you just get over it for ten seconds is there nothing else important going on in the world\nThey're not the only ones guilty of this but there is CNN in particular a treat like Donald Trump ...\nLike almost the reverse of a teenager and a boy band it's like the obsession level is he's incredibly high now they're looking at it as a negative instead of a positive\nBut like they just are obsessed with this person yeah I mean it's it's seemingly there ... all that matters are dominated by him yeah all that matters the whole thing about living rent free inside someone else's head I mean is so on display with CNN right now they can't talk about anything else even when they're talking about other things\nSaudi Arabia Trump Saudi Arabia now Saudi Arabia he's in trouble you know to all of those Trump have ties to Saudi Arabia he's talked about his ties to Saudi Arabia\nHow they can they caught somebody up alive alive the butchered him alive caught him up and put them in a suitcase and you're looking for a way an angle to get Trump what is wrong with you people that's wrong with\nIt was like legitimately like a sickness for some of that might be ... if not on CNN but I mean it is it as a network as a whole\nThey can't figure out a way to discuss any other topic is really incredible I mean he really does dominates their lives\nEvery aspect or at least there's at least they're public life I don't know maybe they go home and don't talk about it I don't know but when they're on TV they're talking about all the time it's like there's got to be something else interesting in the world there's got to be\nWell just looked at the headline and Fox they're talking about Elizabeth Warren and you know are Cherokee heritage\nReally my ... again\nLike all of these stories like the Elizabeth Warren thing is is interesting because you can be running for president it's a day or two story um I think it's at this point I'm I'm done with it but it was interesting to see her I mean real flop here we're talking about when the all time political flops yes she's tried\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas at it this way try this on for size\nAh a\nDonald Trump is everywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like Iraq Obama was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh yeah that can we talk about today and I don't want to talk about the ...\nYou know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life\nTed Cruz was a very big picture or a big big force in everybody's life two years ago but he's just kind of falling off the map and he's just doing a good job\nOkay mhm I'm Greg Abbott is just doing a good job and nobody's talking about\nWhen I was talking about him because the state's running great everything's going really well he's a great governor he's not controversial so I think the poll numbers are just how much is this person impacted my life\nIn a kind of in a bad way of oh I got to deal with this again today I got to talk about this again and you can get you get older you get into a cheat or Indiana yeah yeah yeah and it's not a bad thing about any of 'em it's just like\nOh I'm so tired of this ... you know it's like the closer you get to Washington Greg Abbott is here Ted Cruz's in Washington but you know really the epicenter now and with the last president is the White House\nAnd so the closer you get the more you're like oh enough\nYeah I it's it's a it's an interesting thing that I mean I it's nice to see I think\nYou know especially if cruises hold on to this race which it seems like he will at the moment or it's going to help a lot of other candidates in really close races there six tossup races right now ah Arizona Florida Indiana Missouri Montana and Nevada all of them are are very tight um I you know\nThe fact that this thirty eight million dollars is not flowing into a race in that group is a real positive for Republicans I did Democrats are very excited about better but I mean his chances of winning are very low\nAnd they've just thrown money at a candidate who has essentially I mean a very small chance of winning I Would say it's no chance but a very small chance of winning and you know that's only benefiting Republican chances of of keeping the Senate\nBut they are doing here's what's happening they made him into a national figure ... you know they're already by putting him on Ellen why why and CNN one huh\nHe's he's responsible for absolutely nothing right not he's not something like up and coming outsider right like he's a guy who's been in Congress for a long time\nOr he has been in politics for a very long time he's the whole life has basically been politics outside of his early ... I Swear it's just\nBecause they think he's good looking guy and he can he can give a good speech I think he's I think it's it's the\n... Obama the syndrome of two thousand Fort what does this guy done he will he gave a speech in two thousand four well he should be president what does this guy done well he's been on Allen\nI mean it's it's it's not just that he's good looking I think that there is a\nPart of the Democratic party that does not want to go the Democratic socialism anti capitalist sort of way and Beto doesn't look like\nThat you don't like his ... his power user name is Alexander ... correct I mean they went ... went through them in the debate yes last night I'm sure some of these young yet but first of all let's start with a hit a better was opening an egg may know\nBeto is a a he's a Hispanic\nHispanic ... name is Robert actually rancid here from a Central America I Know a very recently Irish and he uh and he came out and make sure you knew how Hispanic he was a less Hispanic than war than Elizabeth Warren is charity I don't know what you're talking about here's a here's the battles open\nFirst race let me thank you and Sarah from moderating tonight's debate Ken's five for hosting us the people of San Antonio for being here and the people of Texas from watching us and participating in one of the most important decisions of our lifetimes on or if ... is author of sucking in San Antonio\nThe s the powerful see how Hispanic he is he can't even stop himself from speaking Spanish he was trying to speak in English that entire time and just slipped into it because it's so natural for him coming from his deep Hispanic groups and that's something I Want you to make sure you understand unlike this old white guy a ...\nWhite or who is basically I mean it's so ridiculous Ted Cruz's old white guy sending ... a year and a half to two years older than a better mhm or Robert Francis Oregon or he's not my column\n... um anyway so ah [laughter] this is it was interesting to watch this because you know it's like as you pointed out crews runs for president he doesn't win a and he's been\nYou know you don't hear from him as often as you did and but he's been doing a great journeys his voting record is very solid I think you know anybody whether you like Trump randomly like all the stuff he he votes\nFor the stuff he's doing behind the scenes with the judiciary and I don't mean just the Supreme Court I mean the ah the ah the federal courts is remarkable and will change the course of court decisions for very long time\nYeah he's been very involved the very involved um however Beto I don't I don't know I mean I get the idea that maybe he is a younger and good looking and can speak coherently I think that's the only thing you can as attractive to a lot of neck\nMuscles yeah a lotta neck muscles a very shiny well very shiny but he um talked about\nAbout Cruz and his motivations remember this is a guy who's brought in it the only story about that or of any note if he's raised a lot of money that is his entire the entire reason anyone would ever discussed him because he has raised a fortune but of course he goes after Cruz over money less than\nThe speed of balancing budgets I'm only one of us has with\nGood friends in El Paso started a small business mob met the payroll every week balanced the books made sure that we delivered for our clients only one of us has served at the local government level every single year balancing the budget seeing each other not as Republicans and Democrats but at the council members interest is\nServe at the local government level every single year balancing the budget seeing each other not as Republicans and Democrats but at the council members entrusted\nWith a ... responsibility to deliver for the taxpayers will pass every single year we did and for Senator Cruz to say that this isn't going to bust the budget at a time of Twenty one trillion dollars in debt when we're on track to deficit spend the tune of a trillion dollars a year he voted to add two trillion dollars\nAnd those tax cuts just proportionately will flow to corporations who are already sitting on record piles of cash for any already wealthy in a country that has ribbons with income inequality unseen last gilded age why\nIn the days just before and just after that vote Sen Cruz accepted one hundred and twenty thousand dollars from the political action committees who represent the corporate interests benefited from this ... why does it go for this why does he vote for Internet companies to sell your private browsing data to the highest bidder without your consent\nWhy does he not vote for universal background checks and a country that loses thirty thousand people to gun violence every year follow the money in each of these cases if you look at the political action committee contributions to Senator Cruz it helps to explain the reasons for his vote and how corrupt in Congress has become\nNow again unbelievable hundred and twenty thousand dollars really it's Ted Cruz changing and opinion over a hundred and twenty thousand dollars it's ridiculous if cruise dropped out of the Senate right now he get a lobbying job at some for him and make millions without even thinking about it he was ... I mean yeah he's highly educated his wife worked at Goldman Sachs if we remember\nThis is not a this is not a money issue a for crews\nAre beyond that of course Beto O'Rourke has accepted or as had many ads run on his behalf ... from ... from PACs and superPACs and he's got that\nLittle uh you know that little line of ... you know\nI'm not telling them to do it so therefore I'm not responsible ... but again he's raised thirty eight million dollars he's complaining about one hundred and twenty thousand dollar donation to a crew that make some changes opinion\nWorth thirty million dollars do what does that make you I'll tell you what it does I think thirty eight million dollars uh for some uh makes you into a national candidates for another race not this one for others who have given part of that thirty eight million dollars\nOr in large a chunks that just ... them off because\nI Want results results\nI gave you told me that this guy had a chance this guy was gonna do it I saw him everywhere and you still got beat and a and a beaten by how much\nIt wasn't even close where's my money where's my money\nAnd I you know I think that's how people would react to that but\nI Know people on the Democratic side who have given money who are absolutely that they have given given and given and they're like you know I have to tell you\nYou're you're off the deep end with crazy radicals and you're putting up people who do you have who have this guy\nThis guy he didn't win and\nLife after military service has different many veterans\nFind transitioning difficult feeling lost an uncertain about the future these feelings don't take away from a veteran strength courage or sense of duty if you're a veteran in crisis or no one who is\nThe power of one person one connection one act of compassion can make a difference for free twenty four seven confidential support called a veterans crisis line one eight hundred two seven three eight to five five and press one quarter visit veterans crisis line dot net\nFrom the bio Steve environments duty a C.

of something hitting the moon\nOkay and and this was after I said something about the Russian scientists and the spaceship gay\nAnd YouTube shuts down and they're saying the rumor yet they shut down because somebody wanted to push this video is going by really want to stop it from going viral it was a video of a man who was in uniform military saying that he had word that something was going to

and I remember my friend Sara called me and she's saying you know what makes you think it's a U.S for a modern much what makes the Russian scientist that gives us our model and I thought I don't know so I went back to try and look for today I couldn't find the story\nAnd I swear I posted it\nI saw it posted on my Facebook page and I have another\nCall you my name cars pill who he has a site called

extraterrestrial intervention\nSee the aliens didn't want us puny earthlings to fire rockets in the sky or use satellites to track the fact that they were planning their major invasion\nSo I was thinking about that film today\nEspecially when I was reading that some major space mishaps have been happening recently that seemed like an eerie coincidence\nLike for example the Russian rockets so use MS ten failed to launch on its way to the I obsess and according to a statement released by NASA but still use MS ten spacecraft launched from boxing or caused withdrawn the conflicts done to the international space station of poor forty am eastern stand eastern daylight time\nOn Thursday October eleventh\nCarrying American astronaut Nick ... in Russia in Colorado Alexi ocean shortly after launch there was an anomaly with the booster and the launch\nWas aboard it so I had to have a ballistic landing other spacecraft\nBelonged to appear to be going smoothly but Ninety seconds later NASA on his life's dream reported that a problem seemed to have occurred while the booster rocket between the first and second stages of operation the space agency NASA tweeted that ballistic dissent involved they sharper angle of lending compared to normal\nThe capsule continue the astronaut successfully separated from the rocket booster and parachute into the ground with a rescue teams helicopters we're ... we're actually standing there waiting for him it's also interesting to know the two NASA\nOr two of NASA is important in space telescopes went into safe mode meaning that something forced them into shutting down the Chandra X ray observatory went into safe mode\nAnd halted all that science operations a few days after that Hubble are actually have a shutdown first house shut down to a gyroscope failure\nThe ... X ray observatory shut down a shattered his transition disabled as popular as they say this is what NASA said was possibly triggered by an issue that also has something to do with its gyroscope as well so we're\nLooking at component shutting down on the Chandra X ray observatory the Hubble Space telescope [noise] fallen by the way the curiosity Mars rover NASA's curiosity rover that also health and science operations it went into ... as well [noise] okay\n[noise] different observatories the Chandra X ray observatory the Hubble Space telescope [noise]\nThe White House also recently issued a new national near earth object prepared the strategy and\nAction plan intended to energize hosted agencies who could contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster\nFirst of all why are they spending Ninety million dollars we don't have a there's nothing to worry about and and what about the moon bay they were they were planning on going to the moon now they have their ... over budget they're they're under a they're under a performing here\nSecondly white issue a brand new plan that is intended to energize a hosted agencies who can contribute to the potential ways to prevent such a disaster if if there's no disaster looming for the foreseeable future why are they doing this something doesn't smell right here\n\nThese accordion NASA there are more than twenty five thousand asteroids lurking out there that are one hundred and forty meters in size or greater those are the ones that pose a threat there are a lot that pose a threat and there are ... million near earth objects that could pose a potential threat out there\nAnd so\nIt definitely makes sense to be prepared for such a disaster back in twenty sixteen\nThough we had the planetary defense coordination so if they win this interplanetary astro apocalypse\nBack in twenty sixteen though we had the planetary defense coordination op so\nIf they win\nThis interplanetary Astoria apocalypse comes NASA wants to be prepared but I don't understand why overnight okay basically overnight the planetary defense coordination office just got a hundred and fifty million dollars for their budget\n\nAnd this is for asteroids okay say asteroids quote asteroids right so now you're in a wide feeling a little tension because we have\nThe Russians saying they saw an armada let's say there was a dual star clustered looking into a circus or to be do get me wrong I'm not saying there is there a moderate coming okay but I say it looked like a star cluster but the Russians are saying yeah we've looked at it a little bit kind of looks like an armada of some kind yeah cause you throw that out there\nSo I had I talked about it and people to say I talked about on Monday show I guess I talked about that on Monday show\nMy friend Sara says yeah you did talk about because I Want to know why they think it's an armada and remember I called yeah OK you called me\nThey can send astronauts to the IOC says if the rocket malfunction we have to\nX ray or you have the Chandra X ray telescope we have the Hubble shut down they went into the ... they ... they went into safe mode there wasn't a glitch boat where the curiosity Mars rover it's a glitch mode\nYou to shut down all night most of the night\nI mean no one knows what's wrong with the rover right now just it just cropped up Saturday Night and prevents the rover from being mean to earth much of the science and engineering information stored in its memory all this has happened\nKeep in mind but all this has happened after the sunspot observatory New Mexico was inexplicably shut down on September\n... shutdowns sound very much like a precursor do some sort of alien invasion doesn't or some sort of a a a huge\nAsteroid and the guy in a uniform and and\nWell like I said this is like a war of the world's thing that says this is a you know science fiction of course there's a wonderful way of exploring where the cutting edge of science might take us in the future\nAnd there have been numerous stories as of late the bears resemblance to many of the science fiction stories we read over time however these aren't fiction people they this is not fiction and regardless of the many decades of cover up\nIt's no longer possible to hide the fact\nThere is an active alerted the moment for extraterrestrial contact\n\nThe as we are looking for confirmation of alien life forms heat is difficult but here the breakthroughs in science that has been announced with well\nAt least those announcements which certainly confirm of life existing and space\nI mean this newfound sense of confidence from NASA and the European space agency along with several other specialist Russians of course\nI mean they're noting that what was once considered myth what they want speculated about is now finding its way into mainstream science\nMuch of what we're hearing about can be fulfilling of our lofty dreams and other discoveries are those that make up our nightmares thinking or nightmares come true I mean it all depends on how you look at these major discoveries\nIt all depends on whether or not all of the things that are circumstantial shutting down on YouTube that double scope shutting down and several other things have happened and we get to as well it just all seems bizarre\nJust seems\n\nIt just all seems bizarre\n\nJust seems bizarre\nMargaret and Pennsylvania Hi Margaret you're on ground zero Oh hi client I'm really not cold is I wanted to confirms that I did hear you say about those ships\nUm that day you thought it was the star cluster in this Russian scientists thought they were ships [noise] um I Do remember that because I went on YouTube looking to see if there was anything about that\nAnd all I saw was there was something about the moon getting hit\nBut it was an old entry so I didn't even open it but there was another entry that\nI Can't find now that said if you see something in the sky that looks like space ship it it's just a hologram say\nReally you saw something like that yeah and because I'm always I'm always looking\nOn YouTube and and looking um I I'm fascinated with with\nUs those and and space a spaceships and that and so I'm always looking at the different YouTube and selling them you can tell or fake and some of them are interesting but when they said this\nI thought oh I heard that wants to be for somewhere like remember if I heard it from your show or if I heard it from somewhere else that that they were\nThat the government was working on some way to do like a hologram in the sky to I'm frightened people and that keeps them in line\nOh they've been talking about the project blueberry many times before\nSaying that you know you can make ... guide to fool anybody and that's what they're saying things that could be it for the this was something else this was a guy in uniform this is what we stayed there was a guy in uniform that was on you to be looked official and he said\nSomething is about to hit the moon and rather than having nothing go viral his proposed speculated that you to shut down the channels because he didn't want that message to get out and\nWell I can tell you that that\nI Can't stay up late anymore because I have a job now that gets me I have to get up early and so a lotta times I listen to your um ... podcast because I Know you're saying yeah my partner\nUh and so I and when I listened to those um it's\nShorter time for me on you know to listen and plus I can look up things on YouTube and see if I see anything that you're talking about on YouTube\nAnd that's what happened when I heard you say this about the um the the possible spaceship [noise] um that you thought just look like a grouping of stars so I went on looking for Russian scientists anything\nAnd I didn't find it in\n... I I have to believe it or not I have the picture in front of me I had the report is Russia Today okay\nI thought it would be from the problem but no it was from Russia Today looking at it and I I I remember making a comment this SARS going to say this could look like an armada came back to try and find out again no trace it anywhere on the Internet no trace it oh well that's\nThat's what I was trying to get to\nTo try and find that again no trace it anywhere on the Internet no trace it oh well that's\nThat's what I was trying to get to I not only ... and I find that I could find the the old hosting of something hitting the new and I couldn't find the you to talk about is their spaceships showing in the sky there may\nNot find any of that ... law so whatever they did they eliminate a lot of stuff not just outlined [noise]\nOkay so many little I'm getting a lot of twitters tonight tweets telling me that\nOh settling to Youtube video you're Facebooking as you're talking about ... minutes\nOkay we're gonna we're gonna take a break right now [noise] um [noise] but yeah this is this is a weird story this is the weirdest story I think ground zeroes ever been in the middle of because of what I said a couple of nights ago and in what has transpired in the past three nights with the\nI guess I just wanted to add one of the little thing will be for our medical system wick I could not sleep tonight that's why I'm not listening because it's late here for me", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "18"}
