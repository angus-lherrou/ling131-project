to get the best deal Hanna is in Georgia so my husband on our own baby step three be now what that means is that they are debt free except their home life saved up their emergency\nOur own baby step three be and what that means is that they are dead free except their home life saved up their emergency fund a three to six months of expenses and three beam means beyond that they're saving for the down payment on their house\nWe want to take her two young children to Disneyworld you should\nWe're currently saving to build our our new home on property we bought in cash already we can cash flow the trip by not saving for the house for one month about three thousand dollars I feel guilty for both not taking a family vacation and for not saving money where's the balance you you're guilty a lot aren't you\nI mean you're stuck 'cause you're just going to be guilty you're guilty if you go to Disney and you're going to be guilty if you don't\nYou know what I Do I'll be happy for that either one or nobody guilty either way it's your money it's your choice you're smart either way\nYou're out of debt you have your emergency fund and you're saving up for expenditures one of the expenditures as you want to build a house for cash that some awesome go second one is you want to spend more months of that money and go to Disney about three thousand bucks a either one is wonderful you should not feel guilty\nEither way but I'll tell you what I Would do I'd go to Disney yeah little kids you part is perfect age for that\nUm if it's something you obviously do want to do something they want to do I'm just not something I Want to do but you it's fine I mean Rachel cruise loves Disney she just took her little baby down there\nThey had a wonderful time not sure how great it time her husband had but they had a great time\nAnd I'm no uh but but I mean if it's what you want to do you've saved up the money you're not going into that you're not getting out of debt and going on vacation you're out of that you have your emergency fund this is the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some of the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals\nBut I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals then you're not enjoying your life\nYou live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby steps you're extremely intense you don't do anything except beans and rice rice and beans till you're ... out of debt and have your emergency fund in place and then you let your foot off the accelerator some to where you can do baby steps for five and six\nAnd purchases are in there all at the same time maybe step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement meanwhile you start putting some pretty good college and five and six years when you find extra money pay off the house early in that sense that what you're working towards\nThe middle of all of that we don't go ten years and never go on vacation\nThat's when you go on vacation and we don't go ten years and never upgrade the couch that as springs sticking out of it that's when you upgrade the couch you just pay cash for the stuff and you realize that every time we consume something it slows down our long term wealth building but the purpose of long term wealth building has to be able to consume\nAnd to be able to give\nMoney piled up just for ... having a pile of money sake is not worth anything is only worth something when it does something for your family or you're able to do something for others that's all it's good for Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThey have a say thank you for taking my call first time caller sure I'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training\nAnd I finally received like commercial helicopter state ticket\nUm however I unfortunately I Need a the by eighty hours or more training I've I discovered a history is highly regulated by insurance\nIn an orderly comment sure why NATO or two hundred hours and I'm trying to figure out how to pay for eighty hours and be ready to work the upcoming season um\nA figure 'em out how to pay for those eighty hours and be ready to work the upcoming season I'm as a commercial up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a copilot and yet the hours\n[noise] no I unfortunately a day or a job are there any out as a single pilot\nNow that that moment you just said the wrong thing you should do the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida and you know ... what's wrong\nWell I I didn't tell you another thing or two days I I work at a firefighter so that's my primary um income chores there's this kind of like a secondary thing that that kind of went off in bed and that's uh\nThat's kinda why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as a ... ... jobs that I I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than ...\nI Know I Believe it or not firefighter or the definitely make more\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or a career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nYes yeah so that's what I Want to do [noise] okay um\nAnd you show your forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work an irregular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited value\nYeah it's not that you personally it's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this is like it's like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I just I feel I'm too far into it to just\nSuggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except just slow down and go I'm just gonna take me a little time 'cause I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do the hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job\nGenerally up and they don't charge not worth that much\nYeah it doesn't pay that much either\nAnd that's what I mean they're not worth that last compared to what you're paying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training in the first year\nNo mayor right now\nSo not to mention all the money you've already put on it so I'm what I'm going to do is look for a place\nI mean you've got connections in the fire department of their life like guys or something that you can get some hours in the coal policy can get some takeoffs and landings and get a counselor actually\nA fork saying those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently find a Robin ...\nAircraft gotcha\nNot even a turbine yet but um I mean I I've even reached out to people that own their own aircraft and and the and offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get desert or Jerry ... and unfortunately a lot a lot of those guys are very busy\nSo I can get and our air and our there but nothing really Constand\nTo you're going to end up paying for these hours what is it the eighty hours cost\n[noise] well considering some of the hour and a place of a you know on the cheap you can get some at two fifty or three hundred five hundred it all depends on the aircraft and what kind of a deal you can get you know so\nBecause you know you might have twenty thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much pretty much yeah and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on\nJust take your time and cash flow it because you you now have as we continue the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry\nLevel um ... the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more and so this is\nUm ... the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more and so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah yeah ... yeah why not I I there's nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah yeah I mean I I've got a ... I collect handguns and shoot them a lot and uh and and also I burn\nThrough some MOH but it's a ... I don't make any money doing them or trying to make money doing it but it was just a hobby\nAnd so that costs money hobbies costs are on and this was not going to cost you money it's actually gonna make you a little once you get past this but up until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just going to put another twenty thousand bucks into this

rediscovered audio files from Nineteen forty five perfectly describing a recent times\nIt is about a it was about two and a half minutes radio broadcast\nAnd it was a breach in Nineteen forty five shaded by twenty forty five but man would reach other heavenly bodies including Mars or the man predicted all sorts of things in fact here is a recording of of that historic recording from Nineteen forty five people listen to what this man predicted and see how close you can\nHave it is and gentlemen welcome back in the program today we're going to talk about or Rob a serious topic the future what does the\nFuture hold today we're going to make some predictions maybe someday my back on such predictions but yeah I Do know is Nineteen forty five hundred years from now it\nWon't be twenty forty five it is difficult to imagine the state of the world in one hundred years as we have seen before the world has changed drastically in the past one hundred yes just one hundred years ago\nIn the Eighteen forty five the concept of self power flying machine and seemed as ridiculous than ideas abba to many who that is great and dust real revolution\nThe well the scene changed in the fall came to mind as we wrap protections for the next one hundred years in one hundred years I put it that man\nWill have stepped foot in front of us celestial bodies such as the moon independent loss in one hundred years I put it that the average man will get his news and entertainment from a variety\nOf sources big companies will no longer have a monopoly on the news and entertainment people enjoy I predict that in one hundred years calls will no longer be constrained to the ground they will have the ability to fly and the average will and the energy that powers the cost will come from the sun in one\nHundred years I put the television sets we'll get increasingly smaller only protect the television sets for ...\nTo the point that they can fit it on our risk porches I've been in one hundred years that will be filmed cameras at every street corner there will be put in place in the name of a safety but our freedoms really increasingly vanish\nWe will trade our freedom a safety we know our rights to bail wrote it because they all thought his tell us and we'll keep our children are safe now remember these are like\nAnd maybe some of the future man or back on that day so\nThat's a a broadcast from Nineteen forty five not jaded by the year was Nineteen forty five according to apex TV a company that is a setting that out are putting out for the claim that the broadcast came from England\nThe broadcasters probably aired right after World War two with it to the early days ... so disturbing part of the Manson ounce men\nHis where he talks about the erosion or dissolution of the right to privacy which of course now we have a smart cities moving it\nOr we have cameras everywhere as he said he said that TV screens will be reduced down to you about the size of wristwatch is well of course back then I'm sure they had Dick Tracy or or a several other science fiction type of things to look at and say yes but what they didn't plan on was that TV screens be reduced down to your phone\nAnd to be in your hand so it's kind of like that you know he was very close course talking about Mars and the moon battles set foot on a he talked about many places to get entertainment\nOr he said the big companies are not a lot of big companies we only a lot of entertainment sources\nHe's half right there I mean most of our mainstream entertainment is coming from big companies that own a a lot of a movie companies they own a lot of a TV and radio conglomerates in magazines\nBut we also have a lot of independent entertainment and interdependence programming and writing such as what you hear on this program or what you see on the Internet that uh you know comes from just regular people reminded me when I met Timothy Leary uh back when he was doing his tours he told me he he felt as though the future\nOr would be a time where kids themselves would be making commercials on the computers uh that would be a high school project like they can be making a he said well they'd be making commercials for Pepsi or they'd be making commercials for a Adidas or or some other company a where he said that this is how it would be done and of course\nNow we see that a lot of these uh you know commercials are made with just self up\nA digital in fact some movies are shut on cell phones and a lot of independent films are done by younger people these days a lot of TV shows are done by younger people these days is they're producing these out of school and then they're getting big companies to buy them and produced so they go back and they do different edits and that sort of thing so that broadcast from Nineteen forty five\nHas described in in more ways than one a perfect future\nI mean he I mean we have to wait and see what happens in twenty forty five\nBut he says a hundred years Nineteen forty five to twenty forty five\nWhat he believed was going to happen what he believed was going down and I just think it's fascinating to hear once again how something from the past seems to have a grasp on what is happening today or what would be happening in the future and twenty forty five so very interesting to go back and listen to that\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's triple eight six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero [noise]\n\nScience fiction writer his eyes science fiction has never gotten it right and I said I beg to differ man I said you write it you write science that I read it okay I I read the comics I read the books I see the movies and there are a lot of things\nThat people like Harlan Ellison who just passed away got ride for people like Ray Bradbury or Isaac Asimov got right Philip K Dick amazing right he he got allows surprise um and and so when you're when you're thinking about this revelation of a mess it it's a it's a very deep\nFascinating conduit to time travel and to\nThe fantastical concepts that most people considered the stuff of science fiction and while the idea that someone can Journey Through time and change the course of history hideous terrifyingly tantalize simply just not thought to be possible\nBut what if it is\nWhat ... what is there had been those with insight that have been able to see the future of comes from the future to let us all know through science fiction that that time travel is possible and that has happened from time to time or time after time\nSo it's really you know when I'm finished with my radio show I stay up late I don't go to bed till about two or three in the morning and why because I I Want to go home kick off my shoes\nTurn on some mindless TV I watch the cartoons I watch you don't recognize ... much you know Family Guy although I've watched it a Family Guy now watching working more a more than watching Family Guy so Rick Morrisey\nAnd the reason why is because some are TV is relatively dull and I'm and I'm pretty much you know trying to\nYou know record something that can watch it another time but it's not really on TV that I'm watching the you know sometimes I go to Netflix I watched that but I I I binge watch around watching Netflix so I'm Glad that I have a subscription to Netflix I'm Glad that I have all these science fiction shows I can watch and you know I can watch my favorite science fiction shows whenever I Want to\nOr the other night I was up late and I wanted to watch something\nSomething interesting so for some reason I saw the tomorrow in the film with George Clooney is a Disney movie which I saw the theaters which I really like it was free and I said oh yeah oh I watched that would be cool you know well there's a part of the film that I forgot even existed\nAnd that was a part they discussed a secret society\nCalled plus ultra\nNow according to the fictional history created for the film good stuff Eiffel Jules Verne and Thomas Edison in his tower apartment\nJust started a secret society of optimist plus ultra was founded at the Eighteen eighty nine were ... world's fair in Paris, France\nAnd the organizations purpose was to create moderate and expand upon new scientific advancements for humanity\nKey members of plus ultra including Ray Bradbury million Earhart Mark Twain Nikola Tesla and other key scientific pictures all this was also a member of plus altar of course but it's funny because nickel itself the Tesla new Mark Twain\nAh Nikola Tesla was a kind of a uh\nI'd say you know you it was kind of one of the H. G. wells is a counterparts or be of course a she was was England\nAnd uh you know a Thomas Edison of course tests or for edited it just there seems to be this connection between all of these famous people I don't know me a million ... comes in but Mark Twain Tesla and other\nPeople his name was a part of it and I thought to myself\nOr is there any truth to the idea that there was a secret society that Disney was a part of that ah Nikola Tesla was a part of a Mark Twain plus ultra wasn't really a plus ultra secret society well we learned that according to this detailed fiction\nIn the film that tomorrow land Nineteen fifty nine when Marlene how does expansion of Disneyland it was actually about\n... this is what it said the movie that the idea of having tomorrow land was actually an area where they wanted and train future society members for the journey to an alternate universe having been foundered developed by plus ultra\nGay so plus ultra found out about opening portals to other universes and so the idea was that they wanted to develop a utopian\n... land as society in the future or in this in this world where there was through the portal\nAnd so the blueprints for the expansion held Keith technologies that enabled the journey including what is known as super transport so they're able to come and go through these portals low key VIPs who were encouraged to join plus ultra were given a special VIP audio Charo tour actually of the world's fair attraction such as\nFord's magic skyway and it's a small world ride off for those that couldn't attend the fair a double ...\nL.
