T.\nCom or this public service announcements brought to you about the American physical therapy association Mm\nOver the weekend I'm so sick of those who want to blame this president for everything he didn't express sympathy or expressed it fast enough stop it there's a deep sickness taking root in this country and it spread here Twitter has become the white van covered and despicable bumper stickers\nOr listen to some of the responses the deep sickness stems from a man who mock sending flames hatred and bigotry he's not the root cause but he's fanning the flames yeah caffeine\nOr you two are you doing that as well is CNN is is anybody else in the media doing that is Twitter\nFanning the flames uh watches rallies and tell me how he leads us into a unified a nation or I tell you what Allison in Kentucky I'm going to take her in a minute she was just that one of his rallies uh let's see oh Glenn are you going to do an anti Semitic attack on George Soros tonight\nKnow how many have you done over the years none probably too many to count at no none but oh yeah right Twitter is the problem will seem like it is because you don't have the facts\nAnd all you're doing is you are being a blowhard without any facts I'm not anti Semitic ...\nHow how how hunter of Israel award accredited by the prime minister of Israel he\nOf George Soros was paying for a anti uh Glenn Beck protesters while I was doing a defensive Israel a program in Israel\n... and ... are very quiet people but when you got to this rally and there there was just an energy that was there that you realize Lincoln these there's hope for society\nYeah granted I got up and went to Walmart the next morning and people are cutting you off to get to the best parking spot you know help on how Alison\nHang on the second I Want to get your copy of my book I I signed it I'll send it out to you thank you so much for holding and thanks for I'm I'm sharing that it is that that is but maybe if I don't I struggling today\nDo feel like some struggling today 'cause I don't feel like I'm struggling to them I'm a little frustrated at ... in the nation I Would say at the end of the of all I'm frustrated that we concentrate on all the wrong things and I think that's kind of what she's saying here um let's see these aren't the things we should be concentrating on you know the the the president\nOr being an anti Semite she's his daughter is Jewish\nThe ... you know how many Klan members are cool with that I I don't think any relatively few\nYeah how many how many Nazis were like a you know what yeah okay so my daughter's gonna marry this Jewish guy she's got to become Jewish that's great that doesn't happen again\nWhen you're talking about uh American Jews one of the main things they've asked the president for for how many generations was to move the capital packed in Jerusalem and this is the guy that did it I mean he you know look\nIt's insane\nIt boils down to these ridiculous uh summaries\nOf what a person believes they are you telling me you can't criticize someone on the on the left that you disagree with politically because they're Jewish because then you get called an anti Semite\nAnd the same way like a liberal should be able to criticize without fear of being called a racist Clarence Thomas it should be able to say I think he's wrong on the on the constitution they should absolutely be able to do that without being called racist\nBut this this bizarre thing and this is carried out today not by you know the mother Jones in the Huffington Post read expected but every mainstream media source asking question after question after question what part of this give me a percentage tell me please how much of this is Donald Trump's fault so here's let me let me\nDo what the Allison just said let's make a tangible here is Joe Lieberman on a very frustrating interview with CNN listen to this\nWell it's just shocking moment I mean I we view it all through our own experience I I haven't had a life for this is a Jewish American which has been is not only free of anti Semitism\nBut I've had the opportunity to be elected senator from states Connecticut where the Jewish population as well to present and then oh gorgeous me the chance to run for vice president first Jewish American on a national ticket\nOr that really didn't know I face no anti Semitism\nA and forgive me for going back to the end of the ... election we actually got five hundred thousand more votes and the other ticket ... which was a reflection in numbers that people were voting are based on religion so when something like this happens\nIt's shocking and it changes that reality but I Believe the reality is that the American people are very fair minded not bigger than you saw it in the wholesome reaction of the neighbors who are not Jewish and scroll hill Pittsburgh and and the elected officials there it was very genuine\n... and of course this does not please CNN this is not what they want it out of trouble\nAnd then they elected officials there it was very genuine\n... and of course this does not please CNN this is not what they want it out of Joe Lieberman they didn't bring him on to say that he had a good experience as an American you know to bring him on to say positive things\nThey brought him onto to clarify exactly what portion of this is Donald Trump's fault tell us so we don't have to say it say he's responsible so we can have plausible deniability that that that this is exactly what we believe we don't want to come out and say at five thousand times we'll just have to what you said okay\nThis is actually the way they lead into this next question and again he is not giving them what what they want to hear\nListen ... believe that there are those who for seen those to be anti Semitic dog whistles when you see the only one of the closing ad campaign\nGeorge Soros Shannon Yellen morning Blankfein from Goldman Sachs with dark ominous pictures and talking about the money and the international banks question okay is that something that that sends a message\nAll the first thing I Want to say is that in my opinion this brutal murderer in pits for really had to wear was committed by a hateful loner who was probably\nMore stimulated but uh uh anti Semitism in a social media than anything else going around um he ... he was against a President Trump but it's a real a real I I was going to see the this website is taking it down\nFor a while and and all the social media people have to ask whether they're becoming vehicles for this kind of hatred but more generally I think all of us\nA half to ... beginning with the president democratic and Republican leaders in Congress people in the media invention all media and the more of an unconventional social media have to ask ourselves to what extent are weak contributing\nTo the division in our society Charlie Dent and I worked together and a group of No Labels trying to overcome or the way the parties have become like worrying tribes\nBut this goes beyond yet of just ... and if you're in the one that is so what would I say we're on the president makes a a statement about unity ah let's presume for\nThan urge them to build on it and think about ways in which a can act so that no one can ever say ah he somehow was responsible for violence or or hatred\nAgain that's the the the Joe Lieberman forty seven minute response ah but I mean you get the summary there I mean first of all this guy was not pro Trump not I mean he was ... viscerally\nAnti Trump in a way of he you know what I don't like about Donald Trump is he's too nice to Jews\nThat is essentially what the guy was saying on his social network over and over and over and over again\nAnd so he was not a pro Trump guy that shot up this sucks the synagogue\nA and you know like if it's important to make that distinction and how do you bring people together the exact opposite of what CNN is trying to do in that clip ... I mean without ... just in the nicest Joe Lieberman possible way right but what are you saying is what you're doing right now\nBy trying to make this into a situation where it's Trump is blamed what we should do is wrong what we should do instead is when he says something that we think helps the environment we should praised it sure certainly generally speaking we have an an issue with our discourse I think I think almost everybody would agree with that\nUm but when it comes to the shooting it's not related right\nSo here's what the media should have done this weekend the media should have said okay so what role does rhetoric\nOn social media and from the president and from the press and everything else what role does media play in in in the life of the guy who as we saw this\nI'm ... tried to commit with a with a pipe bombs\nThe guy was nuts the guy was absolutely nuts he was a\nLoner she had finally found a cause that she could you know rallied behind she ... Reno was\nNot he was nuts okay so that one what role does politics play does the media play do politicians play in whining people up\nThat's a viable asked the question on that particular topic and not just about Trump but the whole thing\n... ... what role does the media play what about Twitter what about Facebook what's winding some of these people up what happens in the future\nOkay valid\nThe shooting in Pittsburgh here's how they should have covered this this guy was a anti Semite who this clearly had nothing to do with politics the guy hated Donald Trump this is just\nA loner just like the guy in the van he had no friends\nHe had no friends she was a sick twisted guy\nWhat is the whole in America why are we seeing this now\nBecause it it's\nNot Donald Trump and it's not for Rocco Obama ... right there's something fundamentally missing here what is it why are we changing wire or kids killing themselves at a record rate\nThere is a bigger issue here than politics but nobody in the media wants to address it because nobody in the media and nobody in politics can win\n[noise]\nBy the way we're doing a episode tonight on what happened in Brazil and the candidate in Brazil\nAnd why does that matter [noise] why does that matter\nThat's a really important a monologue or that you don't want to miss and that is on tonight's a [noise] a TV show the blaze\nAt five PM [noise]\nAlright sponsored this half hour is life lock cyber security cyber security\n[laughter]\nYou really think that you're for safe I mean with anything I mean on line I mean no no way no way\nForward after report basically every day there's another one of these things where hey five hundred million [laughter] you know subscribers or you\nAll our twenty four hour victim help line at age seven seven net help or visit mad data\nFrom your first one runs to the onset of life we are with you through life's journey\nSocial Security or ... or in today and tomorrow\nIt's Social Security to\nProduce and us taxpayer expense\nFrom the biopsy environment studios CPU well am nine Seventy building toward it now live and local in the mornings with Montana talks on news talk Ninety five point five\nVisuals for the fall and I'm Carmen Robert Fox news yeah those are the ... and that's where the guy was an attack on each and every one of us\nPennsylvania governor Tom Wolfe individual with thousands in Pittsburgh to honor the victims of the tree of life synagogue\nIt was an attack on our humanity\nWas an attack what our value [noise]\nIt was ... what are very the\nFunerals for the eleven killed start Tuesday was three victims to be laid to rest that day on the same time a President Trump and first lady will visit Pittsburgh and a rabbi at the tree of life says the president's welcome but nearly a dozen other Jewish leaders from a progressive group said the president should stay away\nGo to pay my respects I'm also going to the hospital to see the officers and uh some of the people that were so badly hurt\nPresident Trump has been using words like wicket and vote to describe the deadliest attack on Jews\nIn American history but eleven Jewish leaders say it's the words he's used over the last three years that have quote in bold into growing white nationalist movement the letter goes on to say President Trump you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism\nAfter this headline making ration at a rally last week [noise] you know what I Am I'm a nationalist\nFox's ...

tonight has actually it's been many years in the making [laughter] um the reason I say this is because\nI remember I'm Nick Read from the writer wrote a book that I read\nAnd it talks about the cones family or the or the the elite college bug line\nAnd I thought\nThis is crazy man that whole Collins group or the college elite or the college Thirteen or whatever and then of course a one day I met for spring Meyer another a person who writes about the ... lines of the women are families and\nHe's going up on the ... family and I'm thinking you know okay um what proof do we have and someone said to me as well you know every time\nYou know they write stories about vampires other write stories about you know I'm you know different types of secret societal families that kind of hit the Collins family\nAnd he pointed out dark shadows they pointed out all these other shows something you know you know kept calling would I understand that and you know everything else and so I just kind of let it be and I thought man what someday I'd want to talk about this because I think it's interesting and a\nMic Redfern gave us a call the other day and I told him I said you know I Know you just wrote a book about aliens because he did he ... he wrote this great book about aliens\nAnd I said I'm reading that right now but you know you wrote a book a long time ago about the call and so each and you wrote about how their family they go all the way back to the druids and um\nAnd how are you know the names of the yo Colin how would you say the ... or ... or it's old cue on actually still struggling to OCU I. L. L. E. A. I. N. O. coil in or oh Collins and how they established\nSee you by L. L. E. A. I. N. O. coil in or oh Collins\nAnd how they established themselves as the elite family and they're part of the Thirteen most powerful bloodlines and you know when you're hearing about it ... that limit I conspiracy everybody says well what about the Rockefellers or what about the Rothschild and it's all bloodlines they were talking about okay\nAnd I remember coming to Portland and someone said you need to go to Astoria okay and I said why is because the asteroids we asked your bloodline you know who they are no\nAs I studied all about the Astor bloodline and how you know the Astros were also kind of a vampire blood line and then all these mysterious families the Bundys and the ... and the dupont's\nAnd I and some of the names like the department's for example they were involved with a ... let's say on trying to bring forward than council of benign which of course these nine demons or these nine agents that are are here they want to bring them forward from the Easter\nAnd I got to thinking about Alister Crowell you and I got to thinking about how he\nAbroad forward a character called lam which was a bold creature they called the monkey was and then you have jak Parsons now Ron Hubbard and you have the Babylon working and John D and that Kelly and what they did I brought them up during my ground zero lounge grounds there a Halloween party that I had the other night\nI don't think people really understood I was talking about but the idea of the of the ritual is um and magic and creating the ... or at least creating a Gen or a gala or or something\nBut how about the idea of creating a vampire or creating a night stalker which would go out and in order to a ... in order to satisfy the creator\nThe night stalker has to go from house to house taking people against their will\nSometimes removing things from their body whether it be their vital organs for their blood and taking it back to some strange group\nSome strange elite group in order for them to\nHave good health you know what I'm saying I mean we were talking about this the unite the ambrosia group but now they've gone forward they said okay well we'll have a clinic in New York now and people volunteer to give blood and people who volunteer to get shots eight thousand dollars gets you a shovel the blood\nOkay\nBut when you're dealing with secret societies okay when you're dealing with the nature most powerful nature of the secret societies\nIt's hard to pinpoint just where the real uh called power of ancient European bloodlines comes from and the traditions of the oldest high kings of Ireland\nHad had at their disposal the holy ones are the ... the ... the ... the calling snakes in fact the call and the ... name again\nMeans coil or also uh what coils in the woods um and then of course leg coy lay\nBeans physician so you have the [noise] the calling physician in the woods or the one who carries mistake on the poll hundreds [laughter] okay [noise] so [noise] a combination of probably the most primitive Gaelic words so ... and\nOr make read from reports that after he published a book final events he was in contact with the man formerly attached to a U.S military group known as the nights doctors\nWho maintained the real purpose behind the cattle mutilation phenomenon was to a piece called based entities with whom elements of the official world we're desperately trying to engage in work with in essence\nHis story is that the removal of vital organs are particularly the blood for mutilated cattle is not the work of aliens but\nOf course these night stocking demons that have been some and and it had been someone for well over for many years thousands of years the culprits according to read for his contacts were paramilitary groups that take the blood in Oregon's from cattle and humans\nIn order to be utilized an ancient sacrificial appeasement rights to incredibly old DDT the type that can offer something in return supernatural powers what type of understood and harnessed may even be weaponized\nSounds like a what I was was reading about that it sounds like the gym or it sounds like you know I'm I don't know\nThe idea of just summoning a gym or ... or creating a monster in order to\nAttack or the sort of thing it's a [laughter] it's pretty amazing actually go to um go to\nReach that your name leach highly ... and I do about it\n[laughter] you are making my skin crawl\nHi leach coming in for doing buddy [noise]\nAh [laughter]\nYou are making my skin crawl St Louis\nHowe so ah [noise] I ... which is my last name right I Am or what we descended from Collins okay ... ah was on in mid coast may\nWhile uh that's where the majority of my family is and it or is from ...\nAh she's still trying to collect my thoughts because there's so many pieces that are kind of Wyoming together and might add um ever since I was little\nI have been fascinated ... or ... with the damn hires a ... they didn't scare me at all I Do I Want it to be ...\nWill keep in mind is I mean the Collins controlled them okay the comments controlled the vampires so whatever you know you wouldn't want to mess with the ... family or the uh ... because they control the vampires they were the ones that control of life and death they were the ... with the medicine men they were the\nA pop that carry a workers they were the ones that were able to promote health\nOr take away health they had the power of life and death and their hands\nSo they all have our older ones that you don't have\nTo I got away from the whole wanting to be a vampire thing yes but I still had white and attraction that was a um and also the the leakage family that kind of made me think\nOf ah the old school doctors that would use leeches to way to end or purify you know there's the old are your thing\nMhm they're used my us yes uh-huh\nWell sorry I'm I'm a bit of a jumble its Muslim and I'm like yeah the whole dark\nShadows thing and coast Maine and my family is call and say you know like my my dad's mother ... is a colonies and my dad's dad is a ... so\nDo you know what your your name itself view if you have to you know when you're talking about leeches in blood and\nAnd that sort of thing it's just the idea that the name itself bleach it's OK\nIs actually taken from the water itself beating that um you know if if your last name is leech a of course uh it's the it's from the word uh a while they'd means leach means the what the leeches they use for medical purposes but it's also meaning\nThe war is like taking the boardwalk or look which of course is the\nIs the old word for those who work on the lake or those who work on the water\nSo right um yeah ... is this thing I'd say a flood yeah the leads takes the blood away that's what it is a threat to the doctor applies leeches\nFor medical reasons and then from there it was like whatever or whomever worked on the water also got the name leach as well as like latch there's which would you courses\nAgain another a strange a ... a creature of which is of course they resurrected a zombie like being a witch and then we ...\nYeah a magical imagine old a ... that does not die um it comes back from the dead the ledge grow I mean it it's interesting and all those Maine's Susan Collins they'll come together the ... ah leach which\nThe dead the ledge though I mean it it's interesting and all those names Senate and Collins they'll come together the ... ah leach which ah connections of you know that which takes the blood and not which uses the blood to live forever it's it's the same origins of the name\nAnd again I'm not sure of all of this it in my head but it seems like stuff was falling together as you were talking about the call and these ... ... ... everything else and then you know the whole each Collins families\nThat I Am a part of ...\nAnd the fact that as I said the water and English Irish yep\nAlready married and then all coming over to the east coast places like Maine and others are right in Delaware and other places where they came and they and they and they actually settled there that upon subtle bears or other ... people came in a lot of them yeah a lot of these a looming all your bloodline families\nSettled in places like Maine and a Massachusetts and all these places\nYou know I was raised in my state college because I don't want to be part of a\nA little ... and white you started throwing just together and I'm like oh God no\nWell blame that blame that on print spring Meyer and blame that on a Nick Redford because uh I I read this stuff and I just thought it was interesting because it just made me think of dark shadows on the TV show dark shadows and Barnabas Collins so thinking yeah of course okay so why do you recall like go to Gary in Delaware Hi Garret Iran ground zero\nHello Mr Lewis good evening\nI was just calling because I Am from Delaware uh-huh\nAnd even though I'm not part of the blood line I actually spent a lot of time out the woman in ... public library which is a monument that you've ... sure ... square it's Wellington Delaware mhm yeah and I'm there I was telling the so called clean or there was a lot of little symbols all along this building is like ancient\nRoman building basically with the calls and\nEverything but along the top there is\nA kind of shocked that it's still there there's a swastika and in the dupont's defense\nThis was built for Hitler's rise\nTo remember the ... and this is something that was interesting I saw something on the Internet the other day I think uh uh I'm just trying to figure what somebody was showing the swastika and saying this evil similar not\nThe swastika little shown with Hitler swastika which of course the reason the difference between the ancient swastika and the Hillary swastika is very simple\nSwastika alone than ancient symbol or the Hitler swastika is tilted it's tilted in such a way that it looks like it's marching so if you see a falling out and tilted whether it's bent over this it's a Red Cross tilted that is the swastika there's the symbol of evil the other swastikas there's engine symbols of peace\nAnd well being but when you take a look at the the ... the swastika was provided by the Nazis\nYou look at a swastika ... was killed that just check it out to be the the artist of the swastika submitted to Hitler he was also a doctor I Believe and all he did as he took the swastika dangerous symbol and he just king did a little bit oh humid that look of a of a band crosses a bent it is the symbol of been crosses what it is\nI can assure you this one is not built the only other thing is that I Know some people from Philadelphia and they told me some scary stories about her new possible there was some kind of murder mystery they were involved with where\nOne of the dupont's was killed some people and for a he said is because of the the wealth of the family that they just will get off I don't know if has hang in there with the vampire blood line there was a scary stuff\nThere was actually a ... a movie that\nOut a while ago it was about a John du pont [noise] uh he was a guy a I guess he coached wrestling\nA movie that came
