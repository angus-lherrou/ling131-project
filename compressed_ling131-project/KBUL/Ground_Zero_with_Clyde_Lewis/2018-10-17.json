of get off my lawn and see our TV or he is the writer actor comedian he is the founder co founder of vice media in vice magazine ah and ah\nAlso leader of the Proud Boys a which the media\nIs saying them you know they're they're violent a and racist activists so\nTell me who you really are Gavin tell me what you're really fighting for what is your vision of America\nWell first of all I'm not the leader of the Proud Boys I just started it\nThey they grew organically I just happened to be there and it grew organically ... as someone who wanted to stand up to the violence of antifa who were pepper spraying and culture and Lawrence rather than me and all these other people who just want it to go do it talk and they haven't stopped\nWith this violence and inevitably when you're that violent I mean you get a grip slashing tires you're going to have the tire boys\nAnd point right now so this group would not exist if ... if it wasn't trying to show people down in trying to I'm a big take them out\nI don't think so I think he just they just stay at a bar like the ... they wouldn't be coming out to defend people but more importantly the the way I feel personally is America's greatest country on earth\nBecause it's not about identity politics because it's not about your accent like it is in Britain or or where you come from it's about meritocracy you come here you bust your ass\nYou at least appreciate Judeo Christian values you could be an atheist but you have to understand that that is the backbone of the country and as long as you if you're part of us here in we don't care if you're from you're gone to Singapore you bust your ass you're into American values urine and there's not a lot of places like that in the world it's it's very rare\nTo have that total lack of classes in that admiration for independence and liberty and hard work\nAnd we got there through a horrible list of ups and downs and and rights and wrongs and trying to correct things we had slavery or treatment of the Indians was not a but what's not what you'd expect for someone to whom the sermon on the mount mount with divine commanders as you can and says\nBut we we we got here altogether through all this mess and all this suffering and here we are in the fridge country of the world and we get people complaining saying America was never great\nAnd and that's what pissed me off and it's ironic that we ... we get caught a white supremacist because the reason we love America is it doesn't bother with all of that crap\nAgain we have is that for a long time I think the media basically just sand antifa was that maybe didn't exist they ignored them completely and as the violence has escalated their new tactic seems to be well yes there's violence buddy it's the Proud Boys fault or it's it's the right wing ... have\nYou noticed or they're just exercising I my favorite is they're just exercising their First Amendment right of assembly and petition of course of course I'm curious if you have if you turned to the difference recently I'm\nIn the approach from the media as is trying to make your group\nThe real a village real villain in this because I mean I I they were you know there was a ... a tweet string going on about the alleged violence by Proud Boys members and it was retweeted by people like ... like the big time reporters were going after this you'd be calm I think a central target in this is that you feel that\nDefinitely I think that the DNC put their uh hate is not hate has no home here that's the only thing they have to say to America and it's an idiotic thing to say that's like saying we we are sick of albino violence\nLike most is really weird concept these evil Nazis and they said we're going to read\nWe we are sick of albino violets my clothes it's\nReally weird concept the evil Nazis and they said we're going to rid America of the clan and Nazis now there are not so they go ... uh we got to expand the next year so now anyone who disagrees with them as part of this evil hate that have to stop and I unfortunately have fallen into that that\nDefinition and it is [laughter] it's amazing that anti Islam\nAnd the media and the DNC are all in cahoots like Cuomo was saying hey this is like a a match and put it on dry dry grass and then the wind just takes it I think the matches antifa the wind is the media and it can't be are starting fires\n[noise] I don't I I I have to tell you I have a hard time disagreeing with that I'm seeing the way the or the left has just consumed the DNC I mean there there's you know when you when you're into a an organization where you're starting to say you know shout your abortion and\nUm and and that kind of really despicable kind of a a behavior you're bound and determined to start going way off the rails and they're they are they're they're the extremist party now\nIt's it's all getting so great I mean they used to and at the same as in Britain by the way the way that that the anti uses ... paramilitary kept paramilitary wing here\nOr the media uses the jihad is over there and and the attitude in both cases the enemy of my enemy is my friend\nAnd then he first language and the DNC language getting more and more similar just like that noted that we are not simple that's what he said when we go low but when they go low we kick them or Maxine Waters saying no no freedom no they'll peace or whatever go to their own attack then\nWe've got people on CNN saying that Sarah Huckabee Sanders should be harassed for the rest of her life that's a life sentence they took the same thing about Susan Collins they're setting rice and\nTwo Republicans they got Rand Paul's white sleeping with the gun we've got senator is getting that text to be having a trick cabinet comes in I mean can you tell the difference in all those stories between people and the DNC they sound pretty similar to me\nThose are the people you need we need to unite with\nWith the easy ones to get by the ones on our own side gathering the Guinness and I\nMay disagree on a lot of things we disagree I Believe that it would be much more helpful to take the Martin Luther King's pledge and go and walk through ...\nSinging hymns and let them club you in the head go ahead and let them club you in the head I Know that's not fun I don't want that\nBut that video of not breaking ranks and knocked punching back that video will speak to eighty percent of Americans\nThat video will cross all barriers and people will say okay look at these ... they're not even defending themselves look at what they're doing to them you put evil versus good side by side and people in America at least still at this point we'll choose good\nBut it has to be really good it has to be a shining example of good it has to be over the top good\nThat's why this is where we disagree I understand you know gather in in in ah the Proud Boys what they're doing I don't think they're wrong for wanting to do it\nAnd I don't think they're wrong for thinking that it's the right thing because how is it right now how is it wrong to stand up to bullies\nHow's that wrong how is that wrong if the police won't stand up if the media won't stand up well who's going to so I completely understand that and I can't blame you can't like I get it\nI just think it's not effective\nBecause what happens is the media event just takes the piece of the video that they have where somebody's swinging back and then they say it's their fault\nSo it's just not as effective do I want to get club in the head no no\n\nBut if given and I can't come together even though we have big disagreements our disagreements are not on the things that actually matter\nWe're not talking tactics the things that actually matter or the principles bill of rights constitution declaration of independence Judeo Christian ethic\nFundamentally the left as you talked about this before shouting their abortion they're proud of their abortion and they're heroes the Proud Boys are proud of the west right ... and they're the villains or you know I think you and Gavin ... would agree completely on\nOr the fact that ah you know what you are in the western way of life is is something to cherish it's a miracle it is and there's nothing wrong with with defending that at all or you know tactics are attacks tactics aside we have to if we don't defend it it's going to go away\nYou know we're all at the ... you know we're only one generation away from losing this as we all know and maybe it's a generation it seems like it could be a week or two away at this ... this rate\nSo we have to sit there and defended it it's just you know what's the best way of doing it and I think that there's a there's a discussion there um because I think you know I think as you I'm Devin would acknowledge me kind of talked about it in the interview they're going to be they're gonna be under the microscope now you got to be on the absolute best behavior as when the Tea Party was going on right when we went out and do these rallies\nIf there were you said don't bring signs\nBecause we know if there's one sign that's out of place if one person makes one sign that has any hands of something that it will be the entire story don't even bring signs make sure you clean up when we when we walk away we want to we want this uh this area to be cleaner than when we got here and time after time after time\nThat happened and they weren't able to show to say it would any evidence that they were violence\nSo here's the thing I think we were way ahead but Roger ales told me once he said you're so far ahead of the parade\nYou're about four blocks ahead they can't even see who you're walking by herself high or blocks ahead of the parade you're just it was his point on a stroll that was his point and he said you're so far ahead and I said well I I don't know I'm just doing what I feel is right and he said slow down your way too far ahead\nThat was the best advice he ever gave me I never listened to it ah it was good advice and I think you know when we were talking people used to say all the time why are you talking about Martin Luther king why are you talking about Martin Luther king when we went to Birmingham I said I Want everybody here I Want you to sign that that Martin Luther king thing\nWell there was nobody shouting us down there was nobody doing that and I said on stage\nThere will be there will be there's going to come a time soon where you're going to have to decide there will be these times in our future and you have to decide now\nWe're just ahead imagine doing or imagined doing a rally now we were afraid of the restoring honor rally because if you remember ride the black Panthers were going to come\nAnd they were going to engage us well the black Panthers joined with ah with Al Sharpton and they tried they just marched through they didn't cause trouble they just marched through and we let them go\nAnd there's video of people saying good things as they're saying bad things to us we're saying good things to them now at the time it wasn't like ... in Portland\nAnd asked if I wasn't there if you\nDo a rally and is peaceful and and to fall comes to attack and and we're the ones and we don't oh my gosh what am I saying good God and we don't turn away we don't raise\nA fist that's a\nDifferent story now and one that people want to hear\nBecause people aren't believing the media anymore and they're seeing these words come out of there are Democrats I'm telling you all over the country that say look I maybe I Believe in abortion but I don't believe in that\nI don't believe in partial birth abortion I don't believe in hey abortion should be you know you should be proud of it go shouted it's great\nThat I don't believe in partial birth abortion I don't believe in hey abortion should be you know you should be proud of it go shouted it's great there's nothing wrong with it no\nNormal people look at that on the Democratic side I mean the voter that lives next to you they look and say look I don't want to be involved in those decisions but you know I I'm I don't agree with that\nI don't agree with that ad of compassion medical because I don't know people situation yes but if that's your version of the pill and your proud of it that's a problem\nThat's who America is and they're looking they're looking for a movement they're looking\nFor someone they can stand with who just will call balls and strikes who are not going to say yeah\nThat's right when Donald Trump tweet something\nStupid to say if it's stupid\nI don't agree with that but what he does something right yeah I did that look at that ha ho balls and strikes that's where America is the first thing we have to do is come together behind those\nPrinciples I don't care if you are on the Democratic side of the Republican side or the independence I don't care I don't care who you voted for in the past I don't care what you believed in

[noise] [laughter] [noise] [laughter] gland [laughter] [noise]\nSo I Want to get into the ... case uh this is the case of the Washington Post journalist he was the Saudis citizen he is not you know despite what the journalists will tell you they they leave out the part that he is actually a Muslim Brotherhood and uh his problem with Saudi Arabia is that they wouldn't\nYou know a protector sanction the Muslim Brotherhood well you know Saudi Arabia knows who the Muslim Brotherhood is um and uh so we had a falling out with the kingdom and then he had to go get a a you know divorce certificate\nHe divorced his life in Saudi Arabia had to go into the Saudi embassy in is in both turkey\nAnd he disappeared his fiance was waiting for him outside it appears as though the Saudis came landed a jet on the tarmac\nCame with a bunch of empty suitcases and a bone saw chopped him up and put him in the suitcases took him out of the embassy put 'em on a plane and he's\nProbably scattered over some desert in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia said that's out land dish that's crazy yadda yadda the Turks went in ah apparently there was a massive cleaning crew that went in right before the Turks could go in and investigate\nAh the some more things were leaked by the FBI or sorry about the CIA et cetera and are now our secretary of state is over with the king of Saudi Arabia and it looks as though they are going to admit\nThat yes they did kill him a but it was an interrogation that just went horribly wrong and we're going to punish all the people that were involved\nIn this so now they're twenty four episode oh it's it's crazy now that this is I mean this is honestly rear window Alfred Hitchcock this exactly Alfred Hitchcock with somebody said it's sitting outside going\nWait I I I think they chop her up in that case it's a woman I think they chopped her up and then took her away in the middle of the night\nAnd there was like no that's crazy mhm well it turns out it was and uh and it's the same thing here somebody sitting outside going I think they've chopped them up and took a mountain suitcases that it is\nThe Hitchcock rear window and this is obviously gone very arrive for the Saudis because you don't do things like this and expect to admit to and interrogation gone wrong two weeks later\nLike this is something you do and you deny me Russia does this all the time they're constantly killing journalism and like I don't even know who I don't even know where that was what is ... I've never even heard of the thing and you know like that that their pattern and they never admitted\nIf Saudi Arabia actually comes out of the ... yeah we kinda killed that journalists\nThat's a big moment\nOr in you know geopolitics that's not a it's not a tiny thing\nToday or how today or tomorrow the way the president answers Saudi Arabia when when they admit to doing this this is an ally\nA bigger backers this is probably our best\nFriend next to Israel in the middle east they stand against a lot of the stuff that we stand against there\nAre a big supporter now of Israel um we're in a proxy war in Yemen with that most people don't even know that but we're fighting a war in Yemen at their request and they're fighting with us\nUm they keep the ran at bay we're about to sell them a whole lot load of arms\nThey also dump money into our tech industry ... right now because of this um they also dump a lot of money into our banking system a hillside\nThat cool orb that we should say that's a pretty sweet shore okay the or British do we know that and how they don't ask the or why hasn't anyone interviewed the or about this incident notice how the orbit is\nA show Josh should only stuffed inside of it [laughter] stuff inside of me how they ... they hide so\nUm what is the president do what do we do this way you don't get involved in these things because it's none of our business I mean I don't want it to be any of our business I don't want to have our whole economy and everything else hinge on what they just did we don't like that we don't want to endorse it we don't want to be anywhere near it\nCertainly feels different but the ... helped me quantify the difference here for a minute\nThese regimes are killing people all the time\nYes we know bad things are happening all the time and you know Saudi Arabia is not an innocent of these things yes is it just because it's a journalist is it just because it was on foreign territory in an embassy\nIs it just because you know like the Washington Post really cares what happened to this guy so therefore it's become a big issue because if they can go after a cushion her and and and Trump because of the relationship what ... what do you think I say yes on all of that I'd say yes to all of that um I don't think if this guy was a preacher\nThese people are and sending that signal a and I think uh you probably wind up\nAs a president with everything that you have to a deal with I mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know then I remember\nThere was a world this isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem here\nIs that uh they believe that he was um\nYou know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against to Saudi Arabia and possibly even helping the Muslim Brotherhood here in the United states so he's not just a journalist is that let's let's\nLet's clear that up the citizen is Saudi Arabia ... really ... and it's not that they were killing him because he was a journalist but because of his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood\nFor I think I mean it's a you know it's literally impossible\nTo be able to judge all the moving parts behind the scenes that we don't know about ... you know this is why you this is why you hire a president that you trust and and you know this is why you vote right because it's the situation so that we noticed with Bush I mean you you met with him during the war\nAnd he informed view of nothing a top secret or anything but a lot of the different uh things that you had to consider when making these decisions\nAnd you know it's easy to say well we should just never talked to Saudi Arabia gonna throw him out there is a lot of things behind the scenes that they're doing for example helping in the fight against terrorism may have been a while obviously we as we all know nine eleven or many of the people came from Saudi Arabia and there's been all sorts of questions on that\nAnd we talked about distancing ourselves for a long time and this is probably a great opportunity to do that a little bit\nBut you know there's there have been they've also arrested and killed a lot of terrorists or that have assisted us over the years as well um on on those efforts so\nI it's a tough one I think you have to you have to send that signal you have to make sure I think probably sanctions or something if this is actually a proven\nUm you have to you have to do something publicly but you look at I mean Russia's done terrible things like that and we have an uh we haven't uh acted 'em any more or not selling arms to Russia no\nNo it's not selling arms to Russia and you know the idea that OK well arms sales help jobs is not a great argument [laughter] this is the one thing that we have to we can't really consider the economy first when you're talking about arms sales\nYeah um but I yeah I think taking that step of of probably sanctioned and maybe that's what it is maybe it's arms um is\nGoing to be an important really really important decision for us for the president Glenda [noise] um first I go back in history and I look at uh the Archduke Ferdinand moment\n'cause this is the exact kind of moment that the world thinks is no big deal that could spiral out of control so quickly mhm um I send my secretary of state over which is exactly what Trump did yesterday\nUm like gather all of the evidence and then I Am as strong as I possibly can uh understanding and weighing everything ah that is currently going on trying not to\nThis is Sara Lee empower them or as well and try to get myself out of it in a long term strategy of getting away from the bad guys and and I think you know we're both\nGoing back and forth a little bit because we just don't know what's going on behind the scenes but not enough information and make this decision logical but will say is that while I Am not a fan at all of this slogan\nAmerican America First and I think it has a terrible history I'm In this situation\nThat is your priority here is to make sure that whatever happens is whatever is in America's Best interest you can't start a war you can start um uh you can't go crazy and to just to make a statement if the long term effect of this is a negative\nFor the United states we've seen this with uh North Korea right like I mean North Korea you can make a serious argument that ... I don't think\nTrump wants to go out there in the eye and talking about how he loves Kim Jong lunar publicly\nI think he thinks that the best way to avoid negative consequences and if we're if I got to stay a bunch\nOf words you know what this better good we were saying the last night on the news and why it matters again this South Korea at the time to take care of that was under the Bush administration we didn't\nOr Clinton your Clinton now we didn't do it and now you're in a situation where you have no good options well welcome to the world that we ourselves created or allowed it to
