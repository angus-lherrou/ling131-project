that the guy who Nasser ... in front of women and expose itself and women should never work again\nI I ... I mean that's amazing meet your rationale of\nOkay but you let this guy on who did much less than they are and you shouldn't you shouldn't have let this comedian perform on your stage fright and the fact that nobody cares about these other people the same people right by the way\nWho want him to shut out Louis CK didn't care about Clinton didn't care about any of these\nCircumstances but he's supposed to [noise] yeah and it you know I I Will say he he was really smart about this I mean he he was some great points in this interview and and the New York times reporter was just constantly trying to say well yeah but you did this thing and you allowed and try out it personally on him as to why he made the decision\nIt points in this interview and and the New York times reporter was just constantly trying to say well yeah but you did this thing and you allowed and try out it personally on him as to why he made the decision which is an interesting part of the story but I mean he made the point is well\nOf look what is the line\nWe don't allow him Louis ... to work so what does that mean does he go on the governmental does or can you work at other jobs any work ... what if Louis CK got hired by Walmart would that be okay\nAnd I I think it's it's a fascinating I ever support himself\nIn life again and the idea that this guy has not been punished for that there's much sanity yeah the Manhattan was making ten million dollars a year and he's probably now making I'm only the making of the comedy cellar appearance fifty dollars maybe five hundred dollars I don't know nothing may I wouldn't be surprised if he just walks in and does it because he wants to do it\nOr he has you know paid for this and in a large way\nUm and you know it it certainly affected his career in a big waste last movies he's lost jobs\nBut I mean we saw this with Charlottesville\nThere was a guy who can again we're talking about a consensual act the ya ya a consensual time he'd actually did it yeah it was it was in charge of will and will there was one case in which as we discussed the woman to them no\nAnother case on the phone where we don't know what happened another case where he started doing it and the woman left because she didn't what are you part of it will be good for him that's what she should she should walk out or I think he's a loser and tell every all of her friends that he's a loser for a company that does not mean that he should be losing jobs ten or Fifteen Years later\nCharlottesville is another great example of this\nBook we use other people we play the video and the and the audio of a you know Jews will not replace us and and all these crazy chance from the real dirt bags or in in Charlottesville carrying torches and you know that the deepest darkest corners of the all right and one of the guys\nWho attended the rally and was in some of those videos\nOr was identified as a man who worked at a hot dog stand in California\nHe was fired from his job at the hot dog stand\nNow how is this a good outcome for anyone that look if he is saying to black customers I won't serve you because you're black obviously we get that\nInto indication that I'm In the kitchen if that ever happened he did his job at the seemingly right for every one he was serving hotdogs and making hotdogs and it was not like you know he was not in a high levels of finance here [laughter] and so now\nWe we we can all feel good about ourselves the dynamic of a hotdog vendor though is that a still intimidated or other people that's true so so I guess that we can all feel good about ourselves but the fact that we are instead of him having a job a hot dog stand instead we will support him with our tax dollars\nBecause he's going to be at home and all these projects and programs that liberals have created over the years to support people in need are going to go to this white supremacist who can no longer hold down his job at a hot dog stand screenings for two morally above him\nBut I ... I don't want to ever hang out with a guy who would go to that rally and carry a torch and say Jews will not replace us never but I mean do you do what we do is we just find every one of these guy you wanted you to replace you [laughter]\nQuestion do you ever consider you want to I Would rather not\nBy anyone [laughter]\nI never have considered that include uh gee I guess I guess I don't like figure it out to me or anyone else but yeah it does include that but I really don't want anyone um it's just a it's a weird thing we're dealing with because you know finding someone\nOr in a video and I tend to find them on line gives you the sort of rush of I've out at this terrible person and I can punish him who really\nOh and I tend to find them on line gives you the sort of rush of\nI've out at this terrible person and I can ... who really punishing\nI mean I ... for certainly you're punishing the tax payers this area who now have to support the loser who actually somehow was able to hold down a job selling hot dogs and now has to fit inside probably playing X. box while you're paying him to do it and you know water when let's do celebrate that one\nI I I don't know it's a strange direction for us to be going\nAnd there's an AK ... yes yes it's nuts it's absolutely crazy\nOr so maybe the answer is um they just can't be alive anymore I mean is it almost comes down to that because if they can't support themselves\nAnd certainly the state you don't want them supported by your tax dollars right so I guess all people who are accused just starve to death now now I I guess that's when it comes ...\nThat's the way it works and I I Would be nice for us to find some consistency in this world would you know the fact that like you know if you were to say the me too movement I bet you most people are you sure you get hurt you get Harvey Weinstein mentioned mhm\nUm and you might get more maybe Kevin Spacey or one of the other two you know few big stars but what you would almost definitely get is Donald Trump and Roy Moore and Brett Kavanaugh and every conservative or anyone even\nSupposedly leaning right that you can think of that was accused those have all had huge play in the media\nThe I mean what's the percentage Ninety five percent have been on the left ... it's all Hollywood and news media people and I mean it's been almost everyone has been in those industries and those industries obviously lead incredibly to the left\nThe idea that this is a right wing phenomenon I mean it just seems like the people who are on the right pay the price for it where people on the left you know you don't necessarily see that the same way and you know I think you have to get to a point\nWhere someone like Lucy K\nWho was I think are accused could correctly of being a dirt bag right to his ... to his own admission but not not any nothing that was over this line of sexual assaults at least it's not as reported you know you have to look at these\nThings as they said I mean these are is now doing shows again um and he was a he was accused of something um you know what's his face from the New York times he's back\nOr the Glen or what the heck is his name you know we get it wrong fresh right he used a of a of harassing young interns and other underlings and he he's back at work we have this weird saying why I mean Mike Tyson\nIs pretty ... the man was convicted of rape not and I'm not sure I'm convicted of rape spent time in prison yeah and he's like the darling of the media he comes out of his silly appearances everywhere have a problem going anywhere now doing anything and he's I mean and look he served time and he's out right now\nUm and so you could make the case as the less has made forever that people who go in felons should be able to come back and vote you should be we they have programs to give felons in convicted felons and murderers jobs\nYet but when someone's accused of something much less than murder they can never work

happened that time when he gets like nine hundred yeah you know nine fifty\nDon't speak English charge is it time to stop that the ... the waiters expecting tips [laughter] is it time to time the restaurants pay the waiters a decent wage and then I don't have to worry about paying that tip unless they do an outstanding job [laughter] 'cause now they expect to expect me to pay them of their salary\nEither that or I or I had a very high level job as a a\nChili's waiter ... a couple of years ... uh and uh the minimum wage at the time I Believe was four twenty seven an hour and you got for like two and I got to twelve I haven't getting thank you well over an hour it was with my with my two out really well of course that wow reason is because you're getting tips and you're going well over the minimum wage right\nAnd ... and you get of course I mean yeah you know it was it was not hard to get two dollars an hour and chips\nOr even for me and I was a crappy waiter or buy a twelve hour the check would come in after two weeks it would be like sixty dollars [laughter]\nI wouldn't even cash is worth it yeah it was almost a dumb like your mom probably spend sixty bucks an hour\nTo get to the to the the ... yeah yeah that's ridiculous it is it's got a bad\nYou know there's also a for you to when I was thinking of you well as I was reading this new study on the burger chains uh having failing grades with their antibiotic use in their ...\nOh I Know I Know not only five burger chains reveal a very different pattern now there's a new study the chain reaction burger edition and if you thought it was going to be slanted [laughter] no that's produced by Consumer Reports along with the center for food safety friends of the ...\nTurns trust ... saw guile us public interest research group\n... those are some of my favorite age and thank you for the earth and the ... the the resource defense counsel those are two I mean you want to talk about all full environmental organizations [laughter]\nThose are the top of the list but I use of antibiotics in the beef industry is a terrible scare people ... right so there's ... there's only two restaurants that uh you know fast food chains that got the essays are in their belief that they don't use any beef with antibiotics burger phi which I've never been to\nNever heard of that and ... oh really ... right I Know I I Am at all that yeah I Want to guide ... let's go to Chicago right now we're on the list [laughter] leave right now you know it's just I just kind of put the microphones die [laughter]\nWhat kind of the studio and go to ... now good yeah all the other\nFast food restaurants failed except for Wendy's who got to the minus because they have now committed to sourcing a small percentage of beef they got to intervene millionaires who minimize\nDon't they don't limited by producers will minimize the house of medically important antibiotics so once in a while you're going to get a burger with those ...\nAnd what is what is the antibiotic and the burger doing to us\nIs it is making a living their claim their claim is that it's making us resistant to change the way our\nCore or left wing environmentalist groups are saying there's bad things in their right or watch I that means absolutely nothing to me\nI'm guessing there's worse things than antibiotics and they're like you know cow poop and that kind of mixed in good faith that are on 'cause some of this stuff is not done really well\nYeah did you see this report on la Croix water that came out I think it was this week you know yeah water the sparkling like oh yeah I Would say it's for flavor but if not if you've ever had a drink of it like you would be like what is that oh I can teach a tad bit of a long time it's not an ... months late for like ... like right in my opinion not not a fan\nBut they tried to come out the same thing like oh well there's an ingredient here that's included in this terrible thing and and you go through the course\nOf course at the end of the day there's absolutely nothing to the report because that is what you know medical journalism has come to its especially about food ... they just try to say like well this ingredient is included in some other thing that sounds scary\nUm of course you don't eat nearly enough to come close to any problematic area where you are constantly you know we can't miss some of those only\n... shouldn't say that with Jeff you're never going to point John [laughter] of us need to be concerned [laughter] if you're eating as much as nine horses would eat well okay I Am ... falls into that category so\nBut I mean if we can get so scared about these things and and Ninety nine percent of it is nothing like it you go and you can have all the things that they say you could never catch you can have as long as you don't go crazy with them\nAs long as you're not constantly eating them all the time you're going to be okay and honestly most of the stuff even if you are eating it all the time you're ... you're probably going to be okay I mean we're pretty resilient creatures here I don't even tell this from a guy who's who's in the past\nDrank round up yeah so you know\nCommercial my viewpoint but yet they had\nAround here and there\nTo prove that that as well I didn't know ... and ... on this planet I'm Still alive though they're making headway\nWith the chicken or company with with the big companies that are using chicken 'cause you've got a AAA put era and chick fillet number one they use is without antibiotics that you're going to the\nAl Sharpton pronunciation of my life she landed on so I have to accept the ... anything I don't I ...\nThe sign ... its AAA because they've already said that he was ... Romney went to a ... like to hear it all at age ... lake\nThat was a montage of sharp can't ... I Can't call everything else but that though oh sorry that's right that's the name\nOkay but uh it's good that a subway and Taco Bell they're all trying to play along with their chicken you know they they using chickens with less antibiotics or zero antibiotics so we're good there but my favorite story as we talked a little bit about this a pet show a week or so ago\nThe gluten free uh dishes that are at restaurants now that everybody does so well there's everybody is has to be gluten free now yeah but everybody has renewed everybody was glued\nNobody told me if you're a secretly ac or whatever that is the ... that's one thing ... disease you probably\nShould know glue and look and there's there's very few people have that house beer you\nOut there that gray hairs\nApproximately one percent of the U.S population with that disease oh\nWhy oh why or mainly three percent of people avoid [laughter]\nThere's\nThere's a weird like uh this happens with a lot of these issues where like people are mad at you first accusing them of not having\nI think that's a great thing you don't want\nMy daughter because for a while she was on that ... oh yeah I'm like well\nYou don't have to learn [laughter] in the cabinet out here\nAnd it's like all these people come out and they're using cabin on like how dare you not believe them and they're fighting like wondering are be better if it was true what we've been\nWorry at all like would it be great at the ...

of like a ...\nAnd we talked about among kill us right now the image of the among the list is all over the Internet in this in PC form basically mocking\nLeft wing propaganda saying well it sounds like a script and so therefore we all look like drug in fact you remember back in Nineteen eighty four\nUm which is a sharp contrast to all the grain bleak images you're saying and then there's this picture what appears to be this Macintosh\nComputer on it's on a tank top and she's carrying this this ah brass\nRats that had hammer and it's being chased by security police wearing black uniforms and they have this riot gear on helmets and visors and the whole thing that covering their faces they have these huge night sticks they're chasing after she racist towards a large screen with the Wii image of this big brother like figure giving a speech and the big brother figures saying this this is what he says he says today\nWe celebrate but first glorious anniversary of the information purification directives we have created for the\nFirst time in history a guarded up your ideology where each worker may bloom secure and for the past preventing contradictory throws argue the vacation of thoughts is more powerful a weapon that I've played core army on earth we are one people with one will one resolve\nOne cause our enemies shoved talk themselves to death\nAnd bury them with their own confusion we shall prevail\nWell [noise] the runner runs up to the screen she takes the hammer pearls that around\nAnd right when big brother says we shall prevail ... [laughter] everything explosion shattering glass dust flying everywhere and these millions or just like not flinch in there like\nHer like\nZombies that's what an NBC is that sort of NBC looks like kind of goes bald weird looking\nNondescript human beings and then of course at the end of the added says\nOn January twenty four that will computer will introduce Macintosh and you'll see what Nineteen eighty four won't be like Nineteen eighty four\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nYou know it was really odd if you go back and we got commercial you'll say wow they were saying they were going to eliminate Nineteen eighty four there weren't a lemonade the uh oppression of not being able to express yourself they're going to eliminate or the possibility of a family of knowledge they're going to eliminate all those things with the introduction to the computer and guess what\nGuys the vision has failed\nDivision of Nineteen eighty four remember I was as your you'll see why not do you need to Fort won't be Nineteen eighty four the very thing that apple hope their computer would change was what is it just becomes a very evil but it's brainwashing\nWhat now it's called the end PC heard in the fall of the plant are following the script and one is unfortunate is that the NBC mean\nTargets only the left and how they appear to be the only ones reciting the strip verbatim fed to them by the end PCs on the nightly gab fest on CNN\nOr MSNBC or MSNBC or MSNBC at an ass and\nB. B. C. P. C. MSNBC MSN PC\n[noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise]\nI Love that clip her name but here's the deal that I'm not gonna I'm not going to\nBe a hard ass against liberals for this one I'm going to talk about something else to get the liberals are smart and\n[noise]\nIf they were smart [noise]\nThey should get a [noise] a counter mean [noise]\nTo demonstrate against the people who are these big Q A non technical people [noise] like some sort of shoes that looks like a dumb cue or [noise]\nAlthough he can churn wine into something else many cancer [laughter] I'm just saying you can't do that for some reason in this country so there's NBC name mocks the left basically making them out to be expression list of the parents bought like in behavior\nI mean that's one of a causal observers right they just stand there occasionally say oh this is the door make a left here it's like it's like being one of those talking maps make a left three hundred feet ... that's kind of a an NBC it's kind of giving you directions that doesn't need has a limited script\nAnd it's the same thing over and over again\nAnd so if you go to Facebook or if you go to your Twitter or read it or ... or you may be able to see these things but apparently Twitter responded\nAnd took down about Fifteen hunter accounts that were happy and PC me and uh they said it violates their terms of service with regard to intentionally misleading election related content now several months ago\n[noise] this NBC tournaments basically it was basically a drawn gray cartoon it's is anyone can draw one of these things as kind of like a ... an alien gray it's like a ... a head round two eyes kind of the upside down seven nose in a straight line for a mouse\n\nSo they put them over the faces of people on CNN they put in it and they have a they may have a column Capra Nick one\nUm\nIt's just [laughter] it's a new symbol I think it's a new symbol for the future as long as that continues and you know and and if if it if it shows up\nI I just think that it targets ... it's kind of unfortunate that we have that only for the laughter people say well\nClaude you're giving a lot of uh a lot of uh but let's see well I just think it's interesting and the thing is I think there should be a mean use to demonstrate that brainwash masses that have become members of the Q A non technical because chewing on has all the personality of an algorithmic Bob that turns out what people believe is inside information about President Trump\n\nAnd people that followed you seem to believe that there are hidden references to Q. everywhere\n\nAnd when there are those who question or even acknowledge accuracy bought they're told to trust the plan\nI was going to collide trust the plan is if it were something religious code amongst the NBC's on the right trusts the plan\n\nSo here we are again seeing how easy it is\nBecoming easy to just program the masses through means bits and now they're in the ... thrust is pushing the issue of like a cultural and the sad thing is is that followers of cue believe\nThat\nThey're getting inside information about some great conspiracy when the conspiracy has always been about a plot to destroy the United states\nAnd not an exclusive plot the targets one man like President Trump all the queue and non does\nIs create an atmosphere to dissolve the cognitive dissidents caused by the gap between Trump that's how it's paid for ... hours like to imagine instead of what he really is and what he's really doing\n\nIt all enforces the fantasy disguised as a plan that again creepy and PCs for the right\n\nI mean you don't create a wild fantasy about your leader being a covert genius unless you understand that most people\nDo that to most people that he he looks like something quite different and you don't need an occult story about how your site is secretly winning if it's actually winning and it's not what I'm saying I mean the entire population is being programmed into becoming this radicalized\nWhatever and they're trapped in their own cognitive biased by programmers with no just what buttons to push\n\nAnd we're losing as they can conjure that certain people can agree on and the various collectors within the collective\nI mean what we're seeing here is higher mind within hive mind within hive mind within hive mind until the substances rendered inert\nFor the purpose of major programming and that and then there's a major programming wipe and then we're all back to normal again\n\nIt's like we do one ... we're going to another ... mood failure dialectic where we have a problem\nWe demand answers for a solution and the person who creates the problem is the person that gives us a solution I mean it's truly terrifying when you think about it because it just would further the argument that we're living in a highly controlled matrix where consciousness can be manipulated to further the goals of the programmers\n\nAre unconscious students is very mysterious I mean it seems mysterious it's like this is supernatural paranormal\nMystery writer or well life in general can be explained by physics chemistry and biology\n\nIt seems that what everyone tries to explain like when they're trying to explain the relationship between the brain in the subject of events that are experiences feelings something appears to be left out of the uh the explanation somebody has left\nOut of the equation\n\nThe chooses to be however he does emotion\nBut is driving this guy and so there is this war going on between the brain and the subjective experience\nIt's called the explanatory gap where we have to bridge the brain that consciousness the experience of motion and critical analysis we have to try and do that we have to do that without even thinking about it\n\nBut most people leave out one or the other I mean either they have all emotion and they don't put truth in the mix or they they don't have critical analysis of the easily misled\n\nSo what we have now is we have this problem of of of understanding primary consciousness where we have the ability to have any experience or any feeling it all\nSome people I don't care they're ineffective they're unaffected they are disenfranchised they're angry they don't they just don't want to participate\nI mean the experiences of feelings we get now are both natural and organic and of course we're now experiencing the virtual reality or the hyper reality from electronic illusion for everything that we see now is part of some electronic stimulus\nMost of our knowledge comes from a TV must run out comes from a cell phone [noise] most of our knowledge because with a cello streams that de ... George Orwell talked about\n\nAnd with that comes to the mixing of language the changing of meaning of words the double think the double speak the news speak the propaganda\nAll those things that lead to the program that we have now and people don't even realize they're being program they just say well I mean part of the game right\nSo we struggle with primary consciousness that we used to be that we would just take for granted that we have primary conscious now there are people out there that are becoming apathetic there are people out there becoming for team there are people out there just don't care at all anymore and you know it's really scary is is that if people are being bred not to care if they're creating is a nurse you up there and they're creating is um\nAnd they entropy they're creating all this what this does is this creates monsters\nBecause if you wanted to find a monster you can save the starling be like you know in the bushes orange starling be sweating the ratings of pounds to predator yeah that's that's one definition of a monster but there is a definition of the monster that I think fits\nAnd it's something I think we need to take into account and that is the definition of a monster is\nA person who just doesn't care anymore\nAnd that's what we're struggling with right or struggling with the idea of ... if we even care\n\nAnd I think it's unfortunate that we're seeing more people respond to the electronic illusion\nAnd they are becoming a non player characters or NBC's as a matter of habit and in some cases people do this because they wanted to survive they don't want to get involved\nAnd so this is where we are now we're in a position where we don't know whether to go left or right\nSo some people don't go anywhere at all and see I've always said this I say I I always say if you want to really get Americans to do nothing all you have to do is offer skate all you have to do with confuse them and they don't and they won't make a decision and say well if I'm confused I don't want to do this because I'm damned if I Do\nAnd damned if I don't\nThink that's why you see less people vote I think when I was saying get out and vote get out and vote red white and blue or whatever way they're talking about they're again they're encouraging people to go out and do something even when they're confused\n\nAnd it's hard to sell people when they're confused [noise] and so if you're ...\nIn ... in without looking stupid [noise] you decide to read the script you decided to follow the script it's put before you and your programming and education and media and everything else you've\nTaken consume [noise] dribble eight six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise] extremely expensive three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis used to be ground zero\nAnd we'll be back you're listening to ground zero on news talk Ninety five point five [noise]\nThis online banks for closing on us they even have documents that I signed for home equity loan only I didn't what a nightmare", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "19"}
