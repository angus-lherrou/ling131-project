I did that last week\nYeah [laughter] I thought it would you love to see these guy because nobody is talking about fines Feinstein really nobody in the media is despicable I mean the I\nDon't want to just take one side 'cause\nI'm not God so I don't know what happened I happen to believe Kavanaugh of on Ford and most of that is because Ford has changed her testimony several times a year just ... there's nothing support it but I maybe she's telling the truth I don't know I'm not God\nSo if I have to put them in a room and choose one or the other I'm going to choose him because I don't think she has enough evidence for me to quit\nAnd even if I kind of believed her yeah I still would ... there was a ... there that it's not on him you know he's not a direct proven negative correct so I Hope he didn't do it um and I don't think she has proven that he did by any stretch it out I don't mean\nBeyond a shadow of a doubt I mean just a preponderance of evidence there is an inclination I mean I honestly I just want I Do not believe he did it I frankly don't need to not believe I don't either I'm now that's not to say I'm as you point out we're not God even though they're pretty cool\nUm so it's possible okay but I don't I don't believe that he did it right so we've plowed this field\nOver and over and over again how come nobody is plowing the field on how much they've destroyed her life Senator Feinstein has destroyed her life they lied to\nHer several times lied to her she requested anonymity they released a letter anyway causing a chain of events that would obviously reveal who she was\nUm lied to obviously they lied to her about the Democrats are the Republicans not willing to come out and take her testimony in California yeah she was surprised by that I mean look to be Frank I mean she's told many lives in this process as well\nUm and you know I I don't how all those realize what low things like you know she never fly that's why she can't make it to the hearing and then oh well yes I Do fly often yeah I'm not really that was her ally or of that was ally coming\nSeveral people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like having a or said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime yeah but ... and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape well there was a videotape\nNow we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not\nSeen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the Kavanaugh thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with the bail us with\nThe ... and we don't have that evidence yeah we we have a a ton of evidence and in fact I don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the forties so we I mean like we came out more and I was like we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alice in case there however um\nWhat's interesting about this is that fifty six percent of Democrats believe Christine Blasey Ford's allegations fifty six percent only eight percent say they ... they believe Kavanaugh fifty six to eight is a split there so you assume that if you ask people and it wasn't a partisan\nSituation what do you think about the Alison situation do you what do you believe from her because she's got a more recent allegations she actually brought it to the tension in real time\nTo multiple people people around her have seen evidence of this there's text messages there is a there are medical notes all the evidence that we just talked about there's an infinity amount time as more evidence in the elephant case\nHe had only five percent of Democrats believe Allison's accuser we're told over and over again that women are to be believed it only five percent of Democrats believe the allegations against Keith Ellison and here's\nWhy this is really important I'm just like I don't want an abuser on the Supreme Court\nIf if there was the amount of evidence on Kavanaugh but there is on a Keith Ellison I Would not be for Kavanaugh would you if there was amount on cabin up I Would yeah I Would if if if the evidence was the same thing yeah I was [noise]\n\nWe still have a standard here in this country um called innocent until proven guilty and preponderance of evidence is a slower is a lower level than that\nAnd I understand that um my issue here would be\nYou can once there isn't the legal standard because people will say well this is just a job interview or this is just that this isn't a legal proceeding once you have the absence of a legal standard you have to choose the standard you apply\nI Choose to apply a very high standard because people who are in relationships many many times when he relationships to break up or someone feels jolted say things that are not true I having all that I agree with all the way in this case\nI'm Keith Ellison should have the right to defend himself and he should we\nShould assume his innocence unless I agree point in which he is and if especially with a case like this where it's very recent\nThat should just go through the legal system and when he comes out and he's guilty then he should get thrown out of that job and you can factor that in in your vote if you wish but I don't think he should lose any job because of this at this point he needs to you need to be able to see\nWhether this case goes through and and claims are proven someone has said they have video we need to see the video we see everyone a in investigated we need to see an actual police\nAh investigation go through and and and the weather the evidence leads us to a belief that he actually committed these acts if we do not get that\nYou do not ruin people's lives over it I mean think about the amount\nIt would keep health in overall anymore which everyone I mean even at a lot of people in the right where like look ... really looked like he did these things his answers are really bad\n... you know there's much more evidence for ... much more there's people you can interview right now yeah children who went through traumatic moments where they had to read about their mom being abused or you know sure her telling other friends at the time\nThat being said however you didn't you he went through this process where the presumption of innocence I agree\nSo but what I Know about she fell assumes the evidence against him [noise] okay\nAssuming this was not current day and it was thirty five years ago if Ford would come with that evidence I have letters\nI have a photo of lead bruises on my arm I have um ah I can tell you where it happened I told my friends and here they are they verify that I told them after the party ... would you not\nWould you not go okay I think that's good yeah I mean I think that would be enough and it was the only way we can judge this situation wrecked right correct here it is with Alison and again this is why it's important\nJust like I don't want to have a Supreme Court justice that is an abuser or a liar or whatever\nI also think it's extraordinarily dangerous to have a guy who\nMay have beaten his girlfriend may have mentally abused his girlfriend assuming the evidence is real and checks out you can't have him as the as the the the chief law enforcement of the state\nRight and does anybody care no fish shows you that nobody in the media\nCares at an iota\nFor this woman and her story they don't care if she was abused and they don't care about any of it what they care about is stopping Brett Kavanaugh\nIf they care they would be just as passionate as a guy let's not just throw him out of the Minnesota attorney general this is a guy who was second in charge of the deep what the the DNC ... this is not a a a minority a peripheral figure in politics he's one of the most powerful Democrats in America\nAnd is now going to be a chief law enforcement officer for state\nAnd you could say oh well it's all you're what you're doing is what\nAbout Islam no no it's not it's not what about his him I apply the same standard Alison that I applied to Kavanaugh you weren't doing this to Kevin I Would still be saying this about I'm I'm a about Alice\nAnd look at go back to why it's bracket why was Brock Obama president\nRight brought about was president because he won a presidential election in two thousand eight\nPreviously he made a heck of a speech\nAnd what two thousand four\nAnd a two thousand for an election he won a Senate seat a Senate seat that would have been incredibly close if he was going against Alan Keyes who they flew in the last week to to start a campaign but it was a Jack Jack Ryan but it might be thinking of junk residence gay at this point I'm [laughter] I think too many Amazon commercials\nBut uh Ryan was his last name and he was a legitimate challenger\nTo Brock Obama in that Senate race it was a close election and he may have won it\nAs a Republican in Illinois wow and what they did if they went through his divorce is sealed divorce or um hearings and ... and paperwork or out to the public and in there there were accusations by his wife the actress who said they went to swingers clubs and all this sort of shady stuff\nDo we know if that was true oh an added horse proceeding and the divorce proceeding people make\nThere is clubs and all this sort of shady stuff do we know if that was true in added divorce proceeding and the divorce proceeding people make all sorts of yelling Ames yeah and that's why you don't just believe them\nThat's why they're already old because they went and got them unsealed in a democratic state and they they they ... Brian eventually dropped out there was no real opposition for a bronco bomb and you've got eight years of him\nThat it sort of thing should be always viewed skeptically every claim of a crime should be viewed skeptically by people on that side you're supposed to give the presumption of innocence and close to start with skepticism of a claim on any side on any side on any side of all people who are accused\nAnd here we are in a situation where Democrats overwhelmingly believe the accusations against capital with almost no evidence\nAnd they only five percent of them believe the woman who is a Democrat who does not want someone up a ideologically opposed to ... to Keith Ellison to have that job she's a Democrat\nAnd only five percent of people believe her\nThe the platitudes you hear from the media and the left I mean nothing on the story they do not care about whether Ford was abused or not they don't [noise]\nAnd this shows you how fast that standard is applied and how\nAnd how your life could be destroyed you are on the wrong side of an issue and by the way I think you've seen\nThe issues change\nAnd up positions what's politically correct changes and if you don't abide one hundred percent and you're not on the right side will destroy your life [noise]\nWhile they let somebody else be fine [noise]\nThis is why we must have a standard we must have a standard\nIs getting dangerous to be an American [noise]\nThat's the frightening thing to say [noise]\nI've been telling about gold mines do silver maple flex bar that uh the maple flex\nBar here still can you open this up and and uh and break some people's pieces off what it is it's it's a it's a\nIt's a bar of silver um and it's it's made by the Canadian meant and what you do is you take it and you break it apart and it's in one tenth of an ounce one quarter of an ounce I couldn't get that one open either leaves open\nNeed window coverings then make a call to the blind guy wouldn't personal onsite consultations we help guide you through the many options available by showing you the designs and colors and then we'll look in your home\nLine guy makes the experience of shopping for window covering sneezing we're locally owned and had been a part of the buildings community for over Twenty years schedule your free consultation my calling six five five sixteen eleven or go to blind guy dot com hey who is your blind guy\nFrom the biopsy environment studios Seavey well am nine Seventy building Casey ha toward it\nNow live and local in the mornings with Montana talks on news talk Ninety five point five [noise]\nStill blasting away ...

much for someone to put all this stuff together and mail it out I mean the thing is\nWhen these things are used and are American citizens or target especially when it comes to leaders um ... it's basically a having me question a lot of things right now it is I had a I spoke recently at ground zero lounge and I'm\nAt the ground zero lounge we have a discussion\nAbout the ... the supposed to be happening tomorrow with the bones or this is the world but the U.S nationwide chest\nAnd they're going to send a message about an emergency ah this is a a a fake emergency rather to drill a test to see if your Bones Are going to be working and a sea of uh you're you're going to be able to pick up on an emergency broadcast\nNow when I was at the ground zero lounge\nWe were talking about the cabinet for to fear\nAnd we weren't talking about he said she said who's right who's wrong cast yeah ... exactly are we um my uh British just always ... from ... um\nWe were at the ground zero lounge in and we were talking or are we talking about ... about the cabinet Ford situation\nI told him I said you know\nI said and I said on a few occasions that it was going to be some sort of an attack in the attack would happen and if you remember we did a show about\nThe ... ... in Oregon\nAnd for those that have seen the TV show while while country you'll know that the reason we're actually ... the Russian each cult actually tried to poison\n[noise] uh ... county authorities because they wanted to be able to win the election they had their people running for office and they figured if they can make people sick\nThey wouldn't come out and vote okay they wouldn't be able to vote\nAnd so they when they put salmonella and the salad bars around the area so those who get sick wouldn't be able to go out and vote\nAnd it would reduce it reduced the voter turnout consider this happening right now is this a rice and attack\nNot only happening the day before we're supposed to do this nationwide test but it's happening during a major investigation into a chief justice being um\nConfirmed and\nIn a nation in a time of the nation when we're very divided okay\nAnd what I what do what I'm thinking about tonight and and if you can hear the ... and you know I'm really kind of nervous about the show tonight mainly because of the fact of how close we've come and how and how it's all happened here and what's going on is is real okay and uh\nAnd I'm trying to assess just how everything comes together it's ... it's like a puzzle\nAnd all the pieces are coming together in a in some way but once again I asked the question you know is there any investigation right now I'm not seeing I should put on network news on my monitors right now we're having some sort of debate with our governor ... ah there are governors speaking or or or something's happened I Know what's going on\nBut has nothing to do with the matter at hand today and I really don't think the mainstream news cares or are they even investigate or even trying to investigate who may have been responsible for sending this rice and powder\nTo the president\nAnd whether or not this is an assassination attempt on whether or not it could have been some sort of a\nA a mini\nTrial for a decapitation exercise or if it's something that is keeping us aware of what's about to happen to the phones tomorrow and whether or not\nKavanaugh\nWill be affirmed while you realize that if the FBI Files that reports are more and more than likely they will because they don't need till friday okay\nThey don't need Joe Friday to make their assessment they probably won't take until friday everybody's waiting for friday they oh wait till friday no\nThey'll probably give the report tomorrow and this is the thing is that that I'm I'm the arising here they're going to give the report tomorrow\nAnd when they do they're not going to let the American people know the results because they\nDon't have to [noise] they don't have to tell the American people the results of that funding [noise]\nAll we'll hear about is the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh [noise]\nAnd I have a feeling he's going to be and I talked to a lot of people he's going to be confirmed [noise]\nBecause if he were joy of inhaled rice and I mean sure he could be treated he could have a you know flu symptoms or whatever but you know if it didn't get treated his lungs could fill up but it could have killed at the\nSame same with the Ted Cruz you know same were mad at the same with all the other people that were targeted today\nAnd I said and

were infected November three months of infection and\nThere were gaps in preparedness for this biological attack but the difference between this attack in in in nine eleven an inch or two thousand one and the attack that happened today\nWe knew\nThat something was happening we knew that something was going to go down and why did we know ... acts OK clay next was talking about this very thing the possibility of something getting released\n[noise]\nWe have the gain a function exercises that took place where the aircraft and boy I have some news about this it's really good for you [noise] and we've had many bio drills and now we have the emergency\nPhone report tomorrow we have the test tomorrow\nTomorrow we can see the wrapping up of the FBI report on the cabinet or for case and they don't have to give us the information they can just say well we did our investigation it satisfies everybody put it to a vote and when he's confirmed every second\nAnd they don't have to give us the information they can just say well we did our investigation it satisfies everybody put to a vote and we've confirmed everybody said well what what had happened Didier didn't meet you won't know\nHe won't know\nAnd I'm sure there'll be you know people screaming injustice here and injustice there'll be a fight going on and all kinds of crazy so go on this is a pattern\n\nAnd warned you okay I warned you I saw it I I can see it and I and I'm very nervous tonight the little bit because I said some things on the ground zero lounge\nWith the the video it's up yet and I and I don't know uh when it's going to go up of the recording of of the presentation but uh you can hear the audience I were talking about this and they and somebody had piped up in the audience says I'll bet they'll have a wrapped up by Wednesday and then I was reading something that the FBI is Betty ... ready to uh\n... basically summarizing put together a report released it Wednesday and we won't know\nWe all knew anything about it and they delayed talking about until friday but apparently from what I gather tomorrow's the day\nAnd we won't know because they they don't have to tell us anything\nTripoli six Seventy three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six seven three three says go to Tony in Indiana Hi Tony on ground zero\nStay quiet I tell you what that fits right into the pattern\nThey are a year's ... you know there is a bio a girl all of a sudden it's alive\nThey uh have been some you know they've been talking about since the ... report about a biological attack and your hair and out of Europe how the Europeans are worried about Europe because sources banker friends are saying that they're playing for the collapse\nSo this is something that's been coming for a while it just you know it may be the curing time for the rice and was at a rally on the Eighteenth so they've pushed it off as a third\nOh it was ready I mean a ... let me let me just a you know and and I'm gonna have to repeat myself in the next door I'm kind of holding things up but I won't hold things up for much so I'm a U.S anything about what rice and does to people when they inhale it [noise]\nYeah it's it causes a a massive influx of food into the lungs and you're just drowned\nWell yeah you can drown in your lungs but it just depends on the frequency and what's in it and\nAnd you know it's worse if you swallow it it's worse if you injected because it can get you on a a a DNA level in the blood if you put it in the blood\nBut here's the deal by hey here's the deal I was reading that if rice and is it gets into a human being and all of a sudden they started coughing and they started sneezing\nAnd the part of everyone that goes airborne okay yes and then people around you if you're around it may also getting some of it in them and what they they are showing these aren't showing signs of food they start showing signs of sneezing coughing nacho watery eyes a fever feeling\nAnd it happens it happens within seconds there is no incubation period it happens within seconds or maybe even\nA just a little bit of time but anybody who's exposed to it you have a lot of people around you you start seeing all of them getting sick too so we went to the last time it off when was the last time we heard about this happening you remember\nRight after nine eleven is no ... more recent than that ah that as I'm sure you know remember the Emirates plane landed a JFK\nOh absolutely yeah they have three of them there were three planes they held I think they only reporter onto though\nThere was a plane that landed in Emirates and they said that people have gone on board the plane and the lower level and there were two or three people that were acting like they're sick and then the whole lower level of the people they all came down with the same thing\nUnder the public and just let them go\nSo you know that would explain why they didn't even care they release people in the public as you're okay you didn't get exposed all that bad\nThe rest of you were gonna hospitalized no reports of deaths but still for the function exercise if we released rice it in a plane or we put somebody on was exposed to rice and how would the plane react coming into JFK\nYet ride your time New York times that right you know what time at Emirates plane landed at JFK\nProbably three thirty three no nine eleven that's\nNot a shock I tell you what the the that the way they use numbers and the way they planned it just it's just amazing how when you start analyzing it how it is so true to form\nDo you know what time they're going to do that test on your phone tomorrow wired to Eighteen to Eighteen eastern time you know what I mean one is lying and what is nine and two eleven died\nIn there yeah they use that ... yeah they do they do I went on there so quiet at all or incidents [laughter]\nYeah it's all going to All right well everybody got to ask you about that you're telling the truth I I Try thank you for calling take their hair All right Bye bye let's go to a really quickly in Texas I Will you're on ground zero\nOh gosh she just last night they listen to your program and I'm not sure where ongoing other than I Believe that what you're saying tonight this is a major distraction to what is happening politically in our country is that right\nNo it's done a major distraction and said attempt it was an attempt to try and block votes and confirmation of cabinet and I think er or to the lady investigation\nBecause what you have the FBI chasing after who tried to kill the president who tried to kill people the Pentagon and the thing to do is just the same modus operandi or the or rush beach pure and did in Oregon in Nineteen eighty four\nOkay or what should we take away from this and I I\nYou know I'll tell you what it takes away from this be prepared because there could be something even bigger coming tomorrow\nOkay\nNow I don't know what it is I don't want to panic anybody\nBut I think that if we find out tomorrow but the FBI is wrapped up this investigation which I hear they have they don't have to report or give us any information about what they what they concluded in fact\nThey could put this to a vote and say we voted and that's the way it is they can report if they want but if they don't I'm sure there'll be a lot of people screaming vengeance\nAbout what has gone down depending on which way it goes\nFast case scenario or ... ... s case scenario\nNothing nothing oh that OK\nBest case scenario nothing but the thing is it's already happened I mean the balls wrong I mean what you have an attempted attack on the president we are we ever ever attempted attack in the Pentagon women attempted to the attack on Ted Cruz\nAnd his people now why Ted Cruz I have no idea\n[noise] [noise] Hi well I think it's a major just is trying to distract us from what is really happening which is very significant in our world about abuse of women that I that that so minor compared to what ...\nI don't know how it's distracting is from the abuse of women the problems there and we know the problem exists it's okay I don't know how that is what this does is it it's basically it's terrorism to change political direction is what it is\nAnd I believe that it's domestic terrorists [noise] okay All right so really uh be prepared for anything tomorrow so I got that in fact I told my staff tomorrow I send tomorrow will be prepared we may be coming in early will be doing a bunch of things early because of the ah [noise] the two eighty\nI'm not saying that anything bad going to happen but we know that nine eleven was a drill we know the nine eleven had ah anthrax attack or attacks attached to it in fact she was going on for\nThree months [noise] results in the uh the aftermath of this went on for three months now we have an attack with rice and I mean even a step that of course\nYou can get to the president's residency refined we at a hospital I used to staff members of Ted Cruz's office his campaign on [noise]\nSo whoever was doing if they wanted to send a message and they were hoping I'm sure to thwart the vote or at least the investigation to
