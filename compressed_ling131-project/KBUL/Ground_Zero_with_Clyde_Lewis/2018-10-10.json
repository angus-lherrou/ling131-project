talking about the people who are socialist in Washington I'm Talking about the people who are studying\nThe culture studying humans and studying technology to gather that are now looking for what is it that will give people value what is it when we do hits high unemployment if your goal is one hundred percent\nBain capital's says we will have thirty percent of unemployment and it will be a

give people enough money to be able to live and and further their life\nIt's fraught with problems and even universal basic income I think misses the fundamental point\nThat\nPeople don't want to live without a purpose and too many people get their purpose from their job especially men\nWe can't just look at the money problem and you can't just give people stuff if you give people stuff they value it less\nAnd most importantly on this\nWhen you have a universal basic income and Seventy percent five percent of the people can work what stops\nPeople who want control and power or just basic human instinct or human reaction what stops at thirty percent from saying well wait a minute I don't have a job I Can't even get a job how come I have to live on this and they have that\nIt will be the same

said the things that I said about President Obama in it and it wasn't the inflammatory stuff it was why did you think she was so bad or why did you think that administration so bad\nAnd I I gave you

you know what because of that moment I read doubled\nMy efforts to read there are many times that I hear people say well you'll find that in the times actually yes that's exactly where I found out you know what I mean\nAnd so when we talk about the problems we we have those in common that whether it's keeping our children's faith whether it's drugs whether it's the weaponization of information and those are big problems that we need to discuss the aim person quality of it has to happen because\nEven though in a posting these awkward awkward thing even though it got hot\nIt's difficult to come

hear the term red flag lost almost daily in campaigning but at least she lives in a different state\nAnd gets different not\nAgain it's not about whether you think either of the ideas are good ones are bad ones it's about the fact the other side had never even heard of them\nWhen we're talking about trying to protect our kids shouldn't every idea would be considered\nEmbedded with number three\nEither or thinking this is another exchange that fascinated me between Anna are progressive mother and Mona who identifies as a Christian conservative about what each of us can do now to help keep our children safer\nI Know from my side is you know reaching out to my legislators and saying this is what I Want and if the legislators are ... to take action and helping to elect people with or more in line with the\nThought and perhaps on your side you can do the same but we all have a part to plan and first is\nMaking our voices heard\nIt might be a fair trial but that's one that we can

we are today and that sort of\nAnd for the record for ... was just dumped doubles\nAnd afterward they started talking specifics again but there was a willingness to work together and limit the number

the other person the problem isn't always the other night Denise explain how the shifted\nGreasy to come out to the range of than just putting your toes in the world of another person and and understanding and actually getting into the it we're not a problem then\nWeeks later Denise in I spoke about her perspective on America after our time\nTogether just a very combative [noise] uh you know very argumentative environment that doesn't ... doesn't have to be in a can agree to disagree on things you know like what you're trying to find something things do you agree on and I don't think that it is hard [noise]\nThere isn't that hard so the question remains\nHow did we get to this point of connection and optimism\nOnly happened in the room during the conversation with them\nThat it prompted Denise to want to reach out to enter and invite her to the gun range and the first\nFor me\nYes I appreciate it thank you I Know there were others who were not okay to either side and it was just I Know what it is a major turning on why they\nFeel and that's why I started hanging around\nThe moment of him [noise]\nAre you willing to put some words no doubt that can't be that accurate anti because you're not even willing to let them know [noise]\nRemember when I said there was more in that moment than I had realized there's Denise defending and I'm like saying you can't do that to her\nHair hey that accurate anti [noise]\nSo what happened in that moment I asked Denise later\nI just felt very angry that someone that was supposed to be sharing my point of view and my perspective was seen blatantly disrespectful I'm completely shut off than human mean sitting next to me\nOn it was just like I needed to defend her um whether she was on my side their side and it doesn't matter\nIn that moment to moment of impact the enemy lines that actually shifted someone on the complete opposite end of the issue became an ally to the nice when there was a greater obstacle to overcome [noise]\nWant greater obstacle so I went back to the audio around here\nAnd listen to attain\nI think probably I don't get any ... reasonable okay or what they were in love\nAgain and again the obstacles to consensus so many of the times was the same person written\nNow are you willing to put ... into\nThe [noise] it wasn't like the the majority of the room shared his ideas I'm pretty much everything it was his approach to the conversation\nShe became the greater optical\nMany times we would all agree to an idea but in going around the room for consensus we should have long hair for everyone around but the problem is I [laughter] I Can't smoke here I Am an hour to anticipating his block to a new idea a little I think he knew he was playing\nBefore [laughter]\nYou know we're three here I Am again the specifically because you're the you're in your mind and it is right now and then this happened\nNow are you willing to put some words no\nIt wasn't the content of what he was saying it was the way she was saying it the intention behind it and that was because of his number the number ... walking\nAids for fake three ten ten or ... remember\nThose numbers and the sound guy was setting up at people who are sitting down and sipping their water nervously I Wonder how could only measure the degree of hope that they were bringing to this round table how could I gauge their commitments to finding might lead to jump to the audio started recording you hear me asked\nThem how do you think is likely one to ten of finding some sort of some sort of you know jumping on [noise] you honestly believe and then and then to me\nNumbers were privately pass to me at the beginning of the conversation and never referred to again until it was time to leave three hours and forty six minutes later he was the actual moment the conversation ended the numbers are revealed you'll hear Rick at the end\nStuff it's a tough one\nWait to see where our numbers come out on\nSix three and tenth or\nOne one one of the line but they're already you know they are and I was raised in Maryland one interesting\nRick was the one\nWe never had a chance\nIn fact the next day he sent me an email saying quote real I think this was a good college but the impact is far too wide a cab them to be called end quote\nA one will always diminished the hope in any given room just the way that negativity lately overwhelms whatever true hope there is out\nThere we've all been Rick for whatever reason or whatever mood we've all been that person but a one is a very powerful thing especially in a very divided America [noise]\nSo to me the answer for how do we move forward and work together to keep our children safer [noise]\nUsed to be any number greater than one\nThis is Denise ... at the end all round table Denise who went on to open up her world to show a fellow American that she is in age them\nDenise is number is eight\nNine eleven setting here are like my heart is going out here in twenty four a day or you know your ear and points and I understand that and it may not be one that that I you know finally get on board but I Believe he and I know where you're coming from that and I
