that every single person that you want elected from from dog catcher to president of the United states that every person you want elected he was elected and they are putting in all of the policies that you can\nI'm going to be really generous I going to make it a lot easier there's thirty or forty percent of the country that disagrees with your utopia they just want to go in a different direction\nWhat do you do with the forty percent of the population that does not agree with you\nWhat do you do with them [noise]\nWhat do you do to make sure that those people don't start infecting the minds\nOf others so your perfect utopia starts to fall apart\nWhat happens with the ones who won't comply with these new rules what do you do to make sure that that utopia it remains in place by keeping all of those people in power because there's going to be another election\nAnd if you have history tells us anything it swings the other direction what once you have the power what are you willing to do to keep the power\nIf your answer to all of those questions isn't\nNothing you have gone over the cliff\nBecause in America the answer to what are you going to do to all of those people who disagree the answer in America is nothing what are you willing to do to keep your power or the answer in America is nothing\nWhat do you do just to silence those who will not comply the answer in America is nothing\n\nSo any time somebody says we should shout these people down they've taken the first step all saw is creative\n\nWhen you begin to speak things they use speak them into existence\nWhen you say we shouldn't round people up the more people that say we should round people up we should disturb them in their own homes we should we should picket and surround their houses the more that you say that the more reality is created in that direction\n\nBe very careful on what you say and what you think\n\nThe answer to these questions and America must remain\nNothing\nI Will not do anything to my neighbor who disagrees to me with me I Will not do anything and everything to hold on to power\nI Will state my case and I will Duke it out on the battlefield of ideas I Will not silence other people I Will not smear or destroy other people I Will not be calm everything\nThat you're going side he goes an army guy he promised you a lot didn't he I said yes I Am going to be a

under the sun he goes you know what am I promise you I said what he said for ... years are you ready I said yes and I signed up\nWhen I look back at that and then I didn't know what I was doing what I'm saying I was just reacting but when I look back at that I Know I was desperately seek seeking positive male role models I didn't have\nAnd wrinkled gave me many of them and that was a a great thing and that the marine corps the military's not everybody and not much to join but for me it really helped me tremendously and I said all the\nTime without the marine corps I Would have been a punk because I was lost at Seventeen completely lost in the marine corps helped me tremendously and when I got an a Marine Corps about seven years later [noise]\nUm my mom had really gone into a very bad place um she couldn't handle me leaving she couldn't handle my father's death and\nShe was addicted first illegal drugs and eventually illegal drugs\nAnd she was a victim of the drug war and she was a convicted felon so I pulled her out of prison\nAnd I used my whatever things I had to try to get her back up and running a reading her an apartment in the house that I mean I'm I'm a car that kind of thing and she struggled and if you if you've had a felon in your life and you know hard it can be right they have that on the record and then they feel less then and then when they get a job there are a hostage to that job because they're afraid to do the job for them\nAnd it's just bad bad bad so I said you know what I'm going to do something I've been taken actually my whole life and take action now too and we decided to start our own business I figured if we're in charge him with a ball says you can't fire her such so we ... we can't trucker so became we had a small trucking company\nWho what did you know about but what did you know about business nothing [laughter] matter God Bless America would it matter what it was what I have a\nChoice I allow my mother to be hostage or I Do something I was my option go to business school was that when I was when I Do\nKnow right I'd have to walk\nThe judge or I Do something I was my option go to business school what is that what I was when I Do know right I ...\nI ... I don't I never I never have and never will ever measure any plan I have against perfection because perfection doesn't work I measure my plan against status quo because that has caused what I have status quo was my mother as a hostage I don't accept status quo so with our business\nIs well um my my um it did well I actually left it let ... let her and my step dad run it and she ran until she retired and when she retired she did what too many New Yorkers do and that is leaving New York state and she went to South Carolina to retire\nUm so she did that in ... and she was fine until she passed away several years ago but after that that's when I went off to do my own thing I had made it for jobs\nAnd then decided you know what the first visible successful let me try another one so I thought in my second business and that's when I actually uh that when I did not do well and that's why I say we're not that's when I first heard you back when you want your Philly station\nI'm In ... in the morning show ... out of here yes that's when I first heard you doing your ah your jokes um about\nAn hour and a stand [laughter] I remember I remember I was I was I was driving around and and I would like to listen to you I think you can I Am\nI yeah yeah I think so yeah I Am yes you when you get morning show I remember listening to back then and um then I did that and I sold that business off it did not do as well as I wanted to be do but I always call that my MBA that failure was my MBA so I'm\nFrom that I didn't have one more job and then so at this job now that this is now that I have which I'm a trainer consultant teacher\nSo I have large clients like a ... an essay laughter and smaller clients like small law firms I teach um leadership I'm exactly the coach at each business I've been an executive in a public company twice as a a band aid\nAnd I've talked to many colleges that Bruce St John J. and I've taught as a guest instructor at the graduate level of a Yale and Colombia\nAnd now here but what have you done with your life seriously I Want to be a I'm a loser I'm Sorry\nYeah holy [laughter] yes [laughter] so oh you are a guy that to me seems tailor made for the times that we live in I I mean I think we're Rocco bomber\nBut was also in in some ways tailor made for the times that we live in and I don't think he lived up to his potential um the the more division happened\nUm we we need somebody that can speak to all sides with ah with credibility somebody who can speak to prison reform\nWith credibility and not an axe to grind but common sense and experience\nI mean this is the thing that I talk about all the time you know I've dealt with and seen the prison system from both\nYou know both sides my father's rushes off from my mother as as a felon and I say the same thing as I say in business and that is when you want to fix something you don't walk in and start dictating when you do that you get rebellion when you do that people say no\nThe issue that we have particularly in New York state but throughout the country is we have two sided two sided thinking right as you said before a binary I either every corrections officers that dog and every single person there is a victim or every prisoner is evil and she'd be killed in every corrections officer is perfect\nAnd neither is true with the reality of it is to fix this is the situation in prison we have to have the corrections officers as part of the solution\nAnd that's hard for people to understand because they think they are part of system yes but they see people every day what I Know for sure in prison right now we have people in jail who should probably never get out ever what bad people she never got out and there are people who made a mistake should pay that at the society and she didn't get a second chance\nAnd people probably shouldn't be in jail at all the issue is I don't know which one is which I never will but you know who does\nCorrections officers who deal with them every\nThe deal with the inmates everyday how do I know that to be true you look at Massachusetts right now they have the Humvee program which is a program that has CEOs corrections officers and volunteers from outside together with a specific community in this case the communities veterans but you can pick any community a community that the seals knowing they see in prison everyday\nYou make that happen all the someone happens you know if people who've had that problem coming as volunteers now should tax money you also have corrections officers who know how to control people know which people who can get in there no those who will be scanning and well now see those who are scanning and we'll put the people who need to have the rights\nThe right the second ... out there in his program how do we know that there is it isn't right in Massachusetts in general is about Seventy five percent\nWith this program less than five percent holy Oh yes no no specialized people coming in corrections officer and do it here's the problem in New York state specifically the corrections officers ... the the the life expectancy is fifty eight years that's ... years old not just that every corrections officer I've met either know someone\nWho committed suicide and or\nA knows someone who is so ready to leave they have become completely opposite to assist them this is a problem\nAll of them to have the same thing Larry you know I'm I'm already there their therapist I'm already there their marriage Calif I'm already they're legal assistant already help them out with all kinds of things I'm already trying to help them there are so many CEOs who would happily ship into this world\nWithout having to change any of that ad in the body by giving them an actual contract and had a contract and three years in the upstate that's how bad it is\nSo we could actually fix things this is repair trouble if we actually use both sides and go in and asked the people who are there\nHow to fix it that's how you are in the business that's how you fix it in life\nAnd Larry do you have time can I hold you for a while could ... okay ah I Want to take a break 'cause I I Want to talk to about the economy I Want to talk to about business sure are and you know the direction of California where they've they've just a mandated that you know women now have to be on the board of

Trump has\nBrought to NAFTA we're back with a Larry sharp but he's running for governor in New York how do we how do we change education in New York how would you change it\nWe have to rebuild it from the bottom up I mean it is totally completely broken we drop twenty two thousand dollars per kid at a basket mediocre results\nAnd the first thing is ending standardized testing until high school no satellite that's going to ... satellites testing is unfair way\nWay upgrading teachers and unfair way of rewarding schools it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve who don't test will feel stupid equate to second class of students\nIn elementary school that's embarrassingly bad at it is absolutely no indication success in life to the future that has to go away but when that goes away a couple of days I've been in New York state Common Core will go away good I don't have a problem with in comic or go away\nI'm the only guy who says let teachers teach and that does not administrators I'm the only does that my goal was to remove administrators to allow teachers to actually teach we have school districts in New York state where there are more diminished rather than teachers that's embarrassing\nSo once we do that we'll find all of a sudden I be able to get rid of a lot of administrators an average teacher in New York state makes about eighty K. the average administration makes over six figures you get rid of two administrators that's either to know teachers or raises over quit meant at what point earlier\nDon't decide what that is the school district does they know what they need and they can repair how they want to repair\nHow you got to deal with the unions are the union's New Yorker out of control\nWith the Janice decision it helps obviously but the issue here becomes I'm not at a union in any way shape or form a union leadership hates me because there was that was meant\nObviously but the issue here becomes I'm not anti union in any way shape or form a union leadership hates me because there were stabbed which meant\nWorkers love me because I'm the only one who will tell them I Would negotiate openly transparently with every union unions are literally in the Fourth Amendment they are free speech sure who were of association yo yo yo ... as long as they're not forced to join up a problem at all the members loved me so that's why teachers always behind\nMe when I'm when I was asking you about the unions are in such control that you're paying the state is paying for teachers that have abused children and yet they are sitting in rubber rooms\nAnd that's my point once once most of that is happening because of both Albany and D.C control and Albany and D.C money from DC we get about four billion dollars every year and that controls a lot\nWhen that money begins to go away number one that will help the second thing is I'm not beholden to union leadership if they get mad at me so what\nYou get leaderships not going to vote for me anyway I don't need Seventy percent of New York's the vote for me I Need thirty percent of those who vote\nYou just said forty four billion dollars goes away from the federal government that's correct how are you going to have what are you gonna replace that with\nAbsolutely and the first thing is we're going to lose a minister as what you make things a little bit better but that isn't enough\nThe second thing I Want to change K. through twelve K. through twelve she's not exist she became through ten the last two years of high school for too many kids is you know Jim study hall or playing video games it's it's doing nothing how do we know this the first year of college for giving the kids is thirteenth grade they're not ready for college\nAnd takes over six years for the average kid the

good for you also go to go to a very good to eat prep school to get you into the school you want to not you're ready to get that at school you can get that you take advantage of ... of internships maybe graduate in three years and now you're rocking and rolling\nYou don't like that no worries the super smart kid the kid that test well awesome take your safety at sixteen stock you're pass on to your doctor right away get a two year degree by going in there by Eighteen you have an associates degree\nShe no wonder that no worries\nTo a trade school the state of starving for traits been

tomorrow\nSo it's like generational and our generation you know we're pretty much done unless we're deciding we want to learn more we're pretty much done unless we're looking to the kids in and asking them what they're doing it\nUsed to be kids would ask adults now don't have to ask the kids' grandparents have to ask grandkids what uh what's the world's gonna be like a whole new world for them\nAnd it's gonna be partly ours because they're going to be the ones moving faster than we are\n\nSo in our latter days last days on this planet our last year's on this planet we're gonna be seeing smart city networks being planned for Generation Z and if you were asleep\nYou're gonna find yourself completely baffled suspicious of it not that you shouldn't be oh now that you shouldn't be but there are few secrets surprises that await us\nAnd many of the surprises\nAre not major surprises to those if you listen to ground zero\nOkay\nSo ... is the key listening to this program\nAnd throwing away any ideas that when I talk about this conspiracy theory only because this isn't a conspiracy nor the conspiracy theory this is the future\nAnd in the past when I've been on the Internet and I I've been on Facebook I've seen in the social comments a lot of horrible harsh things when I started talking about the future of people say oh come on and\nWell you know what you can say oh come on all your life\nAs we know what we do here and this isn't talking Mimi ... crank conspiracy theory that we're talking about tonight\nIs what makes us different from all the other shows because you know what yeah I can talk about conspiracy theory\nAnd you know for the about conspiracy perjury if I have to mention Donald Trump thrived mentioned cabin are have been mentioned forward or I have to mention all these other names of the scandals of the sexes is actually the sex of the sex does it matter thank you Mick Jagger does it matter\nOr just a matter belong to the future and the city of tomorrow does it matter belong to supporting this program because of what you yet from that show\nTwo weeks ago a lot of freedom and it was on this program and we\nTalked about the show is called ... do you remember the show ...\nYeah I can remember I was talking about\nThese micro machines I was talking about nano by technology or talking about micro by technology or gas or what [noise] Forbes magazine today was talking about smart cities they were talking about the future Generation Z and you know what they said about\nGeneration Z and smart cities well there's got to be a way to control all this stuff but we can't do it by asking people Vince Young taken ... or or come to our happy club like a ... do you do what they decided you know what they suggested\nSmart dust [noise]\nYeah\nIt when I started talking about money in Washington trillion trillion trillion [laughter] after so many zero's you just lose track even after a million you just lose track can't even fathom a million dollars let alone fattening what\nOne trillion censors would be in every city and every ... fate and every ... every place and as we diet is we um as we designed smart cities around the data we want instead of\nThe wiring we have now the dialogue it's even more complex mass\nData aggregation will establish some troops about how our cities run it will lead us just or actually scores cities on different quality of life metrics\nYou imagine that you you teach you think we're talking about the credit social credit okay well social credit will be we tattle on everybody else\n[noise] social credit will be hey you do me wrong I'll put stars down I'll bring your stars that I bring bring your your numbers down right you screw me over I'll bring your numbers and said what Hoover drivers you you you I I write you you write me we rate everyone else okay so can you imagine\nWe're writing everybody else was this whole credit system dragging fly we talked about it the other night right dragging fly\nAnd I and I had a discussion about this the grounds their lines I'm bringing in some political to tell Google to shove it and say hey we don't want you just sit there and and pretend like you're you're you're you know you're not\nThe Internet of things\nIs easy money there is that you you get assigned your life away to the devil their alphabet soup you know you do that Google is there are wondering why fourteen hundred people to sign a petition to get you to stop at your own company five of quit\nBut it's not enough\nDealing with a country that has a bad I mean they didn't even understand it rotten rotten human rights\n\nThen of course we designed a smart city yes because it gives you are going to be there taking ...\nChina China China China yeah that's how it works\nBut we'll find out how our city's truly run and they will give a rating we will score cities that are based on different quality life matrix\nSevere sitting there just decided that what the hell no one's going to want to come to your stupid city\nWas that again because of crime because of the way you keep up the city that the way you keep the homeless cleaned up ... I mean all these things will mount the your social credit score city how you feel about that you think that just the people are going to be scored you're going to be an score to\n\nPeople's eyes great well ... [laughter] you you think you didn't get anybody will care although care about as well this is going to cost you more money you want to bring up the score pay more money\n\nThat's how we design data aggregation so that we know how cities score and the quality of life department all that brings us to the toughest question of all what do we value in human habitat what I mean\nThat that raises another problem we can create a dystopia just as easily as we could create a utopia the dividing line is the seemingly thin\nIt's kind of gray right it's a little little a delivery I guess\nSee we assume that by tapping into the collective intelligence to both devices in people we can create\nA better living environment because they said over the weekend I spoke at the ground zero lounge and much of what I was discussing the previous week was examine in great detail and the concerns about our humanity\nOr expressed by everybody and what was the most exciting about the meeting was that while many people on my social media have been very critical\nWhat I've been warning people about there was this overall intellectual and critical concern about our future\nAnd the future of our children and our grandchildren\nAnd it was so great it was great to be able to talk to everybody about best in the end they kind of you know get the feel of what people are feeling\nAnd anymore I'm beginning to realize and this is the honest truth I'm beginning to realize something about social media and Twitter and all that\nYou don't have the people that say bad things on Twitter saying bad things on Facebook they're not my listeners they're not my supporters support means just that he means support\nOkay\nSo I mean you can be critical of something I say you can disagree with something I say\nMen in the end you'll still listen you'll still support the show you understand that you know sometimes the\nTopics are very difficult to try and swallow it very difficult to understand at first because they're new\nAnd and and the most certainly or something that the challenges the thinking of those people\nTo basically look at my my my social media and see people just\nThe attack attack a Jack Jack and they say I've been listening to you for years no you haven't been listening to me for years or I'm a listener but no you're not a listener or supporter okay if you're a listener\nYou know how things go you follow the show and you know all of the patterns you know what to do and many of you many of you who\nGo back and research some of the old shows understand what's going on here he is not the game sure I tried to make it as entertaining as possible I Want to make it as entertaining as possible\nBut this is not your little political party the outcry in wind over somebody on your side get screwed over or somebody on the other side get screwed over this is not CNN stitches on MSNBC this is not Fox this is ground zero this is one of the big boys play right this is where the grownups play\n\nAnd it really really makes it just brings my hair straight up\nWhen I meet people and it was January and that was genuine wonderful people ever made I ever had the chance to meet friendly interesting kind loving tremendous supporters of my program\nAnd then you have the guys out there that are just the trolls and you know that's exactly what they are both Ron and I have decided that with all the wonderful people we've met all over the country from Virginia to California\n\nWho've been all over speaking engagements Idaho Nevada\nOf all these people we we've been at the end of their cities and towns we do not see anybody\nWho doesn't want to openly talk about things and talked about in the civil way the social media is a big lie its ally\nAnd I'll bet some of the people that are having these conversations are negativity that are putting out his racist content is hateful content they're all boss\nThey're all box and they're sent out there they basically hijack people's sites that have been oh I don't know ... for years and just out of the blue oh what did he start oh he was he got on what twenty twenty seventeenth how many things as he got on his Facebook page oh just a picture one picture he came out over or just to say one bad thing on this website\nWithout worse this whole idea\nOf the Internet of things this whole idea of robots and and ... and computers and algorithms they're here to screw with your head\n\nAnd so yes there is intellectual and critical concern about our future more so that I see on Facebook and more so that I see the ... on on the mainstream and what they talk about every night\nYou know this is beyond Kanye getting boots on Saturday Night live I mean come on I mean I knew about this too but you know you can learn this on your own you don't need to always make you do need to make it a major news story\nBut they do\nAnd so when I was making in the ground zero alone when Israeli ground zero lounge I said last week to to the audience I said the last week there was a ... there's been a glut of news about tac and they moved a smart neighborhoods and the reason the reason is that\nEven though we're caught up in the chief justice debate the sexual more there are plans being made for all of us and and while we're being distracted\nYour future will most certainly give you\n[noise]\nYour smart city away and with all the moves by the FCC and other authorities\nYou will find [noise] the new deployment of five gee cell networks [noise] we'll be mandatory and we'll be standard and I'm going to tell you what the FCC is doing to guarantee that we will have [noise]\nSmart cities in cities are the future [noise]\n\nWe have to now convert an either you adapt or [noise]\n... well I don't want to see what happens to you after that you'll you'll figure that out if you decide you you don't want to go down [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "Billings", "day": "02"}
