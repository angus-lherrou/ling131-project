I think it will be a great Supreme Court justice\nYeah I mean I listen I I assume I Hope and I think you'll be a Supreme Court justice but I don't know because\nThe whole point of this was Jeff Flake in my opinion this was set up\nShift like is he and I think senator your kitchen women aren't allowed to get an elevator with the United States Senate and the Capitol building how did they get in this whole thing was a Senator Jeff flake they asked them to come in\nThat was his cover for demanding an FBI investigation [noise] you know how those two women getting the elevator that convinced him to change his mind from a yes vote to I Want an FBI investigation and the answer is that it was set up from day one and he wanted those two women in the elevator and he wanted to use them as cover\nSo there has to be a reason they want this one week delay and of course it is\nEither because they're going to have ten more women come forward right at all and claimed that brick capital raped them or attempted rape them or whatever he did to them who knows what they're going to say sexually harassed them\nAnd they're gonna try drag this on forever number one and number two they're never going to be satisfied with the limited FBI investigation or all the FBI does ever as jazz break capital honestly said is they file a form after interviewing people and they don't come to any conclusion and they tell you what everybody's head so he said no rape she said rape\nIf this was real how can any once it gets real when they interviewed him one on one\nFace to face and never mentioned that there's a woman claiming you attempted to rape or they have that for the last days to see first did they might be able to beat him some other way and then this is going to be their last chance Hail Mary to try to destroy and let's just go ahead and ... and and they're using the same\nDeal they used against Clarence Thomas storm and the exact same playbook at the same playbook they used against judge Roy Moore I mean I don't know anything about Roy Moore bill I really don't and I thought his answers were kind of strange and invasive and I wasn't quite sure whether I should support him\nBut in the end I came down in the idea that this was forty years ago and a bunch of women were making up stories none of which could be prove none of which had evidence and none of which had witnesses\nYou cannot allow a man to be defeated based on that and they decided that worked with judge Roy Moore let's use it with with Brett Kavanaugh it's very clear that that's what this is if it was real Feinstein would've brought it up and one on one meetings with the man\nCan you imagine if I'm up for a major job and someone gets a letter that says oh Wayne rooted tempted to rape me and you sit across to me and you say nothing but then two months later you bring it up well that means the whole thing was a farce in the beginning\nSo look ... years of my column basically said\nI Am Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh as me Brett Kavanaugh as you and if they could do it to him they could do it to anyone I grew up in an all Catholic neighborhood mostly Italian part Irish\nI was number one in my class like Brett Kavanaugh I was a sports star like Brett Kavanaugh I went to Columbia He went to an Ivy League\nSchool Yale we both got out of the chief great success in life and now they're trying to destroy him and I can tell you one thing guys like that do raped women there's no way it doesn't happen find me a case in America where a guy who's number one in his class and it was ideally educator with the sports started a great kid has tons of women friends had tons of childhood friends who stand up for him\nAnd becomes a well regarded judge and suddenly you\nFind out he was a rapist or attempted rapist or a gang rape is it's the stupidest Mariel ever heard I grew up with nothing but Catholic school boys and let me tell you we all like women but we're all nice guys were like the date when we don't like to raped women I've never heard anything so outrageous and so\nStupid and my entire life show me a witness okay no problem there are none nobody saw it happen it didn't happen\nSooner than the name she provided indicate that you know telling the truth the primaries brute terminals man\nAnd he was female friends he's too cute little daughters\nAnd there is no credible evidence whatsoever you did any of these things there's no truth there's no fairness and there's no evidence there is no facts but Fox News there's declaring it all credible how is it possible that record and the judge no pilot tunnel or Chris Wallace or car rub good say boy that's credible credible\nWalk that have always been credible I Want to hear incredible\nCredible because they didn't breaker because no one tried to break or no one at the single decent question I mean here's the deal if if I was a criminal awaiting trial I Would be for that woman\nRachel Mitchell come after me hey Easter most incompetent personally much our life tallies well I think maybe dine Feinstein harder at\nSome say she worked for the Democratic party far as I'm concerned the only thing she did she said after the fact that there's no way I Would bring charges against them in a real courtroom well OK Clinton argues me a lawyer who would say after everything we know which is there's no way this there's no evidence of that but thirty six years ago I'd be a single lawyer or a prosecutor\nIn the world that would actually say I would bring charges and I'll find someone that ought to be in jail you up with that\nPerson in jail because God Forbid they come and get my son or my daughter you know these are horrible people they'd be willing to say something like that they don't even know what they're doing they don't even

the testimony would not find the evidence you know I've heard a lot of the feminist the missile interests I call them on the left\nI say that survivors must be the lead a well we believe that they have been assaulted but we don't necessarily need to take their word for as to who if they can't present the evidence how did Dr forget to the party she wasn't drunk when she went to the party\nShe lives six miles from the party how she got home she has a very selective memory and like I said I'm not saying something traumatic that it happened\nDinner I Believe that at some point in life at some point in her life it probably did\nCraft but she did not display to me like the burden of proof that I needed to believe that it was Dr Brett Kavanaugh and also what saved his his wife I Do believe that this father\nBy keeping a diary a calendar of sorts and without Brett Kavanaugh's calendar it would certainly come down to just he said she said and the Democrats want to use these weaponized sexual allegations as political tool\nI think Dr Christine for nothing more than a political ... on the Democrat Party while they choose to ignore other women who have come forward with crab credible evidence specifically against Keith Ellison\nThat these are the ... the vice chair the second most powerful Democrat in the party including a candidate for an attorney general for a Minnesota has to credible allegations with police report Dr reports text messages and allegedly a video that that exists\nProving or at least giving us out of it and that he allegedly emotionally and physically abused no less than two women\nAnd I'll give you another part of this or you know it's just like the dog that didn't bark she told the committee the primary impacted event occurred during the four years directly after she said she went on to struggle academically I struggled at a Chapel Hill and in college when I was Seventeen I was off to college at a very tough time\nShe skips completely her junior and senior year in high school I guarantee you if there were a bad grades are bad behavior by her her junior and senior in high school the to academic years after the event took place when she was Fifteen Years old\nThat would have been a dog that barked we would have found out that you flunked out of high school that you did poorly and so how is it possible that you did well in high school\nGood enough to get into a Chapel Hill which is our school to get in to get three advanced degrees including too\nRight sixty five books in periodicals travel all over the world to to Haiti and South America and Europe and uh in Israel and she went to and she went to Hawaii nine times she seemed objectively there'll be full life what she would have written Seventy five books except for this terrible event\nHow come we've not heard about what would happen or academically entered junior and senior year I submit you the reason is they didn't do it\nAnd she did quite well which is the dog that did not bark and that there was no objective indicator and why would she left the house with your best friend leaned Kaiser girlfriends still there if there was two purported attempted rapist running around drunk\nHow'd you get out of there who took her home why didn't you notify the girls the next ah the next day at the swimming club but at the country club or or the first day of class\nShe told nobody counsellors mom and dad girlfriend she kept it secret for Thirty years then had a recovered memory and psychological services counseling session because she wanted a second front door and how is it her lawyers got away with lying\nFor ten days about her wanting to drive from California to Washington when in fact she was staying in Delaware at that time and flying all over the country why wasn't that a bigger deal because you flat outlined\n[laughter] wow that's not the another example of the Democrats using women as political pawns or tools and that's a political assassination at the gate and that's just the politics of personal destruction they want it the political theater\nThey want it to expose her some on dead stomach exposed to the she was and someone made sure that she would have cameras and lights and the national audience in front of the Senate Judiciary committee that was a set up in order to try to make the old white men\nOn the Senate Judiciary committee their own white Republican are taught bad you know Steve can't wait it out just the other day and I say that's the old white men are relentlessly being racially and generationally profile by the tolerant laps and air quotes tolerant\nLeftist media outlets and politicians almost universally profiled and stigmatized Republican senators\nLooks like racial profiling us back in style if you are left us for not only as an old white men that were going to question her corporate have an ... an old white privilege to guide the Sacramento Bee is that when he was crying that's just what white privilege looks like\nYeah so they they they call it a massage or that sort of crime Republicans massage it is an old white men and that's coming directly from the vicious violent violent blast\nAnd missing dress the feminist\nMostly just a woman that crave unanimity demanded a public forty million audience to listen to her story she was never properly cross examined\nAnd uh and the questioning from the Democrats was laughable\nAnd and at this point uh what's gonna happen later this week do you think you're making bars of Reagan babe dot com I assume the FBI Thursday or friday was going to give largely clean bill of health that will not be sufficient Jeff Flake whose last name and should be an ... not a no\nUh I I guess she's going to he's going to vote for unless he's pigeonholed by another Ted Cruz CBGB's screaming out I'm In an elevator God Knows what's going to have to get on your crystal ball what happens later this week\n[noise] well I'm I think it hurts ... however now that we've done and the Democrats are are there we are in this you know higher than the seventh FBI investigation I have a ... I'm sure that Michael ... orbit gory alright well here\nWith another victim I mean right now they're probably scraping the Yale yearbooks to see what they can\nMatter to the Democrats it's simply the perception it's simply the narrative and they can use their buddies in the media in order to further to the same and destroy potentially and allegedly assume ugly innocent man but they can try to ruin him in a court of public opinion because it benefits that politically\nAnd Meghan they couldn't care less about sexual assault victims they couldn't care less about Christine forward that's why the league tour identity to have ... they wanted to weaponize sexual assault the way they weaponize the Oscars the way they weaponize television shows the way they weaponize Murphy Brown the way they weaponize Oscars\nThey way they weaponize Grammys in public education whatever it is\nThe socialist progressive just want to weaponize and take up someone's cause as long as it fits their agenda but Keith Ellison or or Clinton or the Kennedys did not fit the agenda of the modern Democratic Party so that completely ignore the provable Keith Ellison", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "01"}
