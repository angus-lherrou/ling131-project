every several hundred did that they use social media to get together and feed they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump\nHe he he'd previously wrote I never voted for Trump nor a vibrant own Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish ... but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so well when you went in NYPD Hugo but right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nWhat did he do when did he do it who didn't send these messages to and investigate them as to why something wasn't done and about the guns right now according to media counts three fifty seven

I'm going and at least that that'll come to light the wind and someone else who saw this alert police\nAre asking you some doubt how many other Robert Bowers are running around this country and I would assume there are several thousand just like him in a nation that's three hundred and forty million people and let's face it America is the most pro Jewish pro Israel Israel especially with with Trump in the White House nation on the face of the earth\nAnd this is the place or where where where were Jews do well and there's about three million or so three and a half million Jews in America disproportionately successful because of faith and family because of connections to go some hard work because of academics disproportionate success\nAnd so those who are jealous or whatever they got to have a scapegoat for the failures in their life and they look at someone successful so many Jews disproportionately succeed in business and entertainment in finance and the law in Madison and I found it so last year it said that this afternoon on CNN\nWho treated Bowers who unfortunately lived in that doctor is Jewish at the Pittsburgh hospital and a couple of the nurses who treated him and saved his life for Jewish ... isn't that unbelievable that that that somehow powers were saved by by Jews in the hospital unbelievable\nCould have been a Jewish cop who responded to the Senate or do to save other people people in their\nProfession to be doctors lawyers in the emergency areas paying doctors police officers firemen\nDon't look at who they're saving or what they've done they know what they're sworn to do and that's what they do it and that's what the doctors in that hospital even though he had killed eleven Jewish people in a synagogue or with their prey\nSaved his life and that's what they do and that's what cops too and that's what firemen do and that's what these doctors to it and God Bless them for that\nTalk about these are say who was the\nMentally ill deranged individual they ran around in the white van I guess his band was he was an attempt to bomb making factory some have said when someone in a white man\nHas those kinds of ah a Heidi Asians on the side CNN sucks also had scopes on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama that says something should have been done in your years in New York City as a cop Thomas asking how many unusual situations like that did you observe\nThem I can count but I Will tell you this you know there are laws and there are reasons for stopping someone and questioning them\nAnd maybe he didn't violate the law the fact that he's expressing his First Amendment right to express speech on the outside of his car doesn't necessarily give you a right\nTo pull him over and or questioned him unless he violates some other kind of law that we don't even know if the police had any interaction with him relative to as thin as of yet down there but you know at the point in time I'm sure where it went down to about ... aka\nA Florida [noise] when the bombs had been sent proved that distribution center and then in the area plantation where he was taken into custody I wouldn't be surprised to certain people start to make calls on him [noise] prior to the police\nCome into contact with him or learning his identity through his finger print and that was tying in simultaneously with them identifying ... is the potential

himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by leftist government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent\nOf the so called the migrants are young males between the ages of Fifteen and thirty it's impressive offer a woman with a baby to walk two thousand miles\nThrough John goes in the heat and sand and deserts that ain't gonna happen somebody's organizing on this much like the boat live from Juba there are lumped as politicians who hate Trump and want to destroy America and they want to flood the southern border right now there is Fifteen and twenty thousand one hundred Fifteen to twenty million\nYou know there are forty one million people in Central America and I bet a good deal of them have their eyes on what's happening here and how we handle it the problem is that we have gaping loopholes in our asylum laws and if anyone in this caravan no matter what even if they said on national television ten times\nThat they're coming here for a job as you've heard people say all I wanted a job in Los Angeles when they put one toe in the United states they say the words political asylum\nAnd they are in like Flynn they are here they're going to be released into the country and they're going to be on a backlog of probably as long as three to four years never showing up for their cases eighty percent of these folks\nLoopholes never show up for their cases and simply disappear into the United states this is a gimmick they're using our own policies twice this year the Republican Congress has tried to close these loopholes and they have not had a single democratic vote\nTo uh to do so and you asked to ask yourself why who really benefits in the long run for mass illegal immigration\nWhen you look at studies of immigrants as they become citizens and how they vote sixty five percent of them ended up registering his Democratic\nColleagues I forgot to government assistance that they will\nYeah you're barely making it you're going to vote for the party that hand you the most goodies\nAnd ah you know twenty five percent a vote Republican but if you think about you know twelve million illegal aliens a sixty five percent of them would end up becoming citizens and voting Democrat that would that would that have thrown every American election to the Democrats and the last Twenty years and everyone for probably the next forty\n... and the other issue you read in democratic literature is that if and when Texas flipped to the Democratic party and becomes a deep blue state the way the politics will be fashion for the next twenty to fifty years\nThere'll be no chance for Republican ever to win the presidency again in Texas is a blue state and you might throw in Florida because California for most of its history was a deep red state Ronald Reagan heritage easily mixing dared raised ... California flip it goes really go migration\nRight who is the next target Texas flips and it's over but David Wray affair here here's a question Trump is talking in the way I Would like him to talk he's normal he reflects mid western values conservative values he's saying the army or the national guard will not let them crossed in America\nHow do you physically stop maybe twenty or thirty thousand people in mass from getting one totally into American soil then blaming political refugee status how physically we're not going to shoot them there's well ... how do you actually stop 'em\nThat's the million dollar question without going into Mexico because I'm really ... ... that that is the question and I don't know that anybody has the answer to that I'll tell you\nHow you would stop them if it existed Trump's border wall if you had a border wall there they wouldn't be walking in the United states except through legal ports of entry or they would have to walk way out into the desert in Arizona or to come over that's why we need the border wall and some of these heavy crossing points but that's all it takes\nIs one ... in the United states and we're doing and you and you're done and on and on the long\nList vote yeah and all we need to do is end so fair has called called we believe this is the beginning of a national emergency just like the Mariel boatlift was we've asked that Congress the president calls Congress back to Washington\nThis week to close these asylum loopholes if we could close these asylum loopholes or if we could put asylum courts with detention centers right on the border so as they came over\nTo ask for political asylum they had their hearing and they were immediately sent home because Ninety nine percent of these folks would not qualify ... for political asylum their economic migrants than we would have an end of this nonsense we can't get those loopholes closed that Congress failed twice\nThey're going to we think they should come back and close these loopholes anything short of that\nAnd and it's kind of a a you know a cat and mouse game we have to try to keep them from getting in you know\nHere's the problem in very poor taste tan Democrats the United States Senate to move legislation right now there's fifty one there might be fifty four fifty five after the election whatever the number is unique numerous Democrats to switch\n... right now there's fifty one there might be fifty four fifty five after the election whatever the number is unique numerous Democrats to switch party line vote with the Republicans\nIn order to say that much like Mexicans of Mexicans come here and they get one foot and the taxes they're thrown back immediately in Mexico and you're done we ever a loophole in the law that says your ... from Central America Asia Africa\nAnd you're making do America no matter how you get her legally or illegally and you claim refugee status for political purposes but then you can begin in the hearing process that takes three to ten years\nSo unless the Democrats agree to do this no changing the law will happen\nI mean Trump God Bless him I Love him\nOr he can tell tell if all he wants\nBut you cannot stop twenty thousand people or twenty million people from flooding our southern border from Central America\nClaiming refugee status they have no shots they have no medical Clarence them no financial support them no work skills that we need most Democrats than a third grade education and there's nothing we can do to stop them unless the Democratic party agrees and what makes you think they're ever going to agree\nWell I mean at some point maybe they're going to put the national interest on their own political interests is that my pipe dream yeah [laughter]\nNo it won't happen now that's why I feel bad I feel terrible yeah\n[noise] yeah I mean the president really is extremely limited in what he can do in his ... that is to try to get the Mexicans to stop them in Mexico because once they get to the U.S border they're going to walk\nYou know five miles outside of the port of entry and they're going to step right over a fence and they're going to be in the United states hoping that they get apprehended in fact if they see the border patrol they'll run towards them\nTo ask for political asylum and then it's all over and until we get these detention facilities on the border of what these asylum courts as we did in the late Nineteen nineties when Central Americans were pulling this\nA stick with us till we get that back\nIn turn these cases around and get these asylum loopholes or a close we are going to be stuck with this mass\nWell I I I don't know I'm filled with hope all the time but I yeah unless\nMexico says to the Trump bring the United States Army one or two or three miles into Mexico and politically that would be the death knell of the Mexican president if he allowed American Soldiers on the Mexican territory that ain't gonna happen and you know I think there's not going to happen is the Mexican president was elected\nAnd I just recently under an open borders policy and what she wants free flow of information I don't know what we can do other than bitch complain and moan and at the end of the day the Democrats aren't going to agree to this\nAnd so unless they get hammered at the at the ballot box and Nancy plus it goes down hard a week from Tuesday and the Democrats get hurt in the Senate ... ... ... we don't need we need about ten Democrats the United states senators to give the same treatment to Central Americans that we get the Mexicans\n... which means they're here illegally immediately send back don't have to go through a hearing process the liberal activists attorneys are there\nAre the news media is their Kamala Harris and all the rest are just loving this and the goal David raid there thinking strategically is make Texas a deep blue state and if that happens that Republicans are D. U. N. and done\nWell you know ... it's a great political strategy if you're a Democrat because they're scaring Americans away left and right so you're only option left his to import future citizens and they are going to do that from central in Latin America\nAnd you know perhaps that explains why they're sitting on their hands while we have caravans ... of uh\nYou know perhaps that explains why they're sitting on their hands while we have caravans of tens of thousands of people coming towards our southern border this ... of actually be stopped by Congress until then Trump can build his wall\nHe can uh put up a the types of a deterrent that we have on the border to house families together get their asylum cases turned around quickly and then start working on the seven hundred thousand case that log of a ... who are currently in the U.S", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "29"}
