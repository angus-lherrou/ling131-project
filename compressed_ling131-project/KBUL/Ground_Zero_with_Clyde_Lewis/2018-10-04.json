Twenty one trillion dollars and rising I Know a lot of people use to care about the debt when it was Obama\nI still care about the debt total federal debt is now Twenty one trillion dollars it's rising one point two trillion dollar increase is the sixth largest debt oh well it's the sixth largest steady increases that even in the top in the entire history of the United states\nThis debt

that the switch to digital platform offers convenience but also makes consumer access more contingent on like a purchase at a bookstore a digital media transaction is continuous linking buyer and seller and giving the seller a post transaction power impossible in physical markets why is that important\nSo I I think this is important for a an a number of reasons that leads to the scenarios that we were talking about earlier where the ... of the good as the ability not only to sort of reclaim or or recall the good but they also have some ability to control\nHow and when and under what circumstances you make use of that product after the sale that's just not something that you could do in the tangible world right you or your local bookstore put aside the publisher your local bookstore can't tell you what country you're allowed to read a book and\nThey can't tell you um you know how many times you get to read it they can't tell you who you get to lend that book too and they certainly can't keep records of all of those interactions and the digital world allows for\nThat that form of control [noise] and unfortunately it's not limited just to digital media or we have all these smart devices in our homes on our bodies\nUm you know we've got our voice assistance and hour fitness trackers and you know even a home appliances and cars\nThey all have software\nThey all have network connections and all the sort of a problem is that as I've been describing are going to play out in that space is well where device makers\nAre not only going to be able to track your behavior but they're also going to be able to limit the ways in which you can use the products that you think uh we have\nPurchased so I'm Still living and let me interrupt here in and just ask you this I see when I go to iTunes I see a movie I Wanna watch it says rent\nOwn I'm not only yet I'm just renting it in a different way\nIsn't this false advertising\nI so I think there's a really good case to be made here that companies like apple\nAnd use language like oh and by\nWords that have real meaning for people in their everyday lives are missed stating that the nature of those transaction so uh my coauthor Christos ... go and I wrote a paper a few years ago a couple of years ago now I'm called what we buy when we buy now\nThat did a survey of about Fifteen hundred consumers to figure out what people think this language new and it turns out that\nA significant percentage of consumers incorrectly believe that they do have true ownership rights they get to keep these goods they can lend to them they can give them away and we think that there is an opportunity here to\nA correct this misinformation in the marketplace but think about the company that we're talking about you know apple and Amazon are to the biggest corporations that the world has ever seen and getting them to\nA\nConvincing them to not going to have a in a more clear and fair way as it is a real challenge\nClass action lawsuit\n[noise] so I think there is a possibility for class action litigation gear their their bunch of\nA legal or impractical hurdles to making that happen I think it's something worth pursuing I think the Federal Trade commission has a role to play here this is a squarely within their um\n[noise] uh within their areas of of expertise and obligation to police the market to make sure that consumers have accurate information\nParents um go ahead yeah I I just want to go ahead\n... the the way the market works depends on consumers below ... people can't make rational choices people can't decide where to spend their money if they're being misled about the products that they're getting so I think it's crucial story for the functioning of the market to who have that information be correct\nHave you done any look into what a society with out real ownership I mean we're down to you know renting clothes and everything else\nUh and that's only going to get stronger as as as we move forward have you looked into what that means for a capitalist society and for America in particular\nThat has always been about ownership\nSo remind maybe this concern here is the way this change is kind of our conception of ourselves in the way we think about ourselves as individuals in society\nOn my own property\nUh it it ... it it almost creates this uh this feeling of oh well that's just the way it is and that's the way it always is going to be it just runs that way and it stops innovation doesn't it\n[noise] I I think it has the real risk of doing that it it discourages people from being creative discourages people from um from as you say ... with the same as if they are and we had a lot of ah incredible innovations that have been made a over the centuries in this country that didn't\nCome from giant corporate hiring deeds\nApartments they came from individuals messing around with things that down in their garage and there is a risk that were for closing those kinds of opportunities but even even more broadly than that\nUm if we're discouraged from thinking of ourselves as independent actors in the world you know I worry that that creates a sort of complacency in\nUh in our in our population in our country and you know not not to zoom out a ... of a level here but for democracy to function people have to steal and they have to be\nIn charge of their own lives she asked to be invested in making informed decisions\nAnd ... that that you know this this lack of control over the every\nDay this is my play into a much broader set of problems when it comes to people feeling like active participant in society and democracy\nI couldn't agree with you I couldn't agree with you more um I\nJust don't think this is the way society is thinking anymore everything is about the collective\nAnd very little is about the individual and you know I think you understood you are under state of the case\nOf tankers I mean if you look at the inventions in America that a lot of them a lot of our progress came from what used to be called thinkers people who just did things in their own garage and and uh\nAnd now the weather's the government or these corporations every one is being told that the way it is sit down shut up you can't do anything about it and I think that's extraordinary I mean that that that\nYou know in in decades that's what\nIs that is what they don't think of things the same way that we do they don't have that that um spirit of invention that America has always been known for\nSo I I agree with you that um that the history of innovation in this country has um benefited greatly from individual creators and we and we need to keep an environment in which people have that ability to\nExperiment um to innovate and ultimately it to just share a that progress a with a with the rest of the country and the rest of the world\nI worry that we're moving in that direction where um people aren't able to build those skill sets because they lived in a world of sort of lock down digital life\nSo let me ask you one more question and I'll let you go I Know you've spent twice the amount of time here that you you probably planned on um\nThe last one more question I'm really concerned about copyrights patents trademarks we seem to be entering a world where people don't take somebody's intellectual property seriously on the on the other side of this\nUm they just feel that to well I can download it I can just take it\nAnd it should we shouldn't have intellectual property rights that that is frightening because again\nThat was the second piece of the American experiment was you have a right to that intellectual property for a period of time so you can make money on it which encourages other people to come up with their own ideas\nDo you see this why do you see this fading and is this trouble on the horizon as well\nSo I I write in each about intellectual property and it's something that I take 'em very seriously and one of the things that I always try to communicate to my students is that an intellectual property system functions best when there is a balance\nBetween the interest of the public interest\nOf creators and the history of intellectual property copyright in particular is it is a history of a struggle to find and and and that appropriate about [noise] um\nAnd I think we're we're going through and have been going through kind of since the last for adoption of the Internet a period where we're struggling with how to answer some of those questions\nAre there are certainly areas in which I'm caught freight holders have legitimate concerns about air works being exploited without compensation and on the other hand we live in a culture in which um\nCopyrighted works a sort of um\nIncreasingly being a distributed with within these environments\nLike apple and Amazon for example where consumers can't do the things that they think they're entitled or should be ranked Jewish\nSo I think that that part of the solution here is\nProviding consumers a strong incentive to pay for these works um that's one of the things that streaming services I think have gotten your grades\nAre which is that they offer a really attractive deal to consumers so people learn that if they're going to access the world's libraries music they have to\nPay for the privilege of knew that\nFiguring out how that money gets distributed and what the price point is I think is is one of the sticking point so it's it's an important set of questions and I'm One that I probably can't do justice\nBut the price plans I think is one of the sticking point Joe ... it's an important set of questions and I'm One that I probably can't do justice\nTo um you know a couple of minutes yeah All

eight hundred six to one Seventy nine nine one eight hundred things on line seven nine nine why [noise]\n[noise] ... that\nWe um uh [noise] we're talking to 'em Larry's wise or he is the president of governing accountability Institute the producer of a documentary called the creepy line the creepy line dot com um we're talking about Google\nAnd Larry I've never I've never believed in\nYou know those dystopian movies I've always made fun of them and said you know this this this is crazy you know the corporations up to get you\nBecause of their algorithms because they are so all encompassing that is the world were headed towards what do they tell you when they say algorithms\nThat we have to keep that top secret because\nYeah they what they argue is this is for reasons of of a state secret um and and you know that they need to protect their trade secrets they need to be a a you know making sure that nobody gets access to it\nThere's some truth to that but there are a lot of things that they could do to demonstrate um that they're offering a fair product in service to people and here's the thing that they have lied about this before you know ten years ago or so you had other companies like trip advisor and Yelp\nWho were saying that Google was artificially suppressing their rankings in Google in favor of Google owned companies switch okay you know Google has a right to do that but here's the thing\nGoogle flat out lied and said absolutely not we don't do that our algorithm is pure it's true the best results or ... or or organically at the top well here's the problem the Federal Trade commission the European Union\nProfessors at Harvard University looked at this and said yes you are fiddling with the algorithm you are screwing these other competitors and you're lying to the point is when Google says you can trust the algorithm you can trust us they've lied before and they're lying now and I think the only question that remains really is how are we going to deal with is\nUm you know there's old story that Henry Kissinger said when he was on the national Security Council you give a president three choices do nothing\nTake my solution or thermonuclear war those are your three choices are in this case it's kind of like that we can do nothing we can try to deal with some sort of the regulatory issues related with Google or we can break up these companies those are the three ...\nPoint of point number three 'cause this is not a monopoly like standard oil standard oil that's going to dominate the market this is controlling the news flow in the United states\nIs in the and this is in the and Peter ... controlling everything yes Google is ... the most likely company in the America but in the American world to come up with a guy yes who ever\nWho ever gets to a I first controls everything there is no way to beat it once you have a guy yes this company is the most likely in the free world to come up with it\nIf we don't have them\n... contained in some way or another when they get to a I worked hosts yes\nYes that's exactly right and here's the thing it's not just\nGoogle the company a lot of people don't realize is I didn't realize this if you use safari on your apple product you're actually using the Google algorithm and that is Google information um if you're using if you are using um Yahoo\nYou're using Google the point being Firefox is Google the all these entities are using the Google algorithm so even if you say I Am not going to use Google dot com you're using unless you are making very specific choices for other options if you using any of those others\nGoogle is the one that's dominated by the way Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year Google actually pays apple\nTo be the algorithm of choice for safari that's how much they value this information and want to dominate the space\nSo I Want to talk to 'em a little bit about um what can be done um with the algorithm or I'm\nConcerned about some things that I think are really dangerous and the platform ing and be racing voices right because Google thinks that's you know that's that's not right that's eight speech we'll get to that when we come back [noise]\nAnd more importantly I think they are ... all of it look there's that this is just at the beginning let me tell you is bouquet story [laughter] you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay\nThe center is the main city of aging how many people it used to look it up for me what do you do how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test\nThey release the guy they they uh took a guy [laughter] pick somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide\nOkay [laughter] they had a picture of the guy and the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then\nAfter like an hour or two they gave the leaves system the picture of the guy and said find him\nIn eight minutes he was in the back of a squad car unbelievable in ... minutes yes city of twenty two million yeah twenty two million amazing in eight minutes yeah so and this is without AI right this is the kind of stuff that is coming that people really need to pay attention to\nThat's right and and Google or is it the forefront of that they they take a position of pride that they are the forefront of exploiting future technologies real quick though on Gmail this is very important for people to realize that just shows you how far Google goes\nI used to have a Gmail account now what ... does is they scan every email that comes into your Gmail accounts and ... ... email you send out you know what else they scan\nIf you ever written a draft email let's say you're mad at your cousin ... and you know I'm sick of you know cousin Chris and all the crazy stuff he does and you write in late one night you write a draft and you say you know what I don't think I'm going to send that to Chris that's\nJust me being on just a second I Want to make sure this is writing a draft but that's not saving it as a draft correct It's just you ... it counts the delete delete delete delete delete delete it's not even saving it as a draft\nRight correct that's correct if scanned by Google\nSo Google knows more about you than you know you can have a very open and completely transparent relationship with anybody in your life your spouse\nYour best friend whatever Google knows more about you than they do and they are very aggressively going to retain that information but they're using it against you here's the key thing it's not just privacy is manipulation because they want to take that information and not just sell information advertisers\nThey as part of their mission wants to steer and move your life in a certain direction that they deem is the way the direction your life should go\nThere to be your choice or the documentary as the creepy line a couple of push back in a couple of things sure or at least problems I had 'cause I'm with you on Ninety percent of the\nOne issue I have is Google is awesome\nIt's all of the products that they make are better than everybody else does products that have similar ... it would eat him an incredibly inconvenience me\nTo give up Google because all of their products work better than everybody else's James doesn't know [laughter] more easier because I mean yes they're everywhere but they also do a really good job or when it comes to designing an easy to use product right how do you break away\nThat's that's a great question and it's not easy I mean there are alternatives search a systems out there\nProduct right ... that's that's a great question and it's not easy I mean there are alternatives search a systems out there um but none of them are as good as Google\nAnd it's not really that I don't know I think that's a a a road that people will go down that you shouldn't go down the what we should go down is we should be talking to the people in ... no no no\nWe should be sending people who understand this fight to Washington because by the time we talked to Washington it's already over we need people who understand the ethics of what's going on with high tech\nIn Washington because they need to have this conversation right now it's not about us changing our behavior right it's to the point we must corral Google and break them up or corral them in some way\nNot with just little litigation because I'm a ... litigation but not with just little simple laws are we going to ...\nBecause they'll go around that that fire right okay moving even one other one yeah\nYou said this earlier and it made me very uncomfortable and my suspicion is it makes you very uncomfortable to\nWhich is your solution we see we're leaning towards breaking up\nThese companies and as a capitalist as a person who does not want the government involved right or in private business\nI mean how do you how do you how to bridge that guy no I mean I I think that's a great point and I came reluctantly tennis as I looked at all the possible things to do with Google here's the problem\nIn this space the way that technology is moving how Google exerts it's market dominance it really we really do not have a free market in search\nLike it's really impossible in fact one of the guys we we interviewed a vice president of Yelp\nOr in in our in our a film a and the founder of Yelp said he wouldn't start up today because it'd be impossible Google would smother them the only reason that Yelping these other entities have survived as they have built up enough brand equity when they were founded what Fifteen Twenty years ago to where they can exist so we have a situation where\nThey're truly is not a functioning\nA monopoly and by the way Google's market dominance is partly related\nTo its political science in Washington may pass laws and rules all the time to squelch competition a veteran in Santa Fe\nAnd to do things like the platform ing yes we are not a publisher we're a platform right then they go in and they edit will now Europe publisher you're not a platform so they play it both ways and they're they have the money to do it\nYes and that's a hugely important point because when they first wanted or it set up the regulation for the Internet it was if your publisher you're treated as a media company if you're a neutral platform which is what Google and Facebook claim they are they said we're not going to any content they even use the analogy were like a telegraph\nWe're just taking a telegraph message from Peter and we're sending it to Glenn nothing else is happening well we all know that's not true now they're editing or they're censoring so they are acting as publishers but unlike other publishers they don't face the legal or regulatory burdens that they do so it's where he earned competition\nOr even the public scrutiny even the public you sound like you're crazy if you talk against Google letter editing I Know that they are frightened the would one solution be to make their algorithms transparent\nAh yes that would help but the algorithm is changing constantly and and I do get I Am sympathetic\nTo the argument that this is a trade secret that they work very very hard to develop and they have um I think by breaking them up\nInto pieces and by the way I don't think it's just two companies I think it's several different cells so bad [laughter] um I think it would be would be extremely helpful in the way to go on this because otherwise\nAnd I said alphabet [laughter] um I think it would be would be extremely helpful in the way to go on this because otherwise they're going to continue to re exert market dominance\n... the other thing I hear conservatives talk about and I find this terrifying is to make them a utility\nOh no no [laughter] terrified\nI don't know what the chilies are like here in Dallas oh no I don't [laughter] Texas we don't really have a we have to open the energy yeah oh that's so we have five different energy company as in yeah we don't pay anything yeah ... notion of\nMaking Google a public utility ... which really means you're making it a government utilities yeah now means you've got that government controlling and search no ... no interest in that whatsoever\nAnd what you are seeing is this merging of Google which used to be generally out of politics very little lobbying very little interaction when Barack Obama was elected in two thousand eight\nYou saw this enormous influx of Google people into Washington DC and they stayed so it is now one of the most plugged in if not the most plugged in corporation in America so this notion that there are kind of these wild cat or out of Silicon Valley that are like independent from government is just totally ridiculous [laughter] I could\nSpend two days with you um I really enjoyed this are you going to take a hard\nPass on that show here where I'm now by our [laughter]\nFeeders wiser he is the president of government accountability Institute the documentary is called the creepy line how

saying now that they're going to set up a vote\nOr for cabin on friday and I had predicted Saturday So up by a day I guess maybe they have the information they needed from the FBI and they're not going to tell us as I said I'm I'll be looking into that later we're not gonna talk about about tonight no but I just saw the headline they're setting up for the vote\nOn friday instead of Saturday So obviously we've got the information today\nBecause they have to have at least one full day to tell everybody was going to happen\nAnd so\nThe good thing is we haven't had anything bad happen today because of any decision but we did get the information sent by the president on the phone as I said I'm\nAs they said prepare for anything so this is what has happened basically ah I get the feeling that the FBI sent the information in it as I said they would\nAnd then they're setting up for a vote on friday and Saturday So I was wrong about Saturday or\nFriday yeah and uh I guess I'll have to look into whether or not they got the information also they found the guy\nWho actually sent the rice which they now say was basically a castor beans or be sent caster beans to the Pentagon the guy was from Logan, Utah\nAnd a ... or actually using things ... Idaho but he sent them from Logan I'm not sure so you there a lot of stuff that's come in but uh of course uh you know the ...\nYou know their redirecting everything now everything was like\nPanic the White House is under attack panic is a biological attack panic and then they turn around and said well it's now just caster beans\nSo it's not rice and its rice and beans it's a if it's ...\nWell you capture beans make rice and so yeah they got rice in it and say hey this is the way they they ...\nThey say president was attacked then they turn around and say well the president was attacked but it was with rice and beans and rice and then they say but we arrested someone who sent the rice and they they don't even know they didn't have their story straight\nBut don't have their story straight so that that this is how you know if I'm reporting something in the in the mainstream media says well nothing happened today absolutely nothing happened today um but somebody did after they arrested the guy who allegedly sent the rice and beans\nTo the president so the rest of the guy um he looks like McConnell Mitch McConnell is now setting up for the vote for cabin on friday\nThese are giving a day a couple of days for them to get ready to settle in and and come up with their ideas so obviously\nSomething came down I actually posted a last night on my Facebook page some documents when I got for the Senate Judiciary committee and they already had sent that message out yesterday that they were going to have a decision the FBI was going to the decision a day so that's why I was able to tell you but there was also a Fox News report that said otherwise\nSo it was actually said that it was going to be a report today\nSo um you know take it for what it's worth information is information but it just seems like you know right now everything is is there's like this intensity\nJust so you know putting putting you in that world for a minute because I just got this information and a lot of people who are like clamoring and calling and saying well ah what was it was something that happened when they all alarm went off the phone well no not really I was with my friend when it happened\nUm [noise]\nAnd ah and and I got mine and he got his like about a minute after me and then runs that he didn't get his so\nPeople are getting their messages but I just thought it was kind of weird and it was scary actually to have this thing loudly\nBeeping or in the car with me today and uh it was ... it was the presidential emergency broadcast that we said was going to happen but see just because it doesn't happen on the same day doesn't mean that this isn't a\nTrial run for what may happen and that's what I'm waiting for I'm waiting for the shoe to drop I I'm waiting for as I say the final blow I'm waiting for because they said on Alex Jones show I said you know it's going to be some sort of a I'm a terrorist\nOr or some sort of a a biological attack of some guy but we have the biological attack but it wasn't as much as I thought it would be\nSomething ... and it may be just a precursor to something bigger who knows maybe we'll have that discussion on that 'cause I discovered some things and as I said last night I had been writing\nThe most amazing show about [noise] what ah what was going on when NASA was going on with a ... a city search for extraterrestrial intelligence and this is putting us on the verge disappointing is right there were were on the verge close enough to be looking right at\n\nNow what's the result of this well the results of it we have a speculative culture that has developed a cargo cult of sorts with regard to aliens because of a half a century stonewalling denial so yeah the cargo culture started\n\nAnd of course everybody has a different opinion an idea of what the aliens wondering what they are from the new age to their demons to whatever and this is something that is not good because here's the deal\nWe appear to be interacting\nWith an exceptionally patient intelligence which despite its advantages over terrestrial science seems limited by a steadfast refusal to make it self widely known to everybody\nNow why is that\nWhy is it that if these aliens have any care whatsoever about us so we always say well why do they intervene why don't they come to us why don't they make themselves known on the White House to\nHouse one well there's a reason much like what we're doing with the other worlds that we explore when we go to Mars or wouldn't be sitting\nCassini out into the Julian system or when we do a number of things do we reveal ourselves\nYou reveal ourselves or do we send our robots to work for us\nWe send our robots to do the work for us unless of course we decide for you know for reasons or to show up the Russians we decided to put man on the moon\nKnowing full well there's nothing up there or maybe there is something up there we just haven't told anybody at right now so we don't know because they don't say they exclude and we include\nBut yet\nBecause they don't say they exclude and we include\n\nBut yet we still see a half a century of stonewalling with regards to this topic\n\nAnd it seems we are interacting with a patient intelligent\nExceptionally patient intelligent village extraterrestrial intelligence hinting at their existence\nWhere trickle down or graduate forms of contact and this is evidence by vi trick sightings of large UFOs bright lights you name it\n\nThe majority of Americans and a lot of people around the world believe that something is out there\nMany people have seen and identified flying objects not necessarily objects that are piloted by aliens but objects they cannot identify\n\nStrange lights and this guy triangular craft platforms\nOther things that are just phenomenal is that no one can really put their finger on\nMany will agree\nThat we are still searching for answers and they're more information is needed especially beyond NASA scope and we can also agree with the Brookings Report he is antiquated and you're either be dismissed or at least updated to include some of the more compelling findings dealing with extraterrestrial life\n\nWith the latest updates from NASA's Kepler Mission showing potentially habitable worlds screw in a cross the gallery all knows where\nIt's becoming harder and harder to assert that we were alone in the universe and if and when we do encounter intelligent life forms we don't want to communicate with them which means we'll need some ... you know basis for understanding their cognition\nWe need to learn\nLinguistic contact or we need to learn mathematics or some sort of a like like in close encounters with third time they had a special no no no no no they they have special tone\nAnd in toning would that hand crap hand class for a hand wave or you know in contact ah there were the um the strange creatures the spoken in blocks\nShe the study of biological life\nElsewhere in the solar system it's not the same as identifying anthropomorphic dealing grays or even blonde already versions of extraterrestrials we have to take into consideration that much of what\nWe speculated about extraterrestrial intelligence may not be fact\n\nLet me say that again we have to take into consideration that much of what\nWe've talked about all these years what we've been speculating about what has been exaggerated was written a spy there's been all these things concerning as to traditional intelligence it may not be fact\n\nEspecially what analysis is taking a supernatural out of the equation new analysis\n\nI mean aliens or like a supernatural phenomena for most people but now it's becoming more apparent and they're not all that supernatural\n\nSo that takes the demon out of everything is it it's not supernatural then there's no reason to believe that any spiritual overtones or even comes with the alien equation something different something we've never even thought of maybe somebody is just the obvious right in front of it I mean it's not an argument as to whether or not these [noise]\nThose will be alien equation something different something we've never even thought of maybe somebody's just obvious right in front of it I mean it's not an argument as to whether or not these beings or demons or angels it's the practical approach of deciding that perhaps they are opposed biological and we explored\nThis I'm Sorry for the concept in another show\nI mean it was um\nBecause of all can show maybe more talking about Vulcan\nNow the study is that of course we're going to wear like getting bread crumbs thrown out as oh here's a little plant here's a little time to be a planet peace plan little puzzle pieces all come in to get a little bread crumbs little things that are throwing to us\nYou know NASA throws as a bone every once in a while there was a Red Cross a red crime or a scrap of meat\nOver there we can say oh man this little scrap of meat is the best steak I've had it along it's not a steak gets a scrap of meat\nIt's got meat in it\nAnd maybe a couple of bone fragments but it's really not what we're looking for and we want a fake juicy Serling steak we want meat we're tired of drinking milk\n\nWere tired of being spoon fed\nWe want the full course meal\nWe want disclosure however the disclosure going to get is that going to be have as good as the confirmation you already have\nThinking about that\nThe new theories and the new studies and all of this\nAnd and we talked about the theory opposed by ... biological live that it may be a actually that pose biological I may be may have been responsible for the reports of alien graves had been responsible actually for a the various accounts of human abductions\nThere are so many new things that scientists of hypothesize regarding the advances being made in determining whether or not we're alone in the universe and it's too bad\nIt's too bad that there is still a huge percentage of people that are unaware of what has transpired\nIn the nearly fifty decades of denial and it's too bad that there are some people even in the UFO community those who go to these UFO conventions or do their presentation is too bad that they let their own dogma getting away with what science is saying\n\nBecause in the past science is the enemy and they may still be to a certain degree because they're not going to give you everything they're going to they're not going to give you the whole uh you know the whole whole course meal\nAnd NASA certainly if we're going to do that I mean they're like soup Nazi is no silver you they they they won't give you what you want they won't give you a soup they won't give me nuts then we'll give you a soup to nuts or nothing nothing that you can even chew on maybe a tiny\nMore solar building blocks for life for the middle of Mars but anyway we we know that going back all the way in Nineteen Seventy six we knew this\n\nAnd it was hype on Mars back in Nineteen Seventy six and ... says well uh when we kind of throw away the data no you you basically discredited the date\nAnd you'll Evan he was there going why you're describing my data when I've shown\n\nThat there was over there could be or there is now life on the planet Mars\nSo as I said\nThere are there could be oh there is now life on the planet Mars\nSo as I said no confirmation it's happened\n[noise] confirmations happen [noise] however\n[noise] with the Brookings Report hanging over our heads confirmation that has to be contained [noise] but [noise] it doesn't always have to be hard [noise] to open the containment [noise]\n\nYour belief exhibit three thirty seven hundred [noise] that's AAA thinks every three thirty seven hundred I'm
