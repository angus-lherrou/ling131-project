the corruption of scholarship part one introduction\nSomething has gone wrong in the university especially in certain fields within the humanities\nScholarship at base less upon finding truth and more upon attending to social grievances has become firmly established if not fully dominant within these fields and there are scholars increasingly but bully students administrators and other departments into adhering to their world view\nSo Dr James Lindsey a along with a couple of other friends decided you know I Would find out what this is all about well let's see what the lines are and they learned an awful lot or they learn something\nA quite valuable that you just can't get away with anything you have to fall into a a set pattern really\nDr James Lindsey a is joining us now he is a thinker he's not a philosopher but he has a thinker which I like a doctorate in math or background or in physics uh James how are you sir\nGood Glenn how are you\nHow good um so tell us what you were tell us what you were trying to do what were you trying to prove\nWell we were looking into the field to find out\nWhether or not their scholarship has gotten so kind of ideological bias that if we put forth I'm really absurd arguments or that they might be willing to publish those so long as they've salt fell in line with the political views\nBut they seem to be forwarding in place a scholarship\nSo ... that first you didn't you didn't really understand\nThe political views that they seem to be forwarding and plays a scholarship\nSo ... that first you didn't you didn't really understand the political view part right because the first few the studies that you use submitted a you've got back they were rejected\nYeah um well it's not quite that actually we I think we understood the political view but we didn't understand the need for a scholarship we started this project out and as you said we got the first several papers\nAre back rejected we started in August by Thanksgiving everyone would literally Thanksgiving a day off or we really realized we were in trouble um we weren't getting anywhere with trying to host them but the problem wasn't we didn't understand the politics so much although there's still a lot to learn there and there was for us\nTo a very complicated they call it a matrix of domination that you have to understand um but it was more that we actually we're not trying to work their scholarship and so there are two things that are needed\nTo to get these papers and one is that you actually have to understand what they call scholarship you have to do it according to their rules you you have to understand the concepts you're working with and present them ineligible eat and then you also have to navigate this\nKind of matrix of offense based rules that stand in place of what a Santa places or the academic rigor you would expect in a in a ... you know more serious field\nAnd that means cold is on its way don't be afraid that you are with that you ... minutes to get you out of the cold ... revitalize after a long day ever here you are in the winter months they had not\nBeen pulled is offering you the chance mom

published studies are a just a tremendous I mean I don't know how if you guys had beers before you came up with this or how you guys came up with these ah but they're fantastic oh let's go through some of them one by one let's start with the first one dog park\nThe or the thesis is dog parks are re rape condoning spaces tell me about ... tell me about it\nWhat kind of funny actually um I tell ya story um when I went to we we all got together to to have this come public as best we could so I went to\nPortland we all went to Portland, Oregon too I'm ready for this project to come out publicly went to the dog park on the first day I got there almost right I got off the plane I took an over next thing you know I'm walking Peters object to the dog park\nWith our filmmaker and uh we get a dog park and there's this just dogs they're living out the paper it was crazy this dog was fighting the other dog's hunting them down housing them left right and center the the owner comes over ...\nThe so he's the author or the dog gently I'll point out he wasn't being abusive and then he says stop pumping and then we get to as I lean over to the filmmaker and kind of modern I guess a little too\nLoudly maybe we should start interrogating people about their sexuality given what's going down here and then this lady yells\nOut to me oh no no it's okay she's the girl dog and I was like oh man this paper is happening for real\n[laughter] so what is what is the thesis\nSo the thesis was all the original idea behind the thesis was that we should write a feminist paper arguing that we should train and the way that we train dogs to prevent rape culture and so\nI thought that they thought it was pretty funny when I was brainstorming ideas for papers sure to Peter Peter takes his dog the dog park every day\nI'm like you said look\nOf the stuff from the dog park and as we started working and just you know absolutely absurd ideas from\nWhat might be considered the most ridiculous dog park in the world\nOr the paper grew into that and so we made it about so called queer performer pivoting in human reactions that the dog park and then ended up concluding things like the\n... we we should build a leash man likely least dogs ... to prevent rape except if not politically feasible and uh gosh\nIt would be great if we could could put shocked colors on men but that's not okay either so we have to shock them out of you know hitting on women by screaming at them to scare them and it gets them to desist from their behavior we the thesis of the paper was though that that humans\nReacted differently to gay dog hunting as opposed to stray dog hunting and men were far worse about this than women\nAnd then we concluded that this is indicative of race culture and we called the dog park rape condoning\nA St Louis then life into to nightclubs we said rate nightclubs are also right condoning spaces was no evidence for that whatsoever\nWe [laughter] um\nSo that was pretty out there um that one was was really out there I think it's I don't know maybe the one about the the feminist spiritual spirituality meetings and poetry\nIs a little more out there but it's probably close to the most\nWell LOU LOU finished the dog park this one was accepted\nAnd reviewed uh some of the reviews is a wonderful paper incredibly innovative rich and analysis extremely well written in organized a yadda yadda I Believe this ah intellectually and imperial being periodically exciting paper must be published and congratulate the author on the research done and in the\nWriter a and in the right yeah yeah\nThat was that low to the most disturbing parts of this I feel like because the ... again it wasn't like these ... these journals looked at this and didn't really go through it and kind of just ... it made its way through the process there are very specific comments from dozens\nOf reviewers who are on the ... who are doing peer review insane specific things that you wrote that are completely ridiculous are amazing new accomplishments in the field I mean that had to be wild funny and improved your point had to be really disturbing as well\nOh yeah that is by far what we consider to be the most important evidence that we gathered in the process of of this project that the papers it got published or that they got awards in some cases are one case and all of this is fine and it says a lot and it's disturbing\nBut the reviewers comments show that they use ... peer reviewers which it worked out between two and four or five or paper so we ended up with something like\nForty five or fifty total a set of comments\nThey they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they ... ...\nSet our analysis was good ones are analysis was terrible they didn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that\nUm you know the dog park paper contains a\nBit of completely irrelevant evidence about were dogs go to the bathroom and unauthorized ways as we did it and it's completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody raise an eyebrow about\nHow ridiculous that is um they were concerned\nHowever that we indicate that we're human about dogs so that we can be sure that we don't claim that when a dog there was a ... ... thing of another dog whether or not the dog they go home to want it or not because how could\nKnow that as being [noise] ... [noise] and they were really concerned as\nBut they're not the dog they go home to want it or not because how could\nWe know that as being ... and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little\nVideo we put out to announce that project they're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um [noise]\nAnd going out to what what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... what I mean you got me man\n[laughter] and then it was done in the privacy of a a veterinary office okay um let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nIs that the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport bodybuilding as a category\nIn which fat is displayed politically so that fat as just considered another to issue a equal with muscle and just say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people pat phobic as they call it\n... and that was accepted\nYeah that was expected that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity or who wrote that who we claimed that paper and he actually has a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something that I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind of this guy being the author of this paper for fat body building was just kind of all areas\nBecause that's another thing to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking would it would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean those kind of a it's a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship could stand or fall on merit not on who did it and so a lot of people are are making that point and we deliberately chosen names that would be hard to find in a Google Search in a district\nSo the all events is a really complicated I'm\nThere would be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at the University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo they decided it didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some ... some are educators primarily working and social justice\nSide or the fields topics\nCourses I guess that's the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff would take up some degree of the suggestions as\nYou know experimental but but legitimate to using the classroom and this was being submitted to the gold standard journalist wasn't some fringe of journal in education this was the gold entered feminist philosophy journal hype Asia\nThat we were working with here\nWhich is where a lot of the literature that like this already exist which we don't mind me going on a little bit this is kind of what's happening I'm we think that what's happening here is kind of in the equivalent with ideas about money laundering ... called idea laundry\nOh so they take they take these these bad idea of some of which are just opinion some of them are prejudiced some of them are genuinely terrifying like this educational thing\nAnd then they wander them through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge so you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or we base this program on studies that show well that's fine when the studies are good but when the studies\nAre coming from a place they can't tell a truth from from prejudiced and opinion it becomes a real problem\n[noise] James one or the other ones they've found um disturbing or was the uh HBO age to ... each one a nature wage\nToo was was accepted can you explain the explained this one\nYeah that pay for was accepted by high pay showed the singer and I was just mentioning that\nPaycheck away stood for hoax on hoaxes so it was a hoax paper we wrote that was about writing academic hoaxes\nThat code namely gave for convenience\nWhat they argue is that that you can only properly criticize things that go against social justice and in particular you can only use humor to make fun of or or do satire to deflate\nThat which goes against social justice if you use humor against social justice if you criticize both will do that what that means as you never really properly engaged with it therefore we don't have to consider your criticism and that's one of the huge problems going on\nOf of fields because that they don't accept criticism if you tried to criticize them they say that it's a privilege preserving epidemic pushback that a scholar named Allison bally hoos huge\nIn the education literature they say it's white fragility that's Robin to Angelo who has just had a big book published on that this year ... introduce the concept in twenty eleven which says that if\nI'm somebody with privilege in particular white people for her work uh is challenged so that their privileges putting the question that they are fragile and don't know how to deal with it because of privilege and made them weak they don't know how to psychologically deal with having that challenge and they act out in anger or grief or something like that\nAnd trying to maintain their privilege and so\nThese ideas are already getting out there who just took him to step further\nAnd didn't do it is interesting guy because the one about hope to this is interesting and that is six to criticize what you guys did they would almost half just cite your paper as that was\nThe idea yeah and it was definitely to put them in that position and I've asked ... to stand\nBy the paper that they accept it and publish in our right names they haven't responded yet but we'll see what they do I'm that way indeed people who want to criticize our project from a position of interest like an old feminist them will need to cite us in order to criticize us\n[laughter] I can we get one more to Glen ... on the you talked about some scary front at the feminist mine pumps are\nYou also did the white man my income if you did to one time and this was accepted in the white man wasn't right\nCorrect correct tell me about them\nSo I'll do though the white one first because they didn't get in it was much more frightening it was written in from the position of an auto West Nile graffiti where the researcher is reflecting on and hurt the state's her own experience\nAs a white lesbian women coming to hate her own white mass and it was rejected partly because the scholarship wasn't quite er which is the case in all of the papers but also because the position to the author as a good white\nRather than being sufficiently saw what country or whatever to critical race ... I'm so there was in there was an explicitly political reasoning behind why it was was rejected and it was that the the author as a white woman was trying to make herself look good by criticizing her own white\nWas was one of the main reason the feminist one was\nWell hold on just a second hold on just saying then that took mind the parts of mine Tom where he was talking about Jews and replace the words Jews with a with whites\nYeah in that case it was either whites are white and this and then we edited the text around it and added a whole a whole bunch of literature and rewarded things get passed plagiarism checks and things like that so yeah that was a it started with scanning through my income\nPicking out passages about the Jews in replacing juice with whites are white nests and then\nEditing around it uh this kind of just one didn't do it quite the same way the funnest one was not about it didn't take the Jews out and replace it with with men for example that actually is the chapter in my income where Hitler explains the need for the Nazi Party is chapter twelve and what its members would be expected\nTo a whole to him including especially the sacrifices that they have to make it could be Nazis and we replaced\nOur movement the party et cetera he doesn't mention Nazis specifically in that chapter or we replace that with intersection of feminism nor solidarity or allies share something to do with with the feminist movement and criticize the idea that\nUh some feminist to do\nOr ally ... something to do with with the feminist movement\nAnd criticize the idea that uh some feminists do what they call choice feminism which is the idea that if a woman is living in her own life the way she wants to end considers that to be a statement of feminism\nThan she is doing feminism that salmon is for women to have you know full agency and make their own choices in the world that's what this paper was criticizing\nSaying that no no they're responsibility if they really want to consider themselves feminists is to be to make sacrifices and stand in solidarity with other oppressed people particularly of you know women of color or women of other marginalized status as\nJames [noise] couple of quick questions um they\nDid this had to be one of those things that you entered into and hoped that you were wrong and when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later going\nGood God this is bad and my right\nTo that is exactly right so especially the ... paper I think the one that got accepted um the idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine costs of course do I mean as you are one to one thing uh\nBut the ... the politics of grievance come through I really am glad I get to talk to you about that I can\nBecause all it takes the grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic laugh as we were trying to demonstrate we called this stuff grievance studies we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided\nA politically right now I was really happy to talk to you because I mean I don't want to get in touch with you but you're a real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this whole May of ... about\nHow things were going for you under Obama's time and I thought that was huge and I was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation it's on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again [noise]\nSo our project was you know or people on the left for left liberal so I'm not ashamed to say that I Know when you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right\nAnd that's great I'm we're on the left me to take responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that\nYou know we're left wing people who want the left to come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all star I think you know people\nIn general I get a lot of sense of the people send me emails about this now all the time especially um we're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to productive politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is\nI think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media sphere as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't\n... remember you know you are an American I'm an American you're a person I'm a person we\nHave ... most of the things that we think\nIncome and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society in a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working out the details and I really hope that you know that our project kinda reaches reaches that point does that make sense", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "20"}
