through the same thing the judge Kavanaugh went through they praise him to the hilt\nAnd we've got the same thing here I could literally spend an hour on this program playing the incendiary violence statements of those on the left that the media routinely ignored\nAnd the hatred all ... the minute by minute second by second hour after hour day after day Trump hatred twenty four seven which is now that it's a it's it's a psychotic pathology on the part of those in the news media they didn't care about that either\nI'm very clear you know I don't think the Kavanaugh standard should be applied in

to outraged about that most people\nAnd now there again there's just selective moral outrage being about Russia\nOr being about sexual assault or allegations of such or about you know vitriolic rhetoric for actions I mean you have people threatening to beat up the president destroy the president bomb the White House and I didn't see the type of outrage we're now hearing from the left\nHaitian you know I think this is happening on both sides and I think there's no excuse for it you know I listen to a clip that you just played and people are hard at work or doing the same thing that we have to be and like she when I asked about the extent to which the president has also made threats and it talked about violence\nAnd out of the I asked you went in there and what you do is you give me the the predictable liberal talking point I asked you very very specifically\nAbout all of the rhetoric that has led up to where we are we've now in the last month watch woman after woman

what do you use the Jonathan\n[noise] well I'll tell you one thing uh I I I Will say that I don't think it's a mob I think it is organized gangs and that's a big difference in a mob\nA mob or people that may or may not have the same interests that gather a to do a certain thing but in this case ... these people have organization they don't just show up somewhere a ... once these people show up again and again and again that's a very important thing that we need to look at um\n[noise] uh it is to the the way the conversation is going over the past couple of days though\nI I Want Sean I think everybody needs a ... one thing or all that rhetoric that you played at the beginning of this was very specific about violence very specific about\nWho to target and when I look at it at the response which you had which are seen from other people are when bronco bomber was an office\nI'm In the case of the shooter that shot to\nUm the Mr squeeze 'em what you saw where people not blaming Bernie Sanders but what you see here and I find that is so hard is that uh these devices have been put out there that somebody went\nThe distance to to put these things together to ah to carry out a plan\nBut he's all at once and none of them went off and immediately the rhetoric starts in a way that is organized and now I'm not saying they have something to do with whoever put these out there but the organization of the rhetoric is so\nDisgusting to lead a low on the political chain that it it does make one pause and asked um was this rhetoric prepared\nIt's a it's a very alarming thing\nWas that I got Daniel [noise] you know I just I just want to make it really clear I'm not blaming the president's today I think that there is plain state line across the entire political state\nTrend and what I think regular people like me see if I go out and said well I deal with people who I don't ... I get my job's done I said I I ... hot and somehow I can manage to get around the world around this country to get around my city\nI without inflaming tensions are the people around me and I just don't understand what is wrong with politicians that I cannot get their job is done without the kind of rhetoric\nJonathan the way I look at it as this is now gone on two years of vitriol hatred lies conspiracy theories on a level we've never seen before\nAnd what's worse is you know when the president says the fake news a lot of it has been fake news it's not even news all of his political commentary clogged up as news and it's not news at all there are these are not news channels these are opinion channels\nYou know I don't see much real reporting from fake news CNN or or even NBC ABC or CBS anymore they're all run by liberal activists George Stephanopoulos has an agenda\nHe's a he's been Clinton drew in through his entire life and he hasn't changed one bit\nAnd it's not any different on CBS or NBC or any of the two cable channels and you know it's interesting I say I'm a talk show host part of my job is to give opinion but I also report straight news we do investigative reporting we've been doing it\nFor example but we've added Obama when no one else would we've invented the deep state more deeply than anybody else in the media\nAnd so that's part of what we do giving opinion is part of what we do well like the whole newspaper they say they're only the news part of the newspaper but they're really the opinion part\nYou know Sean I I've been on your TV show on the radio show I've been around you for five years now\nAnd one thing that I can truly say whether it be you or anybody else on Fox News and and a lot of these other networks out there is that when when something like this happens\nAnd all these Democrats are having these devices delivered to them you're not going to see what else on NBC today where they have the the ah down below where they have the headline or below the reporter and it says that Trump opposition is getting devices delivered to their to their addresses Trump proposition\nThat that's the way that they're they're playing this other automatically putting suspect on Trump just by the way that they are labeled the lower half of the screen I mean it it is it's it's it's such political\nUm this tasteful rhetoric\nThat when you couple that with the things like Madonna said with the things that are these politicians are are instigating people to go out and carry out these things Trump never it never has said anything that inflammatory and by and large\nThe reason his words or so or inflamed is not because of him it's because of CNN and MSNBC and these leftist politician that go out and pump it\nIt could be we're gonna have to leave it there uh Jonathon Gillum author of sheep no more thank you Danielle\nMcLaughlin attorney a and a soon to be\nA mom for I Believe the second time if I'm not mistaken and uh and two weeks so we'll give you a few weeks off and we look forward to seeing pictures of their baby will put them up on the website when the baby comes I think maybe the baby is going to be born on election day let's hope it's a good day for Republicans\nAnthony O'Neill these folks are America's leading experts in money leadership personal development career parenting in marriage take back the key areas of your life\nGet our brand new Ramsey smart conference on DVD and scream it on the go and the online storage Dave Ramsey dot com\nYou will you be CGI toward you see just receiving the roar of the ...\nBefore I point five\nEffect in ...

appears to be the media talking point for the hour for the day here\nUm you know if you expose somebody is being absolutely insane you you know it doesn't matter what their politics are managed that we keep America safe\nYou know when I when I go out there and say I'm not going to go ... into the silly ridiculous road of saying well because that guy like Bernie Sanders any shot up Republicans on a ball field the Bernie must support that I said just the opposite is true\nYou know it is beyond reckless and irresponsible for CNN and all of them to ignore the rhetoric of De Niro and Madonna I think an awful lot about blowing up the White House they called the president twenty four seven on that network a liar\nHis name is over at fake news CNN well deniro is not like the others what Robert De Niro about what I found is Sean Hannity was do we just heard deniro\nAnd what the narrow was saying about the president our president De Niro saying that he wants to punch the president in the face that they do any research over there you know over a fake news CNN any at all\nYou see a pattern between the president's attacks on Twitter in and stage being echoed an amplified by Fox News why Robert Deniro Sean Hannity October Fifteen that old segment blasting deniro\nOh so that's why he got a package from this lunatic bomber because he must have heard Sean Hannity playing the narrows own words calling the president of punk a dog a pig a con a BS artist a mutt and saying that he wants to punch him out\nI Want to punch them in the face\nI'm not going to stop calling pointing out the calls for violence against the president that frankly is the right thing to do why didn't he joined me is a question he needs to answer\nAs the red light just like CNN with the mobs we've been witnessing you can't even say the word mob when you watch women and children being run out of restaurants it's been conservatives that have been saying this got this has gotta stop\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out of restaurants by a mob how you're not going to use the word however it's totally a mob it is without a doubt that we're now it's up to put a stop that his mom but they have\nEver felt that by ... we already did that\nWere already said they weren't mobs no it's not my writing for people who are in their hand out the way the ... the way the country's going and the policy there was no matter who is before you jump and\n[noise]\nThe same deniro who's screaming F Trump at the Tony Awards so blatantly stupid up punk good dog they'll pay good con artist to be I saw it as a mutt\nDestroyed Trump media completely ignoring what is the lesson file calls for violence on numerous occasions now going on for two years like you know fantasizing about blowing up the White House I Dream an awful lot about blowing it up I'm not going to stop calling pointing out calls for\nAgainst the president imagine these words used by any conservative during the Obama years or the Clinton years\nWell like I Am you deplore violence of any kind we can set a lot of political differences at the ballot box eleven days\nAnd when you call out fake news for what it is that is not in any way so I Need to be clear for stupid people\nThat want to purposely misinterpret words of people when you call them out for having an agenda for being fake and phony and fraudulent that is just telling the truth that they don't wanna hear\nOr when you point out that they spent basically every second of every minute of every hour of every day demonizing a president trying to de legitimize duly elected president when people say that they care about the truth first and they say they really want to get to the bottom of Trump Russia collusion\nAnd Russia collusion at all or Russian influence at all and totally and completely and utterly ignore\nThe candidate of their choice obvious choice buying Russian lies disseminating those lies to the American people in the lead up to an election\nThat that's that's not news that is strong opinion and that is it's not even opinion all it is is propaganda and misinformation\nYou know I don't but with that said\nI'm the one that was saying and the Obama years protect the Obamas protect the president protect the first family protect all politicians\nWe saw what happened in the Kavanaugh hearings I didn't see many Democrats on any of these fake news network saying that uh we need to stop spending it senators we need to allow senators to walk the halls freely without being accosted\nI even said that it might be a good idea that we would clear the halls of the house and Senate but those things are too hot and I don't want to see anybody hurt or worse\nYou know but when you have fake news people desperate to get any attention in any ratings they politicized only those things that they think ... benefits their political side\nI guess it would have been easy after Steve skull east we shot and the shooting took place in the softball field for me to say well that guy is a Bernie supporter Bernie Sanders encourage this he's the one responsible\nBut if I did that it would be dishonest as they are you blame the people themselves they're responsible for their own behavior in actions now with that said I'm not telling anybody ever again in anybody's face\nAnd create a crowd and to you know go after people and get them tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore with the crowd\nAnd I've been the one saying that what's happening with secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz\nA Henry Kissinger Mitch McConnell and now Kevin McCarthy has got to end because it's not going to end well if we don't stop this liberal confrontation and based on the orders of people like Maxine Waters Cory Booker and over the years years gone by even Obama himself\nYou know we've watched all of this happened we've observed it and I've been saying ... everybody to come down Hillary's calls for instability oh now ... now she's calling for civility after the shooting after the pipe bombs have been delivered Eric Holder a week ago saying that kick up\nYou know what we're listening to Andrew Cuomo yesterday you would think you know he joined became the pope calling for peace and stability and e pluribus own them and the same guy that said if if you're pro life than you believe an assault\nWeapons and I say there's not enough to have you on\nA wanted in New York because you're not a real New Yorker now he's talking about peace and togetherness want to tell you something because this this it doesn't\nCrazy like the burning guy was crazy you can explain wherever this guy is and apparently there's the Yahoo News report saying that he was not\nOn the one hand loving hating Trump at the same time\nLunatics have no political boundaries you know the guy don't hold Al Gore responsible for the Unabomber because he had earth in the balance and has that little ... that he built out in the wilderness or the shooter as Steve squeezed blaming Bernie Sanders\nTo suggest any way that honest a vigorous debate and criticism\nIs the motivating force behind one fringe violent individual\nLet me tell you what that is that is intellectual laziness\nAnd a cheap attempt frankly to capitalize off a dangerous and serious incident especially in light of the fact while others on TV have been utterly silent their silence has been deafening I haven't been the ones saying something horrible is going to happen it needs to stop\nYou know if you say CNN sucks or CNN is fake news that is not to cry or an ad vacation of violence in any way shape or form it's a feeling people have when they see a few abusive lean bias news coverage\nIf you're American whether sold is should transcend politics\nI deplore all violence of any kind but legitimate fair criticism of me that's fair game media criticism is fair game\nCalling out networks that have political agendas that's fair game when network spend every second minute an hour of the day hating on Donald Trump Donald Trump cured cancer they still hate him well I'm allowed to call that out that's not hate if there's any hate their it's their hatred of the president that they can't seem to get over\nYou know the bottom line is\nYou're watching people trying to make an attempt to exploit and politicize the actions of one unhinged lunatic and conflated with fair and wanted criticism and that for them as they're putting politics above all else and that's wrong for the country\nAnd anybody that has intimidated into stopping what they do because of this predictable attack I put it all up on Hannity dot com\nAnd it's called the less new low Hannity slams the media's total failure to report liberal calls for violence yeah we've got it all chronicled with all we we put the tape and everything you need to one place\nAnd we're going to tweet that we're going to send that out to everybody where Lebanon days away from election day and there's a lot at stake\nRight now Republicans you know what they're behind I think in Florida that means Rick Scott's behind that means the Santa is behind there's a lot at stake in Florida goes to Gillum in terms of governing the state of Florida it will be a disaster that was my prediction\nIt doesn't help that many have been displaced in the panhandle a very conservative part of Florida and I hope those people are able to get back and enabled to vote before the election but I can tell you a Marsha Blackburn can and should win in Tennessee if everybody goes out and vote\nAnd I think the Missouri can be flipped easily now that we know that Claire McCaskill just like Phil Bredesen in Tennessee has been lying through AT T about who she really is she's talking about you know crazy Democrats ... votes left on everything so I guess she's counting herself in that group\nRecovering from mental and substance use disorder is real it happens every day you can recover discover home

establishment he beat the national establishment he's there he's not\nHe's not only draining the swamp but he's a threat to their very existence so it's going to happen is the presidential race is going to start right after the election on November such where the Democrats are going to put up a big field of people who are going to be all at the president and if they get the house and Nancy

I've traveled to fifty or Seventy five businesses I have yet to meet one that has a priest us for tax reform and they're saying we're actually these tax cuts are we're re investing\nEvery one of them is giving a race to their employees or a bonus or both we're finally seeing a glimmer of hope we roll back on necessary regulation\nOr we could really open up the ... the southern chaired a responsible gas drilling a Governor Cuomo votes will not let it happen my opponent repeatedly thoughts you against that and this is how scary my opponent is getting a debate last night he ever voted four times\nFor government takeover\nOf our health care which is single payer which would cost the taxpayers of New York this was bragged about by the socialist leaning guy who's just sponsored the bill will only cost the taxpayers of New York Ninety to ... billion in New taxes on an annual basis\nIt when it's all hard [laughter] that's it I Do believe Ninety two billion when we're already take half your money anyway a credit or any dollar\n... this is a solution not voted four times for late term abortion this isn't a moderate you this is a radical you this is a guy who is trying to pretend he is a support the president he's not going to support the president\nGoing to support Nancy Pelosi is going to support the impeachment cock his he's going to chime right in with all these Democrats you never shown any effect on he's never stood up to Sheldon Silver in fact he was picked by Sheldon Silver for the job to get in the assembly now we can't take by Chuck Schumer\nWho brags about it and Andrew Cuomo funny not a fan of come to the district to help him get elected but she came to our district President Trump the first time in my home city of Utica New York in ... years we had a sitting president ...\nWell you also had his son Eric I'm there and his daughter Ivanka there they recognize the importance of your race and that's why a mum having you on those and the only thing I can say is to the the people up in the ... area in northern New York in that area you this was a district that you can win it's plus a Republican\nAnd you have about thirty thousand more Republicans and Democrats in the district so you have a political edge there the key is to get the vote out because otherwise you're going to end up with a Nancy Pelosi Democrat Nancy Pelosi as speaker and that's going to be a disaster for New York I can promise you\nYeah absolutely and by the way they are raising incredible amounts of money has been talking to my colleagues all across the country the amount of money they're jumping into these racist to try to deceive voters Israeli it's outrageous to me and my opponent is star outspending may I've always been a very independent Republican I'm One of the top conservatives in New York uh when I served\nIt's outrageous my opponent is star outspending may I've always been a very independent Republican and one of the top preservatives that New York uh when I served in the assembly and still you know one of the conservatives\nBut we have got to continue to stand up for our values and be able to read these elections to fight the fight because we've got a ticket for Washington we've got to support the president's policies which are creating unprecedented gangs even upstate New York where we have a really tough economy I mean we are actually helping or small business community are small business humidity\nIt's about Ninety eight percent of my life to visit says in my region and they create most of the jobs that just didn't help is alive by Nancy Pelosi that somehow the wealthiest said the only one fan of fitting it's absolutely false we brought it to make the tax cuts permanent and the reason Governor Cuomo is suing the federal government over the tax cuts\nIt's because he has received honors wanna leave New York because they're not getting a lifeline that they used to get there actually paying more it's all a lie coming from that side and we've got to fight that says this is a tough battle because\nThe Democrats have the money to deceive voters are full of meant to think even if this guy is somehow a moderate he's not and I encourage everyone to support us get to vote at its most important if we can beat the wall with money but we need a Republican voters to understand that a ticket out oh it's really really poor\nAlright uh Claudia Tenney are running in New York and unimportant seat this will tip the balance of power one of our thirty seats we've identified on Hannity dot com ... the main\nYou know ground zero seeds that will do that will literally tip the balance of power so Claudia we wish you the best things for being with us and hopefully we'll send in your back to Congress and eleven\nDays you deserve it and New York deserves that we don't have many good New York politicians at all\nUm by the way just going back to direct or re what he said earlier today a they have confirmed that these Thirteen bombs were in fact real and that in fact they've been able to identify at least some forensic evidence including fingerprints\nWhich which to directly connected to the person that was arrested earlier today a little more about that as the day unfolds here uh let's get to our phones as we say Hi to Danny as in Austin, Texas Danny Hi how are you glad you called sir\nYes listening to you a lot and I have not been any political sense whatsoever but these mid terms are um believe me important\nTo get out and vote a this and you hit on it every day I listen to it and not watch it or not but I have I'm\nListening I Hope everyone feels the same way you do\nThis for a hundred and thirty five members of Congress every seat is important ... vote for a Democrat you're voting for policy you stay home that's a half a vote for ... in the Senate if you stay home I have a vote for sure if you don't vote for the Republican then you're basically voting for sure I mean it's really not that simple and we'll get the government we deserve\nI've been at this game a long time of had a lot of victories I kind of loved when we shot the world in the media you know I see three scenarios that could unfold\nBut I had to say the more likely scenario based on my full objective analysis it would be a split decision whether Republicans pick up houses or pick up seats in the Senate and maybe lose the house of representatives but the house of representatives as well within our power to win\nIf people identified the thirty districts we've identified on Hannity dot com and people take it seriously and get out and vote\nI mean if every Trump voter wants the success of the last two years to continue and goes to vote Republican in eleven days then that means we'll keep the house will pick up seats in the Senate and things will be a lot easier in the work will be getting done faster\nIf we don't do that then you know we get the government we deserve\nSenate and things will be a lot easier in the work will be getting done faster\nIf we don't do that then you know we get the government we deserve\nYou know I've had many ups and downs following political races in the course of my career wasn't exactly happy the two nights that Obama won\nI especially thought he could have been defeated in twenty twelve alright it didn't happen\nAnd you do everything it can to stop the agenda on their side I'm prepared for whatever Nancy Pelosi an Adam Schiff Jerrold Nadler and Maxine Waters want to do to the country and we're not going to go away we're not gonna cry we're not going to be the cry babies like they've been for the last two years\nAnd when they try to do things that are detrimental to the country and the president and they want to enlist investigations were going to be there\nAs a backstop to tell the American people the truth\nAnd then some of you will probably regret that you didn't get out and vote this election season so don't wait until I'm telling you what's going to happen we know they only want Obamacare we know they want to open borders they don't want to fund the wall they believe in open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nWe know they want their crumbs back we know they want higher taxes we know they you know they don't they don't really ... they're all things hating Trump all the time\nNot exactly in the best interest of the country to keep focused on that for two years but we'll do our best\nYou know or we can win at all or we can lose it all listen to\nAll of us here on the Sean Hannity show we love the dollar shave club dot com
