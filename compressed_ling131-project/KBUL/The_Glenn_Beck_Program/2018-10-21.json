[noise]\nWell it would be great if it was twenty eight teams played the ... election by the numbers here we are twenty Eighteen in mid term election and what are the numbers look likes\nTo uh depending on what you're looking at a you can find a lot of good and a lot of bad if you happen to be a Republican\nOr ... or rooting for conservatives to to have a chance here to pass anything I'm obviously you need both to really have a good chance of passing anything and as we've seen over the past uh the past couple years even that is no guarantee you have to get anything done um but\nUh what you're seeing now is really good polling or for the GOP in the Senate a lot of these races that were close have moved to ...\nThese races that were close have moved to geo peas direction\nUm to get to fifty ... is which is what they need of course to have control with Mike Pence was the deciding vote you need to have a a there is about ten races there um and they've knocked out most of it's not just the ones that lean in their category get them get them to fifty there's an additional seven tossup races where they could get all the way up to fifty seven if they were to switch those\nUm you know maybe even outside shot at something dramatic maybe even getting to fifty eight\nMost likely you're probably in that area of fifty three fifty four right now which is an improvement over the current situation in the Senate but if they lose the house that doesn't mean is it yeah and you know it doesn't mean it means something but it doesn't mean on a heck of a lot 'cause you're not gonna be able to pass anything 'cause you know the house is going to go the other way and houses where it looks real things look very bad\nFor Republicans um it's interesting the way that they're looking at this is not whether he usually it's like we'll we'll ever will the party loser gains seats right that's the way we usually typically look at these things and then there's the control angle as well who will control the house\nPull even notice you haven't heard a lot of talk about whether Republicans\nWill will didn't gain any seats floods because it looks like it's not even possible at this point in fact um the the polling models that they have working right now uh five thirty eight has one which they have um the ... the chance of Republicans can maintain their current amount of seats at less than zero point one percent\nThat you might say oh well they've gotten you know there was issues with standing at Trump right which is a big thing every time I talked about polls were like oh well they didn't get Trump right well first of all the national polls are almost exactly dead on for Donald Trump or it just didn't get the ah electoral college right but that also wasn't what they were polling and right and some of the states were were obviously wrong\nBut for example uh five thirty I Believe had about thirty percent chance that they thought Donald Trump or when they're saying there was a point one percent less than a point one percent chance that the Republicans will maintain the same amount of houses a seats in the house\nIn fact they are saying the equal chance that Republicans maintain the same amount of seats as Democrats gaining eighty three seats\nNow both of those are ... dream outliers right like I don't think either one of those is going to happen right but the chances of of of the of the Democrats just controlling the houses are about eighty percent\nAgain more certain if you want to use those words are are more probable is the right way to say it than Donald Trump or being elected or are\nA law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff\nStarted reading

decision not to intervene how how\nCan you how can you support that decision I don't I mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any worse\nHe's trying to make it sound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream\nOur police can do no right but they act and they're just thugs they don't act and their do nothing's\nSo they have no way to win a great

supposed to\nActually have an idea and do something in which I think he did by the way I think you're right what did you were not a big ... me right when you say for public consumption that is exactly what he's doing yes his his opinion is oh jeez where we're damned if we do damned if we don't but in reality what he wants is a is much more on this side but yeah the ... more on the side\nAnd you can back that up with how he reacted to the FBI\nThe FBI building in Portland is ... is under siege for ... to ... I mean think of the balls on these guys\nThey take the FBI building and block it off so FBI agents are are now trapped inside the building they call for police police say a we've got a call the mayor\nWhy\nI'm calling you dispatch police we have to call the mayor the mayor goes out and says if the FBI thinks that this\nCity is going to back them up there in the wrong city\n... excuse me what what ...\nSo the FBI had to get federal officers to come in and get everybody out of that building and into safety\nSounded nothing Portland did nothing to these guys that I mean whoa what is this\nIt's a I mean it's it's close to anarchy right it's certainly the way that that you think it would come if it does it say you know the idea that you the FBI can't depend on police officer forget the FBI just these are people are these are actual real individuals who are in danger or and\nWas a woman who has the food carts across the street from the FBI um she was a a threatened\nBut I think they've had to move out of the city or in your family um they took her stuff destroyed it or threaten the neighbors who are coming down trying to you know stick up for I mean they're just that they've become animals they become animals and their claim these are they're streets\nNo they're not they're not punk have you paid for them\nBecause I think a lot of the people who are trying to make it to work are the ones who actually paid for it your streets since when but read enough history usually people are who are um\nYou know national socialists or Marxist radicals of some sort they were in power and they let this they let this stuff go until the people have had enough and then they\nDo what they want with those people and they you know\nUse those people as cover to seize even more power that's the way it works on a national scale I have no idea what this Portland mayor is doing\nBut it's insane meanwhile Alex ...

fun way of looking at the electorate can be a little different than what you are to get from cold there for example you think you have you had a different way different lens might be a little\nI become desperate to hold on to something I thought I might be losing and I thought I had to do something special to keep it\nI started doing things out of my comfort zone like presenting and the truth is\nIt had been a while since I had been having fun it started I started to worry about ticket sales for my tours what the critics said what the perception of bite me might be I felt like I was living with this over my face and near a and the reality I was seeing was old blurred by it\nI decided I never wanted to read my name and print again never read a review and I never have I decided I'd never use social media again and I never have but the diagnosis made me realize how stupid I had been to worry about all of these unimportant things I was embarrassed by my ego\n[noise] I was embarrassed that has allowed this in security\nI realize that for many years I couldn't believe I was on the same stage as my heroes I couldn't believe I was looking cross somebody like Paul McCartney and saying things like it's hard to get here but my God it's harder to stay here\nThan I woke up and sought after ten years of trying to get here in five years of being scared that it would go away I think I can enjoy it\nAfter his son's illness he says I just don't have the stomach for it anymore the celebrity narcissism it started I started to crumble but then I started to wonder why I wanted to do it in the first place\nI had forgotten that it was all about souls connecting because I'd become so anxious there were people in my business life saying if you hadn't done this or that if you've written a better song tickets might be selling quicker I started to take all\nAnd wanted to take any responsibility is just so much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was ... insecure enough already I Would digested and say it's my fault time rubbish it affected me and I started to think it's all going to go I'm going to lose everything\nIt is\nFascinating to read these things from him because what I've always felt about Mike who play was she was just having fun\nHe was just living a dream and I wondered and I never spotted and him I just wondered\nIf it was ever going to get old to him because what makes him I think the best performer I've ever seen on stage is that joy he just has a joy of performance and it is it is so infectious\nYeah he loves it I mean you can tell when you see 'em live you can tell he just absolutely loves doing it or at least did at one point um but they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports that he's actually thinking about stopping it\nCompletely he says I was learning with passion that I was afraid I'd become a mere poor photo copy of my heroes\nBut when I come back from this terrible time I realized I'm not a mere photocopy I've learned everything I can from them taking it found my own soul my own voice my own style and now know critic can take that away\nIt needed clarifying now I've just seen the music I Love maybe when you let go that's when it comes back to you it's a lot like love\nHe is um he he I think he's joking about he's because he says I miss the guys in my band so when my wife had to go back to Argentina I said to the guys come on over to the house let's have a drink order some pizza place in video games and jam\nThey came over we partied and I said let's play some music and I thought wow this is fun it was then that I realized I missed making music I didn't even know I missed it that was about a year ago so why would he possibly be saying that he is now\nIt seems like it might be one of those situations where the Internet has taken a somewhat a sarcastic comment and turn it into reality has is most people are coming out today and saying that he's not actually going to retire because he's in the middle of a tour in a book or their album released and all that other stuff\nSo here's what he ... here's what he says exactly to the reporter\nHe pauses there are three reasons I wanted to do this album one because I felt a debt of gratitude to deeper than I can explain to the millions of people all over the world who prayed for us and showed us compassion that gave me faith in humanity to because I Love music and I feel I can continue the legacy of my idols\nAnd three because of the world was ending not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe breakup\nThere's never a better time for music then he suddenly stops quote this is my last interview he says quite solemnly\nI'm retiring from the business of made the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top end quote [laughter]\nSomehow though the writer says I don't think he really means it\nIt's unbelievable because you know that it was put all over the media as if he was retiring well he said it was his last interview he got other interviews scheduled\nRight like he's had a whole press tour for this album is just silly and most important thing though is is looking at that and saying that is really the type of thing that ... that changes your perspective completely right you go through something like that and you stop and you examine all the nonsensical idiocy that you you participate in everyday\nYou don't want to have to go through that to do it but sometimes it's the only thing that makes you kind of re prioritize the things you're doing in your life\nOr and she seems to have I mean he he's making thirty five million dollars a year if he's out there right touring and stuff and he's able to walk away from that\nUm because he just wants to spend time with his son how many times you hear those excuses I'm quitting I Would have had more time with my family that was completely real guy yeah it's nice to see somebody who actually you know kind of nice to see\nThat he he got through it and has made it into a good thing\nYou know I have I have\n... probably more respect for Michael boo play than any other professional that I ever met in the entertainment industry\nBecause he has found a way to keep his feet on the ground and he was afraid I mean when everybody when everyone it was very popular to hate me\nShe didn't I mean it's always a popular hate you I Know but he but he would and he was never taking a stand for me he just wouldn't\nHe just didn't understand and he's like look I'm I'm not in politics I'm Canadian why do I care and then you get out of it but then again a fight about yeah he said the guy turned around and said okay\nI Believe you look back and he's like I'm Canadian I don't vote what do you what does it matter what does it matter to you and the guy's real posh and he said I drew punches back and he's got to do it I got into a hockey fight [laughter] you got to do a hockey fight [laughter]\nI Am so happy to hear that his ah family is um is doing better and his son has made this miraculous turn and\nAh Michael ... you've given enough if you want to give more we will certainly

the let's see seven ten ten of these that you're following or ten altogether okay out an altogether okay so let's take on one real quick\nBegin very good when we came here we go this is called the ... the er the search suggestion effect when you start to type a search term into\nThe Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you typed so if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon\nRight away they'll start slashing suggestions at you and Amazon it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that they are flashing asked you to turn a fifty fifty vote among\nA fifty fifty split among undecided\nVoters into in Ninety ten split with all my one having any idea they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my

studies and the corruption of scholarship partway introduction\nSomething has gone wrong in the university especially in certain fields within the humanities\nScholarship at base less up on finding truth and more upon attending to social grievances has become firmly established if not fully dominant within these fields and there are scholars increasingly but bully students administrators and other departments into adhering to their world view\nSo Dr James Lindsey a along with a couple of other friends decided you know I let's find out what this is all about let's see what the lines are and they learned an awful lot um they learn something\nAh quite valuable that you just can't get away with anything you have to fall into a a set pattern really\nDr James Lindsey a is joining us now he is a thinker he's not a philosopher but he is a thinker which I like a doctorate in math a background in physics uh James how are you sir\nGood going our you\nHave good um so tell us what you were tell us what you were trying to do what were you trying to prove\nWell we were looking into these fields to find out\nWhether or not their scholarship has gotten so kind of ideological bias\nThat if we put forth I'm really absurd arguments or that they might you be willing to publish though so long as they've solved fell in line with the political views that they seem to be forwarding and plays a scholarship\nSo that first you didn't you didn't really understand the political view part right because the first few the studies that you've you submitted a you got back they were rejected\nYeah um well it's not quite that actually we I think we understood the political view but we didn't understand the need for a scholarship we started this project out and as you said we got the first several papers\nAre back rejected we started in August by Thanksgiving everyone and literally Thanksgiving a day of are we really realized we were in trouble um we weren't getting anywhere with trying to hope that the problem wasn't we didn't understand the politics so much although there's still a lot\nTo learn there and there was for us to a very complicated they call it a matrix of domination that you

he's [noise]\nThese now published studies are a just a tremendous I mean I don't know how if you guys had years before you came up with this or how you guys came up with these ah but they're fantastic oh let's go through some of them one by one let's start with the first one dog\nPark the ah the thesis is dog parks are re rape condoning spaces tell me ... tell me about it\nWas kind of funny actually um I tell ya story um when I went to we we all got together to to have this come public as best we could so I went to Portland we all went to Portland, Oregon\nToo I'm ready for this project to come out publicly went to the dog park on the first day I got there almost right I got off the plane I took it over next thing you know I'm walking\nPeter resolved after the dog park with our filmmaker and uh we get to the dog park and there's this just dog there that's living out the paper it was crazy this dog was fighting the other dog's hunting them down housing them left right and center the the owner comes over swing the swings the ball thrower at the dog gently I'll\nPoint out he wasn't being abusive and then he says stop hunting and then we get to as a lean over to the filmmaker and kind of murder I guess a little too loudly and maybe we should start interrogating people about their sexuality given money is going down here and then this lady yells out\nTo me oh no no it's okay she's the girl dog and I was like oh man this papers happening for real\n[laughter]\nSo what is what is the thesis\nSo the thesis was all the original idea behind the thesis was that we should write a feminist paper arguing that we should train ... and the way that we train dogs to prevent rape culture\nAnd so I thought that they thought it was pretty funny when I was brainstorming ideas for papers sure to Peter Peter takes his dog the dog park every day I'm ... said let's work in some of the stuff from the dog park and as we started working in just you know absolutely absurd ideas from\nWhat might be considered the most ridiculous dog park in the world\nOr the paper grew into that and so we made it about so called queer perform a pivotal in human reactions at the park and then ended up concluding things like the ... we we should be able to lease man released dogs ... to prevent rape except if not politically feasible\nAnd uh gosh it would be great if we could could put shocked colors on men\nBut that's not okay either so we have to shock them out of you know hitting on women by screaming at them to scare them and get them to desist from their behavior\nSo the paper was though that that humans ... reacted differently to gauge dog hunting as opposed to stray dog hunting and men were far worse about this than women and then we concluded that this is indicative of race\nCulture and we called the dog park rape condoning a St Louis and lie to nightclubs we said rate nightclubs are also rape condoning spaces was no evidence for that whatsoever\n[noise] um\nSo that was pretty out there um that one was was really out there I think it's I don't know maybe the one about the the feminist spirit\nTrot spirituality meetings and poetry is a little more out there but\nIt's probably close to the most\nWell LOU LOU finished the dog park this one was accepted\nAnd reviewed uh some of the reviews is a wonderful paper incredibly innovative rich and analysis extremely well written in organized a yadda yadda I Believe this ah intellectually and imperial ... exciting paper must be published and congratulated the author on the research done\nAnd in the writer a and in the right yeah yeah\nThat was a load of the most disturbing parts of this I feel like because the ... again it wasn't like these ... these journals looked at this and didn't really go through it and kind of just ... it made its way through the process there are very specific comments from dozens\nOf reviewers who are on the ... who are doing peer review insane specific things that you wrote that are completely ridiculous are amazing new accomplishments in the field I mean that had to be wild funny and improved your point had to be really disturbing as well\nOh yeah that is by far what we consider to be the most important evidence that we gathered in the process of of this project that the papers got published or that they got awards in some cases are one case and all of this is fine and it says a lot in his disturbing\nBut the reviewers comments show that these were peer reviewers which really worked out between two and four or five or paper so we ended up with something like\nForty five or fifty total a set of comments\nThey they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they ... ...\nSet our analysis was good winter analysis was terrible they didn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that\nUm you know the dog park paper contains a bit of\nCompletely irrelevant evidence about were dogs go to the bathroom and unauthorized ways as we've ordered it and it's completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody raised an eyebrow about\nHow ridiculous that is um they were concerned however that we\nIndicates that where humans not dogs so that we can be sure that we don't claim that when a dog there\nWas a ... ... thing of another dog whether or not the dog they go home to want\nIt or not because how could we know that as being [noise] and ... and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little\nVideo we put out to announce the project they're really concerned with the fact that we respect that dogs privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um\n[noise] and going out and our NATO [laughter] so what what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... what I mean\nYou got me man\n[laughter] and then it was done in the privacy of a of a veterinary office ice [laughter] okay\nUm let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nAre the the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which fat is displayed politically\nAnother to issue a equal with muscle\nAnd to say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people pet phobic as they call it ... and that was accepted\nYeah that was expected that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use those identity who wrote that reclaimed grow the paper and he actually is a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind to this guy being the author of this paper fat body building was just kind of a Larry\n[laughter] because that's another thing to do a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean it some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking would it would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean those kind of a those are the tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship should stand or fall on merit not on who did it and so a lot of people are are making that point and we deliberately chose names that would be hard to find in a Google Search in a district\nWhich was very common names on purpose I actually used\nA a a roll dice to pick up ... off of a list of\nMean to the university system would would [noise] what's that mean\nSo the all events is a really complicated I'm\nThere will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at the University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo they decided it didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working and social justice\nSide or the fields topics courses I guess that's the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff would take up some degree of the suggestions as\nYou know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to the gold standard journal this wasn't some fringe of journal in education this was the gold entered feminist philosophy journal ... that we were working with here\nWhich is where a lot of the literature that like this already exists which we don't mind me going on a little bit this is kind of what's happening I'm we think that what's happening here is kind of in the equivalent with ideas of money laundering called idea laundry\nOh so they take they take these these bad ideas some of which are just opinion some of them are prejudice some of them are genuinely terrifying like this educational thing\nAnd then they launder them through the academic process then they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge so you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or rebates this program on studies that show well that's fine when the studies or could but when the studies\nAre coming from a place they can't tell a truth from from prejudiced and opinion it becomes a real problem\n[noise] James one or the other ones they've found um disturbing or was\nThe uh H. O. H. two ...\nTwo was was accepted can you explain the explain this one\nThat paper was accepted by high pay showed the singer and I was just mentioning that\nPatriot stood for hoax on hoaxes so it was a hoax paper we wrote that was about writing academic hoaxes that code namely gay for convenience what are they argue is that that you can\nOnly properly criticize things that go against social justice and in particular you can only use humor to make fun of or or do satire to deflate\nThat which goes against social justice if you use humor against social justice if you criticize both will do that what that means as you never really properly engaged with it therefore we don't have to consider your criticism and that's one of the huge problems going on in this this is a set of of\nFields because that they don't accept criticism if you tried to criticize them they say that it's a privilege preserving epidemic pushback that a scholar named Allison bally hoos huge in the education literature they say it's white fragility that's Robin to Angelo who has just had a big book published on that this year introduce the concept\nIn twenty eleven which says that if\nI'm somebody with privileges in particular white people for her work uh is challenged so that their privileges Clinton question that they are fragile and don't know how to deal with it because their privilege made them weak they don't know how to psychologically deal with having that challenge and they act out in anger or grief or something like that\nAnd trying to maintain their privilege and so\nThese ideas are already getting out there\nIs it is interesting guy because the one about hopes as it is interesting in that if you have to criticize what you guys did they would almost half just cite your paper as that was\nThe idea yeah and it was definitely to put them in that position and I've asked ... to stand\nBy the paper that they accepted and publish in our right names they have an or responded yet but we'll see what they do I'm that way indeed people who want to criticize our project from a position of interest in all salmon has some will need to cite off in order to criticize us\n[laughter] I can we get one more to Glen ... on the you talked about this on the scary front that the feminist mine Tom are\nYou also did the white man my income if you did to one and this was accepted in the white man wasn't right\nCorrect fairy tale Iraq telling me about them\nSo I'll do though the white one first because they didn't get in it was much more frightening it was written in from the position of an auto West Nile graffiti where the researcher is reflecting on and hurt the state's her own experience\nAs a white lesbian women coming to hate her own white mass and they was rejected partly because the scholarship wasn't quite er which is the case in all of the papers but also because the position to the author as a good white\nRather than being sufficiently self what country or whatever to critical race ...\n... so there was in there was an explicitly political reasoning behind why it was was rejected and it was that the the author as a white woman was trying to make herself look good by criticizing her own White House and was was one of the main reason the feminist one was\nWell hold on just a second hold on just saying then that took mind the parts of mine Tom where he was talking about Jews and replace the word Jews with a with whites\nYeah in that case it was either whites are white nests and then we edited the text around it and added a whole bunch of literature and reward if things get passed plagiarism\nCheck and things like that so yeah that was a bit started with scanning through mine comp picking out passages about the Jews and replacing Jews with whites are white mess\nThan editing around it uh the feminist one didn't do it quite the same way the funnest one was not about it didn't take Jews out and replace it\nWith with men for example it actually has the chapter in my income where Hitler explains the need for the Nazi Party is chapter twelve and what its members would be expected to a whole two MB including especially the sacrifices that they have to make to be Nazis and we replaced\nOur movement the party et cetera he doesn't mention Nazis specifically in that chapter or we replace that with intersection of feminism or solidarity or ally ... something to do with with the feminist movement and criticize the idea that uh some feminists do\nWhat they called choice feminism which is the idea that if a woman is living her own life the way she wants to and considers that to be a statement of feminism\nThan she is doing feminism the salmon is for women to have you know full agency and make their own choices in the world that's what this paper was criticizing\nSaying that no no the responsibility if they really want to consider themselves feminists is to be to make sacrifices him stand in solidarity with other oppressed people particularly of you know women of color or women of other marginalized status is\nJames [noise] couple of quick questions um they\nDid this had to be one of those things that you entered into and hoped that you were wrong and when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later going\nGood God\nDoes it say that is exactly right so especially the ... paper I think the one that got accepted um the idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine ... of course do I mean as you get a one to one thing uh\nBut the ... the the politics of grievance coming through I really am glad I get to talk to you about that I can because all it takes the grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic left as we were trying to demonstrate we called this stuff proven studies we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided\nA politically right now I was really happy to talk to you because I mean I don't want to get in touch with you but you're real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this whole May of ... about\nHow things were going for you under Obama's time and I thought that was huge and I was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation it's on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know or people on the left for left liberals I'm not ashamed to say that I Know you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right that's great I'm we're on the left me to take responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that\nYou know or left wing people who want the left to come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people\nIn general I get a lot of sense of the people send me emails about this now all the time especially um\nWe're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to production politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media sphere as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't\nReally remember you know you are an American I'm an American your person I'm a person\nWe have ... most of the things that we think income and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society in a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working out the details and I really hope that you know\nThat our project kinda reaches reaches that point does that make sense", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city":
