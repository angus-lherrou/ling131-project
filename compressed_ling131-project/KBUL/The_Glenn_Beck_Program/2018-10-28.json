to be heard and he needs to be a ... needs to be introduced to a larger audience how what is your organization like what's your ground game\nKnow we have we have probably the best um obtain ground you

to include things like a scheduling setting\nAbout thirty five to fifty people who are actively working every day on every aspect of the campaign to include things like a scheduling setting up a ... a fixing our calendar\nI'm making sure people show of social media we have a a team on Twitter or team on Instagram a team on Facebook where we have a team when everything YouTube we do video production\nWhen he went on and you don't have but you you're lacking money you're up against people who have\nTens of millions of tens of millions of dollars absolutely we've raised almost half a million\nBut to be to be clear if in these last couple of weeks if we raise another fifty thousand dollars hundred thousand dollars this becomes winnable I Know it sounds crazy but it is and the reason is name recognition is my only issue the last poll we put out I was at about one third name recognition and with that I pulled the Thirteen percent\nSo you can do the math on that one three times to get through a hundred percent equals thirty nine percent right through time searching they're not ... percent this a five way race thirty percent when this thing\nSo I'm nine points above victory\nAssuming I get a hundred percent there is the hard part writes a math equation cannot get two hundred percent and sadly that's not my message I've got that down it's the media can I get my name out to enough people to where I cross over that barrier which gets to be over the third person I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win\nYes it is really is as well get get remember as as third party in general the system is act against you\nAnd some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality can do this\nBecause every day I'm up against failure but the marine corps taught me take the hill the captain shot take the hill the machine guns broken take the hill radios don't work take the hell are stopped giving excuses take the hell I get it and that's what I Do have to take the hill as a matter\nI get I literally deal with failure every day this woman every day and when I say that that's not an exaggeration\nThat's every single day as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS and they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even those thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot\nWCBS they got him him shelving is his name he there's decided nope lottery shop dozens of beyond their he's decided that the establishment is all that matters this is what I'm up against it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that to you think should be heard than you should probably\nUm maybe tweet storm what's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think that Tim shelled so this is a radio debate yes again and\nThey're just deciding no we don't want ... let me wrong there are three other people should be made should also be the Green Party and also the same party they should all be there but this is the norm and we put up against this with against is constantly and here's the the worst part with all of this we're still roaming and they're still going down\nThat's that's the sad part they don't they don't they don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate heavily doing\nLarry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to get forty five thousand dollars you can't\nThe maximum F. forty four thousand [laughter] by New York state law so if you I Know what am I going I Want to get like forty five thousand dollars sorry you can't do it forty four year old can get forty four thousand that's all you can get\nOkay Larry sharp a dot com this with an e at the end of sharp um I Want I Want to talk to you about some of the issues of the day and and how we solve some of the things like for instance healthcare yes how do you solve healthcare will do that coming up in a just a second\nWhen it yes it's so bad it is so bad that the Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they are pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and his pension is now aren't being spent in New York state they being spent in Florida we're lily we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes so let's take pension so sure pensions are\n... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises ... who work their whole life and were promised ally\nYup what do you do you see here in Texas was your place for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you ate already already happening and they have all the time you're\nIn New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation ... show pictures of critical right now pending or about Fifteen or sixteen percent of our budget and a budget is a hundred and Seventy billion dollars\nIt's double Florida in Florida has more people than us wow yes for about eighty five billion and the more people than us and we have a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget how about just massive\nAnd it's getting bigger the budget getting bigger and so are the percentages of the other pensions but on top of that a New York state has about a three hundred million dollar debt and about a ...\nSo it's a bad bad bad and when you add that people I was telling me about Lowry the pension fund is good they write the fund itself is relatively well some of the ups they ... up engineering\nBut overall certain well they don't realize it's being also funded by our tax base our budget that keeps putting money into it the problem is and the fun right now that's great the problem is the actual budget\nAt one point it gets so big that we simply can't pay me more as you're seeing in Dallas and my response to the times that Larry in the constitution yeah and I get that\nAsked Detroit right asking Puerto Rico right ask\nVenezuela and it was all legal for them to one there's no money it doesn't get funded when it doesn't get funded that eventually will collapse if that collapses if our pension fund collapsed near state we become Somalia overnight\nI don't want to become a Somali overnight I'm going to stop it I'm the only guy talking about negotiating our pensions into the right which is some type of four one K. for her to be something like that and I'm going to go she would every single union that will take forever I Know that's why says a four year plan\nIs to for you plan to make as to what New York state is paying either a flat fee and or a ... percent is sustainable because the issue we have a lot of people are pensions who no longer paying it any more mhm so we just have to keep paying them until they don't need pennies anymore so we have to do that also\nUsed to be like ten firefighters reporting one now it's one supporting tend to Iraq I think actually supporting for ... I think that's right I'm not sure but I was making them think of something I think I was born in three or four\nOr so yeah it's bad so now we have to make that change and the funny thing is people are attacking me saying live wants to get rid of our pensions I'm like I'm the only guy trying to keep them on the other one's talking about reality I'm Talking I was actually happening if you ever if you're ready for a pension now it's ten or Fifteen Years from now it's probably not going to be there for you\nBut why deal with that I mean it's human nature why deal with that if the two on the other side GOP and the Democrats are saying oh he's an extremist he is he's trying to spook you your pensions are fine it's human nature to follow them\nAgreed but I have a problem Glenn I care I have a problem I'm human I have a problem\nI Want people to stay in my state I Want people to stay in my state because if they don't my state's gonna collapse and I have to move\nAnd I don't want to move I'm born and raised in New York state my family and friends were in New York state I Love my state ... people love New York the heat in the U.S government New York state is very special it has served the largest city in the entire nation it has an amazing waterfall in Idaho Falls it as mountains as\nCool as Colorado has farmland in the school as yes I'm In New York I mean you know ...

have been backed by the west Jordan will be next anybody who stands in their way\nThey had to destroy but these were democracies so how are we going to do it well the Muslim Brotherhood decided to switch tactics and weaponize democracy enter the Arab Spring the Arab Spring praised by everyone\nWe told you their goal is a caliphate while it never materialized ...\nNo no not there didn't materialize from the chain of events with ISIS\nWhat you were talking about the Muslim Brotherhood right and what happened\nTo the Muslim Brotherhood did they just choose not to do a caliphate oh no no they were overthrown\nOh the Muslim Brotherhood still wants their caliphate\nSo now you have two of our allies turkey Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis\nWhile hobbyists who are both Jay chasing the

turkey and so was he\nEverybody here all the Saudi progressive fighting for democracy now\nNo he was fighting for the Muslim Brotherhood\nIn the Nineteen eighties and nineties he was one of the king's

shah geared to show he was cast aside\nAnd that's when the western media fell in love with him an active member of the Muslim Brotherhood not us smear or conspiracy theory in his own words yes I joined the Muslim Brotherhood organization and I was not alone\nAnd quote\nHis Muslim Brotherhood friends in clerics were all in prison in Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring\nHe got out he came to the U.S\nHe established a political party while in exile called democracy for the Arab world now party\nThe liberals the progressives the press loved him because they heard the word democracy it's the

somebody say that you make sure you ask them where are you doing your homework where are you getting that why is that a smear campaign\nTo say that he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly was in his own words so why is that a smear campaign because I thought the Muslim Brotherhood was largely secular\nAsked people how much do you know about the caliphate how much do you know about the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood how much do you really know about what this man wrote\nThis man wrote that he did it was a mistake to think that you could have\nAny kind of state in the middle east

doesn't sound secular doesn't sound like somebody we should be in bed with\nThe Muslim Brotherhood ran up against a problem and that was one of them the kingdom of of Saudi Arabia\nBecause it was backed by the west any of these kingdoms in the middle East that have been backed by the west Jordan will be next anybody who stands in their way\nThey had to destroy these were democracies so how are we going to do it well the Muslim Brotherhood decided to switch tactics and weaponize democracy enter the Arab Spring the Arab Spring\nPraised by everyone we told you their goal is a caliphate while it never materialized ...\nNo no not there it materialized from the chain of events with ISIS\nWhat you were talking about the Muslim Brotherhood right and what happened\nTo the Muslim Brotherhood did they just choose not to do a caliphate oh no no they were overthrown\nOh the Muslim Brotherhood still wants their caliphate\nSo now you have two of our allies turkey Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis\nWhile hobbyists who are both Jay chasing the same exact dream a Middle East and the world dominated by surreal law both of them Ewing using jihadism as a as a means to their ends\n[noise] so ... show or whatever you're calling him today\nNow where you look at him\nHe is he is a guy who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood I Want to say this no one deserves this kind of death this is not to excuse the Saudis they're bad guys\nBut so is turkey and so was he\nEverybody here all Saudi progressive fighting for democracy no\nNo no no\nHe was fighting for the Muslim Brotherhood\nIn the Nineteen eighties and nineties he was one of the king's main allies he edited several Saudi newspapers which he was basically Winston Smith in Orwell's Nineteen eighty four sitting in the Saudi version of the ministry of truth heading editing out all thought crime\nMakes sure that there was never anything hostile said about ... or the king\nDuring this time he'd cozy up to Osama bin Laden he scored several interviews while al ... was fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan Saudi intelligence employed him to be the middleman between bin Laden and the Saudi royal family will in two thousand three he fell out of favor with the Saudi royals\nWhen he allowed to be published a an article critical to the ... hobbyist movement\nWhy did he do that ...\nBecause he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and they were at odds with the well hobbyists\nThe shah gear ... was cast aside and that's when the western media\nAn active member of the Muslim Brotherhood not us smear or conspiracy theory in his own words yes I joined the Muslim Brotherhood organization and I was not alone\nAnd quote\nHis Muslim Brotherhood friends in clerics were all in prison in Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring he got out\nHe came to the U.S\nHe established a political party while in exile called democracy for the Arab world now party\nThe liberals the progressives the press loved him because they heard the word democracy it's the Muslim Brotherhood plan to subvert democracy by turning it against itself\nHe wants\nWanted to establish sure Rio law in the region\n\nWho was also a wicked anti Semite who wrote quote outside the context of history and logic the Jews will have to die by force\nOh Israel's outside the context of history and logic so we're going to have to kill all of them\nThis is not a smear campaign when you hear somebody say that you make sure you ask them where are you doing your homework where are you getting that why is that a smear campaign\nTo say that he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly was in his own words so why is that a smear campaign because I thought the Muslim Brotherhood was largely secular\nAsked people how much do you know about the caliphate how much do you know about the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood how much do you really know about what this man wrote\nThis man wrote that he it was a mistake to think that you could have any kind of state in the middle east with out some form of Islam assists\n\nNow that's different remember than Islam and Islamic ... believes you have to use your real law\nThat the constant wow it sounds like the mother Muslim Brotherhood that's our constitution that is our law sugary a law\nSo\nLet's just begin to tell each other the truth and here's the truth turkey is not a friend of ours turkey is in with the Muslim Brotherhood\nTurkey would like to have a caliphate run by them Saudi Arabia not good people Saudi Arabia huge exporter of ... and has done it here in the United states has spent money building mosques that are very dangerous here in the United states true\nThey kill him could be probably seems like it\nI don't trust the Muslim Brotherhood in Turkey but I also don't trust those guys one of them killed him probably Saudi Arabia did he deserve it no does he deserved to be called a freedom fighter\nRush Limbaugh man didn't want to see 'em on news on and

our political discussion itself is a mess but I think it's really important to distinguish between two dimensions one dimension is a continuum from right to left and on those issues as conservative as they come\nOn anybody score card on the second or third most conservative senator or in the United States Senate\nUm but the second dimension is about the intensification of politics and how centrally should politics sit in your world view\nAnd they're on the big skeptic because I'm a traditional American or of the idea that politics can be near the center of your world view and you end up very happy\nSo I think there's a lot of data now that shows more and more Americans are actually tuning out politics altogether but the people who are involved in politics some of the national media\nAnd

because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood\nAnd parts of it challenged I'm sure but uh uh I Would like to just pick up on this point so the number one driver of happiness is vocation your one guy that will understand that if that's true in the next ten years we're in deep trouble\n[noise] we're headed toward a really interesting time in human history ... scary and fascinating so somebody some people shorthand for that so the ... the economy I think the simpler way to think about it is just the average duration of people's jobs or their relationship at a farm is going to get shorter than ever before in human history\nSo let's go macro for a minute hunter gatherers throughout most of human history\nYou don't have any conception of what your job is to pursue that buffalo right and then ten thousand years ago people settled down and started planting and harvesting and we we enter farm on a on a regular cycle\nAnd from ten thousand years ago to a hundred and fifty years ago nobody at job choice they just did with grandma and grandpa mom and dad and aunts and uncles had ever had done forever eternity past with the industrial revolution we get job specialization and it was really disruptive\nBut when people took a job they still kept it till death of retirement to not everybody graduated high school at the beginning of the industrial revolution by the end almost everybody does\nBut you still get one job at some time between Fifteen and twenty two years old and you keep it for all of your life I was born in the Nineteen seventies average duration at a farm for a primary breadwinner then it was still twenty six years\nNow it's four years and getting shorter and it's got to get shorter forever more McKenzie a farm I used to work with believes that fifty percent of the American labor market by three years from now this is not Twenty years in the future\nIt's three years from now they take fifty percent of the labor market will be primarily freelancers meaning that most people will cobble together a bunch of different jobs not all of them are going to be ap enabled tech jobs like being a new driver with the right software that makes\nCobble together a bunch of different jobs\nNot all of them are going to be ap enabled tech jobs like being a new driver with the right software that makes you more efficient than an old school Gabby but what's really going to happen is we're going to head toward a world where people are going to get disrupted out of their jobs at aged forty and forty five and fifty and fifty five\nForever more we've never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the banks of what's often called now the quarter life crisis\nThe sort of late adolescence crisis of trying to figure out your your role in life and how do you go from just being a consumer and mom and dad's house to being a producer that can not just put bread on the table for your kids can actually have a sense of meaning that you're serving your neighbor that disruption that most people know in late adolescence working experience that again every three to five years for our whole life\nAnd that means there's a lot of new potential for upheaval and frankly for unhappiness\nThere's going to be more economic output than it's ever been produced before in human history but it's not at all clear that it will redound to the median family in the median household and the media and worker or going to have to become a civilization of lifelong workers able to get retrained when you're forty nobody's ever done that before\n[laughter] okay so there's about an hour of questions or just on on that one uh but I've got about three minutes left can you give me\nA ... your take on the first real political upheaval that we're going to see that I think by twenty twenty you could change everything could start global war the fakes\nYeah so one of the reasons I wrote them is because I spent a lot of time on intelligence issues and I'm In the intel community there are people who talk about the perfect storm of deep fakes that we have coming\nAnd the storm is these three ingredients number one new technology makes it possible to sort of narrow cast a world with fake audio and fake video where lots of people can be susceptible to being sort of\nUm a spoof or persuaded the things that aren't real are real there's always been enemies doing malicious actor you know information warfare since the beginning of time you can find it in proverbs and includes the Estes to sow discord in an enemies tent\nBut it used to require a prostitute honey trapping effect business partner in a bribery scheme\nAnd more ... to get people around people number one\nIs now we can use technology to surround someone and give them a fake experience and ... are fake audio and fake video that are going to seem really gonna make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad at it the real reason we need to take the Russia\nType investigation so seriously as because China's right behind them\nRunning scout team off since I'm On them and ready to do\nBig deep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and\nBusiness officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions about geography about race about gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided\nThat we are susceptible to these kind of campaigns like Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they\nTry to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL kneeling controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media and the for Seventy two hours after that flamed\nLast fall the majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taken the NFL most of it was Russian on both sides and so we're going to have a world where you're going to have things like the cabinet hearings where all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer's strategizing with Michael ...\nOr video will appear it'll be fake but video will appear and it'll be Kavanaugh partying hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake but in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be\nA potentially much more divisive\nEl it'll be fake but in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be a potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write that the ah why we hate each other is an awareness that there is actually national security exposure for this country and how much we hate each other around politics\nWe need communities of people that live\nIn the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise] [noise]\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\n[noise] ah it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere at a McDonald's right now who probably slapped an old man wearing a mock a hat\nAnd or that person is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of nuts pecking and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have about thirty I've got thirty seconds I'm not getting even ask you not even ask you I Would like to ask you to come down a band and and really unpack this uh because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood and I think in soundbites\nUm it's not a not always understood I'm so thank you very much\nFor them but good to be with your line but\nSenator Ben Sasse [noise] um why we hate each other and how to heal I really wanted that you really want to get into him on taking on your own\nOh you're a conspiracy theorist weight she just said it at one point [laughter]\nI mean first of all the you know the press is a collection of individuals some of which do a good job of some of which do not\nAh so it's important to make those distinctions I think um and you know look at that is a this was just this is going on at our founding you know people were doing it at our founding and it at our founding but we've but we we realize is when we were in a gauge and informed populace we chose correctly\nRight I mean I I you know if we're not\nWell we know what the ... which we know a republic if you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's going to fall apart we knew this was an experiment and that was the risk of it\nAnd I think we are seeing some some of those risks top of their heads up but I mean the whole foundation of this country is to let people\nCome out and make their arguments and we have to make ours back that does not mean I'm In a minute diplomacy thing and I was so encouraged I Hope you are too so encouraged by the ... written a reaction from conservatives\n... shouted down a and I did not see a peep\nOf support from conservatives over the actions of the people protesting hurting I didn't see I was disgusted by I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't see any I didn't now I'm not saying there were none I'm sure people will show me a tweet if some you know not job who was like I think they should harass Nancy Pelosi at dinner\nBut I didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actions not one you could see if we can we played dozens of Democrat and you\nKnow here's here's here's one from Sean King I've said it before but I Need to say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so but I'm Glad we have people in this country to stand up to a fascist and a bigotry and are willing to confront ape face to face right\nAnd you can tell you there's nothing on the left there even prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened to policy and that's right\nAnd I'm Glad they mean that that shows that there's still you know even though we're divided and even though a lot of things come down to ... minute an emotional politics that go minute to minute I'm Glad to see that there's still principles there\nSo here's where I think than was wrong when he said to deal with ... um he was right when he said you know it's a small group to swap room\nHe's right it is a very small group and they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media but it is a small group where I think he's wrong is ignore it\nHe's a part of the solution is ignoring yeah and I think you know 'cause you can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the ... right right you know the Charlottesville situation um you know there's obviously a crime committed there that um you can't ignore right um but generally speaking when what bunch\nI've been forever the nursing go back for a broken bunch of KKK members walk through your town like ... you know largely speaking it's great to ignore them because they want attention and they run they\nMost that's not what we have now we have to a breaking laws you can't ignore the can and can't ignore that I don't I don't care if it's the Nazis or ... you can't ignore now thinks that's would argue nor\nThe right I mean like I think he's saying that we get a little bit too wrapped up in the back and forth of viral videos and people who are not even really engaged in politics [noise] getting freaked out over things that they're never going to have to necessarily deal with if you just missed a group like as a photo that's how they grow\nOr and or at least arguably that's how they grow their own oppose you're seeing it happen in Portland right in the mayor is largely just ignoring what they're doing and it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse that does not mean our lives have to be ruled by a father and I think that was the generalize argument he was going for\nWell the the\nThe key here is what do you do about it and the solution is to not to do what people did in Florida with Nancy Pelosi you don't do that\nBecause that doesn't give you decide to run to yeah you don't do what the Proud Boys are doing I'm Sorry but it's so I just\nYou know when you've talked to Gavin about that and yeah and I think Gavin is even\nYou know looking at things going again you know look we were we were doing things because you know it's funny\nA media yeah he's a comedian um but you know this this will grow out of control you just don't do that 'cause there's nowhere to go when you're watching that you're like well I don't like\nWell Nancy Pelosi is doing but I don't like what they're doing\nSo who do I go to and look at look how the press is treating Donald Trump look how the press treated Kavanaugh everybody kind of hard and their positions didn't they everybody just hardened their positions and got more outraged\nThe only the only thing that might have happened is independence looked at that and said you know what I don't want to be with those people left the left and and I don't want to be with the I don't want to be with the left and then looked over to the Republicans\nThey weren't misbehaving during that but\nWhat are we doing to welcome people in if you're kind of saying I don't want to be with those guys and then you see [noise] you know you ... get out get out and they're pounded on ... and like okay I don't we can't\nWe can't get to a place to where people disengage because if they do completely disengaged then it just run the country is run by radicals\nWe need\nTo be a safe haven we need to be a place of real thought real actual timed this um and real principals\nAnd we have to present a rational logical alternative I mean that that is one of the reasons I'm a conservative right right I saw the left you know early in my life as a group of\nPeople who made decisions emotionally yeah and that's not something I Want to be part of snow and we can't be a part of that we can't do that ourselves let me go to Andrew in Florida hello Andrew you're on the Glenn Beck program\nGoing morning first time caller long unless during the day very good oh right yeah and you know I I just wanted to let you know I mean I'm here from Florida I'm In an independent uh most of my adult life and I'm exactly what you guys just said ... trail\nIt's a lot of the independent just stay out of it because it's so immature and it makes every one of those type of fat because they just can't talk to each other mhm anymore it's just at our God now that being said\nEvery one that I Know that's an independent in the state of horror will be showing up for the conservatives we all love ever\nReally are and why are you\nA simple reason she got it all in the office it off just right now out there that are fighting for lower taxes I might I'm bringing home over three thousand more dollars this year than I did last year which is a huge\nDeal for me I've got two little girls and I've got one more I got my first uncommon in eighth\nGrade [laughter] yeah I mean yes\n... ... ... there's there's things like that are going on and on and I'm a conservative Christian showed up at you when you're when you're talking about\nWhat these people represent and how they ... themselves into a restaurant that can hurt people when they're eating with their family\nOr most dependent and then think exactly the way I Do it just so disgusted with some of the rhetoric on both sides [noise]\nWe just ignore it and we're always been independent thinkers are we are going to stay that way we also know what's wrong is wrong and what's brightest right as far as the big picture is concerned I think a lot of people underestimate that\nWell Andrew I'm you if what you say is true ah than people are a ... ... then the Republicans will keep the house most likely\nA because it is so close at levels we've never seen of interest in participation in the mid term election ever a and it's it's within the margin of error between the two that if the independents come out and they are that they could be the ones that make all the difference under\nWhich direction we go next so much Andrew [noise] plan\nWeekdays at noon eastern this has banana
