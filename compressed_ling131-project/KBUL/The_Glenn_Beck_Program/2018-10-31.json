of a good propaganda lie in an election year well anyway Republicans now are beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the\nFact that repeal has to happen but also direct primary care or what I call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining momentum and I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress in the Senate as we move forward and\nThere are a couple of plans that are percolating one would be block granting money to states so that they can become\nYou know the fifty outlets of of new innovative medicine and they'll turn over every penny because their political futures will be dependent on it which would be a good thing Gavin Newsom wants universal free care for everyone he gets X number of dollars good luck with that but in states red states which smart governors\nOr it could be a lot different and a lot better you know we we often go to the case of health care savings accounts\nAnd that would be your only count your manage every year and set of eyes yearly checkup and your younger years you're building up money it's your money but when you get older if you really get sick that money that account has built up a fortune and you couple that with catastrophic care fairly inexpensive\nDepending on what your doctor bowl is you know you could pay as low as a hundred bucks a year and get a great catastrophic plan if you have a heart attack at cancer\nOr have a bad accident but anyway the health care cooperatives of Dr Josh ... has been a pet project on this program of ours now for years and he joined us atlas empty Wichita, Kansas he joined us with Dr Lee as gross and he's the president for doctors for patient care foundation a thank you both for being with us\nOr Dr Robert just to remind people I I Lived in Wichita I could walk in\nAnd I get unlimited care twenty four seven I got a Ninety five percent reduction in all of my prescription medicine costs and my kids get unlimited care for ten bucks a month is that true\nThat's very uh every American could have ... level direct care just like you and how important people like Sean Hannity um yeah I don't think people under stand just how important this election is um we see how divisive DC as we see how much infighting there is and we don't want those people managing our health care\nEvery American deserves Affordable Care and the direct care model says\nManager for a penny a pill labs for two or three dollars unlimited visits no co pays brief procedures we can fix is we can um work with employers and redesign insurance plans to decrease saving yea their premiums by thirty to sixty percent we can do that but we need Republicans in office\nAllowing the free market to function because if we go back towards a an Affordable Care act style a Medicare for all it would decrease our ability to really you know inundate in a way that is meaningful for patient\nAnd more importantly shot you know we're looking at a vision right now we have two completely different visions on healthcare future one is a completely government controlled socialized medicine or you're going to instruct the government between patients and their doctors\nOr you know I think the cabin out here you know that's how the ... that's the same government that's going to control your health care or you have a another position that his health care freedom and these are the freedom of choice between you and your physician\nA word that your decisions are not being made by the ...\nBy by the government and so in a while direct primary care isn't is not a partisan solution it is a solution that has been graced by most Republicans that are running including a ... running for governor in the state of Florida he is a race that is Newt Gingrich has put this\nIn his you know to primary care and his platform or so this is definitely a platform that Republicans are supporting so if you want freedom this is definitely the vision for him\nI mean the thing is it's almost mind numbing to me and you you know what you're right Dr Josh I have friends of mine that are doctors and because it's not because I pay them to be on it but I couldn't pay them I mean I I Do pay them in other ways and thanked them when they do favors for me but\nUm I I Will tell you that I can make a call at three o'clock in the morning any day and get a doctor's care and get a doctor's recommendation\nAnd didn't and you know what if every American white a white only a few Americans deserve that or they ended up going to the stock in the box places and I'm not now playing them I'm sure they play a vital role in certain towns and communities\nBut I don't think it's ideal because I think most people pick a doctor because they like and trust that individual and know that that person knows who they are and knows their medical background that's important to\nYou and everybody should be able to choose that and I think that goes back to what Dr gross is saying about this is a referendum on ... and we want freedom in our schools in our homes and all that kind of important decisions we make but then we we've been missing that level of freedom when it comes to the most important decisions in health care\nSo this really is a crucial step in history\nWhere we can say look the free market can do this better than the government's been doing it people aren't happy with health care system now and met our ten dollars a pill we we want freedom and health care we what choice do direct care model\nAllows you know every man woman and child preexisting conditions or not to get incredibly high quality care in an affordable way\nI'm Shauna in the bars you know it shouldn't be a\nPart of it you know in our practice we have not raised our prices in eight years we've heard sixty dollars a month for eight years for unlimited primary care services are X rays are twenty five dollars are MRI's or two hundred and twenty dollars these are all affordable so at a pre existing no Craig's\nSome of the primary care services are X rays are twenty five dollars are MRI's or two hundred and twenty dollars these are all affordable so if preexisting no pre existing condition the question is can you actually afford to get the care unique by the doctor can eat when you need a and his direct care solutions getting the government out of the middle of this relationship\nCan actually do that so you need to embrace the people that are running for office that support the freedom and health care\nYou know it seems that you know it's so simple and so basic and so fundamental and this is where I got frustrated with the Republicans because they had promised repeal replace and they weren't ready for the moment there's no doubt about it now to the president's credit\nHe got rid of the individual mandate but that's only a first step in if every Democrat is going to go out there and say well we're gonna have we're gonna have better health care options for the American people but in many cases the very same people that gave us the failure of Obamacare\nWhen you're offering a health care cooperative model you've duplicated down how many practices across the country doctor remember\nWe've helped over five hundred and fifty practices get launched but there's over a thousand growing every day I'm you know we had a twenty ... started last month alone that's a new practice every business day\nOr the ... and then you have any direct access to every individual twenty four seven direct access to a doctor there are no pre existing condition prejudice at all and these practices exactly have you can afford a cell phone you can afford direct patient care primary care\nThere is no insurance except he probably would have won a couple the direct care with like a catastrophic plan which is fairly inexpensive honors\nYou have car insurance for the big stuff but I think you know pointed goes unmentioned is the fact that the insurance premiums are going up twenty thirty percent every year when Dr Lynn I never raised our prices is is killing the economy it's killing jobs it's taking\nMoney trying to be noisy but are you making and fifty bucks a patient I'm a I'm a make a month are you making any money\nThat's what we're told me that it hasn't been acquired yeah yeah I mean this has not been acquired by the big boxes you know we're able to keep the practices of float or able to drive interest in primary care were able to treat people in the rural communities\nThese practices are in inner city there are critical access hospitals are critical access communities in suburban and urban setting a and it's worked ...\nSame poor people in America people we defined as poor or lower income they can pay fifty bucks a month and they can get a hold are you twenty four seven and if they need to Z pack they're going to walk out with his Z pack and pay above the Z pack\nWas that you know ... ... yeah they should be able to get that if you think about it\nThe poor and ... the more you need a model like this MIT did a study on Oregon's Medicaid system and only twenty cents on the dollar got to the recipient\nDon't believe you need to have a functioning car and car insurance gas money to get to the doctor if you're poor you can texture doctor you can email you can call them you don't have to leave the house necessarily because the doctors are\nAnd how many patients you have\nA we have about six to seven hundred per doctor\nOkay so I'm a liberal the highway and I'm like most practice is probably most of your patients like me I really don't want to see you unless I really need you unless I'm saying hello or you know saying let's go fishing together hum because\nMost people will drive but there's probably at least ten patients of every practice when they're calling me every day I'm assuming\nWe we have our high utilizes\nAnd our last year we had her high we have our high utilize there's a we have a few pains and they asked it never stop you know we factored that in um the only part of the\nProgram we have doctors coming from a three hundred and fifty doctors from forty one states descending on our land do this weekend to attend the conference to learn how to set up their practices after this so you know with a or a thousand ...\nThis from forty one states descending on our land do this weekend to attend the conference

just a part of the playbook that the Democrats as always the same I even think it's gotten worse in a look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and\nWhat is the media but now they're blaming Donald Trump port and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his\nStrong support for Israel including moving the capital to Jerusalem wearable along so\nWell it's interesting I was so what is your take I mean how are people reacting I'm I assume you're getting a fortune of negative ads thrown at you and how are the people of Iowa reacting to\nOh yeah I'm getting out and about four to one from my opponent and Nancy Pelosi and the superPACs out there so it's a message versus money my opponent all her money is coming from from the east and the left the and the west coast a message over money and results right\nResults look what we have done with this economy\nOn the national international stage as well or what the president and when it comes to sitting down with North Korea heading for nuclear is Asian\nOr we would help or making sure that yeah we did move that embassy from Tel Aviv Israel prompts has kept and being a that shining light on the hill or were there was a lot of dark is for a long time still is but the shining brighter we lead in the world others will follow\nA more prosperity and peace um you'd want to go backwards that's how important this election is right now\nI think it's a lot of things to get our vote him\nLook I think a vote for any Democrat and any district for four hundred and thirty five house seats up for grabs it was a vote for ... because your opponent will vote for Nancy Pelosi and vote with her I'm sure Ninety eight percent of the time just like in the Senate if you vote for any Democrat you're voting for sure\nUm to me a lot of it is you know look at the limitation of due process presumption of innocence during the Kavanaugh hearings\nA look at the the agenda Democrats\nIs it's it's it's out there they want their crumbs back because they want the taxes the tax cuts that are putting a lot of money in the pockets of middle class Americans they want it back they want to limit their eyes open borders they want to keep Obamacare and how they're running on health care is just\nThe definition of just or death city considering they litter how many there are counties I read in Iowa that I've seen two hundred percent increases in their premiums people lost their doctors and plans and they have one health care option that's it one provider that\nSaid yeah and and those that\nAre paying it are paying twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year or their premiums their deductibles are so high they can even if they just risk and don't even go to a doctor but you're exactly right\nMy opponent we had three opportunities to distance herself from Nancy Pelosi and she said she couldn't think of a an issue where they could be separated so what's that mean she's a rubber stamp for hopefully not a Speaker Pelosi but increasing taxes\nOpen borders doubling down on government run health care and of course what they've tried to keep under the rug shot and you do this and our listeners now this impeachment\nNow that an endless\nHealth care and of course what they've tried to keep under the rug shot and you do this and are blisters now this impeachment mhm\nNow that an endless investigation but not into the deep state\nUm which of course you know we've seen massive abuses of power not rank and file FBI agents not rank and file a Justice Department an intelligence people but\nThey do their job every day but just a few abusing power at the highest levels the upper echelon well listen this is an important race it's on our top thirty we have the top Seventy racist if you want to go to our interactive map at ... dot com and the most important house races that will tip the balance of power six days from now\nAnd one week from today we'll be talking about those results certainly David Young Iowa's third district is one of those important races we wish you the best in this race\nWe can't take anything for granted go to David Young for Iowa dot com to volunteer and help us make sure we keep the majority thank you Sean for all you do you\nBet welcome a ball the best to you and six days a it's tough out there\nNobody can predict what certainty but I Will tell you they don't I just there's something about um some things not clicking with me and I never you never really have a feel for how the house is going to go twenty hand might be an exception where\nI mean it was a massive landslide and you could see it coming same thing I Would argue when Bill Clinton became president Nineteen Ninety four remember Republicans have been out of power for forty years that Newt Gingrich became the speaker of the house\nYou know so if you look at history and this is what Republicans are up against their forty five retirement and a headwind of history that usually the the party in power loses a lot of seats and the first midterm rather than like in the case of Bill Clinton it was Newt Gingrich in many ways Newt saving\nOf Clinton because things got better because Newt Gingrich force Clinton into what led to balance budgets and serious reforms in Washington\nAnd I think the same thing you know you go to a bomb I mean it was just a white powder and twenty ten am specially after Obamacare and ... you know the fact that Democrats are that's their main talking point now\nI'm this is really fascinating to me there's a crash meals to poll out today I had to go back in double check it showing that African American support for the president has now hit an all time high of forty percent\nI mean that's a five hundred percent improvement\nIf you go back to election day twenty sixteen when he got eight percent of the African American vote in the country in the same survey\nTrump's approval ratings they is at its highest at this point in the fifty percent plus range\nAnd I think the highest level of support for any Republican going back to at least Dwight Eisenhower if not\nBefore and and all the media likes to go after asked me to ... I don't know why he's a great guy smart poster but you know they say oh he's a right wing polling operation but I Do remind you that raspy used them was the most accurate polling twenty sixteen\nSo if that is even close to forty percent that could have a profound impact on the midterm elections but\nAgain it's all up to now the interesting developments as a relates to the issue of the caravan um and I think some people have been over the top and what they've been saying about it it's a lot of distance between here and where they started at the southern border of Mexico\nAnd uh now you have and I look there's always the most people that come into this country illegally I think that most people come here because we are\nLook there's always the most people that come into this country illegally I think that most people come here because we are a land of milk and honey hope an opportunity and the American dream\nAnd when you live in poverty and countries that have little to zero opportunity and freedom it's very appealing to come to America now we're only asking that you do it legally only asking that you respect our laws are sovereignty our borders\nAnd I'd venture a guess that Ninety nine point eight percent of the people in that caravan want a better life and that they've been told that they're going to be able to get into America that's not going to happen\nThe president's been very clear\nUm the left this meteor pushing a narrative that the thousands of of migrants\nAnd from Central America and elsewhere are fleeing violence in their homeland but in an interview with National Public radio on Monday the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some of the people some probably a tiny tiny percentage they'd be clip point two percent\nOr you know less source our quarter reporting that she identified MS Thirteen members because of their tattoos that would give that'd be a give away um but actually the Mexican ambassador to the U. S. describes some I'm sure a tiny percentage is very violent now nobody can vouch for any one person that wants to cross the border\nWe're asking that people come here legally if we had a border wall we wouldn't have a risk of thousands of people at once coming across the border the president has sent fifty two hundred troops down there\nAnd he's not gonna let them in nor can he goes there will be thousands and thousands behind them we don't have room to take it everybody we have a right as a country we have sovereignty or nation built on a on a constitutional republic system the rule of law\nAnd we have border laws and we asked people respect our borders and our sovereignty and just come in legally and we have an opportunity to vet them and make sure that they are coming for the right reasons they can sustain themselves and they don't want to bring harm to our citizens that are already here\nI'm nearly according to one border officials telling the Washington Examiner three quarters of the caravan\nOr that is traveling through Mexico to the u._s. or adult man according to a senior border patrol officer telling the examiner\nAs news talk Ninety five five dot com\nHere is the president himself was um it was an Stewart varnish showed a function fitness channeled egg Rush Limbaugh and what about then your tweets herself for these people that say we don't want any more tweets anybody ever tried to stop\nTweeting no and that's my only form of communicating really other than having a press conference every hour of I don't vote or social media shifts so frustrated they can stop it in a\nRush Limbaugh reduced can handle on the news on Ninety five forty five\nThis is your home from Montana talk with Aaron Flint live and local weekday mornings\nFrom the violence even Martin movie studios\nNinety Seventy ... more friendly\nEnough Sean Hannity on the news hour by\nHour the first stop at a campaign blitz and the final days before the midterm\nRepublicans have always considered Florida a moment ago fries it has a solid win and rational and I\nHad at least one on one with US Senator and now the president and how many people are written not and the outgoing governor now in the Senate races\nIncumbent Democrats you'll know one hundred a moderate not seriously challenged by Republicans\nTo maintain a strong Republican\nVoter turnout them a home resident willing buyer and then Fox\nIs that the round outside Fort Myers the suspect in Saturday's mass shooting in Pittsburgh synagogue indicted by a federal grand jury Robert\nPowers basis forty four counts including hate crimes attorney general Jeff Sessions will ultimately decided powers will face the death penalty called the alleged crimes comprehensively evil and quarterly repugnant to the values of this nation\nAccording to the indictment souers was armed with three ... three fifty seven handguns and of course they are Fifteen rifle taxes\nDavid Lee Miller in Pittsburgh funerals for the victims began yesterday and are continuing throughout the week\nA former federal investigators has a mob hitman isn't suspect in the prison killing of notorious gangster Whitey Bolger\nThe official who spoke on the condition of anonymity telling the AP friday gays and at least one other person I Believe to be involved in the death of the eighty nine year old ... was convicted of the two thousand three killing of another Massachusetts mobster Bolger was a long time informant for the FBI federal investing\n... death as a homicide the Pentagon now saying seven thousand troops from ten states will be sent to the border to assist border control agents as a\nCaravan of thousands of migrants makes its way to the southern border [noise] this is talk to [noise]\nVisiting angels as America's Choice in senior home care we believe your loved ones should never have to give up living at home visiting angels provide personal home care up to twenty four hours per day including meals and like housework ask about our dimension care at home\nYou'll select your professional caregiver look up visiting angels dot com or called eight seven seven three seven four live that's eight seven seven three seven four L.

and grandparents cannot be complacent if these are adult children or grandchildren are not showing any interest in voting\nUm we need to do all we can do to educate them on the importance and the seriousness of this election and all that is at stake and Sean I've been using your talking points to convince my adult children that every single vote is important and what's at risk if they don't vote\nAnd here in our house we turn to boats into three to five and then possibly even more because our kids took the message to their friends their college classmates\nAnd some of them ended up voting as well so I'm a couple of weeks ago I spent three hours on the road driving a mail in ballots semi adult child who's a student at University of Colorado just to make sure that that one single vote is cast and counted so\nHey everybody do whatever it takes to get their vote in um offered to drive them to vote in person pay for their overpay for FedEx to mail that absence here a mail in ballot to be two in to make sure that it gets counted and trust me the future of them will take us\nWell thanks for the call the bigger picture\nEvery almost every parent who's not serious yeah\nYou

they people let me tell you what I think Mr Speaker see if you agree with us\nYou know I think the Ninety nine percent of people that were in that caravan they see America as the land of milk and honey and opportunity which we kind of take for granted sometimes as Americans and I'm sure that Ninety nine point eight percent of them are probably good people that just want a better life\nUm we can't vouch for any of those people in terms of other enemies of America that are mixed themselves into that group\nThe idea that we're going to have five seven fourteen thousand whatever the numbers are different estimates from everybody just get to our border and charge across\nA there is no respect for American law our constitution our sovereignty or we don't know we need to be able to vet
