the woman's name Rachel Mitchell was the one that was asking questions for the Republicans in the Senate\nA professor Ford and she did a very strong analysis of the case you said in the legal context here is my bottom line and he said she said case\nIs incredibly difficult to prove but this cases even weaker than that she said Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate up for the reasons discuss below I Do not think of reasonable prosecutor would bring this case\nBased on the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that the evidence is sufficient dissatisfied a preponderance of evidence standard even and you know I that's a pretty powerful statement now we have what else do we have here so\nWe got some other blue state numbers that are really interesting to watch um there's a lot of reasons why in New Jersey this was surprising to me\nDemocratic Sen Robert Menendez is having a tough time

the anger and the level of anger that exist on behalf of the Republicans and conservatives in the base over all these tactics against Brett Kavanaugh um\nIs that enough for Republicans to win I Would I'd love to see a contract with America and promises made by these Republicans to insure people they're not wasting their vote\nYeah look I think there are sprinkler steps here one is to communicate as you just did that this is about America\nThis is the most important midterm election in my lifetime and I think will be decisive in order we keep going forward or we return to this left wing fanaticism second it really is a contrast between results and resistance\nAnd whether people want to continue to create jobs to do the things that work to move in the right direction or\nGo back to the failed policies of the eight years of Obama\nAnd then third I think the Republicans should have an eye open next week we'll have a sort of very positive think of it as a pledge of if if we were elected here over the next steps are all going to take care of the next good things are going to happen and I think that there are enough things working\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they fall for this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to\nDebate the details of this or that case when actually there's nothing to do with the details with justice itself this is a tactic designed to hold onto power when\nRon ... is an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the census is going to be a racist watch this has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some use some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron to San Francisco racist you knew that was going to happen because it had to happen\nA lot of that era there in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad in Missouri by the Democratic party said\nOh you know be like Republicans black cross cross is going to be burnt on people's lawns a ... well the James Byrd at I mean Al Gore telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you in the census at all\nAnd just really outrageous claims and you know one of the things I'd like to see come out of this that what has now become a predictable tactic that they get called out on this Brett Kavanaugh up until two weeks ago yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen\nAnd now all of these allegations all of these solicitations\nAnd it doesn't matter like if Michael ... making the claim that thirty six years ago that there was a gang of boys that were routinely drug ... girls and then waiting in line to gang and trail raped them\nThat this was happening with a regular occurrence but nobody said it at the time nobody told the teacher a law enforcement official apparent that it just kept going on and was covered up for this long because I Know where I go to why I went to school in one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds\nWell it's ridiculous I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive public gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody and no one else does either in she on the\nTenth one was raped herself and didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven years okay I don't have time for that actually there's a whole country\nWith all sorts of real problems to address tend to\nWhat you really have to be a Republican senator since you had to take that seriously these people fall for the same ... every single time it's going to football and you have like the senator from Arizona's like oh I really need to get to sit here and really\nIf there are plausible claims being made yes they should be investigated this is a guy who's had six FBI investigations into his background in the space Twenty years radical clearance that allowed him ... codes to the nuclear arsenal\nHe was fat vetted and yet we need another on the basis of claims that have no sense to actually shut all men not tacking Christine for it I'm just making the obvious point she\nClaims that this happened she named for people she says for president or for say it didn't happen and no one has the brass to ask follow up questions I mean look\nThis happened to him for people she says for president all for say it didn't happen and no one has the brass to ask follow up questions in the book it's a joke\nAt is what's actually happening it's a joke and only the Republicans in the Senate don't know it\nWell this is the ... either some said they had no recollection amber of anything like that ever happening or being at any party in the case of a best friend she said well I I don't doubt what professor Ford are saying but I don't have any recollection\nBut also professor in foreign identified one person and that was mark judge and mark judge having been in the room when this alleged assault took place and he has said over and over again that's not true\nNow they made statements under penalty of felony\nAnd if they so when the FBI goes back to them if they changed their story they will be admitting to committing a felony\nSo I'm not really expecting a whole lot to change here except now the Democrats are put out a statement earlier today and they are now demanding all the witnesses telling the FBI how to do their job and meanwhile when they had a chance last week to talk about this Ramirez or\nA Michael ... client they passed and they punted and they didn't bring it up\nBut now they want to end it into that aspect and put some\nBut why we playing along with this I mean they actually\nGot to tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra work done it was supposed to be limited in scope and uh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way\nJeff Flake is not in control the Senate they could pass it without flake in where the leaders other than ... and I hate to say it Lindsey Graham seems to be the only person\nWilling to tell the truth but where the rats were the other ... Republican senators out there on television make their case not just for Brett Kavanaugh but for common sense and presumption of innocence for where are these people and they they control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of the agenda pretty much\nThe president Lana undercutting the finger to their own voters and on this one thing they can't just tell the truth\nWhy is that for art and were they afraid of exactly I don't understand\nWhat do you think that you've been in cable news a long time you were back in the crossfire days I think even had a stint shortly at MSNBC I don't know how that worked out for you but\nUh I got fired yeah um well I mean I think that they are one opinion network and that's it and it's all conspiracy all hate Trump all the time but\nI'm now you've been doing really well in the Fox news channel news shows doing really well and uh what what is the difference that you think is happening with cable news today I mean we're on the opinion side of things and Fox obviously as a news division but\nI kind of look at what I Do is talk show host as being the entire newspaper we report news sometimes it straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions other interviews we have people give opinion [noise]\nUm we do sports we do culture pop culture it's to me it's the whole newspaper all these other people claim to be reporters and they're anything but\nWe break a lot of news on our show and we have reporters working on the show there are only job is to find new things to flushed out do interviews I mean I you know I I had been in this my whole life so my family did I don't feel insecure about you know why you're not a journalist whatever I don't care what you call me\nBut we'd bring new facts to light\nEvery night and I see are dropped more than any other kind of explain what this means to really confusing time it's I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen why did Trump get elected ... who didn't get a black to grow up what actually happened and what actually happened was\nThe people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions about our culture our economy\nWhat actually happened was the people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions about our culture our economy our foreign policy they never said sorry and they never learned any and so voters got mad at punish them are good for them and why we're\nSo that's I that's what I think my job is to explain what ... me and I think you know maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right now\nNo I think the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it I'm not totally like for example there'll be days on this radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that I have opinions\nAnd that's what it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism is part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway talk\nA little bit weird that all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed her\nSilence why don't you know they're you know what I mean there are less than nine Tucker there is a is a handful of us Tucker there's not mine and by the way that is a orchestrated effort in millions of dollars being spent to shut down any anybody that dares\nTo not hold that prevailing left wing view but anyway we're putting it up on Hannity or on the website ... dot com\nThe ship a fool's how selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution Tucker Carlson is with us his show every night week nights eight PM ah preceding Hannity on Fox News channel and you're going to be a guest to know one of our panels tonight we look forward to have a new\nI Can't wait thank you Sean\nRight Tucker thank you Hannity dot com Amazon dot com bookstores everywhere\nA listen I Want to remind you if you are irresponsible gun owner you running out of time to clean your free lifesaving guy you're free audio book\nNow if you want the truth about what really happens when people have to God Forbid ever use a gun in self defense they're going to tell you about it it's the U.
