[noise]\nThe name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage and it is very Frank it talks about ah what Christians can and should do and also have not done and how we're actually hurting ourselves\nUm you talk about our God really kind of being identity no usually in that ad\nI think ultimately we kind of as a nation moved ourselves into factions and what I don't want is Christians to be a faction in a world of factions [noise]\nUm I think that's the part of the problem but but I think you know people identify themselves as you know I'm I'm this or that I've got a social media community and and and then that faction sort of becomes identity becomes a faction the faction becomes an echo chamber and then ultimately are we the volume just goes up up up up and the anger just goes up up up up and\nAnd we can't survive I think as a nation factional ... at this level eventually you'll Balkan eyes use a term for history will will kind of break apart and so I think the ultimate thing is I I Can't you know I Can't solve all the political things here you got much bigger platform talk about politics than I Do\nI'm just trying to help Christians to say All right how do we react and how do we respond and the answer is is not to take our identity from anything other than king Jesus and and and again I Know that's overtly spiritual but we're talking here in this\nThis focus I mean so it's to take any for Jesus Jesus is not coming back on air force one he's not riding a dump irrelevant when he does\nAnd to acknowledge that I'm only all in as a Christian in following Christ and everything else is shaped around that my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom which kind of our motto here we can college my identity is more to Christ kingdom than anything else\nSo I explain this yesterday that um you know\nIn college my identity is more to Christ kingdom than anything else\nSo I explain this yesterday that um you know the the so called Christians of the Westboro Baptist church\nYou know they they hold up signs you know God hates this Scott hates that blah blah blah they're just despicable you don't win\nBy by holding up signs no God hates view and shouting things back you win by listening by understanding by him racing them as a soul or a brother and sister not what they're doing\nStanding up but people have been changes one woman in particular that actually left her own family in the Westboro Baptist church that's right because somebody spoke to her with civil civility and said let's just reason here for a minute\nYeah that's okay I got on my desk actually ride every front of me a name played because they actually protested at my church we went out and serve them coffee and doughnuts and they called me and the national news\nI Can't use one of the words probably on the radio but a lying the false prophet and so it's actually one of my staff made into a name played it says it says lined Blanco false prophet Westboro Baptist church which by the way as either wrap diseases either Baptist church\nBut but in doing so I mean the question is how do we respond well somebody reached out actually interviewed one of members of the family as well a Christian Today to somebody reached out and I will tell you I think that's what\nWe can do right now with people who deeply disagree with us in the book is filled with examples of Christians who actually build relationships with people who radically disagreed and in the process we're able to come to maybe a better understanding of what examples for example is a\nIs the president by all university which is a Christian university in California\nAre met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party of state legislature there in California\nThat was trying to change laws that would make it illegal for viola to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more while he ended up getting to understand each other better the will the bill was ultimately not moved forward was dropped and and and now we're at a very different place now I'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying\nThat Christians need to try to do that\nAnd I do think that in doing so well act a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians historically because the the moment we're in is not time for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and and as you said earlier to your caller I'm calling people to arms\nYet that's not I mean ... that's not an uncommon view and I know some of the some of the worst\nThings I see on social media I I click on a lake and I find go to the bio and it's the first things listen the thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like and I think that's what we need is a change in a lot of hearts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us this right now or the the victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained or as slaves or you know story after story after story of these Christians\nWho I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you\nI'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're going to come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit and we're gonna crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said\nWe understand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with Peter unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book\nIt's happening or we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian\nThe apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate because you know victors right the history and the Christians would actually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about or try to hold back the advance of course it either pagan\nUh they're already so more votes than anybody on earth they've driven how many uh book retailers out of business um and they're they're about to spend more on

Democrats running for reelection spend as little time as possible talking about immigration and the immigration issue where more than a one and a half million immigrants are admitted to the country

investigation\nImpeachment of Trump open borders which they won't talk about impeachment they won't talk about\nYou have shifty shifty announcing plans for nearly a dozen brand new anti Trump

who say that they're going to vote this year but did not turn out in the twenty ten or twenty fourteen midterms\nIf the elections are held today Democrats would stand to win two hundred and twenty six

because if if the records are out there as what what comes out or is that the Saudis are claiming some sort of responsibility for this looks like they're not going to they're going to claim that senior leadership was not involved\nBut that people are in charge of it who ordered it would be held accountable there's a lot\nMore and how was that there is no until now because it shows how would they not know until now or what had happened in their consulate in Istanbul\nThat doesn't have to question and I think the big takeaway that I heard from this report we'll see what happens when secretary\nOn pay me to them and let the readout as it is not only need to to come clean on this and satisfy President Trump the secretary compel you know they have an audience and and the Congress and the Senate that they're also accountable to mind you this massive arms\nDeal is a memorandum of understanding it has not been signed by the president has bipartisan consensus for sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually been\nVery vocally among supportive of the relationship I don't agree with senator call for a number of reasons that I could go into\nWhy I think the relationship it is important but the Saudis need to understand how serious that says\nWe need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to see massive\nA movement away from their big finance arm just a few weeks secretary Mnuchin supposed to be there we saw the Dow fell off this afternoon as reports\nAnd they were threatening stake here yeah well they were threatening you know maybe even using the power\nOf their oil if in fact any of the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S stand bonds you know I mean this is getting more bizarre by the men and how does somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely sure there are really two aggravating factors year one year already brought up the fact that this happened\nIn a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that bridge every single a protocol moral ethical role imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well and you know aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media not that there's ever a permissible please I'm not saying I'm just suggesting that this makes it even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual off your so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in a diplomatic facility like that without\nThe savagery the fact that this individual or cause so he was a member of the media makes it even worse now how could it happen in a diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nAnd highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's the side that said way back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now what we do need the Saudis there's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them where on a razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I do think Trump get one more thing or shall I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they\nSeemingly tried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond you know we were this had to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah\nYeah and just to say that the thing that not only the threats that worried me that Dan just said it seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they lied to the president on this\nYou know the president came out and said that the king and ... among the crown prince had called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale unless there's something that we do not know about it looks like they have like the president I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and say oh we didn't know but I mean I I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia\nAnd well okay you're going to happen I mean the the women I chronicled the lot on this program and ...\nWomen voting and driving and set her and and being told how to dress or being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera um I'm sure you had to cover up of you left if you went out in public anywhere and what was life life like for you as a woman living under the sharia there\nYou know this is such an excellent point that you're bringing in China and the reason is is that what we actually last year\nWasn't modernization and Saturday we saw women being able to drive we saw the ... what the wrote that the government that I had to where it's called the ... I thought you were sort of looks like a high school graduation of people have seen it on television probably or if you live in a major U.S team and some people\nThe people who dress observant link but it's such a great point and that people aren't talking about what you just said is that it has been an incredibly repressive regime as it relates to win the strike for many years and and this and this new", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "15"}
