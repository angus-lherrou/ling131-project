control either house\nA for next year so we've got to do is they're supposed to last national survey had fifty five percent unfavorable rating I mean fifty five percent will be a landslide for the

trying to put the bottle down an end our bender in my new book addicted to outrage I talked about how thinking like an addict or a recovering alcoholic\nCan actually help heal the country but to get to outrage on sale now wherever books are so Arthur Brooks from Arthur\nBrooks dot com or to make sure you listen to his podcast the Arthur Brooks show\nReally smart guy really good guy musician I'm a grew up in you know in the Pacific northwest I'm like it's kind of sounds like you kind of had the you know a typical Seattle it'd be kind of family\nUh and uh went around the world is in a in a documentary I think the documentary is called a so called Arthur the pursuit\n'em and um and he's got a fascinating life and it was just really searching for answers\nCame to find that capitalism is is what solves all these problems that we have and his made huge huge increases in happiness around the world and health so\nMy problem here ... ... and the only loose and I can't tie up is people like Rockefeller but have you know they do something because you know they're ... they they discovered oil and they were smart enough to put it all together\nAnd they accumulate this power and then with all of that money comes corruption and they start to control everybody else's lives and start making all the decisions because they have all of this money how do you\nHow do you reconcile that uh because I don't want to take money away from people\nRight now I got a glass and you know it is distressing when you see something like a family where there was a patriarch it was a good entrepreneur but then kind of\nBuilt in load around the council yet and that kept a bunch of wealth\nFrom the family for six generations and made it harder for other people to rise through crony capitalism that's a big problem that's actually not capitalism that's a different system at those basically to mobile wired deal so you could find in any socialist system any monarchy\nThat's a different system that's a those basically that's a system of wired deals that you could find in any socialist system any monarchy any place all around the world\nAnd that's something that we have to fight whether it's capitalism or or whatever ... whatever is on whatever economic system that we've got\nWe have to democratize opportunity the problem is not that we've got very rich people the problem is people have a hard time rising and we have to be\nPutting our resources and our energy in our law in our initiative toward people that are at the bottom not so they can all get to the top so that they can get to the middle the essence of the American experience them the moral basis of the American experience is that the the you know three generations ago the Brooks is in the backs\nWere who were just like scratching out potatoes some place they're they're nothing more than ambitious riffraff who came to this country and wanted to get to the middle and support themselves and their families and we have to be warriors for system that makes sure that people can go from the bottom to the middle [noise]\nYou know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're gonna find that there is a system of preferences for legacies\nYou know if you went to university so four or five times more likely to your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying you got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with the with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience and so that's actually what we need to be thinking about story about Google\nWere a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery at the bottom of our society can't rise today that's that's really an American tech\nIn camp they rise they can't rise because we have a discriminatory system of unequal education were poor kids are locked into public education system of their parents don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people that if they don't go to college there somehow losers we don't have a vocational and technical education systems which are the ultimate education reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country and most importantly Klein [laughter] we don't culturally value\nThe skills that come from actually not going to college for people actually have a work skills where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did the printed system go away\n[noise] but went away for a bunch of different reasons but part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America\nWhere white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades and in you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are we threw the baby out with the bathwater\nAnd get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it\nAnd then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship ... lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history it's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody has ever thought of in the history of humanity and say\nAnd now the problem is not that this is an equal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments 'cause most I think even most conservatives um hold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden and you describe what that is\nYeah so I just this movie the pursuit that that that you mentioned in the last segment of coming out in the spring\nAnd part of it is actually filmed in Denmark in Denmark is considered to be the happiest country in the world it's a\nIt's a social democracy it has the highest tax rates in the world about Seventy five percent of your income goes to the government and so I went there I went to Denmark and hung out with some families there\nAnd the truth is if you're into that you know more power to ya but I don't see very many people were actually trying to move to Denmark I Do see lots of people in Denmark that are trying to move to America why because the the antithesis culturally\nOf what it means to be an American that all you know Danish society Scandinavian society is built on the idea and don't stand out\nDon't be different don't think the ear something special don't try to if you if you're in this country America is built by odd balls like you know like Glenn Beck and Arthur Brooks weird do to actually try to do different things and in Denmark if you\nYou know if you want to get rich or you want to start a company or you're really super religious like you and me or or you want to have eight kids forget about it they're going to look at you like you're a freak\nAnd that's a big problem so if you want to just socialism is not just the social deal socialism is actually a cultural deal\nAnd so and and and basically wherever it is the same amount of money everybody has to be awake as well so if you like being a weirdo if you like being an odd ball if you like being yourself you better stay in America and you better make the American system better don't try to get the data system\nAnd that is one reason why it has been successful\nAnd one reason why would not work here is there was no diversity there was no diversity now that they have open up the borders there's diversity and people don't want to live their life that way and it's falling apart my wrong people\nAre different people are different is look at the country of it's a boutique society of five point three million people that that day and they basically they they're like ... [laughter] you know they they kind of live in the shower\nAnd then when there's a whole bunch of of immigration look for in America you know despite the fact that we have these controversies about the wall and about the immigration system\nAnd that a lot of people listening to us today disagree on this fundamentally we all come from immigrants and we all like immigrants we'd like hard working people who come from different places and integrate into our society most most Europeans say they can't handle it\nThey don't know how to do it they don't think of themselves as fundamentally from some other place like a thousand years ago the Danish ancestors of current Danes were\nVikings living in Denmark a thousand years ago I have the slightest idea where my family was but I mean God Knows they weren't in Seattle\nUm Arthur ... one last thought people's came into it and they saw what they wanted to see one way or another I don't think it changed anybody's mind um it was all about politics and the politics of destruction I think um\nBut we ... you know when when Lindsey Graham spoke yesterday kind of feel good do a lot of people in this audience and I thought it was righteous indignation myself I think there are a lot of people that feel this way knock it off this is shameful what is happening\nUm but there is a difference between righteous indignation and and playing the game the way others are playing it um they're they're playing for destruction\nIf we reach out and play for destruction as well I think we lose and we we have in our own destruction people think that that is surrender you what you want me to surrender you want me not to say anything that's not what I'm saying I'm saying fight the right way\nPeople kind of given up on being able to win\nA without playing dirty and you make a case that they shouldn't do that\nYeah I Know there were Glenn Beck's fixtures right now everybody's got to listen this is the truth\nYou know there is not a long term or that comes from being a bad person\nThat you know here's the key thing here that most people listening to us so they're conservatives like you and me and there were watching the the the they have a they have their own filter bubble look we all hear things through our own experience and through our own biases I got it I got it [noise]\nBut standing up when in righteous ignition look as your senator and you're in a hearing fine but for the rest of us standing up to\nThe left standing up to the other side when they're wrong around the Thanksgiving table or on social media is a very limited impact why because\nWe're not going to actually be taken seriously unless we hold our own side to the same moral standard to have a we really want to be effective on the right what we need to do is we need to look at contempt and hatred and mockery and sarcasm and derision on the right\nAnd call it out and said these are not these arguments are not living up to my own moral standard\nAnd we hold ourselves to a higher moral standard we will not lose I've got the data on his client\nIs and and the long run the the moral high road which doesn't have to be weak don't have to give in to anybody else's argument but the say through love and respect I Believe that you are not living up to your own objective [noise] Tennessee to our own side we will not stand for hatred\nThat's not who we are that's the secret to long term success I\nI Believe that we're entering a time and yesterday I only have ended where people see this\nLong term success I I Believe that we're entering a time and yesterday I didn't only hastened it\nWhere people see this and they don't want to be a part of either side they don't want to be a part they're good Democrats who do not stand where they have to enter bothered by that um but I don't think they have anywhere to go because uh we had been painted as haters\nBut also um we are we shut down people not the way they do necessarily on the left but it feels good to do that do you see any movement on the left\nThat common sense Democrats are starting to say wait a minute I I'm not in lockstep with this\nI Do this is this is not what gets all the publicity screaming ladder is what gets all of a let's say on the writing on the left I look at the data Seventy percent of Americans hate it\nThey feel that they're being out on that and again this is half right wing and a half left wing Seventy percent of Americans believe that were being held hostage or being terrorized\nBy powerful people who are profiting from us hating each other\nAnd saying terrible thing to each other and they don't like it they they they they want to fight back we have uh the the the opportunity to create a new moral movement where we can bring are brothers and sisters on the central left and even on the left together to try to solve some problems in this country and where we can say\nI don't hate you these kinds of these what's going on in the Senate right now what's going on at the hearings right now as a proxy battle it's like an angle and the civil war where the Soviet Union in the United states are sending troops against each other than the Nineteen eighties\nTo fight it out on somebody else's battleground Americans have to say enough with the ideological this ideological warfare between right and left and we're we're being the ones in the middle where we're effectively being held hostage\nWe want better than this in this country we we don't have to back down from conservatives at all we just have to recognize that we don't have to agree\nIt's okay in this country to have actual disagreement that's the basis of our excellent you know your message has always been so good and fled because you don't hate anybody and we have to\nAs leaders we have an opportunity to help Americans to love their enemies and in so doing to find the basis of our strength\nArthur Brooks thank you so much for being on the program we have to have you on more

... let me just give me a couple let's say he is confirmed\nOkay he's confirmed but this kind of perjury stuff is percolating and they just make hay out of it um we go back to normal and ... the GOP loses the house to the Democrats\nThe Democrats than are going to demand testimony from Donald Trump because they're going to try to impeach him they're going to demand is tax records because they're going to impeach him and the White House response by going to the Supreme Court and says that the president of the time to do this yadda yadda\nUm and the Democrats than um wants a Kavanaugh to recuse himself he won't do what you all do it doesn't happen a and the the house then moved to impeach Kavanaugh\nGay so we got a year or ... or ... or let's say he's not confirmed because flake or Collins or Murkowski or Heller okay they just don't believe in and the Republicans dropped the ball they have NO PLAN\nAnd they just like well you know and where you need your vote because we're a repeal Obamacare do\nThey lose the house and possibly the Senate worst case scenario if they don't get they don't get them through they they don't have the Republicans and because of this week with Jeff Flake\nPeople are just like okay the Republicans are worthless and they don't come out with a huge plant yeah I think you're right they'll try to turn that into a reason to get to the polls but if if it's the Republicans that cause it I don't know how to that kind of where I don't think it'll work okay\nAnother scenario he is confirmed the house impeach is Trump the house or in peaches Kavanaugh on perjury [laughter] think that is\nIf they win the house you know they're gonna at least attempt to they will attempt jump and probably Kavanaugh to correct if we lose the house and the Senate\nThings are happening and they're well there's no chance of them being removed but you will have the next two years of non\nIt's been hearings of both capital and Trump OK mhm\nThe only one that seems good to me is I'm a ... if Kavanaugh loses the vote\nThe only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the vote which could be really bad because it will be the Republicans that do it\nUm however Donald Trump comes out and while she says yup that's over here's the guy he ups the ante and you get a guy that all conservatives are rabbit about\nPay somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a skill Leah\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites I mean they're okay with him but no I was willing to die in a sword for memory might remember cabinet was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them he item leader I personally think the best course of action\nIs to nominate let's say let's say flake and Collins come out and go you know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great\nDonald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next the nominee and you know what he's already been vetted for the FBI and every senator knows them\nSo we're going to be calling for a vote next week easy easy you know yeah\nThe thing to do because then you have them battling just thought abortion right there at the same place they'd have about everybody correct and that's not going to hurt conservatives getting to the polls if if you put a staunch conservative somebody who says yeah\nI think abortion is wrong and if it comes before me I'll look at the case of course but I think it's wrong I think it's murder\nBut ... lives in I mean you\nI mean you don't have video tape ...\nTape now we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotape that exist some uh uh one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there is no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the\nWith the with the ... and we don't have that evidence yeah I mean we have a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we I mean like we have them out more I was like we have a preponderance of evidence in in the Alice in case there however um what's interesting about this\nIs that fifty six percent of Democrats believe Christine Blasey Ford's allegations fifty six percent only eight percent say they ... they believe Kavanaugh fifty six to eight\nIs a split there so you assume\nThat if you ask people and it wasn't a partisan situation what do you think about the Alison situation do you what do you believe from her 'cause she's got a more recent allegation she's actually brought it to the attention in real time to multiple people people around her have seen evidence of this there's text messages there is a there are medical notes all the evidence that we just talked about there's\nAn infinity amount times more evidence and the Alice in case\nGet only five percent of Democrats believe Allison's accuser we're told over and over again that women are to be believed he'd only five percent of Democrats believe the allegations against Keith Ellison and here's\nWhy this is really important I'm just like I don't want an abuser and the Supreme Court\nIf if there was the amount of evidence on Kavanaugh but there is on a Keith Ellison I Would not be for Kevin I Would you if there was amount on cabinet and I would yeah I Would if if if the evidence was the same word of mouth [noise]\nWe still have a standard here in this country um called innocent until proven guilty and preponderance of evidence is a slower is a lower level than that\nAnd I understand that um my issue here would be\nYou can once there isn't the legal standards because people will say well this is just a job interview or this is just that this isn't a legal proceeding once you have the absence of a legal standard you have to choose the standard you apply\nI Choose to apply a very high standard because people who are in relationships many many times when he relationships breakup or someone feels jolted say things that are not true I have all that I agree with oh wait wait you know in this case\nI'm Keith Ellison should have the right to defend himself and he should we\nShould assume his innocence unless I agree point in which he is and if especially with a case like this where it's very recent\nThat should just go through the legal system and when he comes out and he's guilty then he should get thrown out of that job and you can factor that in in your vote if you wish but I don't think he should lose any job because of this at this point he needs to you need to be\nIt thrown out of that job and you can factor that in in your vote if you wish but I don't think he should lose any job because of this at this point he needs to you need to be able to see\nWhether this case goes through and and claims are proven someone had said they have video we need to see the video we see everyone a ... in investigated we need to see an actual police\nAre investigation go through and and and see whether the evidence leads us to a belief that he actually committed these acts if we do not get that\nYou do not ruin people's lives over it I mean think about the amount of times of evidence that there is a with Keith Ellison overall you more which everyone I mean even at a lot of people on the right we're like look ... really looked like he did these things his answers are really bad\n... you know there's much more evidence for the ... much more there's people you can interview right now yeah children who went through traumatic moments where they had to read about their mom being abused or you know sure her telling other friends at the time\nThat being said however you didn't you went through this process where the presumption of innocence agree\nSo but what I Know about she fell assumes the evidence against him [noise] okay\nAssuming this was not current day and it was thirty five years ago if for ... would come with that evidence I have letters I have a photo of the bruises\nOn my arm I have um ah\nI can tell you where it happened I told my friends and here they are they verify that I told them after the party would you not\nWould you not go okay I think that's good yeah I mean I think that would be enough and it was the only way we can judge this situation wrecked right correct here it is with Alison and again this is why it's important\nJust like I don't want to have a Supreme Court justice that is an abuser or a liar or whatever I also think it's extraordinarily dangerous to have a guy who\nMay have beaten his girlfriend may have mentally abused his girlfriend assuming the evidence is real and checks out you can't have him as the as the the the chief law enforcement of the state\nRight and just anybody care no this shows you that nobody in the media\nCares at an iota\nFor this woman and her story they don't care if she was abused as they don't care about any of it what they care about is stopping Brett Kavanaugh if they care they would be just as passionate as a guy let's not just thrown out of the Minnesota attorney general this is the guy who was second in charge of the dean what the the DNC ...\nThis is not a a a minority a peripheral figure in politics he's one of the most powerful Democrats in America and is now going to be a chief law enforcement officer for state\nAnd you could say oh well it's all you're what you're doing is what about Islam\nNo no it's not it's not what about ... and I apply the same standard Ellison that I applied to Kavanaugh you weren't doing this to Kevin I Would still be saying is about I'm I'm a about Alice\nYeah and look at going back to why it's rocket why was Brock Obama president\nAbout was president because he won a presidential election in two thousand eight\nPreviously he made a heck of a speech and what two thousand four right\nAnd that's your thousand for ... election he won a Senate seat a Senate seat that would have been incredibly close if he was going against Alan Keyes who they flew in the last week so just started a campaign\nBut it was a Jack Jack Ryan but it might be thinking of junk present day at this point I'm [laughter] I think too many Amazon commercials but uh\nA pain but it was a Jack Jack Ryan but it might be thinking of John ... at this point I'm like I think too many Amazon commercials but uh Ryan was his last name and he was a legitimate challenger to Brock Obama in that Senate race it was a close election and he may have won it\nAs a Republican in Illinois wow and what they did it they went through his divorce is sealed divorce or um hearings and his and paper work out at it to the public and in there there were accusations by his wife the actress who said they went to swingers clubs and all this sort of shady stuff\nDo we know if that was true in added course proceeding and the divorce proceeding people make all sorts of claims yeah and that's why you don't just believe them\nThat's why the ... because they went and got them unsealed in a democratic state and they they they ... Brian eventually dropped out there was no real opposition for Rocco bomb and you've got eight years of\nThat sort of thing should be always viewed skeptically every claim of a crime should be viewed skeptically by people on that side\nYou're supposed to give the presumption of innocence and they all close to start with skepticism of a claim on any side on any side on any side of all people who are accused and here we are in a situation where Democrats overwhelmingly believe the accusations against capital with almost no evidence\nAnd they only five percent of them believe the woman who is a Democrat who does not want someone up a ideologically opposed to ... to ... and to have that job she's a Democrat and only five percent of people believe her\nThe the platitudes you hear from the media and the left mean nothing on the story they do not care about whether for was abused or not they don't [noise]\nAnd this shows you how fast that standard is applied and how [noise]\nAnd how your life could be destroyed you are on the wrong side of an issue and by the way I think you've seen\nThe issues to change\nAnd positions what's politically correct changes and if you don't abide one hundred percent and you're not on the right side will destroy your life [noise]\nWhile they'll let somebody else be fine [noise]\nThis is why we must have a standard we must have a standard [noise] getting dangerous to be an American [noise] that's the frightening thing to say [noise]\nGlad that\nYou know that the tone of programs you can watch on demand\nHas a ... flash TV you can watch every episode uh for the record and watching to see documentaries one of those buildings draw house for terrorists to see actually actually competition", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Billings", "day": "06"}
