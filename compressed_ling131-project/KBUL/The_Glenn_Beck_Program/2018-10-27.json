... coming from the right you remember two thousand tendency party wave the biggest wave\nThe amount of passion or that has been cut coming from the right you remember\nTwo thousand tendency party

were still pretty strong year for Republicans and twenty fourteen\nIn two thousand six he saw the opposite you saw Democrats are in the last years of the Bush administration have a really strong mid term into thousand six but\nYou know generally speaking people aren't as passionate the numbers however for this midterm election or off the charts and it's interesting Glenn was pointing out before or the show that were brought up on what was the sort of celebrity presidential candidate\nAnd he would have these huge rallies in two thousand eight and you remember the one in Denver I mean he was a\n...

huge turnout in the street\nBut no one was going to see the president in those stadiums in arenas they still with book the arena but I remember distinctly covering them saying turn the camera around and they were half\nEmpty room yeah\nThe passion was gone drawn into it we're not seeing that with Trump I mean these rallies seem to be as well attended as they were during the campaign of Don ... sometimes more so right so there's no drop in the passion seemingly among Republicans in the same thing seems to be happening with Democrats as much as it a is a positive\nSo some of those polls are for that some after okay um all the October ones obviously after ... men include the migrants caravan situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the

Washington Post is he is he\nOr does he have a point of view that Washington happens to light up about a Saudi Arabia and that is the Muslim Brotherhood perspective\nSo you remember the Muslim Brotherhood founded in the Nineteen twenties in Egypt the only reason for being was to reject the west and establish global surreal law\nThey exported this organization all over the middle east anti Semitism towards a Jews their biggest and most effective tool and harnessing the Arab rage Muslim Brotherhood they're the ones who invented modern day jihadism they are the ones who wins\nThe other founding members of al ... to do any administration a member from the Obama administration you cannot call them a largely secular organization\nWhen you read just their motto Allah is our goal the profit our model look around our constitution jihad our plan and death for the sake of all of the ... of our wishes they're not primarily a secular organization\nThe Muslim Brotherhood of the calls jihad the industry of death\nAnd they mean that in a good way in their own words to a nation that protects the industry of death and which knows how to die noble e God gives proud life in this world\nOkay that doesn't sound secular doesn't sound like somebody we should be in bed with\nBut the Muslim Brotherhood ran up against a problem and that was one of them the kingdom of of Saudi Arabia\nBecause it was backed by the west any of these kingdoms in the middle East that have been backed by the west Jordan will be next anybody who stands in their way\nThey had to destroy the these were democracies so how are we going to do it well the Muslim Brotherhood decided to switch tactics and weaponize democracy\nEnter the Arab Spring the Arab Spring\nPraised by everyone we told you their goal is a caliphate while it never materialized ...\nNo no not there it materialized from the chain of events with ISIS\nWhat you were talking about the Muslim Brotherhood right and what happened to the Muslim\nBrotherhood did they just choose not to do a caliphate oh no no they were overthrown\nOh the Muslim Brotherhood still wants their caliphate\nSo now you have two of our allies turkey Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis\nWhile hobbyists who are both Jay chasing the same exact dream a Middle East and the world dominated by surreal law both of them Ewing using jihadism as a as a means to their ends\n[noise] so ... year could show or whatever you're calling him today\nNow where you look at him he is he is a\nGuy who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood I Want to say this no one deserves this kind of death this is not to excuse the Saudis they're bad guys\nBut so is turkey and so was he\nEverybody here all that's Saudi progressive fighting for democracy no\nNo no no\nHe was fighting for the Muslim Brotherhood in the Nineteen eighties and nineties he was one of the king's main allies he edited several Saudi newspapers which he was basically Winston Smith in Orwell's Nineteen eighty four sitting in the Saudi version of the ministry of truth ebbing editing out all thought\nCrime makes sure that there was never anything hospitals that about ... or the king\nDuring this time he'd cozy up to Osama bin Laden he scored several interviews while al ... was fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan Saudi intelligence employed him to be the middle man but\nOil family will in two thousand three he fell out of favor with the Saudi royals when he allowed to be published a an article critical to the ... hobbyist movement\nWhy did he do that\n... because he's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and they were at odds with the well hobbyists\n... was cast aside\nAnd that's when the western media fell in love with him an active member of the Muslim Brotherhood not us smear or conspiracy theory in his own words yes I joined the Muslim Brotherhood organization and I was not alone\nAnd quote\nHis Muslim Brotherhood friends in clerics were all in prison in Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring\nHe got out he came to the U.S\nHe established a political party while in exile called democracy for the Arab world now party\nThe liberals the progressives the press loved him because they heard the word democracy it's the Muslim Brotherhood plan to subvert democracy by turning it against itself\nHe wants wanted to establish sharia law in the region\nWho was also a wicked anti Semite who wrote quote outside the context of history and logic the Jews will have to die by force\n\nOh Israel's outside the context of history and logic so we're gonna have to kill all of them\nThis is not a smear campaign when you hear somebody say that you make sure you ask them where are you doing your homework where are you getting that why is that a smear campaign\nTo say that he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly was in his own words so why is that a smear campaign because I thought the Muslim Brotherhood was largely secular\nAsked people how much do you know about the caliphate how much do you know about the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood how much do you really know about what this man wrote\nThis man wrote that he ... it was a mistake\nTo think that you could have any kind of state in the middle east without some form of Islam is this\n\nNow that's different remember then Islam in his ... believes you have to use sharia law\nThat the constant wow it sounds like the mother Muslim Brotherhood that's our constitution that is our law sugary a law\nSo\nLet's just begin to tell each other the truth and here's the truth turkey is not a friend of ours turkey is in with the Muslim Brotherhood\nTurkey would like to have a caliphate run by them Saudi Arabia not good people Saudi Arabia huge exporter of ... and has done it here in the United states has spent money building mosques that are very dangerous here in the United states true\nThey kill him could be probably seems like it\nI don't trust the Muslim Brotherhood in Turkey but I also don't trust those guys one of them killed him\nProbably Saudi Arabia\nThe Muslim Brotherhood in Turkey but I also don't trust those guys one\n\n\n\n[noise]\nHeartbreak in Pittsburgh I'm Joe you're on the

fakes which I Hope to get into\nBut I Want to start with his with his book and the thing that everybody is talking about\nThem why we hate each other and how to heal Ben Sasse a welcome to the program senator from Nebraska how are you sir\nI'm doing well Nebraska's got a winning streak going again so we're happy with our lab [noise]\nUm that I Want to talk to you and I I I Want to ask you the questions basically that everyone asks me because we are\n... on on some things in the same pocket or and I'm I just want to hear your response to this um uh you know some some line of questioning that usually comes my way\nWe have a situation to where people have felt they have tried to do the right thing\nThey have tried to do the Tea Party and they were accused of being racist and they were accused of being violent which they weren't meanwhile the press and politicians excused people like ... and it's getting worse and worse\nNo we're not anti capitalists we're not anti American and then Hillary Clinton says one of the reasons she lost was because she was for capitalism you have Cortez coming out and Bernie Sanders\nAnd then Hillary Clinton says one of the reasons she lost was because

and the uh on the ball field the press is still ignoring all of this blaming everything on the right\nThen Kavanaugh they're willing to take all the way he to yuppies the gang rapist and destroyed people when is enough enough\n[noise] well so first of all the way we consume politics is a mess and lots of our political discussion itself is a mess\nBut I think it's really important to distinguish between two dimensions one dimension is a continuum from right to left and on those issues I'm as conservative as they come on anybody score card on the second or third most conservative senator or in the United States Senate um but the second dimension is about the intensification of politics\nAnd how centrally should politics sit in your world view\nAnd they're on the big skeptic because I'm a traditional American or of the idea that politics can be near the center of your world view and you end up very happy\n\nUm Mm Mm\nMm [noise]\n[noise] Mm [noise]\n\nForty five seconds\nMm\n\nI think [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] ...\nWe're talking to a ... [noise] and I have so many places I Would like to uh go with your view um and and talk to the senator about we're going to run out of time uh I Would like to invite you to do a um an hour and a half uninterrupted podcast with me under when you have time\nOr because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood\nAnd parts of it challenged I'm sure but uh I I Would like to just pick up on this point so the number one driver of happiness is vocation your one guy that will understand that if that's true in the next ten years we're in deep trouble\nWe're headed toward a really interesting time in human history it's scary and fascinating so somebody some people shortly after that so the ... the economy I think the simpler way to think about it is just the\nAverage duration of people's jobs or their relationship at a farm is going to get shorter than ever before in human history so let's go back row for a minute hunter gatherers throughout most of human history you don't have any conception of what your job is you pursue that buffalo\nSo let's go macro for a minute hunter gatherers throughout most of human history\nYou don't have any conception of what your job is you pursue that buffalo right and then ten thousand years ago people settled down and started planting and harvesting and we we into farm on a on a regular cycle and from ten thousand years ago to a hundred and fifty years ago nobody had jumped choice they just did with grandma and grandpa and mom and dad and aunts and uncles had ever had done forever\nEternity past with the industrial revolution we get jobs specialization and it was really disruptive\nBut when people took a job they still kept it till death of retirement not everybody graduated high school at the beginning of the industrial revolution by the end almost everybody does\nBut you still get one job at some time between Fifteen and twenty two years old and you keep it for all of your life I was born in the Nineteen seventies average duration that affirmed for a primary breadwinner then was still twenty six years\nNow it's four years and getting shorter and it's going to get shorter forever more McKenzie a farm I used to work with believes that fifty percent of the American labor market by three years from now this is not Twenty years in the future\nThree years from now they think fifty percent of the labor market will be primarily freelancers\nMeaning that most people will cobble together a bunch of different jobs not all of them are going to be ap enabled tech jobs like being a new driver with the right software that makes you more efficient than an old school Gabby but\nWhat's really going to happen is we're going to head toward a world where people are going to get disrupted out of their jobs at aged forty and forty five and fifty and fifty five\nForever more we've never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the banks of what's often called now the quarter life crisis\nThe sort of late adolescence crisis of trying to figure out your your role in life and how do you go from just being a consumer and mom and dad's house to being a producer that can not just put bread on the table for your kids can actually have a sense of meaning that you're serving your neighbor that disruption that most people know in late adolescence working experience that again every three to five years for our whole life\nAnd that means there's a lot of new potential for upheaval and frankly for unhappiness\nThere's going to be more economic output than it's ever been produced before in human history but it's not at all clear that it will redound to the median family in the median household and the media and worker or going to have to become a civilization of lifelong workers able to get retrained when you're forty nobody's ever done that before\n[laughter] okay so there's about an hour of questions or just on on that one uh but I've got about three minutes left can you give me\nA ... your take on the first real political upheaval that we're going to see that I think by twenty twenty you could change everything could start global wars the fakes\nYeah so one of the reasons I wrote them is because I spent a lot of time on intelligence issues and I'm In the intel community there are people who talk about the perfect storm of deep fakes that we have coming\nAnd the storm is these three ingredients number one new technology makes it possible to sort of narrow cast a world with fake audio and fake video where lots of people can be susceptible to being sort of\nUm a spoof or persuaded the things that aren't real are real there's always been enemies doing malicious actor you know information warfare since the beginning of time you can find it in proverbs and ... these are to sow discord in an enemies tent\nBut it used to require a prostitute now honey trapping effect business partner in a bribery scheme\nAnd more ... to get people around people number one\nIs now we can use technology to surround someone and give them a fake experience and ... are fakes audio and fake video that are going to seem really gonna make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad at it the real reason we need to take the Russia\nType investigation so seriously as because China's right behind them running scout team off since I'm On that\nReal reason we need to take the Russia type investigation so seriously as because China's right behind them running scout team often I'm On them and ready to do\nBig deep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and business officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions about geography about race about gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided\nThat we are susceptible to these kind of campaigns like Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they\nTry to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL dealing controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media and the first Seventy two hours after that flamed\nLast fall the majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taken the NFL most of it was Russia on both sides and so we're going to have a world where you're going to have things like the cabinet hearings where all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer's strategizing with Michael ... or video will appear it'll be fake\nBut video will appear and it'll be Kavanaugh partying art as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake but in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be a potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them\nA why we hate each other is an awareness that there's actually national security exposures for this country and how much we hate each other around politics we need communities of people that live\nIn the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise] [noise]\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\n[noise] ah it took a sweat twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere at a McDonald's right now who probably slap to an old man wearing a mock a hat\nAnd uh that person is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of ... pecking and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have about thirty I've got thirty seconds I'm not getting even ask you I'm not even ask you I Would like to ask you to come down a band and and really unpack this because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood and I think in soundbites\nUm it's not to not always understood I'm so thank you very much\nFor the impact good to be with your line but\nSenator Ben Sasse um why we hate each other and how to heal I really wanted that you really want to get into him on taking on your own\nOh you're a conspiracy theorist weight she just said it at one point [laughter]\nOh I mean first of all the you know the press is a collection of individuals some of which do a good job some of which do not\nAh so it's important to make those decisions I think um and you know look at that is a this was just this is going on at our founding and people were doing it at our founding an end it at our founding but we've what we we realize is when we were in a gauge and informed populace we chose correctly\nRight I mean I I you know if we're not\nWell we know what the ... which we know a Republican you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's going to fall apart we knew this was an experiment and that was the risk of it\nAnd I think we are seeing some some of those risks pop their heads up but I mean the whole foundation of this country is to let people come out and make their arguments\nAnd we have to make our back that does not mean I'm In a minute diplomacy thing and I was so encourage I Hope you are too so encouraged by the ... ... a reaction from conservatives\n... shouted down\nA and I did not see a heap\nOf support from conservatives over the actions of the people protesting hurting I didn't see I was disgusted by I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't see any I didn't now I'm not saying there were none I'm sure people will show me a tweet if some you know not job who was like I think they should harass Nancy Pelosi at dinner\nBut I didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actions not one you could see if we can we played dozens of Democrat and you\nKnow here's here's here's one from Sean King I've said it before but I Need to say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so but I'm Glad we have people in this country who stand up to a fascist and a bigotry and are willing to confront ape face to face right and you know there's nothing on the left there are\nEven prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened to policy and that's right and I'm Glad\n... even prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened to policy and that's right and I'm Glad they mean that that shows that there's still you know even though we're divided and even though a lot of things come down to the minute you know emotional politics that go minute to minute I'm Glad to see that there's still principles there\nSo here's where I think than was wrong when he said to deal with the ... um he was right when he said you know it's a small group so small groom\nHe's right it is a very small group and they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media but it is a small group where I think he's wrong is ignore it\nHe's a part of the solution is ignoring it yeah and I think you know 'cause you can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the alt right right you know the Charlottesville situation um you know\nThere's obviously a crime committed there that you can't ignore right um but generally speaking when well bunch of Nazis or KKK members just even having forever these ... and go back for a broken ... members walk through your town like ... you know largely speaking it's great to ignore them because they want attention and they run they\nMost that's not what we have now we have a chance of a breaking laws you can't ignore them not came you know you can't ignore that I don't care if it's the Nazis or ... you can't ignore the excess\nWould argue nor the right I mean like I think he's saying that we get a little bit too wrapped up in the back and forth of viral videos and people who are not even really engaged in politics\n[noise] getting freaked out over things that they're never going to have to necessarily deal with if you just missed a group like as a photo
