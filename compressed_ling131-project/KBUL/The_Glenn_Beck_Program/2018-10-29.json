six four to eighty eight fifty five eight hundred six four to eighty eight fifty five sweetie\nClaim that [noise] I don't know about you but I'm tired of the same old politics and uh Larry sharp is joining us now he is running for governor in a New York and I\nThink his ideas need to be heard and he needs to be a he needs to be introduced to a larger audience how what is your organization like what's your ground the game yeah we have we have\nUm if probably ever we have over seven or eight directors campaign manager\nAbout thirty five to fifty people who are actively working every day on every aspect of the campaign to include things like a scheduling setting up a fan of fixing our calendar\nOr making sure people show of social media we have a a team on Twitter or team on Instagram a team on Facebook where we have a team when everything YouTube we do video production\nWhen he went on and you don't have but you you're lacking money you're up against people who have\nTens of millions of tens of millions of dollars absolutely we've raised almost half a million\nBut to be to be clear if in these last couple of weeks if we raise another fifty thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars this becomes winnable I Know it sounds crazy but it is and the reason is name recognition is my only issue the last poll we put out I was at about one third name recognition and with that I pulled that Thirteen percent\nSo you can do the math on that one three times to get to a hundred percent equals thirty nine percent right through times Thirteen they're not ... percent this is a five way race thirty percent when this thing\nSo I'm nine points above victory\nAssuming I get a hundred percent there is the hard part writes a math equation cannot get two hundred percent and sadly that's not my message I've got that down\nIt's the media can I get my name out to enough people to where I cross over that barrier which gets to be over the third person I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win yes it is really is as well get get remember as third party in general the system is act against you\nAnd some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality could do this\nBecause every day I'm up against failure but the marine corps taught me take the hill the captain shot take the hill the machine guns broken take the hill radios don't work take the hell are stopped giving excuses take fail I get it and that's what I Do have to take the hill as a matter\nI get I literally deal with failure every day this woman every day and when I say that that's not an exaggeration that's every single day as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS\nAnd they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even those thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot\nWCBS they got him him shelling is his name he there's decided no lottery shop dozens of beyond their he's decided that the establishment as all that matters this is what I'm up against it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that to you think should be heard than you should probably um maybe tweet storm\nWhat's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think Tim shelled so this is a radio debate yes again and they're just deciding no we don't want them don't me wrong there are three other people should be made should also be the Green Party and also the party they should all be there\nBut this is the norm and we put up against this Web against is constantly and here's the the worst part\nWith all of this we're still roaming and they're still going down\nThat's that's the sad part they don't they don't\nThey don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate hopefully doing\nLarry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to get forty five thousand dollars you can't the maximum forty four thousand [laughter] by New York state law so if you I Know what I Want to get like forty five thousand dollars sorry you can't do it forty four you only can get forty four thousand that's all you can get\nA okay Larry sharp a dot com this with an e at the end of sharp um I Want I Want to talk to you about some of the issues of the day and and how we solve some of the things like for instance healthcare yes how to use all health care will do that coming up in a just a second a standby on television\nWhen it yes it is so bad it is so bad that the Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they are pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and his pension is now aren't being spent the New York state they being spent in Florida we're lily we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes so let's take pensions do sure pensions are\n... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises general who work their whole life and were promised ally yup what do you do\nYou see here in Texas with your belief or oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you ate already already happening and they have all the time you're\nIn New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation ... show painted a critical right now Penn is er about Fifteen or sixteen percent of our budget and a budget is a hundred and Seventy billion dollars it's double Florida in Florida has more people than us\nWow yes for his about eighty five billion and the more people than us and we have a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget how about just massive\nAnd it's getting bigger the budget getting bigger and so are the percentages of the other pensions but on top of that a New York state has about a three hundred dollar debt and about a fortified they know that ...\nSo it's a bad bad bad and then you add that people always tell me\nIt's good they write the fund itself is relatively well some of the ups they ... up and you're doing very well some of the city wants or disaster but overall it's er and well they don't realize it's being also funded by our tax base our budget that keeps putting money into it the problem is is a fun right now that's great the problem is the actual budget\nAt one point it gets so big that we simply can't pay me more as you're seeing in Dallas and my response that goes on but Larry's in the constitution yeah and\nI get that asked Detroit right ass and Puerto Rico\nRight ask Venezuela ... it was all legal for them to one there's no money it does get funded when it doesn't get funded that eventually will collapse if that collapses if our pension fund collapsed near state we become Somalia overnight\nI don't want to become a Somali overnight I Want to stop that I'm the only guy talking about negotiating our pensions into the right which is some type of four one K. for three to be something like that and I'm going to go see it with every single union that will take forever I Know that's why says a four year plan\nIt's for you plan to make us or what New York state is paying either a flat fee and or a flat percentage that sustainable because the issue we have is a a lot of people are pensions who no longer paying it any more mhm so we just have to keep paying them until they do need pennies anymore so we have to do that also\nUsed to be like ten firefighters reporting one now it's one supporting\nTend to Iraq I think actually were supporting for ... I think that's right I'm not sure but I was making them I think it's something I think it was supporting three or four or so yeah it's bad so now we have to make that change and the funny thing is people are attacking me saying lie wants to get rid of our pensions I'm like I'm the only guy trying to keep them\nOn the other one talking about reality I'm Sorry I was actually happening if you ever if you're ready for a pension now it's ten or Fifteen Years from now it's probably not going to be there for you\nPut wide deal with that I mean it's human nature why deal with that if the two on the other side GOP and the Democrats are saying oh he's an extremist he's he's trying to spook you your pensions are fine it's human nature to follow them\nAgreed but I have a problem Glenn I care I have a problem I'm human I have a problem\nI Want people to stay in my state I Want people to stay in my state because if they don't my state's gonna collapse and I have to move\nAnd I don't want to move I'm born and raised in New York state my family and friends are in New York state I Love my state ... ... people love New York the heat in the U.S government New York state is very special it has the largest city in the entire nation it has an amazing waterfall negra falls it has mountains as\nCool as Colorado and has farmland and little as yes I'm In New York ... no ... no farmland as cool as it mid west\nIt has amazing rivers and lakes and every you can imagine in New York is there is a beautiful diverse states and we're destroying it because wedding one city run the entire state\nMost of my my ideas about happiness but the other part is decentralization it's about letting counties ... counties in regions be regions in towns me towns right people upstate tend to get upset with people in New York City saying well they're running it and they are bad and cut them off\nIf you ran your own county you wouldn't care and that's what I Want to let people in New York City ... New York city isn't by um W ... Rochester\nIsn't that what we're we're debating now over the electoral college the only reason why we're debating the electoral college is because it's the original debate I don't want New York city yes just tell me in the middle of the country\nHow to live my life you asked your lead San Francisco bay San Francisco and you want to lay hoop on the streets that's fine yes but we're different here yes\nMaybe you want to visit them once in a while right then ... look at the poop refine whatever whatever your thing is and they shouldn't be allowed to do to their city their county what they want to do a hundred percent true and it's not happening in the east\nWhenever I whenever you're thing is and they shouldn't be allowed to do to their city their county what they want to do a hundred percent true and it's not happening and the issue is we are getting more and more centralized control it happens in any large organization as I told you I'm a business guy\nRight and I'm the guy who I Will come in sometimes and try to help businesses to fix that make things better and the last thing I say as iron fist\nIt's the last thing I say I hear all the time I go to a business owner and he goes my my leaders aren't doing with them what they should do I can't get to innovate ... to take it because you're taking your all your things and the last thing I say it's iron fist\nI say give them actually more freedom here's what I Know it's it's literally an equation [noise] personal freedom\nPlus transparency plus accountability equals innovation that happens all the time so you give the people more freedom let the leaders take charge some all make mistakes but ... as long as you ... you learn from them you become humbled by them which is fine we all make mistakes\nBut then what you don't want to simply want to make a mistake blame someone else\nNow you see that these leaders you don't need which are the ones who will not make any mistakes there doing nothing those illiterate you don't need you need the ones to get up try do well hit a couple of home runs strike out sometimes get better become humble to become better leaders in the long run that how you make a better organization we don't have that now\nLeary is going to join me for a a pod cast you'll hear a about Ninety minutes uninterrupted a and we'll put that out on Saturday um Larry sharp is his name and ah you you need to be a need to listen to him I have a feeling\nOf doesn't when New York we're going to be seen him a again a perhaps the elsewhere but he is um he's worth your time to listen to and if you're in New York consider voting for can't imagine\nI Can't imagine what would stop you because it's not working as it is but that's just me Leary sharp a S.

these were democracies so how are we going to do it well the Muslim Brotherhood decided to switch tactics and weaponize democracy enter the Arab Spring the Arab Spring praised by\nEveryone we told you

make sure you ask them where are you doing your homework where are you getting that why is that a smear campaign to say that he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly was in his own words so why is that a smear campaign because I thought the Muslim Brotherhood was largely secular\nAsked people how much do you know about the caliphate how much do you know about the founding of the

killed people\nSouth Daytona police investigating after they said that someone shot out the window of the local county Republican headquarters belief set a worker arrived Monday morning saw the damage called authorities\nWe have another threat of a man has accused the guy who's been arrested by threatening to kill Florida congressman Carlos\nCurbelo that story came out this week yet he's been threatened\nThere was a campaign rally would Lindsey Graham and Marsha Blackburn and he had an angry leftist mob disrupt disrupting that and a half a dozen angry liberal protestors\nThey had to be removed\nAnd you'd think of the language or we can't be civil with Republicans and\nKick them and\nAll the other comments that have been made and then the other silence what had happened to a conservative\nReally shouldn't be something that's political and\nCalling somebody fake news I mean it is so disgusting overt CNN\nSomebody sent me a transcript I guess it was on news busters of home the dump the\nOh I understand that CNN doesn't like fake news and they don't like being called fake news but they are fake news they're not a news organization anymore they have gone fulltime destroyed Trump every second of every minute pretty much of every day\nThat's what they do so they have this panel I guess if they put together\nAnd they're talking about what happened in the synagogue shooting and we have to look closely at the poison being spread sometimes on television sometimes out of the mouths of political leaders and often times on ugly dark corners of social media as can be pretty ugly\nThen it goes on the first panelist as Bill Kristol or never Trump or he attacks Fox News\nI'm like hello what we can't have conservatives in my I support mainstream conservatism\nBill I don't know what happened to you\nI support original is on the Supreme Court I support lower taxes less government burdensome regulation I support energy independence\nI support legal immigration I support border security I support peace through strength at a tough national security posture with a strong military to defend the values that we all believe in\nAnd I support\nYou know a free press even to be wrong even criticize the media for being role at a Washington Post columnist comes out some woman I've never heard of Margaret Sullivan\nYou know her praising or analysis and the Democratic threats et cetera et cetera reads like a list of Sean Hannity's free broad ... broadcast crib notes\nAnd that is asked point blank if she blame people on the right like\nKennedy for the violence as a martyr you're right about this this week uh with regards to the bomb attacks or the suspicious packages you said you know looking all these targets in this reads like a list of Sean Hannity's pre broadcast crib notes that was the way you put it in your Washington Post column I getting are you blaming the hands of the world I think than\nSort of the wrapping up of hatred and um without regard for\nA while it's a fact my feet and without much regard for the truth I mean the way things are being patch on Fox and the and a pro Trump right wing media and dangerous and it's destructive so I think we need to call it what it is\n... Lewis was on from the Daily Beast of all players and he actually was the only one that made even a little sense he said the only thing I Would add is tomorrow it could be Hannity's targeted\nRepublican systems have perverse incentives to Gen off their base for elections I think a cable news has incentives to a gentleman anger and anxiety and passion for ratings same thing with websites with clicks and tweets\nAh I agree with everything that we've set so far today the only thing I Would add is\nTomorrow it could be Sean Hannity who was targeted for a Republican congressman who was targeted and why agree with the condemnation of what Fox has done in terms of gender up this anger over the caravan I think that this is a much more widespread problem\nWell it is more widespread than I have had far more instances that I'm willing to talk about a real credible threats towards me and my family including the one that I did share last week with white powder purported to be anthrax\nSent to a my office and one of my employees having to spend an entire day in isolation scared out of her mind\nAnd it's been worse but obviously these people are not listening to what I'm saying\nBecause I have been saying we've got to know what what do I advocate I'm like okay I Want I Want these principles stood up for\nI fight for the American forgotten men and women I fight for lower taxes less pure bureaucratic regulation energy independence Supreme Court nominees that believe in the constitution\nI Believe we should secure our borders\nLegal immigration these are things I I Believe that my entire life and career a strong military security for the American people a strong stand against evil in our time\nIt's not that complicated\nI Know what the democratic agenda is if they win it's going to be okay we want to impeach Trump endless investigations they stated they want their crumbs back we know they support sanctuary cities open borders and the elimination of ice and they think Obamacare works and it doesn't\nKnow yet and MSNBC you know literally pressing the Israeli ambassador germ or the blame Trump for the synagogue attack that sells tickets gotten you know ABC Trump is at the center of all the political violence no he's not\nBut I guess it's an easy blame game so now we've taken the predictable every two four years Republicans are racist\nAnd sexist and massage therapist and Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic and they weren't dirty air and water and they want children to die and they want granny thrown over the cliff and now it's that they are somehow inciting violence in the country no they're not\nIt's not true it's never been true\nAnd it's not any conservative I Would ever support and then the case of this guy that shot up the synagogue it was a very ill and anti Semite who also hated Donald Trump but that doesn't stop them from saying and literally advancing that narrative\nYou know this is you know watch watching the ...\nIt's unbelievable Fox deserve their headlights Fox News and the rest of the right wing media can escape responsibility oh I've been the biggest supporter of Israel that I Know\nIn the mainstream media have been my entire career friends with Bebe Netanyahu going back decades been there during the war and been there and other times reporting\nShowing people the tunnels that nobody else in the media would show them friends who they who Bronx former least Shimon Peres\nLet's name names according to the Washington Post Trump's hate and lives are inciting extremist oh this extreme is in the synagogue hated Trump those are the Washington Post headlights that you got\nFrom the G O P defiant amid allegations that incendiary rhetoric these are the same people on CNN fake news they couldn't identify 'em up for who they are these phony hypocrites\nTrump blames and you know something when the media live twenty four seven and they get calls out that's too bad that is not a call for violence\nUnbelievable the times that we're living now here is um where we are the Senate is interesting 'cause there's two races you can add maybe to the let's watch column\nAnd I would say that would be West Virginia where Joe Manchin is down by two in the latest poll and Menendez is barely hanging on to a lead in New Jersey by three now do I think both of those races are going to be won by Republicans\nAh maybe West Virginia New Jersey's hard ... possible people in New Jersey clearly fed up with an end us\nThen I think it's too close to call on either the gubernatorial race I have no idea why Floridians are flirting with Guillaume ... got a radical agenda in Florida Rick Scott's done a fantastic job as governor and he'd be a perfect complement for the Republican majority in the Senate\nI think Marsha Blackburn hangs on we got Josh Hawley now in the lead in Missouri we got Dean Heller holding on to his lot hopefully that's an important race in Nevada I don't know why Christ in ... cinema well we've got new tape on cinema tonight that will blow that case wide open\nI don't see how somebody who supported Americans joining the Taliban could win and Arizona and calling her

that you know he's a citizen of this country and if the president wants to come here please come he was not objecting at all to the president's visit which I appreciate and when we start focusing on this blame game which is what we do especially the the ... media\nThat then we lose sight of what really happens to you know what really happened is as we discussed an anti Semite killed ... that was his goal those are the words that were true unspoken from him he wanted to kill Jews but we also had\nPittsburgh Police who are amazing I Love these guys I Know so many of them they went rushing towards the gunfire while everyone else it of course is rushing away we had a doctor a banner with\nWho went to care for a gunshot victim and he became a victim himself rabbi Myers made every effort to save as many lives that they could and he regretted that he couldn't save more these are the real stories and this is the truth\nThese were not acts of a nation divided that's what the ones that lead the media wants to believe that we're a nation divided but we're not we're a nation or a community like this one like any other when we're faced with adversity when we come face to face with a madman we roll up our sleeves we face that\nSacrifice and and and that is who we are as Americans and when they play the blame game on the media if it makes me sick because we missed what the true story is what the truth is and rabbi Myers I Love what you said he said the bullet holes are too numerous to count\nBut we will rebuild because we're tree of life we've been here one hundred and fifty four years you can cut off some branches that the tree will continue to grow we will be back\nSo that Sean is who we are and that as a nation I Know you agree that's who we are a nation we are not divided\nAnd ... and ... most of us or not but the blame game ... there are some gas and it's All right well thank you both again a rose our thoughts and prayers to all our friends of Pittsburgh and to the community and the synagogue and a rabbi please send more loving and regards and our prayers um\nYeah that's right and and Sean ... are it by the people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature through our organization is thick nor the polls ignore the press ignore the pundits do your job get the ...\nAnd everybody tells me you know I make a living for people not ignoring\nHi and thanks I Love your except it okay but I think you're right though\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nThat's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman\nLast every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman in Georgia when we elected the first Republican governor in that state in a hundred and thirty four years\nThe last published poll in a midterm election\nShowed him trailing by Thirteen he won by five\nFavorite only off by a team points and particularly in a midterm election work turnout is everything it's all a matter of who does a better job of getting their voters to the polls and Sean I talked to a friend of mine who's helping to run independent expenditures and every target it's been in the house race in the country\nHe told me that in some of these house races dirt down to as few as twenty three hundred are undecided voters in an entire congressional district everybody's got their uniforms on everybody's blocking and tackling and everybody's going to the polls and the good news is\nWe've got the ability to identify twenty six million voters as either evangelicals are pro life Catholics we have phone numbers on forty five percent of them we've got an email about half of them are we\nWe have the ability to get directly to them and we know nightly whether they voted or not and then we can follow up with more phone or email us more tax and worked or not\nWhere do you see because I'm looking at six races believe it or not in Southern California that matter for the houses\nThose races in New York house races that could turn tipped the balance of power and New Jersey can tip the balance of power and Minnesota has house races that can tip the balance of power\nBut then I say that and then I'm thinking well there were four hundred and thirty five races going on a in a daze in any one of them could tip the balance of power and while you use the poles and it's somewhat helpful it's much harder to decide and get a feel for how the house is going to go\nLook right and now we really see the houses on the bus or we think it's plus or minus five or ten feet\nAnd we think when you're dealing with probably right now a hundred seats in play and\nProbably half of those are tied again it's all about turnout and and look you remember the special election in Georgia sex when they had off off up you know two three four five and he lost by four\nIt's all a matter of who does the best job at the ground game and the good news Sean is the power brokers and the media and no longer get to control who wins or who loses we've got the ability to communicate to voters\nDirectly on line on their cell phone at their doors wherever they work play and live and if we do our job and get our bowed out we're going to have the potential to have a shocking an election night to the to the dominant media as we had two years ago\nI mean that's what I keep reminding people you can shocked the world again we can go against history nobody thought Trump would win I mean the networks were literally what I read the exit polls of five Fifteen I was doing radio at the time and and the at that moment reading the exit polls Trump lost Florida he'd lost North Carolina he lost Pennsylvania\nHe lost Ohio he loves Michigan he lost Wisconsin He lost it all new id barely won state according to the exit polls the same thing happened in two thousand and for the exit polls at five Fifteen election day show John Kerry was president so you're right and I pay attention to the polls but more importantly\nHow do you get all these people involved that they're really spending the time making phone calls getting on you know getting the vote out and sending out these emails and letters and tax what are you doing\nI I have to be honest with you Sean I got to give credit where credit's due first of all a to President Trump for providing the banner of the positions on the issues that have got these people so excited and secondly to the Democrats for during the cabinet nominations\nTrying to air and destroy a good man and his family and we saw a lot and\nSecondly to the Democrats for during the cabinet nominations\nTrying to ... air and destroy a good man and his family and we saw a noticeable inflection point in this cycle when they tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh it's a reminder of why people turned out in sixteen and we've got thirty nine field offices and Nineteen states we have a team's operating in every state in the country\nThere overseeing walking teams that are going ... neighborhood we had a woman the other day that was\nVerbally accosted a ... a guy got in his car and followed her all the way down the block screaming obscenity at her or she sent me an email later and said not only am I not that church she said I'm now going to walk every neighborhood in my town and knock on every door\nIt's that kind of intensity that kind of commitment or our country you know at at times like this Sean when people wonder you know if that kind of\nDecency and character still alive in this\nCountry the answer is a ... yeah it is it's in the heartland of the country it's at the grassroots it's alive and well\nWell I think grassroots politics works grassroots works and I think it works from the beginning one of the things I think Obama lead the way but Trump and the Republicans did some catch up and we saw the benefit of their working twenty sixteen and that is the use of social media I don't think anybody has a more powerful platform on social media than President Trump\nI think that's right I think ah you know a rock Obama was the first social media Internet president in the same way that FDR was the first radio president in the same way that John F. Kennedy was the first president to master television but if Obama was the pioneer\nI assure you Trump's has mastered it or not only in his use of social media platform but also the thing is that his campaign dead in twenty sixteen\nTo catch up with what the Obama campaign did and we for example a Sean when we took our Christian voter file and matched it up against social media platforms\nSeventy two percent of the voters were seeking to contact or on Twitter or Facebook\nOr another social media platform and we're broadcasting out thirty two million videos get out the vote messages and other targeted messages directly to those people and again I Want to stress the minute they vote they get dropped out of the turnout universe and all the videos we've been pushing to their social media accounts then begin to go elsewhere\nSo I agree look anything's possible I I don't take things for granted\nI'm I was one of the few that really believe that Donald Trump could when I saw something happening but it was I was out on the road\nI also see it happening this time anecdotally you know I can see it in ratings every single night it's a you know Fox is audiences enthusiastic 'em and you can see CNN fake news and and that mess that they're just desperate then they'd like not doing well they seem almost the audience seems depressed but\nThere are three virtual outcomes here one is we shock the world Republicans picked up Senate seats hold the house that would be the best case scenario then there's the split a situation\nWhere Republicans get seats in the Senate but below sea become speaker and then there's a worst case scenario you wake up you know ten nine days from now when you find out as speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Schumer and\nIt's really up to the people which decision which outcome they want but we'll get the government we deserve you stay home well that's a half of Oprah below sea and Schumer if you don't vote for the Republican you're basically voting for below sea and Schumer\nYeah and I and I really believe showing that the intensity gap and the enthusiasm gap that wants to separate the two sides has closed significantly since the Kavanaugh nomination you know you see different\nPolls would Democrats with a high enthusiasm maybe Seventy two percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight to Seventy percent but anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out there that I saw in ...\nTwo percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight to Seventy percent but anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out there that I saw on twenty sixteen I was in Des Moines Iowa last week at an event with the vice president we have a very strong organization out there we have over a hundred and fifty people walking door to door just in Des Moines neighborhoods and\nThis one gentleman who was volunteering told me she was at the president's rally the previous a friday and Cedar Rapids they filled an arena\nThat we're over two thousand people who couldn't get in they stood in the driving range for two hours and watch it on a jumbo Tron\nThey stayed there to show their support you simply cannot quantity type a quantify that with a poll or within analysis it's an intangible it's out there and it's real\nQuick break we'll come back more with Ralph Reed founder chairman faith and Freedom Coalition right cybersecurity some things you need to know cyber security\nThat's the protection of networks devices and programs from cyber attacks that are designed to access or destroy sensitive data or extort money from businesses and people strong cyber security has layers of protection spread across computer networks programs\nAnd realize not only ON Technology but also making smart choices\nLike keeping software updated in staying informed on cyber safety out consumers also need cyber security to protect their digital lives in today's connected world it just takes one weak link criminals get it thank goodness there's the all new life lock identity theft protection with the added power of Norton Security or that protects\nYou against threats to your identity or devices that you can't see or fix on your own out new life lock with Norton Security\nWell you can get it now like block dot com you need it in this day and age protect your name your reputation your finances\nLife lock dot com one eight hundred life lock promo code Hannity or get an extra ten percent off your first year and for a limited time may twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with your annual enrollment as life lock dot com one eight hundred life lock promo code Hannity we'll continue", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "29"}
