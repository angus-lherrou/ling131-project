I I'm I'm Down here in Robert I'm formerly from Ron ... out there on the island this or um [noise] the reason why I'm calling and I appreciate your taking my call but the reason why I'm calling is I think you Rush Limbaugh and going back a downplaying this red wage\nI don't think it's the right way and I think it's a rich nominee the Democrats are getting fed up with allies and the and the ... the perception of you know okay Larry and all of them and\nThat's really getting ... and ... uh like didn't mean Trump so I think they just they just want him silence and they're going to just vote Republican\nLeaning I I Am a realist and I try to look at things as I study these numbers more than you know if the election were held today I think we lose the house by about five seats Bush\nIf the election were held with the Senate today where we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely hold Nevada I think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana and we'll win North Dakota\nFlorida too close to call Montana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head is that today and I'm I'm trying to warn people that this was real that you know hit we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before\nAnd it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house and that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house\nOr it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nVery Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go vote for the gusto and when it all one of the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirements\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house\nOne of the best the best case of Hitler and wanting the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors have come out contrast after two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten can midterm stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change\nGive the crumbs back increase to regulate its watched jobs go back overseas see now that's that's a difference my opponent goes and talked about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some some people in November six\nI noticed that former New York city Mayor Bloomberg is you know putting tens of millions of dollars apparently into a lot of these house races are you seeing the effects of his money and others\nI'm not seeing Bloomberg's money in in this race but I'll tell you one thing closest Pakistan a million dollars on hitting me right here in my home district ... million dollar San Francisco money being spent right here in Lee high value in Pennsylvania attacking me\nBy the way I say this to everybody I said they're foreign or thirty five members running for Congress and if you vote for any Democrat make no mistake about it you're voting for ... they're just not saying that\nThey're not saying it but that's the absolute truth\nWhat are the polls latest numbers show uh in the district\nTwo points back where the latest poll shows that were to back to back well within the margin of error and we're and we're gaining momentum uh we've we've debated\nSeveral times I made an average debate she will not agree to any additional debates are we caught her actually listening as we caught her in the debates talking about supporting open borders then she correct herself and say no no no I support a strong southern border\nTwice she said that in the last debate which completely makes sense because during the primary she was ... running on a ...\nNo no no I support a strong southern border twice she said that in the last debate which completely makes sense because during the primary she was running on a ballot eyes open borders but now we're getting a general election they're trying to pivot and we're going to and we're going exposure for what she really is\nWell this is a really important race a now Marty knows Dina's running for the seventh district of Pennsylvania this the Lehigh Valley district\nLehigh Valley county in Pennsylvania\nA it's a dead even race it's all going to come down a turnout Democrats are spending a fortune Republicans sadly of not spent as much and they should be meeting these guys dollar for dollar but I Hope people in the seventh district I Know we have a lot of listeners there are paying attention and and get out and vote early voting goes on in Pennsylvania right so people can vote soon\nYes and then we're seeing and talking to our election board you know there's so many presidential election is what they told me what the amount of absentee ballot requests and what is being turned it so people are really really engage the really engaged\nAnd he's getting any orders feedback as to you know what's coming back Republican versus Democrat\nI haven't been getting any any feedback but I can just tell you that people who have been meeting and the people who aren't going to be here to vote have been asking for absentee ballots and they're making sure they're getting their votes in I have a good sense that there's going to be a lot of people showing up at the polls and it'd be alive and there's going to be a lot of people supporting Trump's agenda [noise]\nYou know we're in the middle of the great American come back the last two years have given a lot of people hope in this country\nMore jobs lower taxes safer communities for do they want to uh uh have Nancy Pelosi take charge and have more welfare higher taxes open borders and sanctuary cities the voters are smarter than that Sean they won opposite when freedom and liberty they went opportunity that's what we want as what we have and we must continue it\nWhich is the best Marty all the best thing I Know you'll bring that great training as an athlete to the hard work you do for the seventh district of Pennsylvania and Lehigh County\nUh we'll be following the race ... a week from tomorrow and uh I Hope you're able to sneak this out\nYes sir thank you thank you for having me on the show\nEight hundred nine four one ... listen you've got to understand this is now how close it is it's all coming down to get getting out the vote\nIt's one point here two points there it makes all the difference there are enough people in his audience that have everybody just made a commitment wherever you live on six hundred stations now and you made a decision that you're going to get out and you're going to vote\nAnd you're not going to stay home and you got to put in the effort and you're not going to give a half a vote to below zero have a vote to Schumer it could be you know shocked the world again kind tonight is happy and stay home than it's you know maybe we splits but the baby in the sense that you know it's\nOkay we said we saved the Senate and get extra seats there but we lose the house it'd be a lot easier and better for the country if you want to continue progress to win both houses as of today eight days out I can see any\nOne of those scenarios unfolding any one of them All right let's go to our busy telephones ah let's say Hi to Katherine is in palm bay Florida next on the Sean Hannity show\nHey Sean I Can't I'm telling you how much my husband and I just absolutely\nI think you are the greatest\nNot because of just what you inform us because of your courage and put my arm hearts and prayers\nGo out to the people in Pittsburgh it is devastating I Can't believe Americans have forgotten the history and the genocide that went on during ... during the Holocaust I don't understand it but with that said our hearts and prayers are with them I have a point to make about courage and by the way you are right up there with President Trump\nAnd his entire family and those that stand by and I want the conservatives in this country to take part in some shared risk and stand up not in a violent way not in the vulgar way but maintain your credibility by Venus\nUp to all these bullies and oppression and and the violence and the hatred that they're stealing and the lives telling about our gear presidents I'm comparing him to Hitler and style and which are just atrocities I Can't stand to listen to but the problem was that a lot of\nA lot of very frightened people I think if President Trump as the most famous whistle blower in the nation because he's he's taken the curtain back and all the corruption in Washington and then something\nI'm I'm a whistle blower myself unemployed nurse practitioners Afrikaners surgeon five years ago and still fighting today that's that's fine\nBut I just want to say if if the conservative talk to shed risk and stick together and consolidated\nGotta let me tell you why are we are now I mean we're now at a point where there's a there's a group of so called conservatives never Trump or conservatives again that they're just angry they've been so wrong Ben Sasse was one of them Bill Kristol is another one of them Jennifer Rubin another one of them\nYou know the if there's if Trump cured cancer they would be mad because oh he was Donald Trump that did it you know doesn't matter that he's transformed the economy all things that they say that they use conservatives would ever want in terms of cap tax cuts deregulation\nA energy independence a peace through strength trust but verify\nSecuring America's borders all of these things it doesn't they hated all because Trump is doing that which they advocated for but they wanted somebody to do it in a way\nThat that that set everything the way they wanted to say it but the problem is the old establishment way of doing things get nothing done you know I agree he can be incendiary he breaks things he throws dishes and breaks them in Washington and he exposes the swamp but he fights hard\nBut we're getting the results in the benefit of that hard fight you know ... they're the type of Republicans the basically want to just sit in power in the corner and and act like they can be friends with people that are saying publicly to kick you and that don't want to be civil\nThat are running you out of restaurants and screaming at the top of their lungs that you so I you know it's it is what it is a the only thing I really want at this point I Want results\nI Want the forgotten men and women to be taken care of I Want as much prosperity as we could ever create for every American and I want to take care of Americans first and then we'll work on helping the rest of the world develop the same system in paradigm that we built that\nHas benefited our population and then I Want security in a world full of radical Islam is and people that that want to wipe America off the map and chant death to America\nWant to make sure that we have the meanest toughest bad US military and then we can handle any threat to the world throws at us\nAnd we can do if necessary we can protect the world against evil when evil you know raises its ugly head but there's it's happened before and it's going to happen again history has proven in the meanwhile it's you know basically you know temper tantrum politics\nOf never Trump or his they're they're still mad they got it wrong you know we wouldn't have to Supreme Court justices that are conservative had they had their way we wouldn't have had the tax cuts we wouldn't have the regulations to roll back\nWe wouldn't have America on a path towards energy independence\nWe wouldn't have had you know all the record numbers of jobs we currently have or the big GDP Growth we have or consumer confidence that we have that's why in eight days when people go out and vote this all matters a major question people have to ask is are you're better off than you were two years ago\nIn terms of the economy peace and prosperity Dr elections and if you want this prosperity this growth to continue if you want to marry\nPeace and prosperity Dr elections and if you want this prosperity this growth to

promise that Jerusalem which is the rightful capital of Israel owe that to move it from Tel Aviv Israel then they never do it because they never have the courage to do it\nWhat Donald Trump is getting all these calls from other countries in the region and they said no I'm doing it I made a promise I'm keeping my word\nOh why don't we have a little bit more of that\nThat is one thing that Donald Trump if he gives his word is going to he's fighting for it we see now happening on the immigration fight or the president and a Lindsey Graham of teamed up to and birthright citizenship in other

he's also looking at districts that he thinks he can uh he can do something there uh this is this has been a held by Republican for very long time and we're going to win the seat [noise]\nBut ah yeah there's a it's an unbelievable amount of money that's coming in here it's it's gotten to a saturation point now when people are just so upset\nI think people getting wet up with it and they tune it out like I Do I mean they they're not going to listen to it any more\nThey go from their mailbox to the trash can and then they bring their if their bills and there are other male [noise] um and it's it's just so much out here right now you can't turn on your TV or in your mailbox [noise]\nNow do you have enough money yourself to fight back on who you are\nYou know we're putting out our message we're putting on her message on what I've done and ah how complex thinks of this district and people like that so that's that's what we're going to continue to do and\nHow do you think about these other races Duncan Hunter Rohrabacher ISIS old seat the other you know Southern California districts that targeting how do you feel about those six because that could be the tipping point one week from today\nWell I tell people all the time you know Southern California is a is the hot spot right now and it's it's because uh you know the two people that are looking to be speaker or in the next session are from California\nAnd uh so they're looking at the seats but I I actually think we're going to do well I really do I think maybe he's doing well I think Dan is doing well [noise] um it's it's going to come down to be candidate though that's going to have to pull it through for themselves a lot of money is coming in and there's been a lot of help and I appreciate all the help [noise]\nBut the candidates really got to pull it through [noise]\nAll right well we wish you all the best and your race a Congressman Steve night again if you're in Southern California if you're in the\nUh it you know seamy valley area if you're in the Fresno area the Bakersfield area you know we've been out there a number of times those are all important seeds and uh that could tip the balance of power in DC and that's why all that money is being flooded into their\nAh anyway we'll watch your race very closely or Steve night California's twenty fifth district thanks for being with us\nHi Shaun ...\nLet's get to our busy phones eight hundred nine four one Sean our number you want to be a part of the program All right Andrew is in Albany New York WG why Andrew Hi how are you in by the way Albany is like a ... or ... to its own in terms of every single high powered Albany\nPolitician or every friend of theirs ends up getting indicted I've never seen anything like it in my life\nSo corrupt Sean ... corrupt\nThese calls and I'm looking at the New York times website there live polling I don't think that it ... I think that it's cute based on who's you know answering the phone don't want it all Pennsylvania one on a computer right now no on the extreme in a district first rational on\nThere is no one answer is no one else as all skewed towards down close to Philadelphia I put it past the point that writes I\nI'm not sure exactly what you say explain that again do you think the ... or an accurate I agree OK\nYeah and I think it's just based on her that's 'cause a lot of the district for the first\nIn both thought it was a little more than ... or the suction right on the\nOn the border with New York right\nRight or goes I don't want to answer the phone after it's all screwed up towards the bottom towards Philadelphia\nOh that's a big mistake I think on the Pennsylvania Republican parties part um we had a congressman on earlier this week from Lehigh Valley and you know look at every ... here's the bottom line it doesn't matter where you live\nWe are putting some importance on some of these New York races Minnesota races California races\nBut the bottom line is all four hundred and thirty five members of Congress are up for reelection\nWell we need a majority but it doesn't have to be a big majority but if you can win the majority and pick up the Senate seats I think we can pick up hold the Senate seats that need to be held then it could be a very good night one week from now\nBut I Am telling everybody if in my opinion right now Republicans have plus three for the Senate they add three senators but I also would say that in the house I'd say it's probably on paper looking at poll paper\nAnd I'm hesitant to say this but just analyzing the races analyzing all of the new candidates you know forty five ... retirements in this time\nI'm ... I Would say it's ... it's it's probably plus five maybe ten Democrat with a toss up because right now the Democrats have two hundred and five locked in races for the house the Republicans two hundred and\nNow the problem is the toss ups are almost all Republican so you're gonna have to run the table on those\nWe put all that information the most important in the top thirty that we picked then identified as easily you know\nYou can find that easily at ... dot com\nYeah so I don't know I'm looking at it I made like a toss up right now Michael shit I'm a toss up that I mean I have it with a toss up on the street looking one Ninety two but a lot of ... seats Shawn\nLook let me give you one anecdotal piece of evidence we know one twenty sixteen that the exit polls show and all the polls leading up to the election showed Donald Trump wasn't going to win\nAnd the exit polls came out of five Fifteen and it said he lost everything Florida gun North Carolina gone Ohio Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin gone and the same thing happened to two thousand and four five Fifteen the media was ready to declare John Kerry the next president thank God that didn't happen\nOr in a mid term if we go back twenty fourteen it was for cast as a close Senate race but the G O P one nine Senate seats\nI mean they were wrong so I'm I say this with caution caution you know probably the best thing people can do is realize\nThat if you don't want Nancy Pelosi speaker if you don't want Chuck Schumer to be the Senate majority leader then just go vote and do all you can do in your power at the end of the day will deal with whatever mess if we get one that we're gonna have to deal with\nYou know there are three outcomes on Tuesday night one week from today one of those Republicans gained seats in the Senate hold the house that's the best case scenario one is a split decision they gained seats in the Senate they lose the house Nancy Pelosi speaker\nThe worst case scenario it's Speaker Pelosi Senate majority leader Schumer\nSo you know we have the power to make that not happen right now the ... it all matters whether or not you're going to motivate your friends whether you're going to get to the polls whether you like the progress do you think you're better off than you or two years ago all the ...\nYou know what it matters or going to have two years of endless investigations possible impeachment\nWe're going to have the rescinding of our tax cuts by the Democrats or we're going to have open borders sanctuary cities eliminate ice a and keep Obamacare every everybody as I mentioned earlier is running against running on health care on the Democratic side I'm like\nYou're the same people that ruin the healthcare system with three big wise keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less\nSo my advice is you know let's go out there and everybody fight hard if everybody does their part if everybody listening to my voice goes out and vote and if you understand a boat for any House Democrats to vote for polo see any Democratic Senate voters a boat for sure\nThat we should have a pretty good night a week from now\nBut the best part is that we live in a country where you get to decide that where every American now has the power to decide\nAnyway um I Hope that's helpful eight hundred nine four one shown toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program we're going to get a little into the whole issue\nOf what held how how big an issue health care is a but this campaign a Rhonda Sanders gubernatorial candidate was on with us earlier he was really good
