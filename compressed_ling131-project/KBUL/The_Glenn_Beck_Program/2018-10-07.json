accountability Institute the producer of a documentary called the creepy line the creepy line dot com um we're talking about Google\nAnd Larry I've never I've never\nBelieved in you know those dystopian movies I've always made fun of them and said you know this this this is crazy that you know the corporations out to get you\nBecause of their algorithms because they are so all encompassing\nThat is the world were headed towards what do they tell you when they say algorithms that we have to keep that top secret because yeah they\nThat top secret because\nYeah they what they argue is that is for reasons of of ah you know state secrets\nUm and and you know that they need to protect their trade secrets they need to be a a you know making sure that nobody gets access to it\nThere's some truth to that but there are a lot of things that they could do to demonstrate um that they're offering a fair product in service to people and here's the thing that they have lied about this before you know ten years ago or so you had other companies like trip advisor and Yelp\nWho are saying that Google was artificially suppressing their rankings in Google in favor of Google owned companies which okay you know Google has the right to do that but here's the thing\nGoogle flat outlined said absolutely not we don't do that our algorithm is pure it's true the best results or ... or or organically at the top well here's the problem the Federal Trade commission the European Union\nProfessors at Harvard University looked at this and said yes you are fiddling with the algorithm you are screwing these other competitors and you're lying to the point is when Google says you can trust the algorithm you can trust us they've lied before and they're lying now and I think the only question that remains really is how are we going to deal with is\nUm you know there's old story that Henry Kissinger said when he was on the national Security Council\nYou give a president three choices do nothing\nTake my solution or thermonuclear war those are your three choices are in this case it's kind of like that we can do nothing we can try to deal with some sort of the regulatory issues related with Google or we can break up these companies those are the three options that we have and I think we're really at the point of point number three\n'cause this is not a monopoly like standard oil standard oil that's going to dominate the all market this is controlling the news flow in the United states\nIs in the end this is in the and Peter ... controlling everything yes Google is ... the most likely company in the America in the American world or to come up with a guy yes who ever\nWho ever gets to a I first controls everything there's no way to beat it once you have a guy yes this company is the most likely in the free world to come up with it if we don't have them\nContained in some way or another when they get to a I worked hosts yes\nYes that's exactly right and here's the thing it's not just\nGoogle the company a lot of people don't realize is I didn't realize this if you use safari on your apple product you're actually using the Google algorithm and that is Google information um if you're using if you are using um Yahoo\nYou're using Google the point being Firefox is Google the all these entities are using the Google algorithm so even if you say I Am not going to use Google dot com and you're using unless you are making very specific choices for other options if you using any of those others\nGoogle is the one that's dominated by the way Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year Google actually pays apple\nTo be the algorithm of choice for safari that's how much they value this information and want to dominate the space\nSo I Want to talk to 'em a little bit about um what can be done um with the algorithm or I'm\nThat's exactly right you you are the product we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are ... all of us look\nThere's that this is just the beginning let me tell ya boogie story [laughter] you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of aging how many people it used to look it up for me what do you do how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle\nThere is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy [laughter] pick somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide K [laughter] they had a picture of the guy\nAnd the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then\nAfter like an hour or two they gave the leaves system\nThe picture of the guy and said find him\nIn eight minutes he was in the back of a squad car unbelievable in ... minutes yeah city of twenty two million yeah twenty two million is amazing in eight minutes yeah so and this this without AI right this is the kind of stuff that is coming that people really need to pay attention to\nRight and and Google is at the forefront of that they they take a position of pride that they are the forefront of exploiting future technologies real quick though on Gmail this is very important for people to realize that just shows you how far Google goes I used to have a Gmail account now what'd you emailed us\nWhat comes into your Gmail accounts and ... ... email you send out you know what else they scan if you've ever written a draft email let's say you're mad at your cousin and you know I'm sick of you know cousin Chris and all the crazy stuff he does and you write in late one night you write a draft and you say you know what I don't think I'm going to send that to Chris that's just me\nBeing on just a second I Want to make sure this is writing a draft but that's not saving it as a draft correct It's just you ... it counts the delete delete delete delete delete delete if I'm not even saving it as a draft\nRight correct that's correct scanned by Google so Google knows more about you than you know you can have a very open and completely transparent relationship with anybody in your life your spouse\nYour best friend or whatever the Google knows more about you than they do and they are very aggressively going to retain that information but they're using it against you here's the key thing it's not just privacy is manipulation\nBecause they want to take that information and not just sell information advertisers they as part of their mission wants to steer and move your life in a certain direction that they deem is the way the direction your life should go\nTo Peter Schweitzer the documentary as the creepy line a couple of push back in a couple of things sure or at least problems I have 'cause I'm with you on Ninety percent of this\nOne issue I have is Google is awesome\nIt's all of the products that they make are better than everybody else does products that have similar ... and it it would eat him an incredibly inconvenience me\nTo give up Google because all of their products work better than everybody else's James doesn't know [laughter] more easier because I mean yes they're everywhere they also do a really good job yeah when it comes to designing an easy to use product right ... that's\nThat's a great question and it's not easy I mean there are alternatives search a systems out there um but none of them are as good as Google and it's not really that Alan ... and I think that's\nA a a road that people will go down that you shouldn't go down that what we should go down is we should be talking to the people in ... no no no\nWe should be sending people who understand this fight to Washington because by the time we talked to Washington it's already over we need people who understand the ethics of what's going on with high tech in Washington\nBecause they need to have this conversation right now it's not about us changing our behavior fry it to the point we must corral Google\nAnd break them up or corral them in some way\nNot just little litigation because I'm a ... litigation but not with just little simple laws are we going to cut\nBecause they'll go around that that fire right\nOkay moving even one other one yeah you said this earlier and it made me very uncomfortable and my suspicion is it makes you very uncomfortable to which is your solution\nSee we're leaning towards breaking up these companies and as a capitalist as a person who does not want the government\nInvolved right or in private business I mean how do you how do you how to bridge that guy no I mean I I think that's a great point and I came reluctantly tennis as I looked at all the possible things to do with Google here's the problem are into this space\nThe way that technology is moving how Google exerts it's market dominance it really we really do not have a free market in search\nUh it's really impossible in fact one of the guys we we interviewed a vice\nYelp or in in our in our a film a and the founder of Yelp said he wouldn't start you all today because it'd be impossible Google would smother them the only reason that Yelping these other entities have survived as they have built up enough brand equity\nWhen they were founded what Fifteen Twenty years ago to where they can exist so we have a situation where there\nAnd build up enough brand equity when they were founded what Fifteen Twenty years ago to where they can exist so we have a situation where they're truly is not a functioning\nA monopoly and by the way Google's market dominance it's partly related to its political alliance in Washington they pass laws and rules all the time to squelch competition a veteran in Santa Fe and to\nDo things like the platform ing yes we are not a publisher we're a platform right then they go in and they add it will now you're a publisher you're not a platform so they play it both ways and they're they have the money to do it\nYes and that's a hugely important point because when they first wanted or set up the regulation for the Internet it was if your publisher you're treated as a media company if you are a neutral platform which is what Google and Facebook claim they are they say we're not going to any content they even use the analogy were like a telegraph\nWe're just taking a telegraph message from Peter and we're sending it to Glenn nothing else is happening when we all know that's not true now they're editing a they're censoring so they are acting as publishers but unlike other publishers they don't face the legal or regulatory burns that they do so it's an ear competition\nOr even the public scrutiny even the public you sound like you're crazy if you talk against Google editing I Know that they are frightened the wooden one solution be to make their algorithms transparent\nAh yes that would help but the algorithm is changing constantly and and I do get I Am sympathetic to the argument that this is a trade secret that they work very very hard to develop and they have um I think by breaking them up\nInto pieces and by the way I don't think it's just two companies I think it's several different felt so bad [laughter] um I think it would be would be extremely helpful in the way to go on this because otherwise they're going to continue to rigs or market dominance\n... the other thing I hear conservatives talk about and I find this terrifying is to make them a utility\nOh no no [laughter] terrified I don't know what the chilies are like here in Dallas oh no\n[laughter] we don't really have a we have to open the energy yeah oh that's so we have five different editor company I sing yeah we don't pay anything yeah like ocean of making Google a public utility room which really means you're making it a government utilities now means\nYou've got the government controlling search no I live in no interest in that whatsoever and what you are seeing is this merging of Google which used to be generally out of politics very little lobbying very little interaction when Barack Obama was elected in two thousand age\nYou saw this enormous influx of Google people into Washington DC and they've stayed so it is now one of the most plugged in if not the most plugged in corporation in America so\nThis notion that there are kind of these wild cat or out of Silicon Valley that are like independent from government is just totally ridiculous I could\nSpend two days

quarterback stresses statues much of America is getting outraged for outrage state\nAnd with all of the nonstop outrage coverage we're actually missing out on the stuff we should be outraged about is trying to put the bottle down an end our bender in my new book addicted to outrage I talked about how thinking like an addict or a recovering alcoholic\nCan actually help heal the country but to get to outrage on sale now wherever books are so Arthur Brooks\nFrom Arthur Brooks dot com or to make sure you listen to his podcast the Arthur Brooks show\nReally smart guy really good guy musician\nI'm a grew up in you know the Pacific northwest I'm like it's kind of sounds like you're kind of had the you know a typical Seattle it'd be kind of family uh and uh went around the world is in a in a documentary I think the documentary is called a ... called Arthur the pursuit\n'em and um and he's got a fascinating life and it was just really searching for answers\nCame to find that capitalism is is what solves all these problems that we have and it's made huge huge increases in happiness around the world and health so\nMy problem here is ... and the only solution I Can't tie up is people like Rockefeller but have you know they do something because you know they're ... they they discovered oil and they were smart enough to put it all together\nAnd they accumulate this power and then with all of that money comes corruption and they start to control everybody else's lives and start making all the decisions because they have all of this money how do you how do you reconcile that\nHum and start making all the decisions because they have all of this money how do you how do you reconcile that because I don't want to take money away from people\nRight now I got a glass and you know it is distressing when you see something like a family where there was a patriarch it was a good entrepreneur but then kind of built in ...\nAround the castle and that\nKept a bunch of wealth in the family for six generations and made it harder for other people to rise through crony capitalism that's a big problem that's actually not capitalism that's a different system that's a\nThose basically that's a system of wired deals that you could find in any socialist system any monarchy any place all around the world\nAnd that's something that we have to fight whether it's capitalism more or whatever ... whatever is on whatever economic system that we've got we have to democratize opportunity the problem is not that we've got very rich people the problem is people have a hard time rising and we have to be\nPutting our resources and our energy in our law in our initiative toward people that are at the bottom not so they can all get to the top but so that they can get to the middle the essence of the American experience them the moral basis of the American experience is that the the three generations ago the Brooks is in the backs\nWere who were just like scratching out potatoes\nSome place they're they're nothing more than ambitious riffraff who came to this country and wanted to get to the middle and support themselves and their families and we have to be warriors\nFor system that makes sure that people can go from the bottom to the middle you know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're going to find that there is a system of preferences for legacies\nYou know if you went to university so you know four or five times more likely that your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying you got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience and so that's actually what we need to be thinking about don't worry about Google\nWere a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery of the bottom of our society can't rise today that's that's the really an American thing\nIn camp they rise that can't rise because we have a discriminatory system of unequal education were poor kids are locked into public education systems are parents who don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people that if they don't go to college there somehow losers we don't have a vocational and technical education systems which are the ultimate education reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country and most importantly glad we don't culturally value\nThe skills that come from actually not going to college where people actually homework skills where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did the printed system go away\n[noise] but went away for a bunch of different reasons but part part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen on until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America where white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades\nAnd and you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are we threw the baby out with the bathwater\nAnd get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it\nAnd then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship because it was lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history it's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody's ever thought of in the history of humanity and say\nAnd now the problem is not that this is an equal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments because most I think even most conservatives fold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden and you describe what that is\nSo I just this movie the pursuit that that that you mentioned in the last segment of coming out in the spring\nAnd part of it is actually filmed in Denmark in Denmark has considered to be the happiest country in the world it's a\nIt's a social democracy it has the highest tax rates in the world about Seventy five percent of your income goes to the government and so I went there I went to Denmark and hung out with some families there and the truth is if you're into that you know more power to ya\nBut I don't see very many people were actually trying to move to Denmark I Do see lots of people in Denmark that are trying to move to America why because the the antithesis culturally of what it means to be an American that all you know Danish society Scandinavian society is built on the idea don't stand out\nDon't be different don't think the ear something special don't try to\nTrey America is built by odd balls like you know like Glenn Beck and Arthur Brooks we're due to actually tried to do different things and in Denmark if you [noise]\nYou know if you want to get rich or you want to start a company or you're really super religious like you and me or or you want to have eight kids forget about it but then to look at you like you're a freak\nAnd that's a big problem so if you want to socialism is not just a social deal socialism is actually a cultural deal\nAnd so and and and basically where everybody has the same amount of money everybody has to be awake as well so if you like being a weirdo if you like being an odd ball if you like being yourself you better stay in America and you better make the American system better don't try to get the data system\nAnd that is one reason why it has been successful one reason why it is now falling apart and one reason why would not work here is there was no diversity there was no diversity now that they have open up the borders there's diversity and people don't want to live their life that way and it's falling apart my wrong people\nAre different people are different is look at the country of it's a boutique society of five point three million people that that day and they basically they they're like ... [laughter]\nYou know they they kind of live in the shower and then when there's a whole bunch of of immigration look for in America you know despite the fact that we have these controversies about the wall and about the immigration system\nAnd it a lot of people listening to us today disagree on this fundamentally we all come from immigrant so we all like immigrants we'd like hard working people who come from different places and integrate into our society and most most Europeans they they can't handle it\nThey don't know how to do it they don't think of themselves as fundamentally from some other place like a thousand years ago the Danish ancestors of current dangers were\nVikings living in Denmark a thousand years ago I have the slightest idea where my family was but I think God Knows they weren't in Seattle\nUm Arthur ... one last thought people's came into it and they saw what they want it to see one way or another I don't think it changed anybody's mind um it was all about politics and the politics of destruction I think\nUm\nBut we you know when when Lindsey Graham spoke yesterday kind of feel good do a lot of people in this audience and I thought it was righteous indignation myself I think there are a lot of people that feel this way knock it off this is shameful what is happening\nUm but there is a difference between righteous indignation and and playing the game the way others are playing it um they're they're playing for destruction\nIf we reach out and play for destruction as well I think we lose and we we have in our own destruction people think that that is surrender you what you want me to surrender you want me not to say anything that's not what I'm saying I'm saying fight the right way\nPeople kind of given up on being able to win a without playing dirty and you make a case that they shouldn't do that\nYeah I Know the Glenn Beck speaks truth right now everybody's got to listen this is the truth [laughter]\nYou know there is not a long term or that comes from being a bad person but here's the key thing here that most people listening to us so they're conservatives like you and me and there were watching the the that they have a they have their own filter bubble look we all hear things through our own experience and through our own biases I got it I got it [noise]\nBut standing up when in righteous ignition look if you're a senator and you're in a hearing fine but for the rest of us standing up to the left standing up to the other side when they're wrong around the Thanksgiving table or on social media is a very limited impact why because\nWe're not going to actually be taken seriously unless we hold our own side to the same moral standard to ...\nIt was we need to look at contempt and hatred and mockery and sarcasm and derision on the right and call it out and said these are not these arguments are not living up to my own moral standard\nAnd we hold ourselves to a higher moral standard we will not lose I've got the data on this one\nIs and in the long run the the moral high road which doesn't have to be weak don't have to give in to anybody else's argument but the say through love and respect I Believe that you are not living up to your own objective and said our own side we will not stand for hatred\nThat's not who we are that's the secret to long term success I\nI Believe that we're entering a time and yesterday then only hastened it\nWhere people see this and they don't want to be a part of either side they don't want to be a part they're good Democrats who do not stand where they have to enter bothered by that um but I don't think they have anywhere to go\nBecause uh we had been painted as heaters but also um we are we shot down people not the way they do necessarily on the left but it feels good to do that do you see any movement on the left\nThat common sense Democrats are starting to say wait a minute I I'm not in lockstep with this\nI Do this is this is not what gets all the publicity screaming ladder is what gets all them for will see on the writing on the left I look at the data I Seventy percent of Americans hate it they feel that they're being out on that and again this is half right wing and a half left wing Seventy percent of Americans believe that were being held hostage or being terrorized\nBy powerful people who are profiting from us hating each other and saying terrible things to each other and they don't like it they they they they want to fight back we have uh the the the opportunity to create a new moral movement where we can bring are brothers and sisters I'm a center left and even on the left\nTogether to try to solve some problems in this country and where we can say\nI don't hate you these kinds of these what's going on in the Senate right now what's going on with these hearings right now as a proxy battle it's like an angle and the civil war where the Soviet Union in the United states are sending troops against each other than the Nineteen eighties\nTo fight it out on somebody else's battleground Americans have to say enough with the ideological this ideological warfare between right and left and we're we're being the ones in the middle where we're effectively being held hostage\nWe want better than this in this country we we don't have to back down from conservatives at all we just have to recognize that we don't have to agree\nIt's okay in this country to have actual disagreement that's the basis of our excellence you know your message has always been so good and fled because you don't hate anybody and we have to\nAs leaders we have an opportunity to help Americans to love their enemies and in so doing to find the basis of our strength\nArthur Brooks thank you so much for being on the program we have to have you

state\nAnd with all of the nonstop outrage coverage we're actually missing out on the stuff we should be outraged about is trying to put the bottle down an end our bender in my new book addicted to outrage I talk about how thinking like an addict or a recovering alcoholic\nCan actually help heal the country addicted to outrage on sale now wherever books are so Arthur Brooks from Arthur\nBrooks dot com or to make sure you listen to his podcast the Arthur Brooks show\nReally smart guy really good guy musician um grew up in you know in the Pacific northwest I'm like it's kind of sounds like you kind of had the you know a typical Seattle it'd be kind of family\nUh and uh went around the world is in a in a documentary I think the documentary is called a so called Arthur the pursuit\n'em and um and he's got a fascinating life and it was just really searching for answers\nCame to find that capitalism is is what solves all these problems that we have and has made huge huge increases in happiness around the world and health so\nMy problem here is ... and the only solution I Can't tie up is people like Rockefeller but have you know they do something because you know they're ... they they discovered oil and they were smart enough to put it all together\nAnd they accumulate this power and then with all of that money comes corruption and they start to control everybody else's lives and start making all the decisions because they have all of this money how do you\nHow do you reconcile that uh because I don't want to take money away from people\nRight now I got a glass and you know it is distressing when you see something like a family where there was a patriarch it was a good entrepreneur but then kind of\nBuilt in load around the castle and that kept a bunch of wealth\nFrom the family for six generations and made it harder for other people to rise recording capitalism that's a big problem that's actually not capitalism that's a different system at those basically up to mobile wired deal so you could find in any socialist system any monarchy\nIt's something that's a different system that's a\nThose basically that's a system of wired deals that you could find in any socialist system any monarchy any place all around the world\nAnd that's something that we have to fight whether it's capitalism more\nOr whatever ... whatever is on whatever economic system that we've got we have to democratize opportunity of the problem is not that we've got very rich people the problem is people have a hard time rising and we have to be\nPutting our resources and our energy in our law in our initiative toward people that are at the bottom not so they can all get to the top so that they can get to the middle the essence of the American experience them the moral basis of the American experience is that the the you know three generations ago the Brooks is in the backs\nWere who were just like scratching out potatoes someplace\nThey're they're nothing more than ambitious riffraff who came to this country I wanted to get to the middle and support themselves and their families and we have to be warriors for system to make sure that people can go from the bottom to the middle [noise]\nYou know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're gonna find that there's a system of preferences for legacies\nYou know if you went to university is four or five times more likely to your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying you got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with the with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience and so that's actually what we need to be thinking about story about Google\nWorry a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery of the bottom of our society can't rise today that's that's really an American thing\nAnd I can't say right [noise]\nThey can't rise because we have a discriminatory system of unequal education were poor kids are locked into public education system of their parents don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people if they don't go to college there somehow losers we don't have a vocational and technical education systems which are the ultimate education reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country and most importantly glad we don't culturally value\nThe skills that come from actually not going to college for people actually homework skills where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did the printed system go away [noise] but\nWent away for a bunch of different reasons but part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America\nWhere white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades and and you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are we threw the baby out with the bathwater\nAnd get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it\nAnd then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship because it was lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history it's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody's ever thought of in the history of humanity and say [noise]\nAnd now the problem is not that this is an equal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments because most I think even most conservatives um hold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden and you describe what that is\nSo I just do this movie the pursuit that that that you mentioned in the last segment of coming out in the spring\nAnd part of it is actually filmed in Denmark in Denmark has considered to be the happiest country in the world it's a\nIt's a social democracy and has the highest tax rates in the world about Seventy five percent of your income goes to the government [noise] and so I went there I went to Denmark and hung out with some families there and the truth is\nIf you're into that you know more power to ya but I don't see very many people were actually trying to move to Denmark I Do see lots of people in Denmark that are trying to move to America why because it's the antithesis culturally of what it means to be an American that all you know Danish society Scandinavian society\nIs built on the idea and don't stand out\nDon't be different don't think that you're something special don't try to you so if you're in this country America is built by oddball like you know like Glenn Beck and Arthur Brooks we're due to actually tried to do different things and in Denmark if you\nYou know if you want to get rich or you want to start a company or you're really super religious like you and me or or you want to have eight kids forget about it they're going to look at you like you're a freak\nAnd that's a big problem so if you wanted socialism is not just a social deal socialism is actually a cultural deal and so and and and basically where everybody has the same amount of money everybody has to be awake\nA weirdo if you like being an odd ball if you like being yourself you better stay in America and you better make the American system better don't try to get the data system\nAnd that is one reason why it has been successful one reason why it is now falling apart and one reason why would not work here is there was no diversity there was no diversity now that they have open up the borders there's diversity and people don't want to live their life that way and it's falling apart my wrong people\nAre different people are different is look at the country of it's a boutique society of five point three million people that that day and they basically they they're like ... [laughter] you know they they kind of live in the shower\nAnd then when there's a whole bunch of of immigration look for in America you know despite the fact that we have these controversies about the wall and about the immigration system\nAnd that a lot of people listening to us today disagree on this fundamentally we all come from immigrants and we all like immigrants we'd like hard working people who come from different places and integrate into our society most most Europeans say they can't handle it\nThey don't know how to do it they don't think of themselves as fundamentally from some other place like a thousand years ago the Danish ancestors of current dangers were\nVikings living in Denmark a thousand years ago I have the slightest idea where my family was but I mean God Knows they weren't in Seattle\nUm Arthur ... one last thought people's came into it and they saw what they wanted to see one way or another I don't think it changed anybody's mind um it was all about politics and the politics of destruction I think um\nBut we you know when when Lindsey Graham spoke yesterday kind of feel good do a lot of people in this audience and I thought it was righteous indignation myself I think there are a lot of people that feel this way knock it off this is shameful what is happening um but there is a difference between righteous indignation\nAnd and playing the game the way others are playing it um they're they're playing for destruction\nIf we reach out and play for destruction as well I think we lose and we we have in our own destruction people think that that is surrender you what you want me to surrender you want me not to say anything that's not what I'm saying I'm saying fight the right way\nPeople kind of given up on being able to win\nA without playing dirty and you make a case that they shouldn't do that\nYou know Glenn Beck speaks truth right now everybody's got to listen this is the truth\nYou know there is not a long term or that comes from being a bad person that you know here's the key thing here that most people listening to us so they're conservatives like you and me and there were watching the the the they have a\nThey have their own filter bubble look we all hear things through our own experience and through our own biases I got it I got it [noise] but standing up when in in righteous ignition look as your senator and you're in a hearing fine but for the rest of us standing up to\nThe left standing up to the other side when they're wrong around the Thanksgiving table or on social media is a very limited impact why because\nWe're not going to actually be taken seriously unless we hold our own assigned to the same moral standard ... really want to be effective on the right what we need to do is we need to look at contempt and hatred and mockery and sarcasm and derision on the right\nAnd call it out and said these are not these arguments are not living up to my own moral standard\nAnd we hold ourselves to a higher moral standard we will not lose I've got the data on this one is and and the long run the the moral high road which doesn't have to be weak don't have to give in to anybody else's argument but the say through love and respect I Believe that you are not living up to your own objective [noise] Tennessee\nBut ... says argument but to say through love and respect I Believe that you are not living up to your own objective and to say to our own side we will not stand for hatred that's not who we are that's the secret to long term success I\nI Believe that we're entering a time and yesterday I didn't only hastened it\nWhere people see this and they don't want to be a part of either side they don't want to be a part they're good Democrats who do not stand where they have to enter bothered by that um but I don't think they have anywhere to go\nBecause uh we had been painted as haters but also um we are we shut down people not the way they do necessarily on the left but it feels good to do that do you see any movement on the left\nThat common sense Democrats are starting to say wait a minute I I'm not in lockstep with this\nI Do this is this is not what gets all the public space screaming ladder is what gets all it's all a say on the writing on the left but I look at the data I Seventy percent of Americans hate it\nThey feel that they're being out on that and again this is half right wing and a half left wing Seventy percent of Americans believe that were being held hostage or being terrorized by powerful people who are profiting from us hating each other\nAnd saying terrible thing to each other and they don't like it they they they they want to fight back we have uh the the the opportunity to create a new moral movement where we can bring are brothers and sisters on the central left and even on the left\nTogether to try to solve some problems in this country and where we can say\nI don't hate you these kinds of these what's going on in the Senate right now what's going on with these hearings right now as a proxy battle it's like an angle and the civil war where the Soviet Union the United states are sending troops against each other than the Nineteen eighties\nTo fight it out on somebody else's battleground Americans have to say enough\nWith these ideological this ideological warfare between right and left and we're we're being the one that's in the middle where we're effectively being held hostage we want better than this in this country we we don't have to back down from conservative at all we just have to recognize that we don't have to agree\nIt's okay in this country to have actual disagreement that's the basis of our excellence you know your message has always been so good and fled because you don't hate anybody and we have to\nAs leaders we have an opportunity to help Americans to love their enemies and in so doing to find the basis of our strength\nArthur Brooks thank you so much for being on the program or you have to have

lifetime here of the scenarios that icy\nKavanaugh they're moving the goalposts now on Capitol and if I'm a ... let me just give me a couple let's say he is confirmed\nOkay he's confirmed but this kind of perjury stuff is percolating and they just make hay out of it um we go back to normal and ... was the GOP loses the house to the Democrats\nThe Democrats than are going to demand testimony from Donald Trump because we're going to try to impeach him they're going to demand is tax records because they're going to the gym and the White House response by going to the Supreme Court and says the president of the time to do this yadda yadda\nUm and the Democrats than watch a capital to recuse himself but she won't do what you all do it doesn't happen or at the the house then moved to impeach capital guy so we've got a year or ... or ...\nOr let's say he's not confirmed because flake or Collins or Murkowski or Heller guy they just don't believe in and the Republicans dropped the ball they have NO PLAN\nAnd they just like well you know and where you need your vote goes ... repeal\nLike well you know and where do you need your vote because we're a repeal Obamacare do they lose the house and possibly the Senate\nCase scenario if they don't get they don't get them through down because the Republicans and because of this week with Jeff Flake\nPeople are just like okay the Republicans are worthless I mean and they don't come out with a huge play yeah I think you're right they'll try to turn that into a reason to get to the polls but if if it's the Republicans that cause it I don't know how to that kind of where I don't think it'll work okay\nMother scenario he is confirmed it was a house in peaches Trump the house or impeach his cabinet or on perjury [laughter] think that is\nIf they win the house you know they're gonna at least attempt to they will attempt jump and probably Kavanaugh to correct if we lose the house and the Senate these things are happening and there was there was no chance of them being removed but you will have the next two years of non stop impeachment hearings of both capital and Trump\nOK mhm ... only one that seems good to me is um [noise] the ... if Kavanaugh loses the vote\nThe only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the vote which could be really bad because it'll be the Republicans that do it\nUm however Donald Trump comes out and while he says yeah that's over here's the guy he ups the ante and you get a guy that all conservatives are rabid about\nOkay somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a skill Leah\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites I mean they're okay with them but no I always willing to die in a sword for em em remember remember Kavanaugh was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them he asked them later I personally think the best for the course of action\nIs to nominate let's say let's say flake and Collins come out and go you know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great\nDonald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next a nominee and you know what he's already been vetted for the FBI and every senator knows them\nSo we're going to be calling for a vote next week easy easy you know yeah that\nThe thing to do because then you have them battling just thought abortion right there at the same place they'd have about everybody correct and that's not going to hurt conservatives getting to the\nPolls if if you\nBut but but lives and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape well it was ... now we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exists somehow I'm One of these physical altercation we ...\nWe have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the Kavanaugh thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the\nWith the with the ... and we don't have that evidence yeah we we have a a ton of evidence and in fact I don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the forties so we have I mean like we have him out more we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alison case\nDo however um what's interesting about this is that fifty six\nPercent of Democrats believe Christine Blasey Ford's allegations fifty six percent only eight percent say they ... they believe Kavanaugh fifty six to eight\nIs a split there so you assume\nThat if you ask people and it wasn't a partisan situation what do you think about the Alison situation do you what do you believe from her 'cause she's got a more recent allegation she's actually brought it to the attention in real time to multiple people people around her have seen evidence of this there's text messages there is a there are medical notes all the evidence that we just talked about there's\nAn infinity amount times more evidence in the elephant case\nHe had only five percent of Democrats believe Allison's accuser we're told over and over again that women are to be believed it only five percent of Democrats believe the allegations against Keith Ellison and here's\nWhy this is really important I'm just like I don't want an abuser on the Supreme Court\nIf if there was the amount of evidence on Kavanaugh that there is on a Keith Ellison I Would not be for Kavanaugh would you if there was amount on cabin up I Would yeah I Would if if if the evidence was the same with the ...\n[noise] we still have a standard here in this country um called innocent until proven guilty and preponderance of evidence is a slower is a lower level than that and I understand that um my issue here would be\nCan once there isn't the legal standards because people will say well this is just a job interview or this is just that this isn't a legal proceeding once you have the absence of a legal standard\nYou can once there isn't the legal standards because people will say well this is just a job interview or this is just that this isn't a legal proceeding once you have the absence of a legal standard you have to choose the standard you apply\nI Choose to apply a very high standard because people who are in relationships many many times when he relationships breakup or someone feels guilty to say things that are not true I having all that I agree with you I Would say wait you know in this case\nI'm Keith Ellison should have the right to defend himself and he should\nWe should assume his innocence unless I agree point and which are he is and if especially with the case like this where it's very recent\nThat should just go through the legal system and when he comes out and he's guilty then he should get thrown out of that job and you can factor that in in your vote if you wish but I don't think he should lose any job because of this at this point he needs to you need to be able to see\nWhether this case goes through and and claims are proven someone had said they have video we need to see the video we need to see everyone or ... in investigated we need to see an actual police\nAh investigation and go through and and and see whether the evidence leads us to a belief that he actually committed these acts if we do not get that\nYou do not ruin people's lives over it I mean think about the amount of times of evidence that there is a with Keith Ellison overall you more which everyone I mean even at a lot of people in the right where like look ... really looked like he did these things his answers are really bad\n... you know there's much more evidence for ... much more there's people you can interview right now yeah children who went through traumatic moments where they had to read about their mom being abused or you know sure her telling other friends at the time\nThat being said however you didn't you he went through this process with the presumption of innocence I agree\nSo but what I Know about she fell assumes the evidence against him mhm okay\nAssuming this was not current day and it was thirty five years ago if Ford would come with that evidence I have letters I have a photo of lead bruises\nOn my arm I have um ah\nI can tell you where it happened I told my friends and here they are they verify that I told them after the party ... would you not\nWould you not go okay I think that's good yeah I mean if that would be enough and it was the only way we can judge the situation erect correct here it is with Alison and again this is why it's important\nJust like I don't want to have a Supreme Court justice that is an abuser or a liar or whatever I also think it's extraordinarily dangerous to have a guy who\nMay have beaten his girlfriend may have mentally abused his girlfriend assuming the evidence is real and checks out you can't have him as the as the the the chief law enforcement of the state\nRight and just anybody care no this shows you that nobody in the media\nCares at an iota\nFor this woman and her story they don't care if she was abused and they don't care about any of it what they care about is stopping Brett Kavanaugh\nIf they care they would be just as passionate as a guy let's not just thrown out of the Minnesota attorney general this is a guy who was second in charge of the ... what the the DNC ... this is not a a a ... a peripheral figure in politics he's one of the most powerful Democrats in America\nAnd is now going to be a chief law enforcement officer for state and you could\nFigure in politics he's one of the most powerful Democrats in America and it's now going to be a chief law enforcement officer for state and you could say oh well it's all you're what you're doing is what\nAbout his them no no it's not it's not what about his him I apply the same standards Alison that I applied to Kavanaugh you weren't doing this to Canada I Would still be saying this about I'm I'm a about Alice\nYeah and look at go back to Weiss bracket why was Brock Obama president\nRight above was president because he won a presidential election in two thousand eight\nPreviously he made a heck of a speech and what two thousand four\nAnd a two thousand four ... election he won a Senate seat a Senate seat that would have been incredibly close if he was going against Alan Keyes who they flew in the last week to just started a campaign but it was a Jack Jack Ryan but it might be thinking of junk residence gay at this point\nI'm trying to think too many Amazon commercials but a Ryan was his last name and he was a legitimate challenger\nTo Brock Obama in that Senate race it was a close election and he may have won it\nAs a Republican in Illinois wow and what they did is they went through his divorce his field divorce or um hearings and ... and paperwork or out of it to the public and in there there were accusations by his wife the actress who said they went to swingers clubs and all this sort of shady stuff\nDo we know that was true\nIn added horse proceeding and the divorce proceeding people make all sorts of yelling and that's why you don't just believe them that's why there aren't any old because they went and got them unsealed in a democratic state and they they they ... Brian eventually dropped out there was no real opposition for a bronco bomb and you've got eight years of him\nThat it sort of thing should be always viewed skeptically\nEvery claim of a crime should be viewed skeptically by people on that side you're supposed to give the presumption of innocence and close to start with skepticism of a claim on any side on any side on any side of all people who are accused and here we are in a situation where Democrats overwhelmingly believe the accusations against capital with almost no evidence\nAnd they only five percent of them believe the woman who is a Democrat who does not want someone up a ideologically opposed to ... to ... and to have that job she's a Democrat\nAnd only five percent of people believe her the the platitudes you hear from the media and the left I mean nothing on the story they do not care about whether Ford was abused or not they don't [noise]\nAnd this shows you how fast that standard is applied and how [noise]\nAnd how your life could be destroyed you are on the wrong side of an issue and by the way I think you've seen\nThe issues to change\nAnd up positions what's politically correct changes and if you don't abide one hundred percent and you're not on the right side will destroy your life [noise]\nWhile they let somebody else be fine [noise]\nThis is why we must have a standard we must have a standard [noise] getting dangerous to be an American [noise] that's the frightening thing to say [noise]\nClans that\n[noise] you know that the fleas tone of programs you can watch on demand\nHas a police dot com slash TV you can watch every episode of for the record and watching documentaries one of those buildings house for terrorists to see actually shooting", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Billings", "day": "07"}
