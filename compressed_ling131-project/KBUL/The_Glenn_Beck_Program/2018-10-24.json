house\nAnd we're certainly going to pick up seats in the Senate We're going to come close we don't want to ask me to keep it I think as the pastor Scott said earlier said well there's so many a minority voters out there who are going to come around the Trump or expand that opportunity he's not a racist he's opening opportunities for all people including black\nAnd I'm telling ya liberals can't stand this Kanye and the other people who were defecting from their plantation can't stand it this is exciting stuff it's I think we need to go on a positive message nationalize that these last

that they can afford a vacation take their kids to do is anyone there seven and be miserable uh but but they want to take their kids go out to eat not have to worry about a pastor I mean we all want the same things but it does it universal list is humanity\nYes it is I really believe you next fourteen days is going to be critical for messaging as long as I mentioned in stays consistent also I think that you know they're the script in the Bible says this isn't a weapon formed against the self prosper I Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation\nI'm not going to be able to possibly even with this caravan I think is back firing I think that a lot of Americans share the same concerns about those caravans regardless of political party this year the same concerns that the Republican Party or shares\nBoth the cook Political Report in odds maker Nate Silver and tightened their assessment of this race\nOr and the cook report actually listed this is North Carolina what you can explain the exact areas are that are going to be impacted by by this um this district anyway is among the five congressional districts across the country\nThat it said had shifted more towards democratic candidates and yours is gonna be a a bellwether district and you're going to come in I think your polls close at what seven thirty by remember correctly on election night\nOr they do and so we're going to fight all the way through the end ah look this is a district that goes from in Greensboro down to solve very over to Moore's avail\nAh this is a this is a great\nA district but it is one of the topics toughest district and the state it is if you look at those numbers it's an are six or so it is a real fight we knew this\nA twenty two months ago when I was sworn in that this would be a a a fight for the foundation for who gets the speaker's gavel in twenty Eighteen and voted it come true now it seems like people are waking up\nVoters are starting to turn out and we're thankful for every single one of these conservative voters that are going to the polls of the few days of early voting but again this is a con harassed race you know for low unemployment ah like we've got growing the economy we did a done when I said I was going to do\nWell you also have the ninth district in in a tight race\nMark Harris is on on deck and Trump the president is coming in to support me and mark Harris both ah this coming friday night\nThere's a winning be starting with him he's a great guy I've known him for two decades or so look forward to him winning and serving right alongside of\nWell this is an important race if you're in the thirteenth congressional district and you're in North Carolina including what much of high point or Greensboro all Davidson Davey counties of um parts of the road and counties and and some others you know this is a big raise this is going to be a bellwether race or election\nCounties well exactly thank you so much\nAll right thank you we wish you the best thing so much for being with US Congressman Ted Budd that's an important or race or let's get smart phones patios and but that is the Maryland Patty how are you\n[laughter] I'm doing great how are you Sean I'm good thank you glad you called\nYeah you know I'm I just wish I believe in ... I Believe in what he's saying I Believe and what you're saying you cannot let the migrants come in and now it's ridiculous it's out of control but\nIt's all about the whole coordinate the effort and showing it so that the Democrats crack can't play their same game as\nYou know of course she ... you know with the way they're using all of their their word she's still sent that the infield next trust against the Republicans and\nTrump is so good at this she's just got to make sure again there is a coordinated effort said that there is seeing the people there and the military show of force start sending buses start sending plane all staged they're ready to say we mean that\nThis is his reading in the sand just like Obama hat with Syria he didn't do that\nThis is this is ... is is that and he's got to show this and and handling is right with a really great where it needed Africa\nI'm really not worry yeah of course I Do I mean we don't want a humanitarian crisis you know the vice president actually said today that\nYou know a Central American leaders told him that left us in Venezuela or bankrolling this caravan which wouldn't surprise me the Honduran ... president telling the vice president that then Pence told the Washington Post the president of on doors told me this was organized by leftist groups in Honduras financed by Venezuela look\nBottom line is they should be turned back now but if in fact we see they're getting closer and closer to our southern border we've got to protect the border\nWe're going to do this in a way I I Know that is we want to have the best interests of innocent people and all of this nobody's innocent if they're willing to just rush our border rush across the border\nWe don't want people hurt we definitely don't want people killed and ultimately the people that will precipitate this crisis they're going to be on the Mexican side of the border because America is not going to do anything to people that don't violate the law but if they violate the law there'll be arrested and I I hear what you're saying\nWe should have food water medicine supplies\nAnd transportation back to where they came from\nAnd I I think you can do it in as as expeditious way possible with them as much care as possible\nUm but I don't think any arrest\nEver looks good and if the people on the Mexican side of the border border one of confrontation with American police and ice and our military\nUm our side is going to win and you're right we should do it as passionately as possible I don't want anybody to get hurt you know a lot of these people probably come from nothing they have zero to lose here\nAnd that's a that's a tough position of being and then you have agitator that or you know they're not telling them anything that's on us than truthful that they're telling them they're going to get in and so they're going to be disappointed feelings of anger anger who's going to probably be on display\nSo we're just hoping to get a turned around before this even happens but ... you know let's let's be clear here this is the United states of America we're constitutional republic we believe in the rule of law and the application of our laws\nGet it they can change the law good luck to them doing that on this topic which John Podesta says they shouldn't even be talking about right anyway Patty thank you I'm Becky is in Tucson, Arizona next on the Sean Hannity show how are you glad you called Becky\nHi Sharon how are you today I'm good what's going on I\nWell I got a couple of things being from the border town I don't care that people don't understand about this this law that's kind of [noise] yes\nThey come to our voter but they don't understand that they also come with a lot of diseases like TV and chicken pox in life and our border patrol agents in all are people that are working with him get exposed to this\nThey don't understand there's a long term ramifications of them and I had a feeling of pot about why I'm Mexican Government is not stopping some\nMob it's because when they come here and earn money they send millions and millions and millions of dollars back to their family members the wire transfer\nSo why should they stop them because they're making money off so I think we should stop the why are trained first\nLook there is a part of me having been down to where you live in Tucson\nThe Rio Grande everywhere in between and I've been I've spotted reported on the border more than anybody else that I Know in media today I've been horseback all terrain vehicle helicopters boats I'd been there I've seen a I was up close and personal when it turned out gang members were being arrested I've got the video of it\nDrug warehouses tunnels I've seen it all look I understand the people come from countries where there's great poverty and little opportunity um but the answer isn't not obeying or laws\nThat we have a an immigration policy immigration laws the first step if you want to ever come to America is to respect the laws of this land and\nRespect American sovereignty and respect our borders and that if you're not willing to do that basic most fundamental of things and then at that point there are other people that would would be willing to accept that and doing the right way and they should have precedence over those that are law listen don't respect our laws\nSo it's really really simple\nAnd you know I feel listen to the world America had the money you know we do so much already ... to tunes of billions and trillions of dollars we've spent over the years to help other people in other lands\nAt some point we've got to take care of America First\nWe've got to take Americans out of poverty first we've got Americans that need help in this country that that don't yet have not fully gotten on board we need every American successful and those that can take care of themselves they will be taking care of no Americans never lack for compassion\nJust the opposite there's never been a country that has accumulated more power and used it for the advancement of human good around the world more than the U.S\nIncluding paying the price and shutting the blood for the cause of liberty and freedom for many people around the world\nUm but it is it we cannot take on the world's problems either we don't have the money we don't have the ability to do that anyway eight hundred million for one showing you want to be a part of the program Donna's in Iowa Don Hi how are you glad you called\nHi Sean thank you for taking my call I appreciate it a I'm a marine

are you know the the last silence on this is very suspicious to me you know why don't they speak out about protecting our borders\nYou know if we had the wall built do you understand we wouldn't have to worry if they ever got to the border that there would be some type of confrontation 'cause he couldn't take it couldn't happen it would be good for people on both sides\nAnd look on oh meeting with

all evil on TALK radio and Fox News for over a decade\nWhen he just said Fox News and talk radio did it I mean this this rush the job we don't know who did it we have no nobody has a clue who did this\nWhat I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative or Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with\nBut it's just so typical the rush to judgment they want to believe what they want to believe because they want the political narrative what's so hypocritical the same people that have been ... tone deaf and failing to what has been unfolding now in this country for a month\nHow many women have been confronted and restaurants movie theaters how many times has this happened with you know the chanting in the restaurants with with politicians in their wives\nEven this weekend with McConnell happened twice the Ted Cruz over a conspiracy TV MSNBC there just despicable insinuating that suspicious packages can be tied back to the Trump himself and that the intended recipient have all been criticized by the president\nYou've got to be kidding me\nIs this how twisted let's just take the rhetoric of of who they are every day or ... well just last night alone I played a bunch of tapes of you know lower thirds of the president he's a liar he says is he's a lawyer fraud this\nI'm Sorry the president flat out by saying Congress was working on a plan and they were coming back before the election it gets hot alive he changes his story again and so if we're going to get sort of actually the president thinks you're stupid the president thinks people are stupid\nWhere efficiently and parents and in fact ...\nPresident Trump tries to play to his base with outright false\nHe's not even trying to hide his life anymore he's putting all out there he's spreading a lot of lines about non why is this all you hear\nEvery single day from the mainstream media why is about\n... ... ... look this is every election season you get it that we did have an incident\nIf you recall when Steve ... another's the shooting took place on the ball field\nAnd I actually I remember saying and I asked my staff to go back and find out what did I say when we found out that the gunman or the person responsible for the shooting that nearly killed Steve ... was a Bernie Sanders supporters is what I said now I Am\nAnd well the person responsible for the shooting the nearly killed Steve ... was a Bernie Sanders supporters is what I said\nNow I I'm a I'm not going to do with the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him so much Ryan McCarthy and ...\nRight and this individual this assailant that we are now getting the information on that you just shared by his own and Bernie Sanders took to the floor of the Senate to condemn it because she was a Sanders supporter suppose what they want but you know what that they do it I I don't blame Bernie Sanders of course not they would say would blame us yes of course I have to do what\nI Want to say you know Rush Limbaugh and the radio in the end all go home and said hey mama and you know they got out there were made up and around and say\nWell this is because these guys are convinced the left that by ratcheting up their rhetoric that they can get away with it and they get a free pass nobody doesn't matter if they do it\nSo here's what you have today right here in Washington DC and attempted assassination I Hope it's not and I'm praying that you know he's in as we know Shawn he isn't very serious very very critical supported earlier that he was upgraded a critical condition upgraded from critical that good but he's been critical is what they said well he was in stable\nYeah stable condition you get them into what I did back where you can't blame Bernie for that\nNor can you blame any conservative but we don't know what the motivation is just it's all ... and now it's being used as a political weapon to bludgeon talk radio Fox and Trump\nIt's just outrageous\n'cause that's not who we are ... what did I say yesterday about George Soros I won't play it again now but I said hey not this has to stop George Soros spends millions of dollars paying groups to get me off\nThe air we that's not how we settle political differences\nYou know when the sun is out there apparently blaming Donald Trump Trump is not responsible for packages that might have bombs and anthrax or rice and then it\nWas ridiculous\nYou don't see why you know let me play Hillary Clinton today and Hillary Clinton just what a week ago which puts his compare\nYou know not be several with political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about her only from the Republican whom to\nRecognize average Frank\nIt's an mine a deep\nDivisions\nAnd we have to have to do everything we everything we can bring our country to get together\nTo but we weren't supposed to be several ... days in a week later and listen and Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York you know we must be simple where Americans All right that's not what he would say in a while back when he talked about conservatives that live in New York people like me listen\nTo that problem is not me and end up in stem cell or are they streaming shows right up where it is\nThat they are because that's who they are they the extreme conservative stations to say that it's not your\nAt the end of the day we may have political differences\nSo now we go\nTo the end of the day we may have political differences but this is one country we're all Americans he pluribus unum out of many won\nAnd keeping the faith and the dialogue civil\nLaw is very very important and elected leaders\nWho in many ways set the tone\nIs especially important\nHow do you work 'cause there's no place in the state of the New York if you're a pro life pro Second Amendment I happen to be libertarian on issues involving sexuality so it's not my issue\nYou know I just very different tone isn't it I Want to tell you a little story so I had this and and\nWendell lived through this and when the you know we're still very great friends with the lease who worked for me for a long time and she went on to bigger and better things will really proud of her and happy for her and she was a friend of our program we just saw her in Washington when we were last there right\nYep we just saw um it was like nine hours when we had what we thought was potentially anthrax into my office of Fox right\nUh yeah it was it was actually a little bit more between how long they held her over\nAnd the sad thing is and she was in isolation she was alone we couldn't talk to her even it was just horrible for her\nAnd it was cordoned off we went to the hospital they wouldn't let us than we couldn't see her because they didn't know if it was anthrax right than what was that if it was ...\nI mean as with all my heart I Can't stand CNN is reporting I think it's fake news but\nI I feel sorry for the people over CNN Today I've lived through this\nAnd I and Linda\nOn a scale of one to ten the anthrax incident being one how many tens of we had in the course of my career that you know about I mean you know we got ten death threats today via letter yeah but I mean and it's just a horrible thing there was one particular person at another network I won't say who\nWho's going through a very bad time and going through a lot of threats and picked up the phone don't agree with this person at all and I explained everything that I've been through and tried to give my best advice\nI mean this person was upset had to leave their house they had young kids this person you know how to family and you know it's it's hard\nIt's unfortunately part of the environment we live in and that's why I don't understand why there's been so much silence about chasing people at restaurants and attacking people in restaurants you know somebody bangs on your table\nIn a restaurant that's an assault that guy should have been arrested\nFor shows up at your house or spent on you or threaten to you or follows you\nI've had to all the above\nAnd it's just very very very difficult and how many times if I said keep Obama said when he was president we got to keep up for our politicians safe whoever did this\nIs not a conservative in the sense that maybe they think they are but they're not anybody I Want anything to do with her any conservative once anything to do it but this rush to judgment\nDon't know one thing yet who's responsible by immediate that trying to exploit it for political gain when it is a serious significant threat ever say well the president says fake news are they are fake news you know truth is ... words are very different than actions\nOne million more jobs open and then there are people to fill that Rush Limbaugh household wealth in the U.S just continuing to see an unbroken smells of well gays there's a party out

I'm going to go on on my mind unconstitutional guaranteed that right [noise] um but I'm not guarantee the right to send them bombs in the mail that illegal\nI totally agree with you but you're right you got it but let me let me put it wouldn't let me tell you what we shouldn't have either\nUm if Sarah Sanders in her family want to sit down and eat dinner she's not working leave her alone\nIt Pam Bondi wants to see a movie leave her alone if secretary Nielsen has them eating a private dinner and groups of people are running them out of the restaurant I don't want that either\nI don't want a secretary McConnell and his wife some guy banging ... ordered this on this table throwing his food out either\nOr Ted Cruz being run out with his wife out of a restaurant I don't think democratic candidates ought to be talking about kicking and instability um I don't think we should be hearing about creating crowds and getting in their face and telling people they don't want anybody anywhere anymore either I'm sure you agree with me right\n[laughter] I couldn't let me\nAsk you do you agree with that\nSimple question\nFriends are because as a hostile environment that has been created by the rhetoric of people like Maxine\nYou know Spartacus Booker Hillary you can't be civil with them Eric Holder kicked them and even Brock Obama back as they are is that Mr Burgess out the tears Sean Hannity up\nGetting if they're in their face this this is their\nRhetoric now interesting when the shooting happened at the ball field in ... nearly lost his life um and it was a Bernie Sanders supporters that turned out to be I went out of my way to say I don't blame Bernie Sanders because one not that supports him you know decided to become violence\nIt's outrageous what they do they do this every time they've been their silence has been deafening in recent months and days are anyways\nSean Spicer ... is with us senior advisors spokesmen for American first action and also former White House press secretary and the author of the book the briefing politics the press the president Kris Kobach is back with us\nAnd uh he has penned a piece on them migrant caravan he is the elected secretary of state of Kansas an expert in immigration\nAnd uh by the way it's been very successful at what he's\nDoing and uh and uh I fully support your your victory there in Kansas was a big win that you're pulled out in the primary and I hope the people of\nKansas are smart enough to put you in that position I Know you've been a great governor um look I I don't know if we're going to get to this point this caravans growing Mexico seems incapacitated unwilling to do the job of securing their own borders which they usually do a pretty good job of they either put people in jail or throw them out immediately\nUm but if they in four weeks or whatever and make it to our southern border\nUm and if anybody has to cross that border or if they rush as across that border as in as one we don't have any pro choice we will have to arrest them\nThat will be a crisis precipitated by people not respecting our laws I don't want anybody to get hurt if we had a wall up right now Kris Kobach we wouldn't have a problem\nWe wouldn't have a problem and also if we had more states denying welfare benefits to illegal aliens so we give a hundred and thirty four billion dollars a year most of those are state public benefits to illegal aliens you know meanwhile you got governors\nAh like a Governor Brown out in California giving more benefits so if if a federal and state response or the ... to build the wall and states has to stop panning out the goodies\nWhich gives the illegal aliens assurance that if they can get in that it can come in and started gaining welfare benefits so while they're looking for a job\nSean Spicer a U.S quite a lot of incendiary rhetoric thrown in your direction we'll get to that in a minute but let's talk about what the options are here I Would think that is the role of the Mexican government\nThat they should be turning these this caravan back they seem unwilling or incapable of doing so uh what should America's response be\nWell I think America's response and the fact that the president has talked about which is making sure that we protect our borders our sovereignty and our citizens and that means ensuring that we know who's coming into our country\nWhy they're coming in a and that they not coming in with either nefarious reasons\nOr to either harm us for that day you know but there's a variety in the bottom line is the number one job of any president of any elected elected official is to protect the people in the president's made very clear and and the one thing I said that the other day that so much on I Want to be clear your great with me I Know Christ will agree as well don't temp Donald Trump don't temp temp\nBecause he's warned of Mexican Government he's warned Guatemala he's told them that this is unacceptable they need to do their job stop this from happening um and I I guess I I think that if anything people have seen over the last\nIs unacceptable they need to do their job stop this from happening um and I I just I I think that if anything people have seen over the last year when he gives you a warning he means that there will be action afterwards if you don't reverse\nCourse let me let me be very clear I I'm just going to assume I and I really believe that probably Ninety nine percent of the people in this caravan of good people people that don't have a lot of opportunity and their own communities countries they want a better life for themselves and their families\nI Believe a lot of the age we give to many many countries is abused and it doesn't get to the people as it should\nUm with that said we have a legal process of doing so but on the other hand let's say it's only a small fraction of the many that are coming that have the various intentions for this country we don't know there's not one person that can vouch for anybody in that care of him\nNobody can vouch for anybody\nAnd it would be unfair and a massive risk to the American people to allow people in on vetted no idea what their their point of view a worldview happens to be whether or not they have good or bad intentions for the United states and I say that Kris Kobach assuming Ninety nine percent of of the people coming just want a better life\nWell and that's that's a very good point you know it'd be there's abundant evidence of terrorists using\nThe traffic flow of illegal immigration across our southern border could get into the United states\nGoing all the way back to before nine eleven uh people from countries where al ... was active now countries where I suspect active have used this this flow this Margaret close to blend in there's no question that that will be the case again\nYou know the other thing Sean that I I wanted to point out is I think the Democrats have lost their grip on reality here there and the third stage of open borders psychosis just to follow this for a moment in the nineties\nThe Democrats are were pro enforcement Bill Clinton signed the immigration reform act of ... of Nineteen Ninety six and they agreed with Republicans that we need to deport those here legally then in the two thousands they became pro amnesty and they no longer want it to deport they wanted to grant amnesty eleven million plus here\nNow they're taking the position that we ... they are cheering for illegal aliens before they even get here they want them to come in and be part of the American society it's it's gotten ridiculous fair churn people before they're even here to become unlawfully present in the United states\nAnd when you play what I played earlier it's amazing how all these politicians leaders of the Democratic party not not that long ago sounded a lot like Donald Trump yeah let me let me switch gears to these packages\nThe president said um he spoke out about these despicable acts of terror he said no expense will be spared whoever's responsible for sending these packages that appears in some cases pipe bombs and powder\nThat they will be tracked down in full force of the government will be coming down upon them which is the right thing to say and do 'em spoke before that show and we've seen a lot leading up to this\nAnd what ... what have we seen we've been witnessing ... if I can\nGet one quick point before because I think you're making an excellent points at one last thing it only takes one\nAnd that that leads into what we're talking about today you you can have Ninety nine point nine percent it'd be be be doing the right thing but it only takes one to do the wrong thing and I think that's what we need to remember to this whole process we saw that today one person or however many we don't now is now frightening and terrorizing thousands and thousands of people [noise]\nUm and and you know I'm not making any cash but while I'm at the point that I'm making is that it doesn't mean you can get Ninety nine point nine percent of the people through or safely but if we don't protect to get a hundred percent right\nIt it doesn't mean you can get Ninety nine point nine percent of the people's true or safely but if we don't protect to get a hundred percent right people can be threatened her her and I that's the thing that we have to make sure that we're clear on\nOur will and how do I went to take a quick break on this will come back on the other side and talk about the president's comments he they will hunt down those people that have been sending these suspicious packages\nAnd powder and potential pipe bombs are two very politicians want to CNN or this is not new I've lived through this myself\nI had a one of my assistance at the time poorly Sabbath was in isolation what was that the window what eight nine ten hours one day scared to death yeah it was horrible and it was horrible because she opened up a letter sent to me with white powder in it\nAnd it's happened to Don junior and his family we saw the shooting which college but we've been watching this ratchet up\nLeft wing rhetoric has been insane and we've heard
