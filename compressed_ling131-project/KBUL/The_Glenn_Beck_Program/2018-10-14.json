[noise]\nThe name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage and it is very Frank it talks about ah what Christians can and should do and also have not done and how we're actually hurting ourselves\nUm you talk about our God really kind of being identity no new slain that ad\nI think ultimately we kind of as a nation moved ourselves into factions and what I don't want is Christians to be a faction in a world of factions [noise]\nUm I think that's the part of the problem but but I think you know people identify themselves as you know I'm I'm this or that I've got a social media community and and and then that faction sort of becomes identity becomes a faction the faction becomes an echo chamber and then ultimately\nAre we the volume just goes up up up up and the anger just goes up up up up and and we can't survive I think as a nation factional ... at this level eventually you'll Balkan eyes to use the term but history will what kind of break apart and so I think the ultimate thing is I I Can't you know I Can't solve all the political things here you got much bigger platform talk about politics than I Do\nI'm just trying to help Christians to say All right how do we react to how do we respond and the answer is is not to take our identity from anything other than king Jesus and and and again I Know that's overtly spiritual but we're talking here in this\nThis focus I mean so it's to take her to any for king Jesus Jesus is not coming back on air force one he's not riding a dump irrelevant when he does\nAnd to acknowledge that I'm only all in as a Christian in following Christ and everything else is shaped around that my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom that's kind of our motto here we can college my identity is more to Christ kingdom than anything else\nSo I explain this yesterday that um you know the the so called Christians of the Westboro Baptist church\nYou know they they hold up signs you know God hates this Scott hates that blah blah blah they're just despicable\nYou don't win by by holding up signs no God hates view and shouting things back you win by listening by understanding by him racing them as a soul or a brother and sister not to do what they're doing standing up but people have\nThat actually left her own family in the Westboro Baptist church that's right because somebody spoke to her with civil civility and said let's just reason here for a minute\nYeah that's okay I got on my desk actually right every front of me a name played because they actually protested at my church we went out and serve them coffee and doughnuts and they called me and the national news\nI Can't use one of the words probably on the radio but all lying the false prophet and so it's actually one of my staff made into a name played it says it says lined blank false prophet Westboro Baptist church which by the way it's either wrap that he was either Baptist church\nBut but in doing so I mean the question is how do we respond well somebody reached out actually interviewed members of the family as well a Christian Today to somebody reached out and I will tell you I think that's what\nWe can do right now with people who deeply disagree with us and\nThe book is filled with examples of Christians who actually build relationships with people who radically disagreed and in the process where able to come to maybe a better understanding of what examples for example is a is the president by all university which is a Christian university in California\nAre met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party of state legislature there in California\nThat was trying to change laws that would make it illegal for viola to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more well he ended up getting to understand each other better the will the bill was ultimately not moved forward was dropped and and and now we're at a very different place now I'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying\nThat Christians need to try to do that\nAnd I do think that in doing so well act a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians historically because of the moment we're in is not time for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and and as you said earlier to your caller I'm calling people to arms\nYet that's not I mean ... that's not an uncommon view and I know some of the some of the worst\nThings I see on social media I I click on a lake and I find go to the bio and it's the first things listen the thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like and I think that's what we need is a change in a lot of hearts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us is right now or the the victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained or as slaves or you know story after story after story of these Christians\nWho I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you\nI'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're going to come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit and we're gonna crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said\nWe understand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with Peter unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating upper called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate 'cause you know victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent\nAnd and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about trying to hold back the advance of course that he's a pagan\nAnd he says this a while for the pagan preece neglect the poor the hated galleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these in pious galleons empire ... not only feed their own poor but I was also welcome them into their about by\nOr they're already so more votes than anybody on earth they've driven how many uh book retailers out of business\nUm and they're they're about to spend more on the original programming than even Netflix or they're going to be the biggest Hollywood producer [laughter] and just so many things is it time to\nI mean I don't know what you do about it do you favor as a capital is breaking up a company that's what they did that Microsoft is what they did to or are they tried to to Microsoft that's what they did with mountain Val\nI'm Yvette mountain dealt with in with the government\nI mean that was that was protected by the government and part of a you know that was\nThat was a protected property you couldn't you couldn't start anything against them\nRight that's why yeah I mean you know you could start your own Amazon you're not you're able to compete on I don't think there are other options you know there are other outages are just people you know the problem is Amazon does everything better than everybody else you know this isn't real problem where we've been talking about this whole week is\nI don't I don't want you to change Amazon I like Amazon I like Amazon Prime I like the fact single yesterday we were trying to build a stupid volcano for um my daughter and\nTanya went and got a three percent hydrogen peroxide and we're reading and I'm like I think thirty five percent

you'll have tomorrow you know you had as ours I mean it's I don't want them to change some of these things\nAnd and we're the same way with Google and Google's getting pretty intrusive things right

same argument Amazon controls I mean people are like oh well I buy a lot of things for Amazon and it's obviously a big part of their business when they're cloud computing is really the main thing driving all of their profit off of um you know and it's a and so many places or use it every place you go on the Web based government young Amazon yeah I mean\nAnd it's like you know Alexa at this

does something they don't like right as ... ... ... ... that is it socialism that is sweeping the nation remember the headline we're all socialist now that's what sleeping is sweeping the nation\nAre parallels between the two areas aren't perfect but the late Nineteen thirties I thought oh that\nThat's an understatement of the year can use a lot of the parallels between the two hours are perfect they're not perfect but that is one way to describe you've just done yeah about three quarters of them are completely inaccurate but as an aide to a night late Nineteen thirties as today\nPolitical rancor social division and the threat posed by alien ideologies\nSparked widespread unease what is the alien ideology\nOf today yeah of today or back then I mean the fact that one of the two major party has embraced democratic socialism is already alien to me yes the the the fear back in the thirties was communism or the ... and the less said no it's fascism\nUh probably some conservative thing yeah no no the textile workers' strike of Flint sit down strike the battle over the overpass the republic steel strike almost all of these and including many of the race riots\nHave communist and

they said about the Tea Party that never happened\nIs now what they're excusing from the left and we already have attempted assassinations we have somebody who tried to assassinate\nCongress the Republican congressmen yeah almost killed one of them as he was pulling the trigger shooting at all of them he was shouting this is for health care and people are like do you believe Rand\nPaul said he thinks there might be an assassination I don't know he was standing on a freaking baseball field being shot at and then got attacked that his front yard of well yeah I can I can believe he thinks that might happen I Belong to a gym a couple of times\nI have worn that is the only thing that hasn't happened if you were looking in the Nineteen thirties the genes the sixties and now today the only thing that hasn't happened that has been repeated itself almost exactly assassinations\nWell because the press didn't make a big deal out of it because\nThey wanted to bury it because it was a Bernie Sanders volunteer people don't realize you had someone tried to kill a third of the congressman a third\nSay it was because they were [noise]\nBut I think it was like one tenth of the elected
