come out of again we were busy last week with the capital issue but the bigger bomb that come out of the testimony of James Baker memories the top legal counsel at the FBI\nHas to do with the issue that we discussed three weeks ago which was Rod Rosenstein saying that he wanted a surreptitiously record Donald Trump and maybe we can get some cabinet officials in both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnyway it turns out that not long after that twenty Seventeen meeting where Rod Rosenstein reportedly discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with President Trump remember this was this was chronicled by both\nThe deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe in and his lawyer Lisa Page that's Peters trucks boyfriend\nThey went into the office of a third FBI official a girlfriend rather sorry\nLisa Page was it was she was his boyfriend\nHe was her she was his girlfriend alright enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third FBI official general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump\nAfter Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it the thing that struck me the\nMost was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source close to the investigation of of bakers house interview he was saying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but as he took it seriously in other words they all thought he meant it\nOr because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force along the outer banks and forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Colombia or Augusta places like that as it moves so but it's going to accelerate through there we're we're looking at the devastating wind power with this hurricane is Panama City\nThat is ground zero for the worst part of this storm\nAnd you folks over there you ... you got you got remembered the way the northeast or the at fighter Florida shape\nEven though to the east Appalachia cola or the wind won't be as bad you're still going to get tremendous storm surge in there because all that water that's to the east of the storm is piling up\nAnd heading in there and do that by to Florida I think Tallahassee probably going to get wind gusts eighty Ninety miles an hour they're knocked the power out in Tallahassee doubt during hurricane Kate which went very close to the Ninety percent\nOf the power was knocked out in Tallahassee and I think you're going to see Ninety a hundred percent power outage or with this there I'm and I'm just saying the when should be higher in Tallahassee at least that go with this\nAnd we'll have severe weather breaking out later tomorrow afternoon drawn a possibility tornadoes are from Florida and then prove southern Georgia coastal South Carolina North Carolina or during the day Thursday as this moves up rapidly northeast\nIt's a scary All right so what do we get landfall and or what would you recommend that people I Know a lot of people live on the coast I've been there a number of times it's actually it's so beautiful um and it's but there are a lot of homes right on the water so\nOut between three and nine PM tomorrow thinks where we're going to have landfall and I think things are really going to deteriorate\nVery very rapidly um it appears tomorrow morning midday and afternoon\nIn there you just got to get out I mean well you know again with Florence you know we had a hundred hundred and ten mile an hour winds there was a bad storm it was spread out this is this is much more of a hey make or other kind of thing where it's a it's a knockout punch it with a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty mile an hour when I look folks\nYou can see what's going on with this\nYou saw with Florence Saturday I kept trying to organize couldn't quite do it you see it on the CLA photographed the eyes getting tighter and tighter and tighter\nAnd that means that this storm is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nIs look there's nothing magical about it and I we I wrote\nI wrote on this weekend I I Know that sounds pompous but you got people saying we've never seen anything like this it's already started with the climate ambulance chaser\nTelegraph so far in advance\nAnd even from late last week you could see that was going to be a major problem\nComing up into the Gulf of Mexico and that was going to be what we call rapid rapid development feedback we see that happen every now and then and we are fortunate with uh Florence said it was you know if it was off its peak this is going the opposite way and that's what hurricanes do and given the ideal situation and that's what this is so\nIt really hits landfall I Would say if I'm looking at that my own but your website actually so you have a hitting land it's really going to start getting we're up about noon tomorrow with little before right\nAnd that and then the the landfall I think sometime between three and nine PM it Panama

Jared and John Solomon into the next out one other thing that we've got to get to an all of this we have now other revelations that have come out with everything that's been going on with Brett

Russia gate scandal that only paying for the dot CA\nAnd there was a great piece by John Solomon last week and investors business daily also laying out all the evidence\nA chilling indictment of how this political criminal not only managed to escape indictment but was somehow able to weaponize the FBI and the deal Jay all to destroy your duly elected president President Trump and last week the ... of course we have the FBI general counsel Baker reporting\nYou've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was\nHillary Clinton Russian collusion two people are on her payroll the British by Christopher Steele who compose is a totally fabricated phony document\nBased on suppose Russian sources and providing it to the FBI and the de OJ so they can launch the investigation and spy on the Trump campaign and now\nA second person on the Hillary Clinton payroll Michael Sussman or who is passing along\nComputer storage data as well as documents to the FBI and so this was the Hillary Russia connection\nAnd conspiracy to use phony opposition research to defeat her political opponent when that failed\nThey doubled down and they continue to spy on an associated the Trump campaign and to launch a special counsel Bob Mueller to drive Trump from office why haven't Andrew McCabe memos\nEvidence seen this soft coup attempt by a Rod Rosenstein being given to Congress they've been given to of all people Robert Mueller Rosenstein\nIs Mueller's boss if Mueller is going to be investigating Rosenstein for illegal illicit activity he can't how we must still the boss in this case\nAnd the timing of this tells us everything John his was revenge for the firing of James Comey this is part of the listed scheme to frame Donald Trump good title for a book I guess that's why it's number one\nOn Solomon I Want you to weigh in on this and I'm sure I missed some details here but I I'm given the best summary I can it sounds complicated but it's not\nIt's really not complicated and Greg does such a good job of cutting through all the laughter and BS in Washington and get right down to the point the FBI and the Justice Department were misused for a political opposition research projects to a stop Donald Trump from becoming president and when that failed\nFace was saying I'm investigation that was designed to hamper his early presidency and that's what the overwhelming evidence now chosen and there's another important part that Baker divulge as in the middle of my story about what types of south because many times I've heard you and I've heard Greg say the media has been complicit in this well sky or\nA fake or gave us an unbelievable anecdote of complicity in November right after the election right after ... with the reporter David Corn of Mother Jones\nGives a new version of a ... copy it's different from the one the FBI has sort of steel and gives it to Baker and then fake or turns it on to the a counter intelligence people why is that important first off it's not a job a reporter to be getting evidence the FBI what we're supposed to report facts not become snitches\nBut more importantly the timing of it is so important the FBI just fire Christopher Steele for leaks\nThis is your best occasion and all the dirty hat on Trump just before the election he gets fired they televise the court they're no longer using them and here it becomes a backdoor a journalist becomes a backdoor to continue to receive information for Christopher Steele\nThis is not how the price of process is
