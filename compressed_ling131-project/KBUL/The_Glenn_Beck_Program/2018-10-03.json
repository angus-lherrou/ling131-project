percent of the people lay the judge Kavanaugh I should be on the bench so if it if that doesn't you know all I can say is it the stakes are high who would follow Kevin after this they will destroy

life it's better to be on the same page with Lindsey Graham and inviting him to one of our of that and actually we've done that this week um he's he just I mean he ... with us all last week that he not\nWell I think ... you know that's another thing well he doesn't have the temperament sell if you if you're accused of gang rape and accused of sexual assault and you're innocent\nHow was the what is the proper way to act was he supposed to be monotone guys I didn't do this so it's just not true I mean because as his wife is crying behind him as his daughter is saying to him pray for this woman and a ... a bright innocent\nAnd the half the country and these people they don't care they don't care who they destroyed in the process of accumulating power\nAnd honestly it doesn't matter what he would have done it wasn't going to be the right thing and\nI and I believe it that didn't even have to be Kavanaugh could have been anybody this is much bigger it's about than stopping the Supreme Court\nConfirmation that's what it's all about they are willing to do anything to stop it and these liberal women these he kept wearing liberals women out there speaking like they speak for all women they don't\nThey absolutely do not end when the press and the media and the the leftist obsessed about women this um this cycle we're just not going to sit back and take it we are the ones\nFor sixty since the Nineteen sixties women have the deciding vote women were the ones that elected Donald Trump's women are the ones that are going to decide what happens in the Senate turns and we're going to be the ones that decide what happened and twenty twenty and conservative women are kind of that\nTogether and we're pushing back on all of this and say they don't speak for us and we stand with Brett Kavanaugh I mean we're not going to back down and let and let them win this absolutely no way\nWell it's going to be up to three senators probably Jeff Flake snowflake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and then it's gonna be whether or not the ... whether or not I'd look the Senate's going to hold a vote and a big Lindsey Graham has a point\nUm we haven't really heard from Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski on the issue\nWhat is it ... the the convinces them he's not qualified for the job\nYou know the guy admits that he drank he liked to drink he drinks beers that likes to drink beer sometimes drink more beers that he should have drink and then people say what he must have blacked out we know we did he's a liar he's a perjure right and now they want to investigate in my eyes throwing incident at some game\nKnow back thirty five years ago this is how absurd this has gotten\nWell I Can't tell you what I was doing thirty six years ago but I can tell you what we're doing it to days\nAnd that is we're having a win for Trump or first ever conference here in Washington DC it's limited for America first heels on gloves off and women from across the country are coming together and we're going to spend three or four days together and talk about why we love this country and we're going to people that are supported the\nPresident and Brett Kavanaugh and on Thursday or taking a little trip to the U.S Capitol while the others are camped out at their most conservatives are working but we're going to take a trip and visit some of the senators and let them do how we feel about it and encourage them to vote\n'em to support to confirm Brett Kavanaugh we need to do this and I'm hoping that Mitch McConnell brings this vote on Thursday it we're having our first event Thursday night and it would be great to be able to celebrate the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh um women for Trump at our conference\nSo I Want to see what happens we'll know a lot more by the end of the week we may even no I'm I'm hearing\nOn on women for Trump at our conference\nSo I Want to see what happens we'll know a lot more by the end of the week we may never know I'm I'm hearing rumors that the FBI may be very close to finishing their report\nAnd when that happens maybe it'll happen before tonight when that gets an ounce will senators will get to read it and then the cloture vote will be called and we'll have an up or down vote we'll see where people come down on this shouldn't be that difficult to read the FBI doesn't reach conclusions\nThey don't make recommendations they just say interviewed person a B C D E F G and but in every case there's no corroboration in every single case they have like a case there's inconsistencies\nAnd every single case is very problematic and all I'm saying is is if this is the excess full we will never ever get good people ever in this ... like do want to do anything\nPublicly why should de\nSean I completely agree it's a political his job and we need to stand up and make sure Republicans\nDo the right thing and confirmed hands so glad to see Lindsey Graham staying\nWith us with the president and fight back for a change instead of playing on the terms that the Democrats that so and I hope that they keep up this fight and confirm Kavanaugh weekend anybody that's out there that wants to join us this weekend we'd love to have them and that just keep up the fight\nRight thank you so much for being with us we are very proud of collie is now part of the Sean Hannity show\nAnd she's the one that's answering everybody's calls

and this\nAnd that story in the system\nI Will tell you that we see it every two and four years systematically it's now when we come to expect that they want to smear slander destroy character assassinate and\nNow they do it for anybody any thing everybody is fair game doesn't matter how young your children are does it matter what your that your wife is crying behind you does it matter that
