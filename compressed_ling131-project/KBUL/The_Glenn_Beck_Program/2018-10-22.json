election by the numbers here we are twenty eight gene in mid term election and what are the numbers look likes to\nUh depending on what you're looking at a you can find a lot of good and a lot of bad if you happen to be a Republican or a rooting for conservatives to to have a chance here to pass anything I'm obviously UD both to really have a good chance of passing anything and that we've seen over the past uh\nTo the past couple of years even that is no guarantee you have to get anything done um but\nUh what you're seeing now is really good pulling up for the GOP in the Senate a lot of these races that were close have moved to ... direction\nUm to get to fifty is which is what they need of course have control with Mike Pence was the deciding vote you need to have a a there is about ten races there um and they've knocked out most of it's not just the ones that lean in their category get them get them to fifty there's additional seven tossup races where they could get all the way up to fifty seven if they were to sweets those\nUm you know maybe even outside shot at something dramatic maybe getting getting to fifty eight\nMost likely you're probably in that area of fifty three fifty four right now which is an improvement over the current situation in the Senate but if they lose the house that doesn't mean is that yeah and you know it doesn't mean it means something but it doesn't mean on a heck of a lot 'cause you're not gonna be able to pass anything 'cause you know the house is going to oppose the\nOther way and houses where it looks so real things look very bad for Republicans um it's interesting the way that they're looking at this is\nNot whether he usually it's like we'll we'll ever will the party loser gain seats right that's the way we usually typically look at these things and then there's the control angle as well who will control the house\nPull even noticed you haven't heard a lot of talk about whether Republicans\nWill will didn't gain any seats flirted because it looks like it's not even possible at this point in fact um the the polling models that they have working right now uh five thirty eight has one which they have um the I the chance of Republicans maintaining their current amount of seats at less than zero point one percent\nAnd you might say oh well they've gotten you know there was issues with didn't get Trump right which is a big thing every time I talk about polls were like oh well they didn't get truck right well first of all the national polls are almost exactly dead on for Donald Trump or it just didn't get the\nAh electoral college right but that also wasn't what they were pulling right some of the states were were obviously wrong\nBut for example uh five thirty I Believe had about thirty percent chance that they thought Donald Trump or when they're saying there was a point one percent less than a point one percent chance that the Republicans will maintain the same amount of house seats in the house in fact they're saying the\nEqual chance that Republicans maintain the same amount of seats as Democrats gaining eighty three seats\nNow both of those are extreme outliers right like I don't think either one of those is going to happen right but the chances of of of the of the Democrats just controlling the house are about eighty percent again more certain if you want to use those words\nAre are more probable is the right way to say it than Donald Trump or being elected or are\nStarted reading kicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and the mayor\n... released a statement at a press

the\nThe just the idea of look this is wrong but we do want to make it any worse he's trying to make it\nSound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream\nOur police can do no right\nBut they act and they're just thugs they don't act and their do nothing's\nSo they have no real way to win\nThe great observation there are two a political parties and whatever you do one of them might criticize you yes that is that the job of being a mirror I get the job of being a leader you're supposed to\nActually have an idea and do something in which I think he did by the way I think you're right what did you were not a big ... and when you say for public consumption that is exactly what he's doing yes his his opinion is oh jeez where we're damned if we do damned if we don't\nBut in reality what he wants is a is much more on this side but yeah the ...\nMore on the ads on both sides and you can back that up with how he reacted to the FBI\nThe FBI building in Portland is ... is under siege for ... to ... I mean think of the balls and these guys\nThey take the FBI building and block it off so FBI agents are are now trapped inside the building they call for police police say ah we've got a call the mayor\nWhat\nI'm calling you dispatch police we have to call the mayor the mayor goes on and says if the FBI thinks that this city is going to back them up there in the wrong city\n... excuse me what what ...\nSo the FBI had to get federal officers to come in and get everybody out of that building and into safety\nSounded nothing Portland did nothing to these guys that I mean whoa what is this\nIt's a I mean it's it's close to anarchy right and certainly the way that that you think it would come if it does it say you know the idea that you the FBI can't depend on police officer forget the FBI just these are people that these are actual real individuals who are in danger or and\nThat was a woman who has the food carts across the street from the FBI um she was a a threatened with it\nAnd that was a woman\nWho has the food carts across the street from the FBI um she was a a threatened with an inch of her life that I think they've had to move out of the city or in your family um they took her stuff destroyed it a threatened the neighbors who are coming down trying to you know stick up for\nI mean they're just that they've become animals they become animals and their claim these are they're streets no they're not\nThey're not punk have you paid for them because I think a lot of the people who are trying to make it to work are the ones who actually paid for it your streets since when but\nEnough history usually people are who are um\nYou know national socialists or Marxist radicals of some sort they were in power and they let this they let this stuff go until the people have had enough\nAnd then they do what they want with those people and they you know use those people\nAs cover to seize even more power that's the way it works on a national scale I have no idea what this Portland mayor is doing\nBut it's insane\nMeanwhile Alex ...

Glenn Beck dot com slash too\nI become desperate to hold on to something I thought I might be losing and I thought I had to do something special to keep it\nI started doing things out of my comfort zone like presenting and the truth is\nIt had been a while since I had been having fun it started I started to worry about ticket sales for my tours what the critics said what the perception of bite me might be I felt like I was living with this over my face and near a and the reality I was seeing was old blurred by it\nI decided I never wanted to read my name and print again never read a review and I never have I decided I'd never use social media again and I never have but the diagnosis made me realize how stupid I had been to worry about all of these unimportant things I was embarrassed by my ego\nI was embarrassed that has allowed this in security\nI realize that for many years I couldn't believe I was on the same stage as my heroes I couldn't believe I was looking cross somebody like Paul McCartney and saying things like it's hard to get here but my God it's harder to stay here\nThan I woke up and sought after ten years of trying to get here in five years of being scared that it would go away I think I can enjoy it\nAfter his son's illness he says I just don't have the stomach for it anymore the celebrity narcissism it started I started to crumble but then I started to wonder why I wanted to do it in the first place\nI had forgotten that it was all about souls connecting because I become so anxious there were people in my business like saying if you hadn't done this or that you've written a better song tickets might be selling quicker I started to take all of that on board\nAnd no one wanted to take any responsibility there's just so much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was insecure enough already\nI Would digested and say it's my fulltime rubbish it affected me and I started to think it's all\nThe thing it is fascinating to read these things from him because what I've always felt about Mike who play was she was just having fun\nHe was just living a dream and I wondered and I never ... spotted in him I just wondered\nIf it was ever going to get old to him because what makes him I think the best performer I've ever seen on stage is that joy she just has a joy of performance and it is it is so infectious\nYeah he loves it I mean you can tell when you understand why if you can tell he just absolutely loves doing it or at least did at one point um but they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports that he's actually thinking about stopping it completely\nHe says I was learning with passion that I was afraid I'd become a mere pour photo copy of my heroes\nBut when I come back from this terrible time I realized I'm not a mere photocopy I've learned everything I can from them taking it found my own soul my own voice my own style and now no credit can take that away\nIt needed clarifying now I've just seen the music I Love maybe when you let go that's when it comes back to you it's a lot like love\nHe is um he he I think he's joking about he's because he says I miss the guys in my band so when my wife had to go back to Argentina I said to the guys come on over to the house let's have a drink order some pizza place and video games and jam\nThey came over we partied and I said let's play some music and I thought wow\nThis is fun it was then that I realized I missed making music I didn't even know I missed it that was about a year ago so why would he possibly be saying that he is now\nIt seems like it might be one of those situations where the Internet has taken a somewhat a sarcastic comment and turn it into reality has its spokespeople are coming out today and saying that he's not actually going to retire because he's in the middle of a tour in a book or their album released and all that other stuff so here's what he ...\nHere's what he says exactly to the reporter\nHe pauses there are three reasons I wanted to do this album one because I felt a debt of gratitude to deeper than I can explain to the millions of people all over the world who prayed for us and showed us compassion that gave me faith in humanity to because I Love music and I feel I can continue the legacy of my idols\nAnd three because of the world was ending not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe break up\nThere's never a better time for music then he suddenly stops quote this is my last interview he says quite solemnly I'm retiring from the business of made the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top end quote [laughter]\nSomehow though the writer says I don't think he really means it\nIt's unbelievable because you know that it was put all over the media\nAs if he was retiring well he said it was his last interview he's got other interviews scheduled right like he's had a whole press tour for this album is just silly and most important thing though is is looking at that and saying\nThat is really the type of thing that ... that changes your perspective completely right you go through something like that and you stop and you examine all the nonsensical idiocy that you you participate in everyday\nUh and you can re prioritize you don't want to have to go through that to do it but sometimes it's the only thing that makes you kind of re prioritize the things you're doing in your life\nUh and and he seems to have I mean he he he's making thirty five million dollars a year if he's out there\nWalk away from that um because he just wants to spend time with his son how many times you hear those excuses I'm so according to our time with my family that was completely real tough guy yeah it's nice to see somebody who actually you know kind of nice to see\nThat he he got through it and has made it into a good thing you know I I have I have\n... probably more respect for Michael boo play than any other professional that I've ever met in the entertainment industry\nBecause he has found a way to keep his feet on the ground and he was on afraid I mean when everybody when everyone it was very popular to hate me\nShe didn't mean hobby right you know by the heat but he and he was never taking a stand for me he just wouldn't he just didn't understand and he's like look\nI'm I'm not in politics I'm Canadian\nWhy do I care and so you get out of it and then it got to fight a lot about yeah he said the guy turned around and said I could leave you look what Beck and he's like I'm Canadian I don't vote what what does it matter what does it matter to you\nAnd the guy's real ... and he said I drew punches back and he's got to do it I got into a hockey fight [laughter] you got to do a hockey fight and [laughter]\nI Am so happy to hear that his family is um is doing better and his son has made this miraculous turn and ah Michael ... you've given enough if you want to give more we will certainly take it\nBut uh do what's right for you do what's right for you and for your family and\nYour real fans will be thrilled no matter what you decide clan\nForty minutes is all you all have our world can be scary lady

about a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there was the last seven ten or ten of these that you're\nFollowing ten altogether okay out an altogether okay so let's take on one real quick\nBegin very good when ... okay here we go this is called\nThe er the search suggestion effect when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you typed so if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon\nRight away they'll start slashing suggestions at you and Amazon and it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments\nThat Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you to turn a fifty fifty vote among a fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety ten split\nWill buy one having any idea they're being manipulated\nEspecially when we get two artificial intelligence couldn't they system like Google be used to identify unstable individuals and wind them

things you can do to him and one of the ... one of the many things I found on that list as you shouldn't be using Google Analytics which Glenn Beck dot com\nIs using [laughter] so that the individual level now as the as the organizational governmental level there's\nUm is using [laughter] so that the individual\nLevel now as the as the organizational governmental level there's other things uh you
