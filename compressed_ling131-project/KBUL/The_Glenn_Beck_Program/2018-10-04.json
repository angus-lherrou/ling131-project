the best opportunity and futures for kids and grandkids is not complicated but politicians want power may get complicated\nWell that's exactly right and I don't understand why why the the other side just doesn't want the same thing that doesn't make any sense\nOr I currently you hold on the ship until I got an opportunity to be back down there in Charleston to say Hi to everybody thank you so much for being with us a can is in palm coast Florida next on the Sean Hannity show Ken how are you welcome to the sewer swamp known as your nation's capital\nSean I used to live in Arizona actually lived up in a town called snowflake and it's funny how you call just snowflake but that is a real town\nIn every ... wow yeah it it it's a two two members that started the town or something snow in something flake and they named the town's snowflake in uh when I Lived up there and I lived in Arizona I had the head to vote for\nBoth flake and John McCain\nAnd I used to call him when I Lived back there and I would tell them all the time I had to hold my nose to vote for you\nAnd it's up to you to hold your nose to vote for you know what I was ... whatever's going on at the time and now I'm saying the same thing that Jeff Flake I did help him get elected and I would wish he would just hold his nose and support the president he doesn't have to like what do you know the president which we all know he doesn't\nBut he should at least support the people that\nElected him and they're not well let's remember what\nHe said it remember what he said it was sixty minutes on Sunday night he said well what he was asked would you be able to vote this way if you are facing the voters\nThey all got absolutely not which means I'm only at doing this because I don't have to face the voters again otherwise I Would just do what was politically expedient so now I'll do what I Want to do that's basically what he said\nBut when he was even in back then when when he was you know this is I've been out of every one for a couple of years he he missed major votes that we needed them on one was when he was home with his daughter at some dance recital and another one he went through his son's wedding\nAnd he said that you know the heat plant this was planned a long time ago and he wasn't going to miss it sounds wedding well who in the Senate would say okay if you're going to get married get married why we're in session\nYou know he he he didn't have a chance I probably I had a hard time even in I call him in and really hard time\nThe chance I probably I had a hard time even and I called him in and really hard time they employ I always was played for the people I talked to and I always wish them a good weekend but he he had been a disappointment\nFor years and years and years he's he's just a it's a good thing is going away hopefully I think the only thing he joined me to do is run at a Democrat and you might see that happening\nWhile I Will tell you the Arizona is have a

then I think I think it's really going to help the economy crowd\nI Want you know I don't know maybe I just have such a sense of urgency 'cause we're on the precipice here of of literally having a transformational economy in the country\nUm if we open up if we've kept these energy resources and all these companies build these manufacturing centers in factories and we get better trade deals like the new trade deal with Canada and Mexico\nThe American workers going to see serious significant prosperity we're going to have an opportunity to take cities once great cities like Detroit Michigan

whirlwind\nOr I missed the speaker thanks for being with us thirty three days to election day appreciate your time eight hundred nine four one\nAnd then that evolved into well I'm well Brett Kavanaugh saw near the punch bowl so it may be probably was one of them and he gave out red solo cups I saw her and give out red solo cups well it wasn't lined up in the hall but he was in the hall I saw him in a hall and nobody\nElse can corroborated they were never getting the answer that they want it\nBecause they've all known as the smear so now they're just me or the FBI investigators in this case that did what they were supposed to do there never was going to be a recommendation or a conclusion made by the FBI we learn that from Joe Biden in Nineteen Ninety One\nBut that wasn't the purpose of any of this their whole their dream their prayer was that the FBI would find the smoking gun that didn't exist based on the accusers own words in each specific case\nAnyway joining us now glad you're with us by the way eight hundred nine four one Sean Dr Sebastian Gorka former advisor to President Trump author of the\nSoon to be released book why we fight moniker Crowley is a contributing editor to

it never was coming was it\nNow because they never would be enough for them is Sean very smart and reality that none of our ships they cited and that is that the left is that war\nThere at war for the future of the country they are at war against the constitution they're at war against free market economics air war against individual liberty in other words there are at war with everything that judge Kavanaugh stands for and both fight for on the Supreme Court\nTherefore not on my block you must be destroyed because if if it were I was sent to the highest court well that means that the left is no longer I couldn't even she used the highest court in the land to slam treated their agenda because lord knows they can't necessarily get it to the ballot box\nFor decades they've been around lying on the judiciary in order to affect their ... and they know what happened on the bench it's essentially over forgotten and they're going to have to change tactics that's why they have\nI don't

please we need your help hurry up please write us now tell us\nYour absolutely right so I wrote a piece that they in the hills um which is a kind of summary of my my book why we fight\nIf you're surprised at what Kavanaugh has been put through this trial by ... deal this this column or you shouldn't be then you have no historic perspective the Democrats have been doing this for a century now\nGo back to Nineteen forty days and the case of Whittaker Chambers his was the first ever televised live televised testimony before Congress and what happened that this is a man who was a former communist who knew where the communists were inside the\nUS government including out his loved by the Democrat Party senior State Department of\nFormer officials and he he told Congress this guy's a Soviet a joke I was the person carrying secret messages from Moscow to out to his out to his denies it but because he he was a a darling of the left they took\nWhittaker Chambers and they accused him of everything you can imagine\nThat they choose them of not only being unfaithful to his wife they choose them in the death of his brother ... of the accusations are true I'm a\nLoan officer would have been trained as died when the load a a a communications with the classified we have the proof that out to his was a Soviet spy so sure they've been doing this since at least the second World War and a lot of cars absolutely right that doing this because they are at war\nWith the will of the American people we told we chose Donald Trump Donald Trump chose judge Kavanaugh and that is why drugs capital must be destroyed so\nWhat are these three Republican senators do a Collins and Murkowski and of course Jeff Flake and then what is Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp was down by a Lebanon North Dakota do Monica\nWell I think based on from the comments we've hurt today Sean from Senator common particular looks like they're pretty satisfied with the FBI investigation on and it looks like they could be yes his flight crew knows pizza flake\nSo who knows what he is going to do just that we might pick up some red state Democrats like Joe Manchin Heidi Heitkamp is now down ten points in her ... in North Dakota and if they really want to stand for the constitution and what you write and human decency they will vote\nTo Claire I'll be honest if they if they vote for Kavanaugh it's probably going to be an election year conversion in only after they see that the Republicans have the votes to confirm him\nYou know showing if I could just jump in just that when he ate it apparently in summer yet the house for his case do you know but Republican congressmen exposed to it says it's certainly a spy it was Richard Nixon\nIvory teeth today and spectator give us the ... I went back I looked at my notes of my conversations with Nixon during the Clarence Thomas here\nI teach today and spectator your essay to ...
