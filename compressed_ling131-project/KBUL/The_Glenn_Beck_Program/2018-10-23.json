something that nobody else did they actually took the time to actually look at Donald Trump's real background real roots his family his father and you know you tell a lot of gripping stories in a book about how well the mean horrible landlords\nActually weren't so mean after all when people came on hard times they would work with people and help people\nThat's absolutely true story that's actually the Carol want a family they in thirty forty your friends and stuff and I wanted to relate that story and all and I'll tell it quickly\nOr Fred Trump showing up to collect rent with his twenty six year old son Donald Trump and and they're walking through the uh the garden apartments knocking on doors Carolina family cannot pay the rent\nThe father has lost a job in a blue collar worker credited his son are looking at him saying okay no problem a very honest guy let's wait a month let's see what happens I suspect you'll get a job well and behold a sixty short days later\nA he gets a job pays the rent that he was owed a and it's just a wonderful story that their family never\nGoing to be told by the mainstream media above people talk about what does the president that compassion for these people does the president of apathy and the answer is yes he learned it at the riding shotgun with his father\nIs he was either building these buildings helping to build these buildings are collecting rent from blue collar people that were living shot so\nSo I wanted I get a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story arc of the Trump family which is a great American success many ways the additive family is also an American success story the arts are different uh and the generational transfers are different uh but they're both part of America that both part of the fabric of America\nYou know the the generations that built this country and I don't know if you're a Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations of built these this country are just amazing people the immigrants that built this country my grandparents all for coming from Ireland\nUh anyway the book is called the Trump the blue collar president Anthony Scaramucci it's up on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere Anthony good to see we're going to see on TV this week we look forward to my friend and all the best on your book tour and hope people will run out and get a copy of it because it's worthwhile reading\nI appreciate it God Bless you meant\nMy front with Fifteen days till election day one of the important Senate races were watching is out in the great state of Arizona which by the way quit\nA son when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harbored al ... who came and killed three thousand Americans sense then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include you know troops will I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them in our a ten but oftentimes ah you know the ... the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there was ... it was a silence there\nAnd everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nAnd for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign and Arizona and should make a different choice to not vote for years and said this is really personal for\nThose of us who served in were shot at by the Taliban and and saw Americans perished over this\nUh you know I hear the emotion in your voice and understandably so I mean you said six deployments that's amazing\nOh I hear the emotion in your voice and understandably so I mean you sit said six deployments that's amazing\nYeah well again it was an absolute honor there's so many Americans who have done that and more are both on the ground in the air and I see I mean this is this is you know why we fight\nTo protect our way of life and our freedoms and our liberties and at this and it is you know in addition to this a comment saying it's okay for an American to join the Taliban to basically commit trees and\nAlso was protesting right after nine eleven protesting our troops in a pink to to a flyers handed out at protests that she led depicting our troops as skeletons in saying stop the U.S terror in the middle east so this isn't just a one off for her uh this is the pattern she advocated is shutdown Luke air force base\nI hosted the president President Trump at Luke air force base on friday to see what an amazing national security treasure it is she's trying to cover up or tracks and with George Soros\nChuck Schumer and the millions of dollars that are flowing in to you know cover their tracks and Turner into something that she's not in the greatest political cover up in Arizona history a lot of people think she's moderate a lot of people think she's right of center a and it's just not true and we\nGot only coming out on a three weeks before the election I mean it's almost on a daily basis it's like the you know a a deep dive dump has been made but I Would think that this was common knowledge\nOr had to have been common knowledge about her I mean I I wouldn't underestimate remember the allegations against the blind shakes attorney that she invited to Arizona State university I mean that's another slap in the two people\nThat absolutely look at you know a sort of joke that the Democrat Party should have done better in internal opposition research on her before they had her Wii Chuck Schumer top recruit\nFor them to try to flip the Senate majority we knew about her radical cats uh we've been telling people about it in Arizona every single day uh and that and the last few weeks you're right some some videos and and things are coming out every single day but unless you're on conservative radio conservative TV Fox\nOr another on social media you're not finding out about this and so we still have another a number of independents\nAnd Republicans who are not tuning it unfortunately that need to know every time we have to put up and add to put some of these statements and like you just played it cost us about seven hundred thousand dollars\nTo make sure the message gets out to the voters as they are voting every single day right now and she's had so much money dumping into her you know and if people do on a supporter of course they can go to make Sally for Senate dot com 'cause we really do need to have to make sure Arizona they're aware\nOf Arizona are aware of all of this they will never vote for her if they are aware of your heroic background they absolutely will vote for you\nUm I've only gotten to get to know you in in recent months and I got to tell you I'm more impressed every single time I talk to you and I think you'll be a great senator from the state of Arizona I Hope you're not going to turn into Ben Sasse and run away from me after you get elected but I'm less happen more than willing to honor\nYou know it's on you may not remember but back when I was a major in the air force I took out in the Pentagon because they were making our service women wear ... when they were in Saudi Arabia and I put my career on the line and I actually sued the department of defence\nAh fought for eight years and got legislation passed to overturn this and I actually went on the Hannity income show during that whole thing ah to talk about how important it was to protect our religious liberties and not say\nIt was a very you know that that was that was a good move I mean I I don't like the idea of American\nSoldiers are are on foreign soil and were there to protect them and help them which is usually the case\nAh I don't think that we need to go by their customs were Americans we get to follow her own customs or else you don't want us there then you don't want us there\nUh I don't think that we need to go by their customs were Americans we get to follow her own customs or else you don't want us there then you don't want us there\nExactly that's exactly oh we we were there it was with the U.S military policy it was ridiculous I stood up for it I saw for it took me eight years but I finally got legislation passed as a citizen or to overturn it and make\nSure that our values are that were set up for it yeah\nWell I really had a little bit of a wider president anew and here I'm a bit more than\nA million dollars if you're not paying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention Christian cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban while Martha McSally doing her six tour of duty twenty eight years serving our country ah she's out one of those crazy pink hats on you know talking down our troops and accusing them didn't you choose them of torture as well\nAs she was a line with a radical uh anti border patrol a group down at the border trying to help uh you know help with illegal immigration and that group ah ... accused the border patrol of torture yes it was a ... or getting radical extreme group that she was very much involved in a in the inner path\nWhat do you think the president needs to do with the seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border if they make it to the border what's the best plan for the president or\nThis is absolutely ridiculous we have got to stop them from coming in the president needs to use all elements of power that he has shown we're seeing little mini caravans coming in every single day though because they're taking advantage of our loopholes in the law\nUh I work very closely with President Trump a it's often called the good that bill that was also the Knicks Sally bill that would provide thirty eight billion dollars for the border wall to secure our border and close the loop holes at the cartels are taking advantage of\nIt has to stop every single day right now there's people coming in in ... uh and that's a a sector that is being overrun right now\nAll they do have been down there many times they redo\nYeah they're released into the interior of the United states sixteen thousand five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recorded\nThis is not ... rather than John Paul it's a Democrat's fault for obstructing a closing loopholes and securing the border and the president as frustrated as the eye and he needs to use everything he's got enough to to get to to put pressure on Mexico\nAnd then they use them for building a wall and funding and fully funding all yes and you have\nBoarded our bills thirty eight billion dollars including building a wall yes or\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell it's on I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on that House bill I'm getting my asking for it right now because it's being misconstrued by the Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people who have family\nMight wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare has failed in Arizona there's only one choice and fourteen and favorite counties which has no choice people lost their health care coverage we had people right now at three conditions who can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I worked hard to make sure that we were moving away from that uh and and towards something that gives more choice for people\nMore flexibility at the state level more free market get the federal government you know to not be doing this one size fits all top down penalty taxes and mandates it's failed\nAnd so we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ... vote I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions\nOh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr Martha McSally a really a rock star a hero who served their country and an important race for the Republicans as the done only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to\nIt'll make votes for Supreme Court justice is a lot easier going up against a very radical leftists in the name of Chris and send them a thank you so much a Martha McSally for all you've done for your country and and the positions you take and ah you should win this race\nFar and wide when

victories I'm Scott Rasmussen was the closest pollster John McLaughlin was the other coast poster in twenty uh sixteen and he says there's an eighty six percent chance the Democrats take over the house\nEighty two percent chance that Republicans picked up seats in the Senate I don't have a feel on the house but I Do believe\nRepublicans could actually win Florida Tennessee Missouri Nevada Arizona for sure North Dakota for sure maybe Montana and if they didn't have a libertarian in Indiana they win that race for sure but\nThey got a good shot beating Joe Donnelly in Indiana if people don't vote libertarian I'm On the house side it's very hard to get a feel forty retirements doesn't make it any easier\n... but I think eighty eighty percent way too high\nAnd a little surprised the silver or for the second cycle rose going ... um you know the most recent survey indicates that in fact you have 'em in the very closely contested districts and this was an NBC survey um that they actually\nAre within about two points on the generic ballot\nWell if if the contest districts now we're losing the Democratic districts very badly we're also not spending much money and I'm we're not campaigning and I'm we're not making our case a but but in the swing sheets that matter a we actually are basically tied the generic ballot\nIn and all I can tell you is\nI I look at the issues that are going to matter should the two things happening you see this little bit with Stacey Abrams or in in Georgia the candidate for governor who explained today that she's opposed to free enterprise and health care because she she hates making a profit and you never do any good if you make a profit\nUm and and she is just very left wing\nCinema the Democrat and in Arizona for US Senate\nRefuses to apologize for urging them\nJust very left wing cinema the Democrat and in Arizona for US Senate\nRefuses to apologize for urging Americans to saying it's okay\nFor Americans to join the Taliban um what's happened in Minnesota now where I think you also\nMay drag down the entire chicken except for any closure they may lose a Senate seat house seats the governorship a because with Keith Ellison is just so totally left wing and unacceptable and so I keep looking around\nAt these patterns and I think what you're seeing is a remarkable moment where\nThe whole you know for example when we were talking about ten days ago you and I work but this was a race between jobs and marched well if you look at the pictures coming out of Mexico right now you couldn't get a better picture of a mob or do you watch the Democrat\nAsk you can you know they could you stay for another five minutes I Want to really get into this more deeply because it's the true important wherever fourteen days out of an election\nOr the ... they're actually fake news CNN actually says president wise price to gin up division\nAnd they've never covered what Maxine Waters has been say\nThey've never covered a single thing of her saying you know create a crowd follow them into a grocery stores follow them into department stores gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted here anywhere anymore or what's happened to Pam Bondi or a secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders a Ted Cruz and now that McConnell and Henry Kissinger and\nYou know obviously this is the the mob mentality is coming from the left\nNor do I see Mr Speaker nor can I say\nYou know obviously this is the the mob mentality is coming from the left nor do I see Mr Speaker nor can I say or\nElaborate on any one issue or program they're offering that will help the lives of the American people not one that's not what they're running on\nYou know I look I I well they do run on a government run health care for everybody which they can't defend the which which when you examine it collapses\nBecause this totally unsustainable financially and would be a nightmare to try to implement that's the closest thing they've come to a big idea and it's a really bad idea for\nAgree totally All right um we'll be checking him regularly fourteen days to go or do you believe the admission by this Georgia gubernatorial candidate that she burned the state flag or is that going to change that race now\nWell I don't think that that doesn't change the race for those the totality of her being a radical the fact that the organization she headed up may have filed twenty three thousand falls voting registrations for people who don't exist I mean I think the more we learn about the more trouble she gets to be in for\nI really appreciate it thank you so much a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich let's get to our phones here uh oh I got to say Hi to big time AJ Houston, Texas he was the star at the at the\nTown hall I was in we had a wonderful time down in Texas I saw big time AJ I saw a Rick Perry I saw Ted Cruz and there was AJ came up on stage with me\nAnd uh you know I I don't know why I had a different mental picture of view\nAnd I mean you have this big huge massive powerful voice\nAnd you know what you like the same size as me [laughter] [laughter] how are you I enjoyed meeting you big time what's going on maybe\nA baby boy I tell you I like I go there but I talked rally last night yeah how was that oh my\nGosh I'm like I if I that they are everybody to know that that are happy bad at ... big time Sean Hannity

everybody in the crowd went nuts it was like you know I almost thought you were running for office which by the way may not be a bad idea at some point that you run\n... they're probably knock me out the box but it's funny you say that South Africa that China two guy in a ballot at you know\nI saw you signing autographs it and I said I [laughter] I think crime signing autographs and then we brought Linda on the stage\nAnd she said Linda say\nNew York I said I think New York and she goes New York and I said said talk talk and say don't go for single for 'em [laughter] that was pretty funny I was one of my lighter it\nOh she's so awful so glad to meet her ... author I filled out ... at ... ... it's all about Bush John\nI use it here on Sundays by the way it is not as sweet as every day [laughter]\nHey but they got the uh uh uh when I told him\nIt is every day [laughter]\nHey but I got I got when I told him were because they wanted to go to Scott added\n[laughter] all\nI Need is this you always have this optimism this love of life this enthusiasm [noise]\nYou know I don't know I'm hoping two weeks from now maybe I'm maybe my ex the expectations are out of whack I'll deal with whatever the results are not a cry baby Weiner and like these liberals after they lost and twenty sixteen I sucked it up when Obama won two terms you know we're survive whatever the country throws at us but wouldn't that be nice\nAgain to shock the world wouldn't that be nice to say that the Republicans not only are picking up houses in the seats in the Senate\nWell I'm pretty confident we can do that but if we also prevent Nancy Pelosi from becoming speaker how sweet would that be how great would that be thinking of the feeling you'll have on election night if you spend the time and you go out and you're voting you do your job especially I put up on my website the top fifty races\nThat this is where the balance of power would tipping point ends up on Hannity dot com\nOh big time that you would say that what we understand and I get a date and they own the big screen without paying ... ... you know there's twenty six ... and have the ... sorry media basis\nOr oh they're desperate Sunday Donald Trump a liar Trump is hiding you know very victory all that's all over a fake\nNews CNN and conspiracy TV MSNBC I big time I got her on my friend I Love your audience loves you thank you so much for coming the other day I had a great time where you know we have four thousand people a moment in Texas in an air ... airport hangar it was amazing\nUm anyway thank you so much a Robin in Gainesville in Florida next to important races down there on the sand is over Gillum\nGod help Florida if you ever like Gillum your your business atmosphere will collapse in Florida and Rick Scott deserves to go to the U.S Senate he's been an amazing governor how are you what's going on Rob\nHey Sean thank you very much for taking my call I just wanted to\nSay that uh [noise] you know the left I always like to paint the right as being a monsters for not\nA you know sympathizing with their poor the poor people that are coming from other countries that have horrific a\nOppression and those other countries and fat very bad situations where we had the exact same stories for people who were on the list doing it legally with the exact same problems that I don't think it's a we should you know highlight those people's stories and you know get more exposure to those\nStories that are doing it the right way and say hey listen we draw the line everyone's got the same tragedies and where we will prior we won't\nUm disrespect the people that are doing it the right way by just letting anyone come in and\nWent to have you know this ... you cannot allow them to do this they're not going to be allowed to create a mob at the border and rush the border and what a violent and let me tell you something if we had the wall up it would be\nMore safe and more secure for both sides let me tell you what I don't ever want to have happened\nAnd I have no doubt that many of the people not care of and they want a better life they're good people their government sucks there's no hope no opportunity and the government that gets so much aid for from us a lot of these governments that we give money to all around the world so many of them are corrupt\nAnd it doesn't ever get to the people where we wanted to get to but the reality is as we can\nSo we give money to all around the world so many of them are corrupt\nAnd it doesn't ever get to the people where we want it to get to but the reality is is we cannot allow we are a sovereign nation we have our country that has built on a constitution and the rule of law this is the law the land we have a process designed\nTo take in people from other countries you got to first follow the law if you want to be in America that's it\nAnd and I know the Democrats are silent on the issue but most Americans agree that you know they would be precipitating a showdown crisis where people are going to get hurt I don't want anybody on either side to get hurt\nNobody wants innocent people hurt out we don't know we can't vouch for every person in that crowd we can't say that there are not people that are bad intentions that they want to bring into America maybe it's just the tiniest the percentage what if it's five people out of fourteen thousand we cannot risk that\nAnd by the way if we allow them to Russia border bone rushed the border and get in and we were all reward that behavior or the next one's going to be fifty thousand that was going to be a hundred thousand and then we'll have what Democrats love open borders and then they'll call for amnesty when they think they have enough future generations of ups\nAnd we can't have it and it's got to be stopped at some point\nI urge Mexico to do the job now in turn these people around that's their job\nListen I Want to remind you off year elections are really about one thing and that's you turning out showing up\nThis election is one of the most important we've seen in decades your tax savings that's on the ballot the economy's on the ballot America's comeback and continuing ed is on the ballot jobs are on the ballot your kid's futures on the ballot your wages your retirement plans that's on the ballot if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on
