will go to Atlanta will say Hi to I'm All right let's go to our phones we've had a Robert is in a king North Carolina Robert Hi how are you glad you called sir\nA very very very honored to speak with you a story but I Do need your help um I have a daughter twenty two years and\nDidn't vote for Trump She uh pretty much went against the grain of everything he used on ah luckily have been able to get her to see the good and everything that Trump has done for this country\nWhere I'm having my problem is with judge Kavanaugh um she just I Can't get her to see the conservative side of it how the Democrats are going to bad mouth anybody call anybody for to\nOur values and I can't\nGet oh no I mean we spend a lot of time going over all the allegations\nAnd in the case or professor Ford or Mr Ramirez or miss sweat they get that cetera I mean in every particular case and\nUm I Would just lay out to your daughter and then go over you know what the allegations were how they came out whereas any corroboration than any of the cases I mean I thought the most outrageous one was the final one to get by miss sweating egg you was claiming and her story shifted in changed dramatically within the course of a week from\nMy perspective and I think you know she was basically claiming almost on a weekend basis that these kids were drugging these young girls teenage girls and boys will wind up in the halls and they were waiting their turn to gang raped the girls now a ... hard pressed you\nKnow again the the media looked high or low why didn't far\nTo find any cooperation and they weren't able to the case of Mr Ford the one I witnessed she placed in the room so that didn't happen or even her best friend says she doesn't remember any parties that she was with judge Kavanaugh so you do need some type of corroboration if you believe in due\nProcess and presumption of innocence and I think we I think the Republicans handled it with the sensitivity of deserves with the severity it deserves considering the severity\nOf the allegation but I'm not a person that Russia's to judgment on ... you have to I Believe that it served this country well to follow the rule of law and due process\nAnd a presumption of innocence and I think that happened in this case and I think the person that laid out the best case and that was what Susan Collins\nAnyway thank you Robert good luck with that um let me play you know twenty two days I just want to remind you\nWe now know I was telling your earlier in the program today Democrats or advice don't talk about open borders in an elimination guys anymore it's not helping us don't talk about impeachment is not helping us even Maxine Waters admitting that they're telling your don't talk about these things\nYou know but remember this will be their agenda in twenty two days they will want endless investigations they won't want impeachment they want to open borders they ... they want their crumbs back\nAnd this woman Nancy Pelosi would be your speaker so pretty much if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for Nancy Pelosi and her views on her values which are radical San Francisco views and values listen\nI can still every African ... we have had to bail says that you can find out what is in ... in\nTerms of the phone is set in ... versus the problems and then say on our camping too far fetched ... petition originally so ...\nAnd ... and then nothing and I think the issue of citizenship that is not just about these young people which would be tested his enough\nFor that other undocumented in a in a sense in our country who was under some pension impatient ... should in my view the phone and pass a long term ... earned\nEarned ...\nI've ever had the experience before I was just\nAnd then I realized for coming on camera\nTo be at risk as cold as far\n... their hair\nAnd saying they're asking people to the hospital and he says ...\nHave to kind of how\nThings are going to say this gives them some stock and then in the slippery slope\nHe was like to Institute a single parent health care program and cancel raise taxes I think they mean roll back the tax cuts that they pass the fear is that what do you think of that when that second part is accurate [laughter]\nSanctuary city my health law enforcement half half of their\nFamily things I think the country here who are working hard in military who are in school [noise] who are\nGetting tired of asking the chair I Do\nThink that if there's ever going to be an opportunity to raise the debt cast part time when gas prices are so low oil prices are so low it was time to do it I I I just don't even know why there aren't uprising fall into the country maybe they will be\nI think one of the jobs of\nQuickest way can do\nProvide more signing some stuff\nIn the constitution does not to say that a person can ...\n... and it's ... theater\nThat we're thinking more of a picture of it stopped the night of the things that came out at night of empire I can still every aspect is ...\nSo that's what's at stake in twenty two days just like in the Senate if you're in Montana or North Dakota Indiana Missouri is here in Arizona and Nevada or Florida well if you vote for the Democrat you're voting basically for Chuck Schumer does that's who they're going to vote with\nThat's that's who they will be that sold there'll be listening to ... they will be aligning themselves with that so they will be voting for for their leader\nAnd we already we've had eight years of this and the fact that we're our memories or that short it's frightening at times to me All right back to our busy phones as we say Hi to skip is in Utah skip Hi how are you glad you called\nExtra thanks for taking my call I'm listening to ask the question what are these street will run out of the things that I see the most uh scares me the most is they seem to be running on a hatred for America um you know I don't know how to put up with everything that America stands for is just seems to be being destroyed by these\nDon't want to wait until the broad brush in St Louis and left the left hates America I think there is a a a significant even at times portion of the radical left in this country that literally they hate\nAmerican exceptionalism America's role in the world\nUm they don't like our economic system they believe in they don't believe in capitalism they support socialism they bought redistribution they don't want freedom um and you see an anger that has emerged because I think they are now focused all of their anger on Donald Trump in all things Trump\nAnd you know it's just it's just pouring out of them you know we've tried a lot of these policies we've tried apologizing we've tried bribing dictators under Obama we tried redistribution under Obama we've tried socialized medicine under Obama\nAnd he's the first president never reach three percent GDP Growth in the history of the country\nYou know we know the disaster of Obamacare no millions lost their doctors their plans and they paid twice three times the amount they weren't paying in spite of promises a we know that at the end of his eight years we had Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps and eight million more in poverty\nYou know numbers means something\nAnd frankly to go back\nTo the failed policies now look ... Obama might even be considered moderate compared to where the Democratic party is in the house in the Senate today you know you have one moderate\nAnd the rest of 'em are all pretty radical left\nAnd they don't apologize for their quote socialist beliefs that is the emerging Democratic Party so when I say that a vote for ... or vote for your local Democratic Congress man or woman is a vote for below sea or a vote for in a Senate race in your state is a vote ... I'm not kidding\nThat's real I used to say that if you stay at home and the election that's a half a vote for Hillary Clinton um same pretty much the same thing here and then there's a lot at\nYou will learn the real truth about what it takes to become a millionaire\nIt doesn't matter where you came from it matters where you're going today you can pre order everyday millionaires for only twenty dollars and get over fifty dollars and free bonus items\nThe bonus items include the everyday millionaires audio book any book a video lesson for me called it's okay to be wealthy and video lesson from Chris Hogan called how to retire inspired pre order everyday millionaires Dave Ramsey dot com or call us at AAA twenty two piece\n... am the CGI toward CGI three ... to another hour of Dave Ramsey\nYou can't be will be toward the future three sixty rebuilt for another hour of the rams on news talk Ninety five point five\nBodies recovered I leave ...

anybody to get hurt I don't care what your politics are\nThat's my advice so now here is an interesting Washington Post ABC News poll Republicans now a head and the key battleground house districts now this is the most important part of the poll\nIf you look at it they quote ABC News is recline trickled look at the current generic ballot polling which favors the Democrats but you know it it always favors the Democrats although we have other polls that have shown that that that gap has narrowed significantly\nBut what is pointing out is the core concerns now with three weeks to go three weeks from tonight you're going to get the results\nIs that Democrats worry a whole lot\nThat mid term enthusiasm is going to wind up wasted in places they don't need it\nIn other words what they're really finding is let me translate that oh they have the generic ballot wrapped up in New York Chicago\nNew Jersey Trenton you know San Francisco everywhere in between they have a wrapped up in Los Angeles probably\nBut not in red state America\nAnd what this analysis shows is inside the districts that will result in the the balance of power in the house of representatives voted another way that will decide if Nancy Pelosi once again gets the gambling become speaker it is a dead heat\nForty six forty seven Democrats versus Republicans very similar dynamic driven by democratic strengthen cities their weaknesses in rural areas that is driving house and Senate forecast in opposite directions in other words the Senate is looking good\nMarsha Blackburn after the tape my project bird that she's doing better by fourteen hours up by seven that's such an important race in Nevada Christian cinemas imploding\nAnd Arizona latest revelation no she's inviting\nKnow the blind shakes attorney was under federal investigation at the time to speak at Arizona State and of course the people Arizona are crazy and it's the meth capital of the world might have a little something to do with borders

luck with that race at this point\nSame thing with ... you know Heidi Heitkamp well the only way these Democrats can win as to why do you not talk about what they really want to do\nNew York times is now concerned that Democrats could be in for disappointment on November sick a column their headlined what could ruin a big blue wave two prominent New York Times' columnists sum up the problem with these words quote Donald Trump seems to have a faded Hispanics voter Rath\nWhat ... what does that mean anyway you mean the fact that we have the lowest level of unemployment for Hispanic Americans and African Americans and women in the workforce look I I get to some people don't like Donald Trump style\nBut you can't argue with the results and you can't argue with the fact that he made promises and he's kept the it's kinda refreshing\nAnyway goes on to point out Hispanic voters despite all Trump's border cruel these well he's always talked about some people to commit crimes and I've been down to the border more than anybody in the New York times\nAnd I've seen it myself maybe they should go to the drug warehouses and should ride horse back all terrain vehicles and helicopters boats like I haven't stand by the border walls and and you know look at the tunnels that have been built and look at that\nHas occurred maybe sit through security briefing and the Rio Grande in the Texas

last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist in say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\nYet it's working everyone I think you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between you know\nThe Affordable CARE Act I mean we want to go down there to try to take us down the path of socialized total government controlled health care you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decisions based upon their individual DNA or going to take a one size fits all approach to healthcare it doesn't make any sense and\nYou know Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump any more than Republicans walk their healthcare chosen by you know Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians into health care with it but the government control health care system when you can have a better way through a direct primary care relationship\nWhere did not leave this is the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more and you get far in theory or care because it never really was about the patient really was always about\nRedistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth than American top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income one percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners\nPay Ninety seven percent so what they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young\nAnd generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying for one check up a year right out of their own pocket\nAnd also getting a catastrophic plan if God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or at a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr amber\nYep this is a one size fits all model um it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to\nEnsure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring you medicines that cost a penny a pill I can get a thousand ... blood pressure medicine for four dollars and Ninety cents\nSo the big box retailers will show you Ninety pills for ten dollars is highway robbery we knew cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases\nThe fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is can compete on quality\nAnd lower their price just like Fifteen minutes we'll save you Fifteen Percent on car insurance we need to get back to a competitive model for the patients are in control and cares affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nWe're at you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do their the innovators in this up front pricing lower costs no government mentally All right well that's true how do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your ...\nPricing lower costs no government mentally aren't all that is true\nHow do you get Congress to how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know for example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would that would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nHealthcare is local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear as the calorie is not coming from Washington to say\nNow if we wait for ... from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other fix this problem themselves and that's exactly what this loop and the movement does eliminate\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our patients\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but it's it is interesting that the one look every Americans worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the healthcare after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh I'm productively as gross the probably one of the defining issues that caused people make people think the Democrats are actually going to help them and that's not\nA we appreciate your time eight hundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone
