to go to a broad range of allegations were already in this together by scholars on by the\nTime you may not by the FBI should we should the FBI now investigate them if this is the new standard Jonathan\nNo because that's not our authority that those are local crimes that happened now in the case of we need Roderick though however um he that would have been a state matter because that the time a Bill Clinton was the attorney general\nYou know and so but here's the thing is that you keep saying and and then you are well have you been here for you keep missing and so many people that are emotionally involved with this if you take the emotion out of it I Know that's difficult because people are very passionate but if you take the emotion out of it and you look at the investigative facts there are none\nAnd there's not going to be any because it doesn't matter who you question the very people that uh the the the alleged victim claims were the closest to the to the electric crime don't know anything\nAnd so if you go out in a perimeter away from the people who the victim says was was there and you interview other people that may have heard somebody say something or heard here say it becomes here say you know that from being in court that\nWhen you have a just eight minutes with no corroborating evidence\nThat case quickly falls to the side\nAnd I certainly agree with Jonathan totally and the the the problem is that and then also the fact that the FBI is being used outside of their authority for a political matter and that scares me as a former FBI agent that scares me\nBecause that is the that's the thing that totalitarian I'm a governments do look\nLook I agree I think that one thing that's important she got back to this one is the standard here this is not a criminal investigation uh this is an investigation and to conduct that may or may not have bearing on way there's somebody get a lifetime appointment [laughter]\nUm and I understand and I agree that this is the kind of extremely political and extremely emotional and I think that's partly because\nAnd yelled is an important question do you have any corroborating witness for\nAny corroborating evidence at all you can say right now\nThat have been on the question that has an unseen\nReally I got an unfair question Jonathan I don't think it's unfair to them\n... well I I think when we say fair or unfair I think what it is is orange intimate question I'll tell you why didn't you know because\nPeople are so again angry and people are saying I Believe her I Believe him but in this case there's just no other witnesses there is no other evidence and so when you're asked if you feel this passionate about something and somebody says\nWhat other information do you have that's legitimate question because there is none and the FBI who was secrete it into this investigation has come up with non either and I can guarantee you if anybody would have earned could of it would be them\nRight and on the other side there is no corroborating evidence as to where the judge was on any given day with a he was there and I I think I think people are emotional for for ...\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and\nA media hysteria that that's why to the extent that people can literally destroy other people

I\nBelieve that the man has spent his entire life wanting to be a judge and get everything that he needed to do to get to that position and he is also like he said on multiple occasions the justice system flock to itself\nIt is intended to protect the innocent and instead what we're seeing if he is absolutely being attacked by them very laws that she has spent his life upholding which is you\nKnow the that defendants did not have to prove their innocence is on the prosecution to prove someone's guilt and they're completely foot thing that the tide and we cannot\nSue for a second Michelle that he gets on the Supreme Court\nAfter going through this experience and he's a judge and\nNow he more than anybody I think it's going to have a heightened sensitivity to the idea of the

three at a very new and\nLevel right so I saw it and I read it and I said it made no sense to me from the very beginning that a person would go to one party\nOr where people were drugged and raped and go to too much less than that made no sense ... and she said this sounds bad and I said yeah Susan is gonna be this way for a while to come\nRead it here's my take on it and being in the law for most of my life prosecutor defense attorney and a judge this doesn't have the ring of truth she said you know that makes sense followed anybody keep going back and putting themselves in that situation and the friends not tell anybody and you've got to remember is ...\nAnd she worked through the process you took ... allegation on its own she went to all the major decision so judge Kavanaugh and spent a lot of time talking to him and this is a ... every I think there should be in every civics class in the country\nEvery high school student should probably have to listen to senator Collins explanation of why she voted the way she did and what the rule of law is all about\nYou know I Am we have an election in thirty two days\nTo me senator or look at\nYour when Senator or I I Know how close you are to Senator McCain\nRight and who recently passed away and I always admired him for being a war hero and I even said I've never regretted not a day not a second supporting him for president in oh wait over ... it was the right decision then and I stand by the day\nI had a lot of disagreements when he came back and voted no on the health care repeal I was frustrated\nThen I remember he said that how would these people on radio and TV\nAnd you know I understood Senator McCain that's you know he kind of had that side of him and I knew it really well\nUm but he also talked in that speech to about civility I don't know if there is not consequences for what has just gone on in the last the teen days political it sounds a ballot box\nI mean so here the consequences a party that will do anything to maintain power should probably never habit or the best thing you can do to stop this in the future is deny them their goal of having more Senate seats more house seats they won't power to bed and what it says and say\nListen I went to the record the allegations don't hold water in terms of him being some kind of gang rape is serial sexual predator he is a very reason logical judge I looked at

they're being driven by people who would assume somebody guilty simply because they don't like their judicial philosophy remembered this America do you really want these people in charge of your
