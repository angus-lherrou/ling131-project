Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points to like the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible Jeff that uh the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nTo shine great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm Scott Brown won when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the model for the unaffordable CARE Act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston determines association has never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist ... she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nI'm In ... Massachusetts whatsoever\nOn this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nBecause you're a one percent or but she also herself deducted fifty thousand dollars worth of closed in one year to lower her own taxes that's always a warrant\nFifty thousand dollars in old clothes that's like the Clintons deducting there used to undo\nOh true they did it as a tax deduction by the way I don't think anybody wants their old underwear and they put a value to it you know I've always said this Jeff that basically liberals are generous only with other people's money that we had the latest numbers from twenty sixteen come out and the ... bottom fifty percent\nOf taxpayers in this country don't pay three percent of the bill just three we have redistribution\n... percent pay forty percent of the bill you know I mean so I mean I don't know what else the tax cuts the fact that they want their crumbs back they want to impeach Trump they want endless investigation they want to keep Obamacare disaster they wanna lemonade eyes open borders I mean that's the whole thing and hate Trump that's it yeah\nShe wants to get rid of ice in fact it was a Cambridge a warrant supporter about a month ago there was arrested for putting a five hundred dollar bounty on ice officers I mean you know her rhetoric actually is dangerous in when Republicans wanted to fix health care make it actually affordable about a year ago she was the one that said the\nRepublicans want blood money from the American people know this is right after Congress in ... had been shot by that Bernie Sanders supporters so you know she really doesn't seem to be able to temper her rhetoric whatsoever and I think if you saw on Monday after the backlash of putting that video out\nA and she got a lot of backlash around the country including Democrats like David Axelrod even as critical\nOr she went on a twenty six I Believe tweet a rant about Donald Trump she's just obsessed with Donald Trump and has no focus at whatsoever on Massachusetts and what's important here whereas a you know I've been a legislator here for eight years I've actually\nPut ... billion dollars in tax cuts back in people's pockets and they know it and we've been campaigning pretty strongly I think that again you're going to be pleasantly surprised in November six with what happens\nIs that I Hope so you may not notice about my background but I live five years in Rhode Island\nAh in Warren Rhode Island not far from the ... borders with Massachusetts and you know I spent a lot of time to sit by the way when it was the greatest NBA time in history with magic\nVersus Larry Bird and and parish McHale and DJ and Danny Ainge I mean it was probably one of the best teams in one of the best rivalries ever in sports\n... annual hall then up I've been to Boston alone so beautiful city but I Will tell you that you know if the people of Massachusetts don't see through those I don't know what to tell them\n[laughter] we'll look Steve grow in the former quarterback probably around the time you were there is a enjoy my race to Curt Schilling indoors but most importantly\nAnyway William ready he needs to indoors [laughter] and we need to get that had his locker Tom Brady is the most\nHated man except for the New England he's the most hated man in football number one because he's a phenomenal football player and they just don't like the fact that he wins that much and they don't like the fact that they as you know a pretty wide who used to be a model they just hate him for it\nRight [laughter] well look at you know ... a lot has changed since you've been here unemployment is now at the lowest we've seen in New England and Massachusetts since Nineteen sixty minutes that's for the whole country but Massachusetts is even lower it said three point five percent right now [noise] warring wants to repeal the tax cuts of two thousand Seventeen that if given our state\nMore money as far as new jobs wage increases our states collected over one point two billion dollars in unanticipated revenue because of that she called the crumbs just like a Nancy Pelosi and she if she had her way would undo that and raise your taxes I think she said fifty percent with either baselines and she's not sure if she had Ninety percent might be too much when she was on\nAh MSNBC a few weeks ago Ninety percent maybe too much but at least fifty percent and then of course she wants to make it fully government run health care which as we know has a thirty two point six trillion dollar\nPrice tag attached to it and of course that puts a bureaucrat between you and your doctor or if you like government run health care that you love having a you know to wait for a hip replacement like Canadian Stewart dialysis like uh people\nAre so many Canadians come to the United states\nThey get better care that they're willing to pay for here that's why\nLike government has to ration health care if they take it over and by the way there is no incentive to drive down costs once government becomes the guaranteed ... just like student loans you know it was a bit sworn complains about the cost of college course she\nCharged two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to teach one course at Harvard or that you know the fact is when government becomes a tale of the loans or whether it's a student just Salter not doesn't matter those colleges get their money and so they drive to cost a year after year after year when government gets involved and takes the free market out of it the competitiveness and\nThat's when costs become completely out of control for us the average Americans\nWell I Wish you the best in this race and I hope our friends of Massachusetts in Boston and everywhere in between will pay attention to\nYou know the big lie of Elizabeth Warren and understand what a real true ambitions are here for her to become president you got to re elect er and Jeff deal is offering a better economic vision and better security for the people of Massachusetts and I wish you well an eraser\nThanks and if people want to get involved it's not too late jail for Senate dot com GI ... s ...
