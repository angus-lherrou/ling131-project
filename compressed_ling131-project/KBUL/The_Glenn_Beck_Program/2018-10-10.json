today\nAnother forty five percent off for the Republicans three percent prefer another candidate\nThat side of five point recent improvement for the G O P\nBut if you go back at this time in twenty fourteen prior to the last non presidential a year congressional election Democrats at a forty one thirty nine lead but Republicans went on to win nine Senate seats and increase their majority in the

phenomenal because you've got to understand folks as powerful as these things are when they get inland fractional effects\nOr it's almost like if you if you're running a nine one a sprint nine one one hundred yard dash if you tweak your hamstring if you can't run that fast if you really pull it you can't run at all well these things have perfect machines but once they get inland the fractional affects the fact that they're moving away from the source of energy the water\nThey ... they wind down but we're talking about a relative winding down how many times as a dust that George you get when sit near hurricane force\nFrom a storm that hit all the way down or close to three hundred miles or two hundred and fifty miles to the south west but the point addict activity yeah make sure we cover for that eastern eastern Georgia eastern South Carolina eastern North Carolina and these tornados as as the storm winds down and the low levels\nStill very strong in the upper levels so what happens is that discrepancy creates these border see these ones that twos\nAnd so you get these higher costs with that and you have tornadoes it wouldn't be surprised if there are a couple of dozen tornadoes tonight into tomorrow in the area south and east and and so so the rainfall I'm Sorry I'm I'm you know just about misinformation out it's like there's so much coming in and I can't\nCan't get it out here are the rainfall three to six locally twelve inches up from a room where we are in Georgia as far in Georgia now but ... South Carolina to North Carolina and a lot of that area that was devastated by Florence\nOther coastal areas probably aren't going to get it as bad they are going to get pretty strong wind gust in here but this is just inland until we get to Elizabeth City and you folks in tide water very late tomorrow night and on a friday morning you're going to get north wins coming in their sixty ... Seventy miles an hour right now in Chesapeake Bay\nBecause there's this reaches the coast\nAnd those same professional affects them talking about overland diminish the storm all wrapped back up again and then go out to sea and stay at a male be there'll be a nor'easter from a DC to to Boston\nTell me because I really what it what are the areas that that may have tornado activity exactly so people can make preparations and be ready\nWell south in ... south and east of a path let's say from Columbus, Georgia\nOr to Greenville Spartanburg I think ah to Raleigh Durham\nTo the tide water of Virginia you live south and east of that path and the further south east to go the more the more you have to watch out for that you're going to see tornado watches and warnings be put into effect in those areas and a over the next several hours I Believe they'll start putting that out\nOf putting that out there if they haven't already I'm sure there's tornado watches up now I'm just trying to look at the forecast map going forward to tomorrow and on into friday\nIt's very very slowly it's about thirty miles inland now as it is that pounded hard the the panhandle of Florida and it's now moving northeast and as it moves north east is going to burst hit Macon Georgia hundred hundred and twenty mile an hour winds possible for their uh through a gun on\nA hundred mile a hundred two hundred and twenty southwest Georgia making eighty to a hundred and\n... he got a then then making its way through Augusta and then it'll go up the the north east coast or to the Carolinas I guess through the tips Columbia through uh the rest of the coastal South Carolina area and then into North Carolina\nRight and there'll be near Elizabeth City two AM in the morning on friday and then about

you what folks if we've been in the sense is two thousand and two all over again except slowly\nSlowly which was the big hurricane in the Gulf hit a little bit earlier in Louisiana and October but we had all the warm weather in September and October this is pointing the way believe it or not\nThis is the pattern recognition toward the winter season which I think it's going to be a big winter for much of the United states this year they there's certain types of patterns is set up so it's going to get much much cooler across the eastern part of the United states in the wake of this storm\nThat

if you want to be a part of the program there was a really disturbing piece on the law and crime website it's Dan Abrams website That's a sister website\nHype and it chronicled the FBI directors testifying today on Capitol Hill and he was asked by Senator Rand Paul whether President Trump was still being wiretapped by any government intelligence agency now you would think the answer is Oh absolutely not\nBut that's not the answer his answer was not exactly reassuring\nNow the FBI Director Chris Wray declined to actually answer that question as to whether or not the FBI the national Security Agency is currently collecting phone conversations with President Trump\nAnd during a Senate committee hearing on national security issues Senator Paul asked do you think it's possible that the president's conversations with international leaders remember when it was first in office they were leaking conversations with the president of Mexico the prime minister of Australia I mean that's never happened before\nAnyway was asking whether it was possible that the president's conversations with international leaders are\nYou know in the foreign intelligence surveillance a Surveillance Act database and raise response was well I'm not sure there's anything I could speak to in this city well then Senator Paul continued do you think it's possible that Congress members of Congress or in the ... the database\nYears and then re deflected again is that most senator I'm quite confident that we're conducting ourselves in a manner consistent with the law in the constitution a that's a subject to extensive oversight\nI don't know that I can speak to every hypothetical about whether there have been such situations\nAnd then Rand Paul asked director re whether journalists conversations were being possibly scooped up\nBy the intelligence community vast spying apparatus simply because they write stories about people with\nSay a terrorist name and the and re declined the answer again I Can't speak to specific hypothetical\nOr that point Rand Paul cut the FBI Director off and said the answer is yes\nAnd as this time with ray was drawing to a close he spoke about the potential abused within the ... system and Rand Paul is absolutely right he said you've had people bringing their politics to work the concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at\nData is as James Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's why we asked you to get a warrant the information you gathered in foreign database is not constitutional in the sense that had gathered\nWith no bar there is no war it there is no constitutional matter to that data and yet you're going to use it\nOn a domestic crime\nThat has been our complaint for years and years and years and I got to admit\nAfter nine eleven I thought it was a great idea\nNever having any any belief that it was possible as naive as I guess I was that we would have government officials at the top upper echelons within the intel community the FBI and the de OJ\nThat would literally be weaponized seeing the powerful tools of intelligence that we give them to protect we the people\nAnd I never in my lifetime thought that a\nPolitical candidate him put together a flimsy dot CA\nWith Russian sources and it becomes the basis for Pfizer Warren application but not one for\nThe original application in three subsequent applications and that the bulk of the information was bought and paid for by one political candidate to use against another candidate and that it was never verified a corroborated but still present it to a ... court and they purposely don't tell the ... the court judges\nThat the other candidate paid for this and that they never verified it by swearing you know we'll get into this you know with chairman Mark Meadows the Freedom Caucus and Jim Jordan later I mean think about that\nThis is what we do we have a constitution for a reason there's a reason why you need a warrant there's a reason why you have to present credible evidence to a court to get a warrant the bar is even higher when it comes to a Pfizer surveillance warrant\nRush got an email from the

Jim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein who you are not and bring him in and put them under oath\nYeah I mean and this is why that should happen and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoenaed than McCain them most of the kitten was or what the New York times cited that said there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who set by the time was talking about recording the president United States so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council Jim Baker saying\nA room with Rod Rosenstein who set by the time was talking about recording the president United States so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council Jim Baker saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting\nThat Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country and we have the Cape memos that reinforce that we've subpoenaed to vacate memos and we've asked Mr burglar assigned\nTo come in and answer our questions neither one of those things that happen\nSo that that you know Mr Rosenstein is leading that you played shots he he talked about trends he he talked about facts and and the here and do this and how our our our rule of law and justice system works well\nOne of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency show what the documents give us those in the case that most and more importantly\nComments or questions that's what bothers both of us well why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I can tell you that your committee has shown weak leadership and I'm I I hate to criticize anybody a but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house the majority leader of the house a gym rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in\nA than we would subpoena him and compel him to do that and I can tell you that uh it's it's more skew sues on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of\nSo we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and could\nLiterally force him to come and testify under oath an answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme a plan that you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe but now James Baker all saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states\nIn the hopes that it would provide materials that they could invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it and said sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm in that\nAnd they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... the guy who was in effect running Justice Department\nShould not be joking with support it's about recording the commander in chief of the United states\nThat ... that even if it's a joke that's not something you do that particularly at the time that this was happening remember on this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on may night the president fires gym called me on may seventeenth Rod Rosenstein they lower the special counsel\nIs one of the huge already happened in between there remember Lisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was little\nMenial leaks strategy so that they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of a reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was the page and struck we're talking about and it seems we got our answer now\nWhere you're writing I think not only are they looking that aired of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this\nYou know we're we've got actually a memos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there are a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet they knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media could not be substantiated\nI I Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead in\nI'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein red defies application many side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony is chilling the amount of documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well\nDidn't they will read them do we know they failed to read the more they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here um\nTo read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well didn't\nThey will read them do we know they failed to read the more they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here\nI'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed it out that the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warrants\nThat that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated they never verified they never corroborated any of the steel ... of this is Christopher steals\nYou know dot CA and as a result was used as the bulk of information or pain the warrants and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they they that's correct ... even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given the British or but here's the other problem\nIs is even Bruce or knew that some of the things that he was writing there were not accurate and and yet somehow they get put in\nA a three oh two and they get used as a justification to actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sick thing it truly is sick me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow under oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about ... you know taping the president of the United states for the purposes\nOf of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte to do he indicated that he would do that so\nNow with your time obviously to get that done and make sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there to answer these important\nQuestions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may ninth and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got to subpoena we've got to bring him into the gas the questions\nI Will
