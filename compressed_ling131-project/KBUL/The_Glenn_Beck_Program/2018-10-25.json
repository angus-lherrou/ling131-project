conservative and he's leading this movement which is hashtags walk away from the Democratic party or he joined us as well as post Paterson who remember he carried the nuclear football under the Clinton Administration\nWrote the book dereliction dereliction of duty a welcome both W brand and tell me your story what made you decide you worry I guess pretty laughter a Democrat and you started this campaign in this whole thing for you is gone absolutely viral what happened\n[laughter] so it's great to be our son thank you um so I you know my whole life I consider myself a liberal and my whole adult life I considered myself so I was at Democratic Party voter I always voted Democrat\n[noise] um and that was true even in two thousand and sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and I was one of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons\nThey've been in two thousand and sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and I was\nOne of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the\nMedia had been telling me for months and months at a Donald Trump didn't have more than a three percent chance of winning and they also had been telling me for months and months that he was a racist and if they get and homophobia and a a monster and basically the second coming of Hitler and that his followers were no better and\nYou know they I think that the liberal media did\nFor me as they did for millions of others are very effective job scaring people really making people believe these stories and this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media\nRanting you know screaming sometimes crying you know saying you know I'll never understand how people could vote for for this monster and on one particular day I had posted about um you know I I'll never be able to understand how people could vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd and mocked reporters disability\nAnd it was on that day in January of two thousand and Seventeen that somebody\nReached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen\nI'm just asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking that Trump mocked the disabled reporter\nAnd for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back\nTen years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter\nBut what's clear when you watch the compilation\nIs that this is a a voice in a bit that Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who was caught in a lie or doing something shady or\nGrumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid and our son but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really realized that the media was capable of creating a completely false narrative\nAnd then isolating a moment out of contact to push that merits if it had nothing to do with news or the truth brand\nThat let me ask you something now once your eyes open and once you become aware of their bias and it's like you you you ask yourself ... myself and it's even worse than has ever been how did you not see it before do you ever say that to yourself\n... yeah yeah it's absolutely the kind of thing that wants to see it you can't see it and what you just said is actually kind of the next\nPart of the story because then I went back to the beginning of the campaign and revisited all those other moments like Trump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women you know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same thing time and again that's not what happened that is not what happened\nBut they made a decision after he won that primary or it was clear that he was going to win the Republican primary that it wasn't funny anymore that he was running suddenly it was scary and that they had to turn this man into the the scariest candidate that the world had ever seen so\nLet me ask you this what when I tell my audience\nTo expect and I showed a lot of the ads that are out last night and I've been I've been showing these instances people that are in the public eye that are conservative more support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants and I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I give it your best shot\nYou know I noticed that it either happens to a guy with his wife or or an older person or women\nYou know what when there are a bunch of cowards the when they do that because I'd never treat anybody that way but you know this is a narrative every two and four years in elections in America that Republicans are racist sexes massage in is\nThat they're a homo phobic dino phobic Islamophobia that they weren't dirty air and water Obama use those actual words\nThat they want children to die and they'll have some commercial\nOver the cliff because they want to kill your grandmother that's what they do that to their play book we're watching it unfold today even Thirteen Days out of the election um do you see now that all of that is not true\nThere's not one thing that is true about that look at the sticks for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce um the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded for these demographics ever\nYeah no absolutely seeing that now and in fact I think a lot of others are starting to see it as well which is resulting in what you just said that even I think that most\nAh these minority groups in particular that I think the Democratic party for so long has taken for granted that this oh these are just automatic vote well that's not the case anymore I mean people really are starting to wake up and they're starting to walk away because they're seeing so\nCalled him and how many people have joined your movement\nSo the movement began on Facebook and then that are rich in that first initial Facebook group we now have over two hundred and five thousand poverty unrest or something like ... yeah all social media platforms we have about four hundred thousand it to be clear for anyone who doesn't know this is a testimonial campaign\nSo these are just people who are going on social media and clicking follower clicking like\nThey are telling their stories about why they are walking away so I mean they're they're making videos they're writing these stories down I mean people are there this was forming like a network of support and people are leaving are walking away from the left\nOf the uh let me bring in bus Patterson as we've been around the block of time or to a new around the

program then there's really have to be the week that the New York times has five novelists imagining Trump's next chapter\nAnd one of the novels actually goes into oh let's see murder and the other one goes into a fake Russia again\nYou know the Russian waited until they were a few steps passed any drew the gun he slighted on the center of the president's back and squeeze the trigger\nBut it missed fired the secret service agent at the president's shoulder heard the quick ... crowd she registered the scene instantly drawing his own weapon with razor edge reflexes\nThe Russian taster taser failure closes sized waited to pay the cost the opened his eyes the secret service agents did before him presenting his clock but first hear the agent said politely use mine\nReally that's what they want to in these times that's the New York times what they're putting out there\nOr Andrew Cuomo was forced to retract that claim that he was targeted by a pipe bomb that didn't happen but it doesn't surprise me that you've got multiple reports you know of course we had fake news they do some of these people do need lawsuits\nAnd there is there is a line that she is being cross here that deserves\nA real court challenge\nAs it relates to slander as it relates to smearing people's characters you know but yeah the NBC reporter suggesting the purple person responsible for the mail bomb scare a you know you know when Robert de probably reads the conservative news website the Drudge Report\nIt's outrageous that's on fake news MSNBC again a segment with this guy highlighting the image of the device sent to a John Brennan nobody wants this to happen\nI didn't like it when I've had threats really serious ones in in my life and career to my family or powder scent to where I work and said that it's one that it's a poisonous material you know and it just goes on from there you know well you know these guys on TALK radio there have\nAnd it shouldn't they should not have to be said no conservative I Know what ever support this horrible act or this type of violence depravity as the president condemn the yesterday\nUm nobody knows who's responsible yet everyone's rushing to judgment like they usually do when they can politicized something\nYou know is this has now been unfolding you you watch people assigning blame or to all political rivals especially President Trump then they go to Fox News and talk radio\nAnd it goes on from there meanwhile we've heard the play some of it in the last hour play some of it later in the program today the most incendiary over the top out of control statements that have now been going on for weeks and weeks\nThese mobs literally showing up getting in the faces take it in the marching orders of Spartacus and people like Maxine Waters that created a crowd and follow them into department stores gas stations grocery stores you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore wow\nHey is that is that how it is what they said to Mitch McConnell and his wife this weekend\nI'm you know you you look at the ... the rush to politicize this in the silence has been deafening\nThe last number of weeks as all of this has been ... you know unfolding before our eyes Sarah Sanders and our family Pam Bondi and secretary Nielsen Ted Cruz had Cruz and his wife and of course Mitch McConnell and his wife the guy got violent and the restaurant over the weekend\nAnd everything to lawmakers punched in Minnesota\nAnd you have a Boulder thrown through Kevin McCarthy store as a matter of fact Republican or Democrat does it's it's got to stop and we saw what happened in the Kavanaugh hearings what was Rand Paul saying well as I say I say we better just get the general public out of the halls of Congress because it's not safe anymore\nAs in those cases left wing activists you know getting in people's faces bidding at Lindsey Graham\nIn a rush to pin blame on the mail bomb some extreme is you know well it's not just fringe Web sites and communities on Facebook but you know Soros Obama the Clintons have been viewed as the root of all evil on TALK radio and Fox News for over a decade\nWell if this idiot bend Collins that NBC News that ever bothered listening to my show\nWell to bowl examples one I said it remember that guy walked into the White House through the front door one day and they only went up to the residence when Brock Obama's president I said this is insanity we've got to protect our president we've got to protect our politicians this isn't political that Senate attacking assault on the United states\nWell but the president says fake news while they are fake news most of them\nEvery second every minute every hour every day\nThere's Trump paid that is all over television\nYou know this is an ... an abject idiot and by the way they're not alone little insinuations by fake news CNN and fake news conspiracy TV MS and ABC NBC CBS so same thing\nWe've been calling for calm we've been condemning the mobs that have been confronting politicians that was a matter of their left or right\nWhere are the ones when a Bernie Sanders supporter tried to assassinate Republican lawmakers on the baseball field nearly killing somebody that is a friend of mine house majority whip Steve school lease I said I'm not blaming Bernie Sanders for this he had nothing to do with that\nAnd that's that's but that's the type of logic and I even said boy who's the other way around they say the same they've they blame us immediately because they want to put politics Trump's all in their world\nYou know political disagreements et cetera you know they shouldn't be marching orders to follow politicians and cabinet members and create crowds and confront them and tell them they don't want it any more in a anywhere anymore\nYou know but if you'd call out the deep state the call out the less hypocrisy you call out their calls for violence the fake news media reporting fake news if you do that that's not inciting violence such just telling the truth\nAnd the same goes for the people the media you know those\nThose you know Trump supporters of Democrats bashing they bash me every other day it was weeks that I'm old I'm plastered all over these channels as as wallpaper for crying out loud as they try to use me to get their ratings up\nOut listen I looked for all the rhetoric but rhetoric is rhetoric\nYou know what at the end of the day individuals are responsible for their own behavior\nAlthough it does sound like the orders have been sent out to get in people's faces and confront them and tell them they're not want it anywhere anymore that sense does have you know nobody talked about Susan Rice the target of\nA a package of what they reportedly believed to be rice and that was sent to her home or three weeks ago President Trump General Mattis FBI Director re CIA director Gina Haspel they all got suspicious packages that they were told was racing\nOr done juniors family or going back a few years when it happened to me\nI Know from first hand experience it's a horrible thing to go through sadly is threats to me and my family have happened many times over the years more than I Would ever tell you\nI've been saying for months the rhetoric needs to come down someone's gonna get hurt or worse\nYou know Kevin McCarthy we've got to Boulder thrown through his office what if somebody was in there\nYou know we've been condemning the the unacceptable behavior day after day night after night Democrats have been nowhere to be found they'd been silent and there are threats to walk to punch the president fight the president beat up the president blow up the White House et cetera you know separate heads up the president\nHappens and can make a so called comedy\nNews channels it happens in the mainstream media happens everywhere really the New York times perfect time that five novelist imagining Trump's next chapter you know one including murder good grief\n... that's that's maybe a little inappropriate for president I think\nYou know it said than to watch the calls for civilian it just brings hello to me and I'm not blaming these people they you know they can do what they want this what the Democrats do every two and four years\nWe have some interesting developments in the state of New Jersey\nWe might have a race Menendez says only up by three points people in New Jersey of figured out who Menendez is just like in Minnesota people have figured out who Keith Ellison is he's down seven\nIt looks like you know when now finding out that people have figured out who Bredesen is down in Tennessee and who McCaskill is in Missouri and who's Christine seminar cinema is in a you know for sure I don't have a problem of Americans during the Taliban I\nWhy would she get one vote in Arizona after being that crazy\nBut we have a race there in the ... race now with the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick ... up by two over Joe Manchin a lot of people weren't expecting that when you think about it is logical\nAll the success of the west Virginia ... saving coal jobs and energy jobs and all the prosperity is because of Trump's policies and mentioned didn't even support the tax cuts and frankly my guess is the capital vote was just an election year conversion it'll go right back to supporting chunky Schumer\nIn Missouri you've got the Daily Caller reporting that Josh Hawley who's running against Claire McCaskill sharing a photo of a yard sign that have been vandalized with a swastika and his name on the sign is this what it's really come down to we asked is now the Missouri attorney general\nClaire McCaskill also caught on tape saying oh I'm just like Obama I'm just I'm just saying these things to get elected um she doesn't care about raining in or or representing the people of Missouri\nYou know you've got another Daily Caller report\nTalks about non exploding bombs turned up yesterday and today the New York times has no reason at seemingly to apologize for the Trump assassination fantasy that they published the day before the pipe bomb was discovered the first one\nTimes published a story short story about assassinating president Donald Trump on Tuesday\nOne day before potential explosive devices showed up at the addresses of all these political figures New York times or ask the novelist to conjure up possible

York state police or they're going to go out there a risk their lives to file personal responsible for these devices now I I Want to practice that if the prices are real\nI I don't know I I'm I'm starting to have a a a real inkling that\nThese may not be real devices hum it and if that's true um were a lot better off nobody's going to get hurt but I find it really suspicious\nThat you've got eight or nine of these things so far in usually the triggering mechanism for these devices is the actual opening up the package while there's been several open and none of them have ... data which tells me\nThere some sort of problem so I Hope it they're not real um and I hope that the the authorities find them sooner or later I think\nThe way they will do you go search go because they have so much now forensic evidence here I'm assuming you know we we talked about this yesterday that it well none of this is easy but I'm I'm assuming by now they probably have their eyes on somebody\nAbsolutely absolutely by said yesterday you'll have you know probably twenty four to Seventy two hours a day in and I stand by that ... much of an enormous amount of evidence\nThat they've been able to capture because these things to knock that date and I think we'll see something so\nAll right Dr Gorka will you be a little less word today\nThe bottom line is we run these people to ground we a relief supplies of how we throw the book at them but it doesn't matter what side you're on\nThe the responsibility for the mobilization of violence\nAs started on the left when you have an a former attorney general who worked for President Obama say when they're down you kick them when you have Hillary Clinton say we're going to be civil off do we win the election nobody on the rise says that it's a less responsibility for the mobilization of pilots\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment\nThere couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people were hearing about that the better off we are\nAnd I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me she knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked it up before having you on today a I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nWhile he votes with him when it counts so you know I don't like to count on naming of post offices a procedural vote\nAnd I'm not ... well let's talk about the votes where he Donald Trump really could have you on his boat healthcare being one\nWell that's right so Joe mansion said no to getting rid of Obamacare and having a really high quality affordable health care options in the mountains state\nSean in West Virginia premiums have risen over a hundred and sixty percent in four years and mansion said no to fixing getting rid of Obamacare\nAnd I think that West Virginians didn't like that they also didn't like the fact that Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts that are really giving a big left to our state providing economic opportunity better jobs\nJoe mansion have to side with Chuck Schumer the leadership on every issue when it matters mansion says no and even on ...\nWhere people say oh he ended up voting for capping off\nThe reality is he waited he actually left the Senate a voting chamber and waited for Susan Collins cast a vote and then and only then to Joe Manchin step out because he knew if he didn't do that he was politically death\nIs so so ah you know I kind of used a lot of those votes as you know election conversion your votes and that's the point is you can vote for the tax cuts um and you know maybe not as extreme as as everyone else in his party but the reality is is that he's going to vote for Chuck Schumer to be the majority leader\nAnd I don't think Chuck Schumer can get ... votes in West Virginia which makes mansion out of touch with the people of West Virginia and wish I would say I ... I should like tax cuts regulation energy those are three main fundamental issues that that affect an impact\nThe economy in West Virginia also I Know West Virginia like a lot of places have struggled with a ... opioid issues and we'd have a with the president did yesterday and what he's been doing since he became president\nThat's one of the big issues in this race that Joe Manchin first vote will be for Chuck Schumer and Chuck Schumer is made no bones\nSince he became president well that's one of the big issues in this race that Joe Manchin first vote will be for Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer has made no bones about the fact that she's going to head out the obstruction\nResistance impeachment caucus and if you're part of that Schumer leadership team and Joe Manchin is and you're powering these liberals the folks that really created all the rock destroying the Kavanaugh hearings then you're part of the problem so that's why people were so focused on\nJoe mansions first vote because the you know he's not going to be with West Virginia\nAnd he's going to be part of a team\nThat's tearing down the president West Virginia's don't want that and that's why we're gaining so much momentum in our campaign\nHow much money is the Democratic party putting into West Virginia sick to try and keep in other words how much you're Schumer in company and below sea in company or are they investing in these negative ads about you\nWell they've put a fortune and I'd say by a ... by all accounts they're going to probably be up over\nTwenty four twenty five million dollars and this is West Virginia this is not New York California or Florida they'll probably end up spending about ... million more we're going to look at the final couch\nAnd that's what happens on you mentioned earlier you know if you get pounded for months on end of that and you can't respond it makes it difficult but now the president came back twice he's actually our side we think is going to come back again and we start to combat twelve to ten eight six to or\nTo to you know to even\nAnd that's because President Trump has made this a top priority\nWhen lives are early voting began in West Virginia as it started yeah early\nYeah early voting started yesterday\nAnd so we're starting to look at the numbers one thing we see is that the Republicans have a lot of energy and people know that the future of the Senate could really be at stake what this election and that there is a clear choice so uh we're feeling good about it we're not hockey\nBut we're going to out work Joe mansion and people are gonna know on the conservative fighter will help the President Joe mansion he's a dishonest Watsonville liberal and he's never there when you need them\nAll right we're watching the race now put this in the ... column a where we once thought it was a leading Democrat now the state of West Virginia and play attorney general Patrick Morrisey would support the president's agenda versus Joe Manchin sadly would vote for Chuck Schumer said\nAnyway it's a deadline and race at this point and uh with early voting a there is a very good shot that that could change hands that would help a future endeavors in the U.S Senate and we wish all the best Patrick Morrisey\nHey Shaun thanks so much than anyone interested in learning about all those you know where Patrick Morsi dot com or take a look we've got a heck of a good record of going after the Obama agenda and supporting President Trump\nRight thank you for being with us listen I Am a big supporter of the second amendment your right to keep and bear arms defend your home defend your family and that's where the U.
