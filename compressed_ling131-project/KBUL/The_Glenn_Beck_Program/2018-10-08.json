dot com um we're talking about Google\nAnd Larry I've never I've never\nIn you know those dystopian movies I've always made fun of them and said yeah this is this is crazy either you know the corporations out to get you because it's\nKeep that top secret because\nYeah they were they argue is that is for reasons of of a state secret\nUm and and you know that they need to protect their trade secrets they need to be a a you know making sure that nobody gets access to it\nThere's some truth to that but there are a lot of things that they could do to demonstrate um that they're offering a fair product in service to people and here's the thing that they have lied about this before you know ten years ago or so you had other companies like trip advisor and Yelp\nWho are saying that Google was artificially suppressing their rankings in Google in favor of Google owned companies which okay you know Google has the right to do that but here's the thing\nGoogle flat out lied and said absolutely not we don't do that our algorithm is pure it's true the best results or ... or our organically at the top well here's the problem the Federal Trade commission the European Union\nProfessors at Harvard University looked at this and said yes you are fiddling with the algorithm you are screwing these other competitors and you're lying\nSo the point is when Google says you can trust the algorithm you can trust us they've lied before and they're lying now and I think the only question that remains really is how are we going to deal with is\nUm you know there's old story that Henry Kissinger said when he was on the national Security Council\nYou give a president three choices do nothing\nTake my solution or thermonuclear war those are your three choices in this case it's kind of like that we can do nothing\nWe can try to deal with some sort of the regulatory issues related with Google or we can break up these companies those are the three options that we have and I think we're really at the point of point number three\n'cause this is not a monopoly like standard oil standard oil that's going to dominate the hallmark of this is controlling the news flow in the United states\nIs in the end this is in the and Peter controlling everything yes Google is ... the most likely company in the America in the American world or to come up with a guy yes who ever\nWho ever gets to a I first controls everything there's no way to beat it once you have a guy yes this company is the most likely in the free world to come up with it\nIf we don't have them eat contained in some way or another when they get to a I worked hosts yes\nYes that's exactly right and here's the thing it's not just\nGoogle the company a lot of people don't realize this I didn't realize this if you use safari on your apple product you're actually using the Google algorithm and that is Google information um if you're using if you are using um Yahoo\nYou're using Google the point being Firefox is Google the all these entities are using the Google algorithm so even if you say I Am not going to use Google dot com and you're using unless you are making very specific choices for other options if you using any of those others\nGoogle is the one that's dominated by the way Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year Google actually pays apple\nTo be the algorithm of choice for safari that's how much they value this information and want to dominate the space\nSo I Want to talk to 'em a little bit about um what can be done um with the algorithm or I'm concerned about some things that I think are really dangerous and gee platform ing and be racing voices because Google thinks\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of us look\nThere's that this is just at the beginning let me tell ya boogie story [laughter] you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of aging how many people it used to look it up for me well you're still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle\nThere is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy [laughter] pick somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide okay [laughter] they had a picture of the guy\nAnd the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then\nAfter like an hour or two they gave the leaves system\nThe picture of the guy and said find him\nIn eight minutes he was in the back of a squad car unbelievable in ... minutes yes the city of twenty two million yeah twenty two million is amazing in eight minutes yeah so and this this with out AI right this is the kind of stuff that is coming that people really need to pay attention to\nRight and and Google or is that the forefront of that they they take a position of pride that they are the forefront of exploiting future technologies real quick though on Gmail this is very important for people to realize that just shows you how far Google goes\nI used to have a Gmail account now what ... does is they scan every email that comes into your email account\nOut you know what else they scan if you ever written a draft email let's say you're mad at your cousin and you know I'm sick of you know cousin Chris and all the crazy stuff he does and you write in late one night you write a draft and you say you know what I don't think I'm going to send that to Chris that's just me\nBeing on just a second I Want to make sure this is writing a draft but that's not saving it as a drag apps correct It's just you ... it counts the delete delete delete delete delete delete it might not even saving it as a draft\nRight correct that's correct scanned by Google\nSo Google knows more about you than you know you can have a very open and completely transparent relationship with anybody in your life your spouse\nYour best friend or whatever the Google knows more about you than they do and they are very aggressively going to retain that information but they're using it against you here's the key thing it's not just privacy is manipulation\nBecause they want to take that information and not just sell information advertisers they as part of their mission wants to steer and move your life in a certain direction that they deem is the way the direction your life should go\nTo Peter Schweitzer the documentary as the creepy line a couple of pushback on a couple of things sure or at least problems I have 'cause I'm with you on Ninety percent of this\nOne issue I have is Google is awesome it's all of the products that they make are better than everybody else does products that have similar ... it would eat him an incredibly inconvenience me\nTo give up Google because all of their products work better than everybody else's James doesn't know [laughter] more easier because I mean yes they're everywhere they're doing really good job yeah when it comes to designing an easy to use product right ...\nThat's that's a great question and it's not easy I mean there are alternatives search a systems out there um but none of them are as good as Google and it's not really that Alan ...\nAnd I think that's a a a road that people will go down\nThat you shouldn't go down that what we should go down is we should be talking to the people in ... no no no\nWe should be sending people who understand this fight to Washington because by the time we talked to Washington it's already over we need people who understand the ethics of what's going on with high tech in Washington\nBecause they need to have this conversation right now it's not about us changing our behavior fry it to the point we must corral Google and break them up or corral them in some way\nNot with just little litigation because I'm a ... litigation but not with just little simple laws are we going to cut\nBecause they'll go around that that fire right\nOkay moving even one other one yeah you said this earlier and it made me very uncomfortable and my suspicion is it makes you very uncomfortable to which is your solution was the we're leaning towards breaking up these companies and as a capitalist as a person who does not want the government involved like burn private business\nI mean how do you how do you how to bridge\nThat guy no I mean I I think that's a great point and I came reluctantly tennis as I looked at all the possible things to do with Google here's the problem in this space the way that technology is moving how Google exerts it's market dominance it really we really do not have a free market in search\nUh it's really impossible in fact one of the guys we we interviewed a vice president Yelp\nOr in in our in our a film a and the founder of Yelp said he wouldn't start you all today because it'd be impossible Google would smother them the only reason that Yelping these other entities have survived as they have built up enough brand equity when they were founded what Fifteen Twenty years ago to where they can exist so we have a situation where\nThey're truly is not a functioning a monopoly and by the way\nFifteen Twenty years ago to where they can exist so we have a situation where they're truly is not a functioning a monopoly and by the way Google's market dominance it's partly related to its political alliance in Washington they pass laws and rules all the time to squelch competition a\nVeteran in Santa Fe and to do things like the platform me yes we are not a publisher we're a platform right then they go in and they add it will now you're a publisher you're not a platform so they play it both ways and they're they have the money to do it yes and that's a hugely\nImportant point because when they first wanted or it set up the regulation for the Internet it was if your publisher you're treated as a media company if you're a neutral platform which is what Google and Facebook claim they are they said we're not going to any content they even use the analogy were like a telegraph\nWe're just taking a telegraph message from Peter and we're sending it to Glenn\nNothing else is happening well we all know that's not true now they're editing a they're censoring so they're acting as publishers but unlike other publishers they don't face the legal or regulatory burdens that they do so it's either a competition\nOr even the public scrutiny even the public you sound like you're crazy if you talk against Google editing I Know that they are frightened the wooden one solution be to make their algorithms trends parents\nAh yes that would help but the algorithm is changing constantly and and I do get I Am sympathetic to the argument that this is a trade secret that they work very very hard to develop and they have um I think by breaking them up\nInto pieces and by the way I don't think it's just two companies I think it's several different spin alphabet [laughter] um I think it would be would be extremely helpful in the way to go on this um because otherwise they're going to continue to rigs or market dominance\nThe other thing I hear conservatives talk about and I find this terrifying is to make them a utility\nOh no no I'm just terrified I don't know what the utilities are like here in Dallas oh no [laughter] Texas we don't really have a we have to open the energy yeah oh that's so we have five different editor company as in yeah we don't pay any fear ... notion\nOf making Google a public utility ... which really means you're making it a government utilities now means you've got the government controlling search no I live in a no interest in that whatsoever\nAnd what you are seeing is this merging of Google which used to be generally out of politics very little lobbying very little interaction\nWhen Barack Obama was elected in two thousand eight\nYou saw this enormous influx of Google people into Washington DC and they've stayed so it is now one of the most plugged in if not the most plugged in corporation in America so\nThis notion that there are kind of these wild cat or out of Silicon Valley that are like independent from government is just totally ridiculous I could\nSpend two days with you um I really enjoyed this I'm going to take a hard\nPass on that you're aware [laughter] you know by all our [laughter]\nPeters wiser he is the president of government

in the Pacific northwest I'm like it's kind of sounds like you kind of had the you know a typical Seattle it'd be kind of family uh and uh went around the world is in a in a documentary I think the documentary is called a so called Arthur the pursuit\n'em and um and he's got a fascinating life and it was just really searching for answers\nCame to find that capitalism is is what solves all these problems that we have and has made a huge huge increases in happiness around the world and health so\nMy problem here is ... and the only loose and I can't tie up is people like Rockefeller that have you know they do something because you know they're ... they they discovered oil and they were smart enough to put it all together\nAnd they accumulate this power and then with all of that money comes corruption and they start to\nPower and then with all of that money comes corruption and they start to control everybody else's lives and start making all the decisions because they have all of this money how do you how do you reconcile that because I don't want to take the money away from people\nRight now I got a glass and you know it is distressing when you see something like a family where there was a patriarch it was a good entrepreneur but then kind of built in ... around the castle\nAnd that kept a bunch of wealth in the family for six generations and made it harder for other people to rise through crony capitalism\nThat's a big problem that's actually not capitalism that's a different system that's a\nThose basically that's a system of wired deals you could find in any socialist system any monarchy any place all around the world and that's something that we have to fight whether it's capitalism or or whatever ... whatever is on whatever economic system that we've got\nWe have to democratize opportunity of the problem is not that we've got very rich people the problem is people have a hard time rising and we have to be\nPutting our resources and our energy in our law in our initiative toward people that are at the bottom not so they can all get to the top but so then they can get to the middle the essence of the American experience them the moral basis of the American experience is that the the you know three generations ago the Brooks is in the backs\nWere who were just like scratching out potatoes some ways they're they're nothing more than ambitious riffraff who came to this country and wanted to get to the middle and support themselves and their families and we have to be warriors for system to make sure that people can go from the bottom to the middle\nYou know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're gonna find that there's a system of preferences for legacies you know if you went to university is four or five times more likely that your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying you got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience and so that's actually what we need to be thinking about story about Google\nWere a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery at the bottom of our society can't rise today that's that's really an American thing\nAnd I can't say right [noise] they can't rise because we have a discriminatory system of unequal education were poor kids are locked into public education systems are parents who don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people that if they don't go to college there somehow losers we don't have a vocational and technical education systems which are the ultimate education reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country and most importantly glad we don't culturally value\nThe skills that come from actually not going to college where people actually homework skills were they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did the printed system go away\n[noise] but went away for a bunch of different reasons but part part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen ... until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America\nWhere white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades and and you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are we threw the baby out with the bathwater\nWhite kids black kids every kind of kids should have the opportunity to succeed through hard work and skills and personal initiative without going to college\nAnd get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it\nAnd then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship because it was lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history it's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody's ever thought of in the history of humanity and say [noise]\nAnd now the problem is not that this is an equal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments because most I think even most conservatives um sold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden and you describe what that is\nSo I just have this movie the pursuit that that that you mentioned in the last segment of coming out in the spring\nAnd part of it is actually filmed in Denmark Denmark has considered to be the happiest country in the world it's a\nIt's a social democracy and has the highest tax rates in the world about Seventy five percent of your income goes to the government [noise] and so I went there I went to Denmark and hung out with some families there and the truth is if you're into that you know more power to ya\nBut I don't see very many people were actually trying to move to Denmark I Do see lots of people in Denmark that are trying to move to America why because it's the antithesis culturally of what it means to be an American that all you know Danish society Scandinavian society is built on the idea of don't stand out\nDon't be different don't think that you're something special don't try to do so if you're in this country America is built by oddball\nBe different don't think the IRS something special don't try to if you so if you're in this country America is built by oddball like you know like Glenn Beck and Arthur Brooks we're due to actually tried to do different things and in Denmark if you [noise]\nYou know if you want to get rich or you want to start a company or you're really super religious like you and me or or you want to have eight kids forget about it they're going to look at you like you're a freak\nAnd that's a big problem so if you want to socialism is not just a social deal socialism is actually a cultural deal\nAnd so and and and basically where everybody has the same amount of money everybody has to be awake as well so if you like being a weirdo if you like being an odd ball if you like being yourself you better stay in America and you better make the American system better don't try to get the data system\nAnd that is one reason why it has been successful one reason why it is now falling apart and one reason why would not work here is there was no diversity there was no diversity now that they have open up the borders there's a diversity and people don't want to live their life that way and it's falling apart my wrong people\nAre different people are different it's like it's a country of it's a boutique society a five point three million people that the Danes they basically they're like ... [laughter] you know they they kind of live in the shower\nAnd then when there's a whole bunch of of immigration look for in America you know despite the fact that we have these controversies about the wall and about the immigration system\nAnd that a lot of people listening to us today disagree on this fundamentally we all come from immigrants and we all like immigrants we'd like hard working people who come from different places and integrate into our society most of most Europeans that they can't handle it\nThey don't know how to do it they don't think of themselves as fundamentally from some other place like a thousand years ago the Danish ancestors of current dangers were\nVikings living in Denmark a thousand years ago I have the slightest idea where my family was but I mean God Knows they weren't in Seattle\nUm Arthur ... one last thought people's came into it and they saw what they want it to see one way or another I don't think it changed anybody's mind um it was all about politics and the politics of destruction I think um\nBut we ... you know when when Lindsey Graham spoke yesterday kind of feel good do a lot of people in this audience and I thought it was righteous indignation myself I think there are a lot of people that feel this way knock it off this is shameful what is happening\nUm but there is a difference between righteous indignation and and playing the game the way others are playing it um they're they're playing for destruction\nIf we reach out and play for destruction as well I think we lose and we we have in our own destruction people think that that is surrender you what you want me to surrender you want me not to say anything that's not what I'm saying I'm saying fight\nThe right way people kind of given up on being able to win a without playing dirty and you make a case that they shouldn't do that\nYeah I Know there were Glenn Beck speaks truth right now everybody's got a lesson this is the truth\nYou know there is not a long term or that comes from being a bad person\nBut here's the key thing here that most people listening to us so they're conservatives like you and me and they're watching the the the and they have a they have their own filter bubble look we all hear things through our own experience and through our own biases I got it I got it\nBut standing up when in in righteous ignition look if you're a senator and you're in a hearing fine but for the rest of us standing up to\nThe left standing up to the other side when they're wrong around the Thanksgiving table or on social media is a very limited impact why because we're not going to actually be\nWrong around the Thanksgiving table or on social media and it's a very limited impact why because\nWe're not going to actually be taken seriously unless we hold our own side to the same moral standard to have a we really want to be effective on the right what we need to do is we need to look at contempt and hatred and mockery and sarcasm and derision on the right\nAnd call it out and said these are not these arguments are not living up to my own moral standard\nAnd we hold ourselves to a higher moral standard we will not lose I've got the data on this planet\nIs and in the long run the moral high road which doesn't have to be weak doesn't have to give in to anybody else's argument but the say\nThrough love and respect I Believe that you are not living up to your own objective tendency to our own side we will not stand for hatred that's not who we are that's the secret to long term success I\nI Believe that we're entering a time and yesterday in only hates ended where people see this and they don't want to be a part of either side they don't want to be a part they're good Democrats who do not stand with an to enter bothered by that\nUm but I don't think they have anywhere to go\nBecause uh we had been painted as haters but also um we are we shot down people not the way they do necessarily on the left but it feels good to do that do you see any movement on the left\nThat common sense Democrats are starting to say wait a minute I I'm not in lockstep with this\nI Do this is this is not what gets all the public space screaming ladder is what gets them to say on the writing on the left to look at the data I Seventy percent of Americans hate it they feel that they're being out on that and again this is half right wing and a half left wing Seventy percent of Americans believe that were being held hostage or being terrorized\nBy powerful people who are profiting from us hating each other\nAnd saying terrible things to each other they don't like it they they they they want to fight back we have uh the the the opportunity to create a new moral movement where we can bring are brothers and sisters on the center left and even on the left together to try to solve some problems in this country and where we can say\nI don't hate you these kinds of these what's going on in the Senate right now what's going on with these hearings right now as a proxy battle it's like an angle and the civil war where the Soviet Union in the United states are sending troops against each other than the Nineteen eighties\nTo fight it out on somebody else's battleground Americans have to say enough\nWith these ideological this ideological warfare between right and left and we're we're being the ones in the middle where we're effectively being held hostage we want better than this in this country we we don't have to back down from conservatives at all we just have to recognize that we don't have to agree\nIt's okay in this country to have actual disagreement that's the basis of our excellence you know your message has always been so good and fled because you don't hate anybody and we have to as leaders we have an opportunity to help Americans to love their enemies and in so doing to find the basis of our strength\nArthur Brooks thank you so much for being on the program or you have to have you on more often you are a well

and All right so Rod Rosenstein why would even be in the mix considering we now know and have corroborate nation Greg Jared that he was saying you know ... what do you want me to wear a wire around the president\nWell he has a lot to answer for and the president I'm sure I spoke to him about it on air force one today did did you really try to get people to secretly record may ... ... did you recruit people\nTo invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment to tip pose me from office now we know Rosenstein is going to not to deny it whenever he's caught a engaging in illicit if not illegal activity she climbs his words were\nMisinterpreted over and over again we've seen examples of that a threat to the intelligence committee staff threats to death and noon is\nOh I'm just misunderstood Rosenstein must be the most misunderstood man in Washington D. C. but it would be imprudent politically for the president\nTo fire him he has no intention of doing so Rosenstein\nYou know must receive Mueller's report and I think the president wants to see how that will play out and I think it's beginning to wind down many of the people on Miller's staff of already left and returned\nTheir jobs at the department of justice so I I think that is reaching a conclusion I agree with John no collusion no obstruction uh and then let's launch a serious\nInvestigation with a grand jury and the people at the department of justice and the FBI who engaged in this what I Believe to be an illicit illegal scheme to frame Donald Trump\nTo care for it actually much more actually much chipper crap will pay right now\nThey say please don't say impeachment anymore\nWhat they say in the CIA [noise]\nIf it turns out that he does become justice Kavanaugh and your chairman of the ... committee would you investigated for possible impeachment case he is on the Supreme Court and the Senate has investigated than ice in the house will have to\nInvestigate we would have to investigate\nAll right joining us now is the man himself he's got his brand new book out say I love the title and I liked the content even more why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies Dr Sebastian Gorka is with us or how are you my friend this book is a must read for everybody and ah how are you going to say I'm\nVery excited show and thanks for having me or I didn't think uh this title would be as appropriate as it is often low Seventy two hours but man we are in a fight right now for the future of the republic\nIt is a fight for the future of the republic the one thing I Love about you and I've come to know you very well is that your patriots and you understand evil in our time evil abroad the need to defend and keep America strong\nAnd you understand the political aspects of it as well because if you elect their own people and what are you going to have policies of appeasement again in that renders us more vulnerable\nJust look at the last eight years what do we have we had a commander in chief who started his presidency with an apology tour\nAnd then he blamed all the bad things in the world on America what resulted the rise of ISIS Russia invading its ... Chinese Chinese re militarized station at the end of the Obama administration just one metric take take politics out of it for a second\nWe had sixty five million refugees in the world that's more than we had at the end of World War two when you don't have American leadership the world is the most dangerous place now that's over thanks to Donald Trump now we have a commander in chief who believes\nThat even exist read his wall so speech listen to what he says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing so that what he\nSaid at the un line yes absolutely absolutely so that's why I wrote why we fight but but you're absolutely correct we have domestic issues here he will exist not just outside of our borders look what they did to the godly man Brett Kavanaugh in the last fourteen days a man who\nHad the probably the cleanest most spotless record in an American public life goes from being\nA stand up standing federal judge to amass rapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next thirty days are so important showing\nIt means ah everything and then look everything's riding on this\nI don't know if you would have asked me three weeks ago I Would have leaned in on the side that history would would win out because the party that wins the White House\nUsually ends up losing seats in a midterm election they totally not happened three times only only picked up seats three times in the last hundred years the last was after two thousand and one of the attack and die on number eleven September eleventh um but there's so much at stake here\nAnd that is what ... literally jumps off the pages I'm reading through your\nDefeat Americans enemies and we'd better do without apologies the tactic orca we don't get to do that if we're not in power right\nWhere we have to take very seriously this concept of the left so the left has been taken over by the radicals thinking about the fact that JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist strong on national security he wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have we have the crazies we have the cost\nOf your core tests as we have the Maxine Waters and control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply\nThe ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool\nWell guess who use that philosophy in the past that philosophy drives to the labor camps drives to the ... and it drives to death camps whether you're a rightwing extremist whether you're a fascist or whether you're a communist that's the philosophy and we've got to stop that Sean we have to stay true to the principles of the republic\nYou talk it in a book about the a will to winter and and again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can't have any more and you talk about the will to when you talk about will\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized yes and we pulled out yeah in Iraq and Afghanistan\nWe pull out leaving it dates of our withdrawal and we lost nearly six thousand kids in the end so many others come back without their arms and legs in their in their faces his figured fighting for their country we cannot come at American troops ever again\nUnless we're willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you have to win these wars or else don't start to be involved in them\nSo some of my book is about two things it's about all the threats we face as a country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China but the second part is much more important this is the one who hitting on\nIt do we have the will to defeat our enemies because Vietnam is a great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with wooden sticks and rusty rifles defeat us\nHow's that possible because we lost the war at home because we allow the left to undermine our will to win\nAnd and what are the most important things is the individual real to win in addition to the ... of the threats I have full vignettes of American heroes I go back to the Bobby was two hundred years ago I talk about a Korean hero a trustee pulled her I talk about a man who spent six and a half years as a naval aviator in the Hanoi Hilton\nBut the last story is very very important for what we are seeing right now and it's wicked chambers most kids have no idea who would occur chambers is\nThis is a man who was Kevin old before Kavanaugh was born in Nineteen forty eight the first live televised Senate hearing was a man cool would it could chambers who have been a communist agent of the Soviets\nWho went on record saying hey I no longer communist but I Need America to know where the communist uh in the government including algae his he was a guy who was working for the Soviets what happened to this man who stood up for the truth\nAccused him of everything cheating on his wife ... of the death of being responsible for the death of his brother none of it was true but what did he do he had the will to fight he stood up for the truth justice justice Kavanaugh ... that social and his his his his a scary thing\nThe Democrats have done this before there'll be surprised at what they did to Capitol they've done it seven eight years ago\nI they have done it every election in my lifetime they play the race card the Gen rye are they don't they\nVersus poor black versus white this is the identity politics which which they have mastered and I keep playing them in their own words it's not like I'm making it up\nQuick break we'll come back more with Dr Sebastian Gorka why we fight his new book
