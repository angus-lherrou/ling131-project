Glad to be here every day thank you for giving me this microphone\n[laughter] I'm basically all I wanted to say is is the obvious\nThis of this whole case is that um Ford is perfectly willing to do to judge Kavanaugh\nWhat she has accused him of doing it to her assaulting her or him on a daily basis with this fall state in the first and and just so much fake uh evidence everywhere\nListen she she identified and there's a there's a part of me that really sympathizes with this is such a serious issue in and I don't think we give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled us including the president they handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves\nShe gave the names of four people and none of the four can corroborate her story including the guy that was supposed to be an eye witness to it at that point\nAnd then they're out buying it eighty bucks a pill and\nThen they find themselves really addicted and somebody offers a ten dollar bag of heroin and now they're a heroin addict and the recidivism rate is like eighty five percent of your addicted to this garbage and they can't get off it and then the next thing you know they're going to buy a bag of heroin that God only knows who's putting it together\nAnd they drop what is the equivalent of three grains of salt that's how tiny it would be a ... inside of the heroin and these kids die and these are adults or even die\nWell I think I think there's another point to the da chief was interview today and he made it very clear that the biggest threat to national security is a Mexican drug cartels so what's happening is it's not just that\nPeople are the article in the hill I saw that\nToo Yeah John Solomon wrote it and and and John Feinstein wrote this article at the DEA chief ... and ... you know did this and and took some time of the statistics from the film that we did and just said you know this is very serious and we're we're looking at it very closely but there's this huge misconception that the borders just about immigration\nWhen in fact the kids are dying on the other side of the border national security helps us both not an immigration issue it's a life or death issue not right or left life for\nI don't think anybody I don't know anyone else and media here that line Kai did life or death yeah no no not right or left life or death I I heard the line life or death when you get any credit for that\nThat was very good very very catchy but the but it's true and desert bowling often reminds us this can happen to you because it's\nI Know that was very good very very catchy but the but it's true and desert bowling often reminds us this can happen to you because it's happening to a lot of people and I don't think there's anybody listening to this program that hasn't been

by the way and they're saving a lot of lives with nor can which were versus the effects are ... but not that no not a problem ...\nKids don't know it so it's like even if they're taking coke or

even notice him half the time\n[laughter] yeah that was those are fun days and then of course eating those big steak foreign cutters down there on university\nOh you bet and the ... [laughter] so what else I don't mind if\nI had a question have you heard Democrats say that if the FBI investigations cruise these allegations faults that they will vote for Brett Kavanaugh\nNo maybe Joe mansion in the end would do it I we know that Claire McCaskill's out we know Joe Donnelly is out I don't think Heidi Heitkamp is going to be in the only shot at any Democrat I think at this point is mansion and but you gotta remember he comes from West Virginia\nThat's pro Trump forty two percent and he probably wants to keep a job in thirty six days so\nI'm not even sure although I think it did vote for Neil Gorsuch if my memory serves me well but look at that they want endless investigations here they are out now on a fishing expedition they want to say that this is about blood thinning and destroying at all costs this isn't going to be limited in scope to them this isn't going to be in a in a week\nNo artificial timelines as soon as as soon as Jeff snowflakes that okay\nThen no bar got moved a thousand times because that's the way the Democrats play\nAnd Republicans fell right into the trap and I guess if they ask for more extensions will get more than what we need to get no no no we need another investigation into this well this five new people fifty new people that have just come out today we've got to get to that or Gina is next thank you so much Lynn we appreciate a gene is in North Carolina Gina Hi how are you and welcome to the sewer\nThe swamp known as a Washington DC\nThanks for taking my call sound good to talk with you it's good to talk with you what's going on I'm very angry that Senator Feinstein no you have a right to be totally net handles the I I Do not see how she could perform her duties and responsibilities to the judiciary\nAnd they had a little late now handle that I Do not see how she could perform her duties and responsibilities to the traditional ... anti American people are fighting with one of your constituents\nI don't get it either I honest she she sat on this for six weeks she sets privately would judge Kavanaugh\nTells him nothing about this nothing while simultaneously working with professor Ford to hire an attorney ... became Deborah cats who was a woman that really said some awful things as it relates to Paula Jones and then she supported our Frankenstein\nThe creepy senator from Minnesota at the time so it's not the cause for professor Ford's attorney it's a radical left wing or and now we have friends that Deborah cats now out there\nAsking people and the Georgetown Prep community to come forward if they have information well that sounds like a fishing expedition to me it ... I don't think there's a person in the country that is not aware of what's happening right now as it relates to Brett Kavanaugh and I mean even if they didn't watch the hearings they're very aware of what took place last week\nAnd if they wanted to come forward I don't know if they need letters from people to do so that's my opinion\nAh it's ah yeah I think we need a full fledged investigation absolutely positively no doubt about it and then we don't then we're gonna you know look we get the country we deserve in the end if you like the progress that America has been making under President Trump then you'd better go out and vote and thirty six days\nIf you don't like the radicalism\nThat you see on display now the last Fifteen days Fifteen days ago Brett Kavanaugh had a stellar reputation if you don't think they're going to have endless investigations into Trump that they don't want to impeach him\nThere this is who they are what they do they can run on their record when Obama was president for eight years 'cause it's a disaster\nIf you want the progress to continue for the country for the forgotten men and women I mean we barely have time to mention that the president got\nYou know incredible new deals with both Canada and Mexico getting rid of a bad deal NAFTA now he had to break a few dishes an ad that threaten the trade war but ultimately he got it done because\nIt was these weren't one sided trade deals and so if you don't say you're willing to pull out of a deal you're never going to get a deal done and the president is effective at at negotiating\nOn all fronts I don't care if it's\nNATO and ... those countries that don't pay their fair share European allies countries of ours that have been taken advantage of us on trade issues\nIf you don't say you're willing to do it nobody will believe you and nobody will move but now he's putting America First\nIn thirty six days you'll decide their agenda is endless investigations impeachment open borders eliminating ice keeping Obamacare and they want their crumbs back if you want that than stay home I mean go to go vote on vote for the Democrats on\nElection day in thirty six days if you want progress to continue for the country\nAnd you don't want to give them this power which way which they will abuse then you can stop it if you voted for Trump two years ago everything you voted for is now in jeopardy and thirty six days they want for them this is\nThey want to reduce the twenty sixteen results they think it was a mistake they don't believe in happen somehow we were

country you know ... search ... character assassination\nYou know character blood thinning machine\nYou got to watch judge Kavanaugh last week you know the witnesses the professor Ford mentioned do corroborate her story you know that the New York times said that Mrs Ramirez was calling others not sure if it was Brett Kavanaugh and was asking them if they remembered\nProduce and eggs and poultry

it\nMcConnell saying earlier today that he wants to vote this week in the Senate and for that to happen Jamie do pre reminds us the majority leader must file culture by Wednesday that's tomorrow will be here tomorrow in the nation's capital in order to force a final vote by Saturday otherwise\nYou vote wouldn't officially be this week I'm so for example if the cloture vote is if you file cloture on Wednesday the final votes on Saturday\nIf you file it on Thursday it's on Sunday violet on friday the vote would be next Monday if you file cloture on Saturday It's Tuesday depending on when the

investigating him I guess for most of his adult life and also I ... a big shock there\nBut this is what's at stake you want you want to go back because this is the enlisted investigation and do you

in\nAnd they have to announce that the U.S house of representatives remains in control of the Republicans and that the Republicans have picked up two three four five seats in the United States Senate\nWhich would render by the way Collins Murkowski and snowflake irrelevant\nAnd that even if they stopped Brett Kavanaugh he could be re nominated and next time he would get a vote\nUp or down and he would become a Supreme Court justice in spite of the slander and the smears and everything else\nAnd all of those anchors that had been for two years trying to destroy the president as an extension of all things Democrat you could see them spiral into their state of shock and denial and depression again that's not going to stop the news is gonna rats\nBy roll into their state of shock and denial and depression again that's not going to stop them that there's going to ratchet up the next day Donald Trump should be arrested for tax fraud\nDonald Trump Stormy Daniels ah Russia was go

investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed that these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged\nUm was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nAll the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mr Amir as was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't short short herself was Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News anymore if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate her stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nOr even the Democrats um declined to fully embrace street Julie sweat next story\nBut on the original story the Christine for a story I think what we're going to find and what we're already finding is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like Peter Smith and mark judge amazingly enough\nThey're telling the FBI the same thing right told Judiciary Committee which they have no memory at all or to support this\nNow I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections or you're not remember\nA Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal of this party entry into Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two thirty six years in three months ago by the way\nI'm listening who is that the party and it didn't match up with a with Christine forks account of this but they thought this was a big deal so let's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that that I think there are three additional people calm burning and squeeze\nWho had not been interviewed earlier a and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about\nA Christian ports are allegations so uh I listen I I I don't think this FBI thing\nFBI investigation is a bad thing I think that they will find out that there is no evidence to support this did find out actual real evidence to support it than I've changed my mind but I don't think it's fair\nWell if you go through I I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell I'm now she's the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes and she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be\nExtremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so they brought in an independent prosecutor to\nTo question professor Ford who showed incredible respect on her but she pointed out a he said she said cases incredibly difficult to prove itself\nAnd then she goes on this cases even weaker than that and then she stopped to Fort identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues there was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault\nHappened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually the failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh as the assailant\nAre inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember key details\nWho invited forward to the party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place how did you get home from the party um and and it goes on from there but every case is similar in as much as there's no corroboration their big holes in the stories and at some point when do we ask it\nAge is similar in as much as there is no cooperation their big holes in the stories and at some point when do we ask is this becoming a witch hunt we know that Deborah cat says her friend sending out emails\nAnd she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly consistent on the issue of of sexual misconduct and they're sending out letters a dear so and so do you know anything please call us and we'll do those letters when ours [laughter] I Know please\nSome core operation you know the ... case right in the mirror at times they said they called they talked to dozens of people not to me that says twenty four people or more I mean that is a lot\nOf people can look at it on on the Rachel Mitchell thing you know she was a lot of criticism of her and um I think that the the way she approached it was not a really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they always did she had to be interrupted every five minutes but she did\nIt listed a lot of information I was looking today at her questioning of a Ford\nAbout her therapist and the therapists notes and the white we even know about this because remember Ford says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty thirty six years to two thousand twelve\nAnd she ... she says she's in marriage therapy with her husband and she tells\nThe therapist about that and she later also tells an individual therapist about that as well and she checks the therapists notes and the therapists notes do not mention the name\nBrett Kavanaugh and she says as a matter of fact it's only her husband remembering that at the session she brought up Brett Kavanaugh's name\nThat is the only evidence that it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the ... there would be confidential but of course she gave them to the Washington Post so there's probably no longer\nA confidential so even even her account of how she finally mentioned this to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have the Judiciary Committee Democrats now they want a new investigate the quote ice throwing incident in college you know this is what it sounds\nLike you're telling the truth is that is what they say well now we have the Democratic hope uh Hawaii senator\nThe one that said the men to just shut up and sit down on Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants that investigation into the ice throwing incident I'm at a ballgame and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity\nAbout was he truthful about is drinking he said he lives here he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college and high school kids I drink too much beer but they're saying well he must have blacked out in this event um\nNobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said to somebody I blacked out correct so does it look till the fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him\nSo here's you know ... question ... go ahead we're told\nUs that things have changed yeah I'm from an emphasis on the the sex misconduct allegations too was he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact that there really isn't any evidence to support the sex\nOr allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking although he mentioned many times in his testimony that he did\nAbout whether he told the truth about drinking ... mentioned many times in his testimony that he did um in fact\nDrink today rocks harbors an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word occurs testimony about his drinking tricare mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr they gotta let it go there thank you so much
