remember in the state of California you got a Thirteen and a half percent state income tax I thought it was bad at New York with a ten percent state income tax\nNow that's a lot of money a lot of people's money and Gavin Newsom now wants to make universal health care available to anybody Californian non California in\nA legal illegal doesn't matter\nIt would cost a fortune now I Know because California is so radically left wing it's kind of hard to think that a Republican to win the governorship out there but\nI kind of believe in miracles and when I saw a poll that showed it was a five point raised with John Cox she's the other candidate running for California Governor against new some I'm thinking Well Donald Trump shocked the world why not um here a couple of the ads that John Cox who's running out there in California\nI live on a drug\nTrafficking rolling from ... rent going up friends and family moving out of millions of Californians near or below the poverty line\nHadn't

have the courage to admit that those who have been leading in California for so long\nThat will Gavin Newsom stands with the lobbyists and the insiders it's about time someone stands California's\nJohn ...\nAll right so is it possible that there could be a California miracle out there now one other an addendum to this is there are number braces house races\nEspecially in Southern California and that would be even our friend Dana Rohrabacher seed and Darryl ISIS old seat\nThese are really important speech in as much as they could determine the the balance of power in the U.S house of representatives so anywhere from Los Angeles straight on down well frankly the whole state of California you have to get out and vote for these congressional candidates cause\nAnywhere from Los Angeles straight on down well frankly the whole state of California you have to get out and vote for these congressional candidates because otherwise Nancy Pelosi could end up being speaker but\nIs it possible that there could be a California miracle anyway a Republican John Cox who is uh I I think surprised so far a lot of pollsters nobody thought you'd get within single digits ever\nAnd one poll had you within five\nAh thanks for having me on a Sean and you're right I was a listening to your earlier marks about a Florida and everything and uh you said help is on the way that's actually our message to the people in California that\nGavin Newsom political class has resulted in the highest housing prices the highest gas prices water is\nBeing rationed in California you're right he's proposing new open\nAll the way they rationing the water because of the delta smelled like one out there in Denver newness his district is a great guy and if you're in the in the San Joaquin Valley I was out and I did a show from there a couple of years ago and then farmers who couldn't form because they was saving water for those little itsy bitsy fish called the delta smelt\nWell that's part of it Shawn but they haven't built a reservoir out here in Thirty years imagine California if it hadn't built a road in the last Thirty years can you imagine what the congestion would be like it's it's all horrible anyway and but they haven't built a reservoir and we built one desalination plant that\nTook Twenty years because a lawsuit and regulations and you know we've got to do more just sell nation we got to do more recycling we got a Bill Maher reservoirs that's all there is to it and but the political class you're right they don't want to do that they want to save a little tiny fish which is wonderful but we got to live\nOut in farmers got a farm and that is such a big part of the California economy I mean you're growing oranges and avocados and and all

poorest guy in Santa Barbara at the time but\nUh I Love the weather out there and when I had my first orange picked up a tree which I stole a it was like a I think I've ever had in my life um let me ask you this so you have Thirteen and a half percent state income tax rate out there you are a sanctuary state not a city whole state\nAnd now the avenue someone's free health care for everybody's busy putting up a sign that says if you get sick come here will take care of you\nI saw that the Newt has said that all the other governors around the country are probably for for a noose of so they can send anybody who is ill to California\nAnd our taxpayers will pay a their health care you know that's ridiculous Sean I mean even for months that they didn't want single payer health care but you know new so is basically just\nOffer anything free to anybody and in the process what he's doing is he's going to make California even more unaffordable than it already is a\nI think the people know that this guy mismanaged San Francisco you didn't fix the homeless problem there he's personally compromised he's a\nPretty much an empty suit was put in business by a billionaire Getty family and I think people want somebody like myself I I struggled I built a small business I got results in the private sector a and I think that's what people are looking for\nHow come the people of California then maybe I should ask the same question to myself because we're not far behind you in New York state with nine point nine percent high the highest income tax rate why did the people of California takeoff Thirteen and a half percent\nIncome state income tax rate and and there's no rebellion out there why are they taking that crap\nIt's beyond me and a lot of people are leaving Sean as you might know ...\nThe tax rate and and there's no rebellion out there why are they taking that crap\nIt's beyond me and a lot of people are leaving Sean as you might know California has had an exodus of

but as an aide to a night late Nineteen thirties as today\nPolitical rancor social division and the threat posed by alien ideologies\nSparked widespread unease what is the alien ideology\nOf today yeah up today or back then I mean the fact that one of the two major party has embraced democratic socialism is already alien to me yes the the the fear back in the thirties was communism or the ... and the left said no it's fascism\nProbably some conservative thing yeah no no the textile workers' strike of Flint sit down strike the battle over the overpass the republic steals strike almost all of these and including many of the race riots\nHave communist and Marxist fingerprints on them I said it's as fundamental to the ideology right rebel yesterday is fundamental to the ideology is not
