know the the mainstream media regarded her as perhaps the one\nDemocratic standard bearer who could\nAt her age with her stance take on a lot of the Bernie Sanders positions\nAre and and she was a senator and she was relatively young so ... and then she does this so now in the past week essentially the mainstream media kind of turned on her it's like they they called her up that was a dumb idea why because they want to find somebody who is a viable alternative to Donald Trump\nAnd they can win and with this kind of baggage she's not going in place\nWhat do you think as you look at and we look at polls every day and I watch Fox and friends and I watch you guys you do a great show you the number one new show on cable news by far in your hour and you have been for years and then like me

the guys who is in charge of buying the ads for the Republicans in Washington DC said that over the last two weeks they have seen a essentially\nA five point bump across the board for Republicans and they're basing that they they attributed to Kavanaugh\nThey attributed to taxes and they attributed to immigration\nAnd so given the fact that uh the enthusiasm level is higher in both suddenly the Republicans are spiking\nAt exactly the right time the big question is and I know a new thing which I think he was on with us like you said the election comes down to to think Kavanaugh and the care of it and the caravan of ... of course of course of action by the United states hey Mexico do something about this or going to have to put troops on our southern border and shut it down\nWell I think

kind of the house I think the Democrats will get twenty six twenty seven seats\nWill take control but more narrowly than people or anticipating this when they were talking\nOf ways of leeway we can prevent the that's you're talking for seats that could very well All right thank you both well have you back Eighteen days to go will be in Houston, Texas tomorrow town hall interview with Ted Cruz works stop Perry\nI don't want people you know I Want people to everybody has a choice I Can't make people watch Hannity or listen to this radio show I Do the best programs I can and and people have all the power but that's not enough of these groups\nKnown as they can't when they can't they can't win on the electoral basis we saw that with Donald Trump defeating Hillary Clinton that was the last straw\nFor the George Soros is in the far left the media matters all of these people once they went down in the presidential election that all of them thought they were going to win because they have the media in their pocket and still do then they said you know what\nWe got to abandon um the free market place we are now going assassinate people and this is very similar what happened in Germany and bringing it back to the\nBy the way you're not saying that you you know it's funny I saw some press you're not saying that they that that people today are like not the killing people what you're saying is that there are similar lying ... propaganda miss 'em ... demonization very different from saying that they're a death camps\nYeah I mean there's just look that can't happen in America thank God because our structure is still in place to prevent anything like that happening\nBut I'll tell you what antifa no different than the essay George Soros behind the scenes with tens of millions of dollars alright funneling into agencies that are bent on destroying human beings and we talked about this last time I was on a program what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nEvery American should pay attention to that because of that guy can go down on uncorroborated are uncorroborated than anybody in this country can\nAnd as you rightly pointed out to try to with Trump on the Russian collusion that's collapsing all over the place the fusion GPS guy put out a dot CA taking the Fifth Amendment now won't testify what does that tell you\nOkay so you know we're living in a dangerous time let's\nLet me in terms of sue this you're I'm agreeing with you that that what really got exposed to me that scares me a lot and there's two things one is we ever do justice system we don't have equal justice\nOr equal application of our laws needs to be looking at Hillary Clinton she ... the biggest obstruction of justice slam dunk case ever but the problem here is we had one party literally before the American people you mentioned Kavanaugh abandon\nAll principle constitutional law and the and and literally core values that have served us so well which are due process the presumption of innocence the Republicans for the first time in their life did something right they handled it with the seriousness the topic deserves\nThey were thorough they did it right and at the end of the day there was no corroboration to the allegations being made and now we see people like what Eric Holder kick them we can't be civil\nIn their face Cory Booker or Maxine Waters you see these cabinet people you get a crowd and you follow them into a grocery stores department stores gas stations and you tell them we don't want them nowhere anymore that's what she said no we want to use\nIts amusing that you ran down the list than we are we could at ten more and then Trump goes to Montana and makes a joke a joke about the Republican candidate for Senate they're um slam dunk ... a reporter [laughter] you know\nAnd it was obviously set in jest and no press goes lie all crazy yet all the things that you pointed out are somehow over look\nAnd not overlooked it they they do to Harris yeah well because now they're in concert\nThere the the American media is in concert with the Democratic party and that's I don't think that's ever happened before in this republic where the the eighty percent of the media now is\nPromoting a political party so it's going to be fascinating to see the backlash in the election coming up in November I Do believe there will be one I don't know the extent of it\nI don't think anybody does anything anyone that says they know a dozen no I don't think a lot of people saw what happened on twenty sixty nine I said absolutely possible that Donald Trump is going to win then they ... then the the five\nDays a on a factor five days before he was going to win because people didn't like Hillary Clinton and here they are even gonna stay home or vote against her and not to exactly what happened but I Want to I just want to reinforce just because I Know you can't say it on your TV and radio show but what\nYou're going to you saying then they're going to attribute it to me and then I got an ally had a lot so rightly say the stuff he won't good that you have\nNo idea what I'm going to talk about because nobody ever does and nobody tells\nMe I don't even think of you or me either no what we're going to save a court before comes flying out of our mouths now\nBut what would you do every day I mean you're you're putting in four hours a day doing commentary and then you have to go home but you have to have unbelievable security surrounding you\nThat should never happen in a free society\nNever been out of this bill you're not the only one to talk about it right you know I mean it was something that would have done the comedies are going on right\nOn and the conservative commentators are all\nIn danger and and this is you know to me I'm I'm saying to myself just got to be exposed number one and it's got to stop number two and you can't have people telling a emotionally disturbed individuals hey surround them when they're in a restaurant\nI mean that should be marching orders should be investigated by the ethics committee or the house just for saying that\nBill we're seeing now into major cities many riots break out we have to politicians Republican uh candidates in Minnesota had been punched the guy was whole hopped in a restaurant got hit from behind\nAnd he's got a concussion and the healing time is a minimum now six weeks one of the people that were punch was a woman yeah well you know look at Pam Bondi secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz's why Heidi\nNow we're going after women and children look at what's been said about millennia ... on a level of cruelty that I've never seen and by the way unfair\nMillennia I she is one of the most lovely people you'll ever meet China same with a bunker\nWhere where are the spokesmen on the left condemning this\nBob board where what is the chief\nOkay you're not going to say the word mop now if the Tea Party had a you know damn well CNN would be saying the word mop\nOkay but what what exactly are those people in the Klan and black with masks on gang All right maybe a gang alright but they're organized and they're out to hurt people\nAnd you don't care\nYou're not going to use the word mob come on\nI'm worried in many ways that we're losing the country where so divided and I don't think Rand Paul's too far off I mean\nThis is the canary in the coal mine a preview coming attractions if this continues somebody's going to get killed or severely injured it's it's weird that close now it's like a tipping point\nYou can see it on the horizon I don't I don't want it to happen by the way and I'll say that any conservative keep your hands in your pocket and just because you disagree with somebody be respectful personally I don't believe that don't do it\nDon't go down at a level well we've already had the shooting at the softball field you're right which was under covered by the national press you know Steve Sebelius everybody a who watches Fox News knows the story but if you just watch MSNBC you wouldn't know ski Steve ... that happened to them [noise] um\nSo you're right and that's what I'm Talking to you about today and I'm
