the terms\nBut I Will tell you I think the fact that you're you've hit two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality and we saw that in the cabin on hearings and we have seen a post Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members in and high ranking officials that our government

I'm Sorry I have an audio conflate those those two names uh yeah I mean that that's that's pretty big that that was thrown out Sean because I mean that's the killer that now stormy is actually responsible for Trump's legal fees I ... and by the way every court case should\nBe I guess I'd always gotten ... from the beginning I'm kind of it these are street fighter hum but I think what especially during the cabinet hearings with Julie sweating egg\nI mean it was was pretty outrageous 'cause she was claiming almost on a weekend basis you know that Brett Kavanaugh was that these parties and they were drug in these young girls nice boys were lining up in the hall and and gang raping these girls as a matter of adult almost a weekly thing\nDidn't have it on ... to ... I Would think a fairly smart guy right\nAnd and to listen to that story and say I'm going to go to that with this I'm going to say that a girl who was two three years removed from high school repeatedly he went back to parties were gang rapes were going on she knew they were going on and she's still kept going back\nAnd oh I won't be able to actually find anybody that can corroborate the story at least no one can independently find anybody\nThat was list I think NBC was saying yeah we tried to find the people that Julie sweating except we're out those parties one dead\nOr to wouldn't returned our calls at one didn't know who actually sweating it was so now Democrats who used to hell ...\nAnd the media obviously another around but also\nThe process they gave up any semblance of core values that everyone believes it and that's due process and the presumption of innocence that's where they lost that I got to run but Joe control over the hill dot com you want to check out his work is probably the only media he is the only media reporter in the country that I Know that is actually fair and balanced and\nSo you know the the look it's I'm I'm just telling everybody three weeks from tonight you're going to turn on your TV set\nAnd you're going to watch the coverage and you're either going to be you know maybe maybe it'll be a mixed bag maybe the Republicans gained a couple of seats in the Senate when\nMaybe they lose the house you lose the house then all you're going to see for two years is never ending non stop obsessive compulsive Trump paint and investigations and possible impeachment\nThat's the agenda that's it there's nothing to improve the lives of the American people ... know that there's a lot of states\n[noise] the Democrats rely on people of low information they rely on propaganda and putting things out there and can be used in people that's the way it is\nWell let me tell you what it is they they've got one play book they're the party of smear slander mismanagement racist sexist massage ... phobic homophobic Islamic phobic dirty air water kill children skill grandma it's the same playbook\nIt's never changed on Thirty years in radio it's never gonna change when they didn't get power for eight years\nIt was it it didn't improve the lives of anybody it left many Americans behind the worst economy in modern times was Brock Obama's\nSo you know I it's amazing that they don't want to talk about well the the tax cuts I'm working now they want the crumbs back\nAnd do well healthcare never worked out for anybody but they want to keep it they haven't made it ... it but are there focuses the hate Trump investigating Trump nonstop All right um but I look on the other side of I'll be blunt\nYou know if three weeks from tomorrow it come on the air and say well you know we're going to be stuck with Nancy Pelosi you didn't get out you didn't vote you know what we'll survive it will fight we're not going to stop\nBut it would be so much better and so much easier for all of us and especially the forgotten men and women they're just getting a foothold now in terms of jobs and opportunities for themselves and their families\nYou know and that was going to be you know a battle every day non-stop accusations non stop fighting\nWe've had that for two years since Trump for president that's supposedly coming to an end but we'll just pick up and we'll fight back that's what we do you don't give up you know given you just stay on it\nYou know you have to win these political battles matter you get the government ultimately you deserve America deserves better than what the Democratic Party is offering but that's going to be up to you my vote here\nIn New York's was meaningless in this whole case\nThis is not going to help I Can't help you in this election\nUm except tell you the truth I'm telling you the truth and I'm saying all of these races are infinitely winnable right now there's ... there's been a change\nDemocrats have overreached they've they miscalculated and the American people are good fair minded people they're figuring this out pretty quick they watch the judge Kavanaugh\nThey see these mobs they hear these you know these incitement this these marching orders if you will by radicals that are Congress men and women and senators\nAll right let's get to Don and Detroit's\nBoyd John James is like the greatest candidate he doesn't he's doing better in the polls he's down in single digits I Wish the people of Michigan gets the outbreak this guy is he'd be he's that's a long shot for us but while he'd be amazing\nBut it was a long shot for us Sean thanks for taking my call that I probably have it at all campaign and let them take\nYour enthusiasm away this man deserves a\nVote oh no no not at all where we're going to the this this will be one of my first campaign rallies for Senate or for a Senate\nUm killed it a long time it's going to have kid rock there is going to have 'em Donald Trump junior and Kimberly guilt foil there tomorrow night is that going tomorrow night when I'm\nOn the Michigan from six tonight I I don't remember exactly the venue but people can look it up at John Jay sure Senate dot com\nLet me tell you something that this man is beyond impressive he has all these leaders\nIn the army at the same that the same time it's him that he provided air cover for me I was a flight medic provided a lot of air cover for me when I was ... an awesome awesome awesome man yeah well\nI you know I look at his background and his experience and he just you know some people just have it whatever it is they have it they own it and um I I just think he's a natural leader and I hope the people millions pay attention to him\n... Kevin McCarthy and Paul Ryan a couple of weeks ago came out they dangle this carrot front of us and they've done it every year every two years they dangles carried out in front of us\nCalled ... border security and that they'll fund the entire wall\nRight only if they went in two thousand Eighteen we\nBloodied whenever we attended a Trump rally we were bloodied up and the reason Donald Trump was elected in one of the big reasons was because he was going to build the wall the reason he won the election was because he said he was going to build the wall the reason we maintain the majority in Congress\nFor the past eight years and especially in two thousand sixteen was because the Republicans were finally going to fund the wall\nAnd when Kevin McCarthy came out who I have a lot of respect for came out a couple of weeks ago in ... in front of the voters faces I was screaming at my TV saying you've had the opportunity to present Donald Trump with no less than three spending bills and neither of those bills get it have any appropriations for border wall\nRight you had the majority in Congress for eight years he won an election not to I was sixteen\nFor building a border wall\nThey act like they're losers they don't know how to\nThey don't know how to act like they do but he's been more critical than me I mean I I Know I have a news\nThe adjectives spineless gutless needing a backup bone\n... look at this point it's too important we've actually gotten a real lot done\nThe president what he's done in terms of ISIS the grading and and the feeding them at a level nobody anticipated\nNorth Korea everybody thought we were headed for real tragedy there and you know which sole thirty million people their lives at risk no more rockets being fired over Japan were not dropping pallets of cash cargo planes of cash and other currency to Iranian mullahs\nAre as we see what's happened on the economic front for point two percent GDP we we watched an economy go from losing jobs to creating four million plus jobs at this time eight million fewer Americans in poverty and I'm fat and food stamps\nI'm we see the pipelines are being built an war has opened up um we spent three billion three and a half billion on the new law we need the full funding you're right the twenty five million a but we're making the progress to original is on the Supreme Court great judges on the lower courts and\nI I just see in America that's transforming before our eyes based on every measure consumer confidence everything in between uh yeah I Wish they would have worked faster they would have kept their promises better there's still a lot of work to do but the alternative is nonexistent\nThere is no alternative if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for Nancy Pelosi in the house vote for Democrats for the Senate you're voting for Chuck Schumer\nUm that's it if you you know you save the house and Senate we can get a lot done we get these additional seats in Indiana North Dakota Montana if we you know hold in Nevada and we pick up with Martha mix Sally in Arizona\nI mean and we Claire McCaskill gets sent packing and Rick Scott wins in Florida it would be amazing holding the house is key\nIf it even if you don't particularly love your Republican congressmen it's not going to be an impeachment investigation vote that the Democrat is offering you\nSo for that reason alone I mean it's important to me will survive it I'm not saying we wouldn't not going to come on here the day after election day whining complain I'm gonna just dig my hills in and do what I always do after elections and let's fight for what I Believe in\nWhat we'd be so much easier if we just did it on election day\nAnyway I appreciate your call I'm\nDana is in Oklahoma Dana Hi

Scaramucci is with us\nBy the way next week he's got a great book I've been reading it I got an early copy it's phenomenal and it's called the Trump the blue collar president ah I Know\nThat it's too early to talk about the book but you tell some amazing stories about who really Donald Trump is where he came from and and his background and you know a whole story that the media is never told about him and I learned a lot reading it how are you my front\nUm you know Sean I'm doing great but you know you're you're you're mentioning a lot of very interesting things and one thing I always remember that the president\nHe may hit hardest Sean a buddy always hits second and he often hit slash I've never seen him unilaterally come after anybody it's only after the attack him\nThat he doubles down and starts to counter punch you know so Elizabeth Warren attacking him he's ignoring her and then bam Pocahontas or a Republican candidate in the primary Jackie and then he fires off the nickname here so the the point being is that like he is actually a very civil guy\nUntil you start shooting at him then once you start shooting at him he's going to hit you with the full force\nAnd just sort of gives a very important distinction between what's going on between the Democrats\nWell let me tell you you know I mean it's so funny because I remember a conversation once I had with the president and and you were at the White House for a pretty short period of time and\nHe he talked about you which is very interesting to me and he talked about well this Harvard Anthony and then there's the kids in the street and they and a and I know both I mean\nYou know yell and yell at me he yelled at me after the curse and you've got to remember like\nThe the guy Ryan Lizz have legs of total wire she basically faded me into the call but then he's asking me to do a profile\nWith them and then that's when I responded with the expert but you know what it is what it is but but what the the president yelled at me he said hey man I Need less street Anthony and I need more Harvard Anthony but you know what ... what makes you great on the radio and and uh and the reason why we're so close is that we both have a little bit of that and I don't like when you were a bus\nIn ... when I was washing dishes bussing tables you know it was a cook yeah that's right yeah but you know something a little bit and I wouldn't trade that experience in life for anything or the years I spent in construction which was two decades of my life\nAnd I don't know I mean I I think a lot of us that are blessed and lucky and successful I met too many people that forget where they come from and I'm not going to forget where it came from and I'm just on and so it's not ...\nWell that's the point though that's the point in the books on I really do try to explain that your story\nAnd I'm just on and so it's not ...\nWell that's the point though that's the point in the books on I really do try to explain\nThat your story or my story is a classical American story or a where we were in these aspirational working class families and our parents wanted us to do better and they were fully bought into as where our grandparents into the American dream\nAnd so uh what the president is trying to do what you try to do every day what I tried to do in my small way is see if we can make that happen for people\nThat were similarly situated or currently ... similarly situated the way we were in the Nineteen sixties or seventies growing up and so\nThat's one of the reasons why despite getting far from the White House I never broke ranks are never broke my loyalty from the president because I really do believe this horse in the right place and I really believe that uh you know she is the right\nOne with a throwaway line the proof is in the party I mean when when you go to Robin ... eight years adding Thirteen million more Americans to food stamps eight million more in poverty you can't get three they only president never to get three percent GDP Growth\nThe worst recovery since the forties and all of a sudden we've got four point two percent for the second quarter of the GDP Growth projections are way over four percent for the third quarter you know that we have four million more Americans working eight million out of office food stamps and out of poverty\nI'm thinking okay finally the forgotten men and women the the young Scaramucci's Hannity's are now doing better why ... why would we want to stop that\nAnd I you know not not and I agree and it's going to get better because he's continuing to de layer the process of regulation\nOr he's continuing to find ways to incentivize corporations large and small to move their money back on shore of the United states I Know you talk a lot about the re engineered now after the U.S MCA now\nUh Shaun I'm going through that you know I'm trained as an economist and I'm running an eleven and a half billion dollars on that I found it a that is going to have monumental positive benefits to middle and lower middle class families the re engineering of that trade agreement because it's just the configuration of the cars\nJust the uh the manufacturing point and the price on labor or that's been agreed to in those agreements is going to need more disposable income for working class family\nAnd by the way you know where was the establishment politicians thinking about those people over the twenty five years of NAFTA shot well where where they\nKnow where I could break right back will continue more with Anthony Scaramucci on
