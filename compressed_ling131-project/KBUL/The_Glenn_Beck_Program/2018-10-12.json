do\nBecause there's a lot at stake that's\nNot going to be the end of the world of the Democrats were just going to make every thing harder and more divisive and more difficult and it's going to waste our time and slow or progress\nAnd then you look at record low unemployment and fourteen states record low unemployment for Hispanic Americans African Americans\nAre Asian Americans um women in the

have supported ever judge Kavanaugh there just lying to the people of Tennessee\nThose are two races that are going to watch the polls and the next week or two of this this information makes its way to the people of Arizona\nAnd Tennessee respectively hey listen I have the best coffee you have ever tasted black rifle coffee company and if you're sick uh wins they get the weak taste of coffee from those left leaning corporate brands that are out there\nI'm going to tell you right now once you try black rifle coffee dot com slash Sean you are going to be hooked now this is a company that's founded by former special operation of veterans and first responders they hire special ops\nA service men and women and first responders and they donate to a portion of sales to veteran and first responder causes it's the best roasted coffee roaster order coffee delivered right to your door guaranteed fresh you can join their coffee club\nAnd now [noise] oh yeah oh you mean like\nWhy is the message we can sit in here for like on those calls and so that's a message we want to be because we're not ready yeah exactly [noise]\nThere's a lot of people who are Republicans who are going to vote for him but if they know that you like [noise]\nI don't want to have like a line that he like within like ...\nYeah exactly the same would be like no yeah and that's the whole thing is\nLike ... ... ... in this for personal reasons probably going to be one term senator from end to that point where you just like if I don't think that horn and stuff like that you know it's going to be running for reelection he can get in there and\nDo the right thing where you're at six years [noise]\nTreat me still actually gets in the center of you know [laughter] um\nSo there you have ten is the Senate hopeful Democrats Phil Bredesen staff literally explaining\nAway why he's consciously lying to the people of tendency\nThat he would never support somebody like judge Kavanaugh but we're down eight and we're trying to get more Republicans on our side and when he gets in there he'll be the real liberal that he always wants to be and do the right thing you won't be concerned about reelection this is just a political move in a political statement\nAnd um I I mean it doesn't get any more sick in this\nNow thank goodness our friends over at project Vera toss wherever the catch all these people including top campaign workers were Bredesen exposing what was the truth with their undercover cameras\nYou know you know based it's all expose their reticent staff saying that Britain's him a liar when he said he would vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh it is purely a blatant political move\nAnd uh when I asked for comment all they said was well project ... times posed as a fake volunteer and and you secret video recording equipment to capture uninformed is speculative comments made last weekend by college students and youth organizers\nWell that's not exactly true is that James O'Keefe was the c._e._o. of project ... is with us ah some of them were high ranking campaign members weren't they\n[noise] that's right Sean and and and thanks for higher learning this and yeah they ... this is a coordinated campaign between the Tennessee Democratic Party in the um and the silk reticent campaign and these these workers have been working at the headquarters for the president campaign for a couple of months\nAnd it's a Greek chorus of voices all saying that it's a quote\nPolitical move because this is a big deal last friday when when there's a Tennessee Democratic Senate candidate so Brett Brett is an announced that she was going to be voting for capping off if you were in the Senate he said I Would be voting for it was a big deal and they're all saying\nThat no it was a big lie it was a cheap political move to get rural voters that weren't supporting him in Tennessee I mean I took it\nAnd that that isn't it but that isn't your a ... statement now that's the statement coming from their own mouth and Sean I don't I'm not speculating here I'm not reporting this anonymously you can actually see the city I can see it coming out of their own mouse they're the ones who are standing\nWhat you just said we've confirmed that and again it's not just one or two or three and half a dozen of these people are inside the campaign office they have confirmed that the people are real and and that and then of course you have the the owners material with his bread isn't staffer thinks the Tennessee voters are ignorant\nHe says quote we don't say this out of these walls\nHe says will be a good Democrat and what that means he'll be a good Democrat that means that he's going to vote with the Schumer wing of the party once she gets elected kind of see they don't want them even the Democrats don't want them to be Chuck Schumer Democrats so all this is pretty amazing stuff Sean and uh\nYou know it's just we're confirming what was known for years\nYou know you you think back and you think Peter Struck and he talked about smelly Wal Mart Trump voters and you think abiding just what like last month saying that Trump voters were the ... of society just fine [noise]\nLosing the court and in a court of public opinion is these forces of intolerance remained determined to undermine them roll back some progress you all may\nThis time they're not you have an on line in the White House this time they have in a\nSmall percentage of the American people virulent people [noise] some of the drugs in society [noise]\nDrags is designed so then you've got\nSmelly Walmart people ... society era deem Abul deplorable that we now learn this week from Hillary you cannot\nBe civil with you know we got Eric Holder saying the kick them\nObama once famously saying that you know these are bitter angry people cling to their God guns bibles in religion I mean there's such hatred in contempt for voters there's another tape we showed last night James I don't know if you saw the show we did run your tape and ... thank you for sharing it with us\nBut an Arizona democratic senator US Senate candidate name's Kristen cinema literally caught on tape and twenty eleven calling the people of Arizona crazy and it's even worse than that\nBecause we found out Fox News dot com reported that she was promoting an event at Arizona State university featuring a lawyer is lawyer was convicted of aiding and Islamic terrorist organization in its leader\nAnd the lawyer in question presented represented someone who was sentenced to life in prison in the nineties for plotting to blow up the UN and FBI building more\nIn a fight that person to\nYou know just I mean it's unbelievable to me what they're doing is they're just outright lying to people\nWhere they have to show on that that's the the whole purpose behind our organization Vera ... exposed the real nature thing the reality and the motivations behind these people and and they have to lie and the red state it's not it's a democratic red state Democrats have to lie\nIn order to get elected and when they get into the Senate\nThey can only vote one way yes or no\nBut they have to mislead andme misinform the voters and and again it's so if if people think that it requires all this espionage it doesn't you walk into the office just ask them questions staffers all tell you the same thing in\nThe last April we don't actually believe this and if there's one thing voters won't tolerate Sean if there's one thing\nLeft this is not a left or right thing because it's just so\nSelf evident you can't lie to people you can't lie about what your intentions are you have to be honest\nAnd they cannot get elected they they will not\nIf they still no you're right if they if they state what they really believe they'll never get elected so whatever you do it's like uh they just it's an orchestrated law\nCaught them or the other side\nThey will be the first time we got a bunch more coming\nAnd going to ask you about that in just a
