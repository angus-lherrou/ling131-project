Bella Hi how are you glad you called\nThank you so much Sean I don't know if you remember in two thousand nine I called in to your show was the very first time I'd ever called into any talk radio and you were teasing me about Fela in twilight and I told you to get Trump for president that was in two thousand nine\nIs that true I don't remember but I Do remember the below calling me talking about the twilight series\nThat I remember [laughter] I'm like I was was it was a it was one of the hottest movies at the time right\nOh I didn't know what you were talking about and then I said to you and like I only watch Fox and then the last time that I talk to you well okay so the last time I talked to was a couple of days before the inauguration\nAnd by the way I I I'm not a big twilight said the only reason I Do have the kids you know I'm not really you know the vampire hours and ... you know [laughter] and we're not result\nNervous because I didn't know what you were talking about but John I talked to a couple of days before the inauguration and I don't know if you remember but I told you that you inspired me to sit my pickup truck every night and you're like wow what kind of inspiration is that can I tell you what you inspired me to do\nWith I'd love to told me I Love inspiring people\nOkay so I ran round telling everybody that I got on your show and everybody was like were you nervous or you're afraid and I don't know but what I realized was when we're talking about the young and how are we going to get people to tune into conservative talk radio\nI left went out to Willis in North Dakota right worked in the oil field\nAnd now in the evening I came in after scrubbing toilets I started my own cleaning business out there and the cleaning and catering business right yeah so\nI come in at night and I would sit in my truck because that's where I could contain audio and I created the Bella DeAngelis show and it was created for people that don't normally listening to talk radio so the silent majority Eighteen year old rough neck six year old black liberal women were listening to my showing at the highlight of it\nI had a following of like twenty thirty some thousand\nThree awesome internationally as well\nYeah that's good for you well let me ask you this I don't\nCare I'm back here in Minneapolis and it might actually go read and do the job that we need to do improve to try that we a hundred percent hundred and fifty percent support him because it's math of this Trump train and ... and stuff that sin Newberg\nHas closed the gap for Clovis shower ward low is Thirteen percent higher than Allison there's some really good signs here for going red in Minneapolis\nThe last thing is I Want to remind people that are very important house races in uh Minneapolis in well in Minnesota for those race um that are going to tip the balance of power like Southern California it's interesting New York New Jersey\nOr places like Minnesota Wisconsin Michigan California state you wouldn't expect that's where a lot of these tossup races that I keep talking about our um look let me ask you when you move to North Dakota and you're in this radio show and you started your own business\nDid you make a lot more money um\nYeah I mean here I mean we were in such a bad recession and Minneapolis and when I moved out there I mean the excitement and all the jobs are not going to say I want to give a shout out to the oil fields because contradictory to what a lot of people here about a ...\nWell you know I mean the same thing we were talking earlier maybe water is a Walter season California's forty fifth district but I think there's that Michael Bloomberg the former mayor of New Yorkers spending some nine million dollars alone in Southern California and how much they poured into the race of negative ads against you\n[noise] it's been it's been my log has something about spent two to one at this point no you're not ... to to wander the good news is people don't get out and so\nYou know the lives that they tell really aren't getting the narrative but we're all male in state every all ballots have been out for a ... for a week and a half now and so every day's election day every day is election day I got the most left wing opponent I've ever had\nA you know she she woke up the day after Hillary law and decided that you need to be a member of Congress and this march and more angry protests in Seattle and creates and the district [noise] you\nKnow thinks it hating the president is somehow a qualification to be a member of Congress Sean I think we're all hoping for more than that aren't we\nDo you get it well of course we are we want to help the forgotten men and women and we have a trajectory of success or that I think has been unparalleled the as quick as any politician as promised stuff and then make those promises happen\n[laughter] yeah it's it's it's just ridiculous that's that's the sensory which he's running on and uh and so we're we've been doing everything you know I was going door to door I think over a thousand houses personally I'm a second pair of shoes\nOr we need people to come make phone calls doorbell with a volunteer contribute you know Dino Rossi dot com come out\nWhat what do you think you get a day by day\nOh the doorbell with a volunteer contribute you know Dino Rossi dot com come hell\nYeah what what do you think that you get a day by day return in terms of a Republican Democrat or do they not give that information out there\nWe don't register by party in our state so it's only based on what we've I deed and ah [noise] get our people are voting whatsoever there's clearly asking a master we really got to get people to Maryland about anybody listening to us right now if you haven't senator but I'll do it now get your family to do it call your friends get it in because\nOf the ... comes in the same or cake after list a or at least you when you get to the heart cases who may or may not vote must we talk to him\nWell she's just writing it running basically on hate as you said so that's the main difference she wants Obamacare let me guess she wants to impeach the president he wants to open borders she wants the crumbs back anything else that's any different from the rest of the checklist of every other Democrat running\nWell that is a checklist we have a few other things that are that we're in the ad obviously we we we don't have a state income tax or straight she favorites that that's been turned down nine times by the public here but she's she's still on that bandwagon fire you know and she ... time for a for\nNot being a fan of Obamacare when Obamacare came in last healthcare myself my wife and my\nMy four children and I ended up with a lousy plan to cast too and at times as much coverage things I Want coverage coverage things I didn't want covered twelve thousand dollar family deductible on top of that you know my goal is to have as many health insurance companies chasing people around for their business we can possibly get\nSo you can decide what's your plan or some bureaucratic politician deciding for you it's called freedom\nWell listen we wish you the best Dino Rossi a that is the difference in this between Republicans and a conservative agenda or the radical left agenda Nancy Pelosi I keep reminding people a vote for any Democrat anywhere in the country is a vote for her and it is because they'll electric speaker\nAnd a vote for any Democrat in the Senate well that's pretty much a vote for sure so I Hope the people in Washington state's eighth district get out there for Dino Rossi uh I Know you've done a good job and you've worked hard and a sadly you have to take all of the incoming it's pretty pathetic\nUm but so thank you so much for being with us and we wish you all all the best is just one of those races\nThe Washington state eighth district where this is the tipping point the balance of power\nIs right there if you're in the ... district there I sort of thank you wish you the best\nThank you very much on take care\nRight eight hundred dying for one Sean is our toll free telephone number if you want to be a part of the program all you've been telling me all day that you want to do something funny and that you're not even paying attention to the show\nWhile I was going to say goodbye to her I guess the by all means let's\nTalk about what what do you all day you been threatening oh I'm going to say something funny what is\nI ... it's not it's funny to me I think it's funny I think our audience\nA lot of I Want to do a poll whole uh-huh dot com perhaps and I was\nThinking ahead of the dot com or we have all the tossup races\nIt only already most important ... so if you're out there and you're registered Republican you need to go to Hannity dot com and look at the thirty most important races in the country we also have an interactive map which has all Seventy races\nAvailable for you to see everything oh by the ... top when you're right it's in the carousel it's the first story or a ... if you have any questions or concerns please call us ... when during nine for one day it again in the four story first story was\nThe first ... say Singapore Singapore Singapore it's not Singapore say coffee coffee coffee\nCoffee it it is coffee say somebody said to me today talk that took the yesterday I answered\nThe phone and this guy was calling from Texas and you had a nice comment but it took him Thirteen Years to get there so I said please\nIt took so yesterday I answered the phone and this guy was calling from Texas and he had a nice comment but it took him Thirteen Years to get there so I said please we'd be this up a little bit and he goes listen they became [laughter] this is talk here from New York I hear you talk real fast\n[laughter] and that's just the way it's going to be I was like you know a click nobody calls me ... oh that's right maybe maybe what about the last\nPerson I Would think that will get insulted at anything settled baby is\nFine sweetheart dialing honeybee sugar pie like oh there's the baby\nSugar bye honey bunch we could make a side right I think uh they were yeah so anyways so and I was thinking that it'll be a lonely or I had a good story or a gun keep interrupting your show host your terrible listening\nOh no you're not terribly you're on my head right I can reclaim lifetime just think about Maxine Waters is the head of financial committee to think about that for one second just a brief diversion so\nI was thinking it might be nice if on election night you hosted your own show and I think we should take a poll and see if America would like to see host your own channel okay well\nWhat you're saying is which has been a fact all my twenty three years at Fox is I don't work on election I this is true and it's all Fox the news division that takes over\nAnd I went one year I went in and uh you know I was on for five minutes and I'm like I I Want to be home alone and I want to have my three TV sets off for depending if I can set up another one in the meantime\nAnd my six computers and I want to do it I always do I want to be looking at percentages and finding out beforehand whether we're winning or losing\nNow the former president of Fox News bill shine can attest to the fact that has emails to the fact\nThat I have called it right before anybody else every single election year because you know I'm sitting there looking yet let's see uh uh Cuyahoga County and Palm Beach county and the panhandle and southwest Florida\nAnd I can figure out usually Broward County all these important counties whether or not Republicans are going to win or lose now there's a little tougher because of\nThe different congressional races my guess is it's going to be late into the morning before we could ascertain who can maintain control of the house\nIn large part because California matters Southern California we've been featuring the seven important races there on our list on Hannity dot com the thirty most important races Seventy total important races although there are all important and I'm just not sure people understand what a Speaker Pelosi means\nTo heartbeat away and you have a woman who says we have to pass the bill to find out what's in it yeah that's what you went running your country then by all means staying home listening at\nThe end of the day will deal with whatever it is where I'm\nGoing to rage their ... well you can rage away as long as it's not against me I don't really care I'm going to be so mad at Republicans if they don't go out and vote well very\nVery excited that well you sound so excited that she's already checked out the drapes she got this big Hubbard [noise]\nUm I'm not so sure I'd want one of the unknown factor is the ... the greatest hope for Republicans in my opinion\nIs that it absolutely there is an unknown Trump factor\nAll bets are off because I don't think Trump supporters of the type of people are going to answer anybody's call for any poll ever I don't I've been with calls me I never get called for a poll\nAnd polls you know I look at them I Know a conventional wisdom is I read real clear politics every day you know they silver as as an eighty five percent Democrats take the house or but I also know that they got it wrong in two thousand\nTo eat and then two thousand and sixteen and not the only did they get it wrong they did it in a colossal spectacular way so I'm just saying to the American people don't be swayed by polls don't be dispirited if you think you can't win assume that you're behind and go out there on the field that is why we play the game\nAnd you know sometimes your favorite team wins and sometimes your favorite team loses I didn't particularly enjoy election nights and two thousand and eight yeah because you can't trust\nYou cannot complain if you don't vote so go out and vote I Can't complain because I'm basically I'm not talking about you everybody knows you vote has nothing to do with the voting I you know all we can do is informed people\nHas everything to do with the voting no it has everything to do with every but my my vote is meaningless in New York for the most part now we know we're in a blue state so we do the best we\nCan still voting every year we'd do the art civic duty and but I Am saying look look at where it's important look at what states presidents do whatever they he's not doing eight states Lebanon rally blitz", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year":
