San Diego sixteen years old that's all I wanted\nBut then something strange happens if you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the early Nineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties\nPerhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false and it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post Ford narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks\nFor what was supposedly one of the most dramatic andme important Nick at events of her life\nWhy is this significant\nWell because if the attack happened when she was in her late teens or in the mid eighties as she first told the Washington Post and her therapist Brett Kavanaugh would have been three hundred miles away and Yale University as a full time student\nSo it couldn't have happened in the mid Nineteen eighties or in her late teens there's more in the memo and we'll get to it\nBut this is a bombshell that no one will discuss\nIt not only discredits Ford's allegation against Brett Kavanaugh it obliterate said he'd cast serious doubts over her testimony now maybe the FBI find some new groundbreaking evidence\n\nBut this allegation should be considered debunked\nThe Democrats knows is the media knows this and that's why they are shifting gears have you noticed now they're talking not about Ford now they're talking about was he was he lying about teenage fart jokes I'm not making that up\nWas he lying about fart jokes and drinking games\n\nThey tried to make him a rapist then they tried to make him a gang rapist that argument is losing now they're going to

J. Simpson do it yes we're all in agreement now now the the emotions are gone we're all in agreement that OJ Simpson was guilty\nSo the question is was justice done\nThe answer is clear no\nIt's not justice\nThat social justice that I Want to feel good that social justice not real justice social justice\nIs evil when it is when it is played the way the post modernist and the progressives are playing it now it does not provide any kind of real justice\nThat woman who was in the elevator her plight I'm sure\nTell her feelings were real and I feel sorry for and I don't know what happened in her case I don't even know if it happened here in America or where it happened but I Will tell you this in the case of Ford\nWe cannot help as a society if you don't ask for help if you don't ask anyone in your circle of friends for help\nWe can help you later especially thirty five years later we can't help you\nKnow I'm I'm shocked that someone could be as traumatized as Dr Ford was and no one in her circle of friends in high school let's say she was a sophomore in high school well no she can be a sophomore could she should be a sophomore she have to be a\nFreshman or a junior I'm trying to figure out when Kavanaugh ... and they're both still in school but let's just say was sophomore year she this happened\nTo her this happens to her are you telling me that there is no one in her life no one her mother her sister her best friend that wasn't told\nBut now when told doesn't go oh my gosh I remember yes it was that summer and all of a sudden you didn't want to go to any parties anymore would you go to a party if you experienced what she experienced would you want to be by yourself at a party\nWould you change fundamentally at parties\nEnough for your best friend to at least now be able to go I remember that you were really weird that summer\nThat didn't happen that didn't happen\nNobody remembers anything she doesn't remember the year that it happened and as the investigators pointed out she's changed this now four or five times\nWe can't help you you have to tell someone you have to tell the police we are not the country of the Nineteen forties we [laughter]\nI Want to make sure that nobody goes to jail that is innocent\nBut you know what that requires not social justice not believing the accuser but looking at the facts you say you're for prison reform\nAnd at the same time you will not look at facts you only want to do with the mob mentality you only want to do with what is politically correct and deliver social justice\nYou say you're against uh putting innocent people behind bars and that our justice system is so corrupt\nThat it is put black man behind bars because of white society look at what you're doing right now\nAnd if you were honest about the way you actually feel think of the the construct that is built by the left\nAll police are really bad people that are going to a throat innocent black people in jail or the white people are racist against black people how would how would let's say real racist cops and racist women or deal with an African American who they say has assaulted them in the past I\nThink of the standard you're creating black people have been victims of this in the past where they were a unfairly accused of crimes I mean you can go back to Emmett Till right like you can go back there's a lot of these things that have happened over the years you were asking for that standard to return\nHow are you going to react when a black man is is accused unfairly\nYou were asking for that standard to return how are you going to react when a black man is is accused unfairly about some assault they didn't commit are you going to believe the white woman then\nI I this standard they are creating is insane and I feel for the woman in the elevator you can tell she actually I don't know if it's about politics or not I don't know her story the one thing I Do know about her story is Brett Kavanaugh was responsible for it\nHe had no role in what happened to her no no no responsibility\nNone now the argument on the other side is we're only asking for five more days we're only asking for five more days well if everyone was quiet for five days\nThat would be something okay we've got five days to look at this we have a week have until next friday to look at it but that's not what they're doing they've now moved the goalposts ... they're using these seven days to come up with something new to move the goalpost she lied about you know how much he drank\nNo she ... oh my gosh\nRight there and now they're saying well yes you gave us the FBI investigation but it's not through enough it's not enough time the only thing here is there delay tactics and that how you can tell that this and I think we're up and I'll be honest enough to understand this\nIs Brett Kavanaugh let's just say politics fail him and flaking Collins and Murkowski bail and the the bill comes down and he gets voted down\nThere won't be a soul who gives a crap about this woman story\nThey will all go they will not even she will not get a phone call returned\n'cause you can still investigate this by the way there is no there's no statute of limitations on felony sexual assault in Maryland they could still go after this the second Kavanaugh is not in that seat they will forget about her and she will be a non story because they don't care about her story it has nothing to do that they're just trying to play this to try to get a pass the electorate\nNow here's the here's this the second point I Want to make 'em Republicans\n\nIf this fall through and the very next day you don't have a qualified candidate that your going to put through\nYou're out of your mind may I suggest right now that if Kavanaugh falls through you don't have the spine something comes up whatever there is one\nGuy that has already gone through all of the confirmation hearings one guy who is already at every FBI background check one guy that everybody in the Senate knows and that's Mike Lee\nIf Kavanaugh goes down in flames Monday morning or Saturday\nThe president should announce his next Supreme Court justice pick of my ... and you should vote on it next week because there's no need to delay he's already had all those FBI background checks and each senator knows exactly who he is\nHe's qualified jeeze clean\nAnd quick you could get that done long before the election if I hear the ... the Republicans have this fall through the whole we're prepared we weren't prepared for the I'm going to lose my mind\nSo that I Will bring up the story about what their plan is after oh geez what is their plan after a they have a quote NO PLAN votes\nSo that should go that completely\nOh geez what is their plan after a they have a quote NO PLAN both from\nThe ... bed completely we need to go through that set because you're right that's my ... my ... he they they know and what are they going to say they know him do we have more time to get to you know him yet you work with them every single day he'd be great to be great\nAll right my patriots supply from hurricanes earthquakes cyberwarfare every American should have a plan to get through an emergency a natural disaster just a power being out\nThis is more urgent than ever we've seen government response and repair to infrastructure can be a little slow now people want to say that it was racist about a a Puerto Rico I Will tell you the overwhelming factor on why Puerto Rico was left in the condition it was", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey
