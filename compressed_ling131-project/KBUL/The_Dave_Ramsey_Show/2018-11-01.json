James Madison is is looking at something\nDifferent he's not looking at the weather you came from Great Britain or not correct he's not talking about people who are coming in trying to drop off to be able to take stuff or or you know or bring the whole family in born in the colonies or were you born in Great Britain\nCorrect and they answered that two ways if you were born here you don't need naturalization however you also have to be born here to be president and that's what they were worried about they were worried about these English coming in at ... ... try this out for size they were worried about the English coming in\nAnd just saying hey I'm I'm I'm American I'm living here and I'm American\nSo I can vote because they knew that if all these English people came in they would change the country that's why they didn't want an a a a foreigner\nAs president as well you had to be\nProtected at that time from the English coming in and screwing up the country with a vote which is what we're dealing with now\nI I think I agree with that although he's saying if you were born here you are you\nDo have correct because it was a ... it was a different time and a different problem yet and I say like as much as I Love James Madison the founders I ... it's almost less important what they thought about this particular issue because it was an amendment to the constitution right we are talking about the fourteenth amendment\nYeah they do and that's why you have to separate James Madison 'cause that's not constitutional he didn't put that in the constitution\nWas that was put in under Lincoln and and so now go to that because that's a different argument as well\nUm so so this is now a Edward ... is president Lincoln's attorney general\n... so we're in a pretty this is again a few years right before they do the fourteenth amendment\nOr the eight incorporates the language and is a this is a from the article for National Review properly understood of codified ... attorney general based contemporary understanding this is what he says\nI'm quite clear in the opinion that children born in the United states of alien parents who have never been naturalized are native born citizens of the United states and of course do not require the formality of naturalization to entitled him to the rights and privileges of such citizenship\nIsn't there more that is the end of that quote\nI thought there was something else too about or maybe it was in James Madison that they had come in the proper way or something I I thought I heard that earlier today but the the the Abraham Lincoln thing\nIs just the same remember so way on the constitutional thing 'cause there wasn't a fourteenth amendment yet I Know I Know he's writing it this is this is the beginning of it so the first one is how do we know who are citizen is because it's\nAlmost all well it is at that point all immigrants except those who had come over and the Mayflower a or had their relatives come over before and so it was very small number who was mainly immigrants so how do you know who is an American well were you born here\nThat was it that was the question of who's an American at that time because it was\nMainly a you know people from England and they were worried about the English coming in so you're born here you're a citizen\nYou can serve you can vote starting to get a pretty serious German influx too yes serious German and they were free to buy that the the second thing is uh with with\nLincoln he's trying to solve a different problem he's trying to solve at that point the Democrat literally the Democratic party this is their first attempt before poll taxes\nAnd you know moving the polling place and all of the\nCrap that they did the first thing was oh well you know you're not okay you might be a you might be a citizen but\nYour kids to your kids weren't slaves so your kids aren't citizens he's truly are trying to say stop it stop it\nWe're talking about the slaves slaves are free their citizens and so are there children\nThat you have to look at the thirteenth fourteenth amendment for what he was talking about and what it was trying to do it was trying to say to the Democrats stop it these are human beings\nThey are citizens and it'd be fascinated here and these two sides talk this out because it's it they're both coming from the conservative perspective it's not like you know Chris Cuomo versus somebody you trust or at least they're both sides of the argument I think a really interesting I don't I mean because I think you're right but sometimes that is because that is definitely what they were intending right was slavery however ...\nThat is the also there's they're ... not unintended but intended consequences where you would you would absorb a larger group to make sure one group is is there is no way the intent\nIs that if you come here from Mexico central and South America and you have a baby and everybody who does that is now instead of ...
