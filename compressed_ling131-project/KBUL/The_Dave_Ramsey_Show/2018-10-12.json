able to agree on everything political but that were actually able to go to a movie theater and sit next to our neighbors in the dark and smile at a star wars movie but then when you go in and you've sort of been reading these things on\nLine and you've had people tell you that it now it's like liberal propaganda and that it's not the star wars you grew up with\nThen you can't even do that and

echoing those sentiments and then their actual fans are going out and engaging and Star Wars\nDiscourse but there's it's not really clear like who is genuine and who is not and who is coming to it as
