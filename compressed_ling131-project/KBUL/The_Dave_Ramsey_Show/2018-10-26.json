I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out in her bathrobe and fuzzy slippers with a cigarette hanging from the get the paper in the mail every day when she gets up whose home do they go to that they did have a Scranton ...\nBoth of them have private security course or sort service at\nThe ... they get older male you you have private security\nYou don't get your ...

didn't fact check their claim but that was what they were attempting to ah to pass off a sophistication I I've never built a bomb no one don't intend to in my life\nUm but it would you say it or that you would make it plastic to get past screening because we put a big metal pipe it's going to be more obvious right if you did it if you did it to get\nPast screening that's good but that shows\nThat you have no idea what you're even do you're not even but you're you're there you have a very low IQ or your uh or your ... you know a a a young kid that just thought it was funny uh I I don't even

were blaming Trump and mocking Trump yesterday before all of the bombs or even found your blaming it on him\nWithout CNN is there is really irresponsible his have gone over Ella edge they worked or target of this and when you're in the middle of it sometimes you don't make rational decisions you know that's no excuse for soccer but not for someone who's running a news organization that he wrote\nA there's a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of the continued attacks on the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand there was words matter that's far they have shown no comprehension of that\nThat is that I think it's a fair criticism at times and we made it um I don't really like everything that he says about the media but we have no evidence\nNo evidence at all the rhetoric or anything else fed into these bombings we have no idea\nWe have no idea who did them we have no idea what the motivation was yet I mean I think you could probably say there's a\nPolitical motive but that's a ... a political motive but that's all you could say you don't know it is such these bombs or so ridiculous that it was either done by somebody who is mentally inefficient or\nIt's somebody who didn't want the bombs to go off yeah the sticker the ISIS me right either done that clearly marks that as somebody from the right why would you put\nThat on there and why did none of them go off right I mean again you hope glad I'm Glad none of them went off by the way um\nBut it it seems to indicate someone who one of these things to be seen every single part of this that we\nJust talked about a no leads to that and and your in your in your point about the timer before it's like ... there's a reason why there's FedEx and details like that because the postal service is not an exact science\nThe right and Donald Trump for this look I don't we first of all you can't blame Donald Trump for the ... unless you think he actually was responsible does anyone think that he actually sent the bombs and brought them to George sources how\nWell no but I think of that might have been [laughter]\nUnless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions we know that but beyond that if you're going to you you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's an obvious incentive to make America feels that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs go off\nIt's certainly possible but they're acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault\nYou do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some skeptical eye\nYou not to say that you know\nThat that that if they exist since we're proving anything but you have to at least keep your mind open to the idea that there are enough jobs on both sides with crazy motivation in a intense time look what they did to freaking capping off with people saying he was a gang rape is to stop it here's here's the amazing thing\nDo you remember the time right after nine eleven for the first few years when something would be saying something would happen and we would hope\nThat it was somebody from the middle east you remember that ... where we didn't want it to be an American no matter which side they were on we didn't want that to happen now we just our dog piling on it for them\nIt's them whichever them if you ... you know helps your political position it's them\nWe we don't even consider anything else we don't even consider that modern oh maybe the Russians are involved maybe this is just\nA an outside influence you know a ... probably not now but we're not even considering it we have zero evidence of anything\nAnd everyone is the media is just condemning the right you have no evidence and I guarantee you if they find this guy and he is mentally disturbed and has no real\nAnd I guarantee you if they find this guy and he is mentally disturbed and has no real understanding of anything that he's doing or she's left you will not hear that\nThey will change the narrative immediately to well it is kind of thing happens it happens all the time and it could happen where it where it didn't go off and it could happen where it is a right wing extremist they'll just change the narrative it won't slow them down at all\nWhat did you think what was the part of this that's a that's a great getting your attention but well the first of all the fact that none of them have gone off yeah and the list of the people involved too is pretty stereotypical my weight I wing targets\n... have you know this bomber ... code name Wylie coyote [laughter] the only thing he didn't do is leave a plate of bird seed next to it and yeah I mean it's so obvious it's cartoonish to start with George Soros\nA and to include Robert Deniro and\nAll of these ... scene waters all of the typical plays it just to convene it's too much for it they don't go off\nAnd it's that perfect list of the people that the right really doesn't like\nThe president is it hard to ... it is it's a cartoon list that is\nNow it so it could ... don't don't get me wrong and I think you're probably saying there's two it could be it could be a left or right wing for it could be a right wing person we have no idea if it is a right wing person\nThey live in a cartoon world yeah they're ... they're ridiculous they they they're so in that that they can't make it but they don't even understand why you wouldn't use plastic for a pipe bomb that that much to CNN's chagrin when they said yesterday well shows the level of sophistication\nTested level ... here none of them went off and like there's no if you can't get one of the tend to go off what level of sophistication you have is right low and it's so cartoonish there's no level of sophistication I I like this\nCan you guys helped me figure out the needle CNN is attempting to thread here they write this is a from Brian filters newsletter cheese most of the recipients were prominent Democrats or as the ... or Washington Post simply put it I made incendiary rhetoric targets of Trump's words become targets of bombs\nThat not the same as blaming Trump weight like many\nPeople on TV on Wednesday I specifically said I wasn't blaming Trump for the crimes of a madman shut news industry executives have repeatedly warned that Trump's reckless attacks against the media are having real world consequences\nYet none of them Maxine Waters words are having any kind of consequences or they none of those no well you know\nAnd he learnt mobs these are not mob nutty or just people gathering together who are very passionate about what they believe it I don't\nEven want you to honor the word ma call it the more\nHow dare you even say ... is a problem and it was not a problem if reckless that we're talking about a bombing reckless attacks against the meteor having real world consequences what are the real world consequences you're talking about\nAre on the day of my farm showing up right in the middle of a paragraph about the bombing and how harsh rhetoric can lead to bombings here saying you're not blaming him but you're also pointing out that his words have real world consequences like I of course you're blaming him just come out it emitted just come out and it made it yeah\nListeners a op ed piece or the piece in slate I thought were they were on there oh it is beautiful I we got to get David Gardner on\nDavid learners a guy who I don't know invented the cursor or whatever uh and uh then sued apple

off the charts smart and wasn't he a victim of ... Unabomber first one I Believe correct very first one he's a futurist and he works at Yale not real popular Yale right now why because he says\nDonald Trump wasn't even my fifth choice but he's the president and the he's doing some good things and yeah he's doing some bad things too but you people have gone in sane\nAnd slates comes after him and does an interview and he just takes them up art here it is beautiful oh what a few that oh yeah we're gonna we'll share that in a few minutes also at the top of the hour I'm going to share an email that I got in\nYesterday it starts like this dear Mr Beck I live in Honduras I live on the island of wrote tan I had been watching and listening to you over the Internet for about five years I'm a native Honduran\nI've been following the caravan news here locally and then I watch your episodes on line\nAnd I have\nTo tell you and we'll continue that at the\nTop of the hour and a\nPath grade from ... unleashed a pre seeds this program on the blaze radio network and then also you can get him on line wherever you find your podcast\nHad gray and least it is worth a download moron tribute tomorrow\n... what's that what was the match up a Green Bay and whoever they are playing I forget that every week now because you're just going to be ... ... a kitten you on Monday Mornings bring the recap the best of moron tribute to this program [noise] Hi Willa yeah we'll look into that yeah\nOh my gosh look into that and do we want to do all the work and let you read the benefits\nYeah yeah yeah yeah [laughter]\nFor a trivia is tomorrow with ... at least thanks pat [laughter] ah alright [noise] my patriots apply\nWould like to ask you this question do you have jumper cables\nNo of course yeah why do you have jumper cables I'm such a conspiracy theorist you're such a worry wart you are such a small sometimes you're free\nYou might leave your light honor yo ... your battery dies\nA car can start a okay All right so you got to be a proper and have your you have your job our cable's prepping that just being smart\nOh this is this is honestly this is the argument\n... you feel weird 'cause you're preparing you know for something that could or couldn't happen I Can't remember the last time I had to jump my engine but I've had to help others jumped there's\nIt's just a good idea to be able to have jumper cables isn't it just being prepared this is why you buy emergency food when a crisis strikes you're ready to feed yourself and your family or help out others\nMy patriots supplies food storage that I have and you should have as well like two weeks food cat will get you started out two weeks that's breakfast lunch and dinner for two solid weeks you'll save sixty two bucks when you go to the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Billings", "day": "26"}
