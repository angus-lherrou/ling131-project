and read the things that we have written you're not surprised and you are way ahead of the game of what's going on with this caravan let's give you some additional information because it's it's\nIt's very important what Mike Pence said yesterday Mike Pence came out in the oval office and said this is being funded by Venezuela now the mainstream press they're not gonna do anything but ridicule that but this makes sense\nIt makes perfect sense and it does sound crazy when you first hear about it like if you're not if you don't know the back story here like Venezuela you know like oh here we go again you know and they can't afford anything yeah there's a blaming something in the country so we can get involved or whatever you know or yeah or the how do they even have the money to do this\nBut um it makes perfect sense when you hear when you put it into the context of the relationship to Honduras had with a both Venezuela in Cuba and makes absolutely perfect sent in particular\nThese this group that SARS started this caravan they are the group that is the fact the ousted Marxist a radical a president was ousted in Honduras\nRight and they are they still have a populist the avenue to go to like their goals are stated goal is still to restore that President back to the power and he was and they do have kind of a case there and an international case because he was democratically elected\nSo really if they can make such a firestorm such a big media uprising over this\nGet international support and backing and they could technically eventually make try and get this guy back in the power but that is their goal and that's where this started and I think that's where Honduras that this party these people in Honduras while they originally organized this but Venezuela also has other\nReasoning reasons to be behind this about if you I mean you think about it just was a few months ago\nUm Venezuelan President Maduro would just survive but an assassination attempt and he blamed the United states people in the United states for 'em or backing those people he blames United States for the economic or her basically ... all the things that are wrong with him if not socialism if the United states has fault that socialism is not working out the theory behind and\nUm so he blames us for all these things so if you arm adore oh you want to strike back they just tried to kill you and his words how do you do it when you can't compete with the United states in a conventional manner you have to go non conventional way and\nYou have to understand too that\nIt was the ousting of the Honduran presidency the guy this caravan support when he was ousted the first thing the new government did or one of the first things the new government did was get out of the ... agreement which was agreements of hey we're going to prop each other up\nSo as soon as Honduras pulled out a way from Venezuela that hurts them economically big time so he's got a double reason for doing this ...\nThis is huge and this is huge so you really need to look at it through that lens they have a gigantic political and future economic reasoning behind all this is a very big plan a you know in place to do all this\nI mentioned before that um Iran and both Syria were big time observers of this economic union\nAnd a lot of people have been focusing on what it would have ISIS gets into this uh you know to this group or whatever you mentioned the possibility of Cuban intelligence Venezuela intelligence was I think it's probably Ninety percent likely that they are part of this\nUh through a Iran Hezbollah\nHezbollah could be all in this uh care of it I I have no information on that note no intelligence behind it but because of all the actors because of everyone involved the because of the people that are are are still ... Venezuela Iran\nRight now that you could be a chasm below would be my ... if I'm In a U.S intelligence operative I'm looking for Hezbollah links you know inside the Caribbean and I guarantee you the U.S intelligence agencies are all over this I'm sure we've infiltrated this that's why when when the vice president the United states\nSays that oh the Honduran president told me this he's not reporting on here say like that would be here say unless they seriously have something behind it\nI fully think that he knows I think I heard your interview with a gun or having a yesterday yeah he do he knew as well he knew and of course that's something he would not come out and say oh Venezuela behind that when the governor of Texas is not going to say that but I Do think vice president Pence tipped his hand on that I really think that they're behind if not the question now is\nHow does this escalate you mentioned waves of attacks we already know there's a there's a Caribbean forming in El Salvador there's a camera and forming in Guatemala and who are they form who's forming them but I don't know the organizers yet but those are all they're all in the same border\nAll with Honduras so the same people that liberty and re foundation party look that up when you're looking at these things up and doing your own homework\nLiberty and re foundation party in Honduras I Would not be surprised if we if we hear more names in El Salvador in Guatemala forming means\nA Caribbean because the ah Honduras border was a shutdown pretty heavily they crack down on that border so they can't send more people on doors anymore so they'll probably go there those are their allies in El Salvador Guatemala are probably just forming them in their border countries\nAnd the press won't look into this in fact the press is downplaying this now and the reason why is because they know this is a nightmare for Democrats and the election this is an absolute nightmare\nThe build up to it what happens on the border may actually work to their advantage politically because you'll have the big bad Americans soldiers standing up\nBut the build up before the border they are saying this is a conspiracy we don't know where they're headed yes yes we do yes we do we know what their intent is to cross our border\nHow are they out who's taking care of the medical care young who's who is who is taking care of the food for seven thousand people the diapers ... we're all alone with the infant this sanitary conditions must be strong how are they sleeping how are they moving\nWith somebody 'cause I Want to help I Want to help I just I didn't\nKnow if ... Smith show where they were sleeping they're sleeping on the pavement and it's burning hot pavement the gaming on yeah and um\nSo where where are they getting the water because you can't take Seventy five hundred people into a small town\nYou know and and and go into the seven eleven and say hey we need that you know fourteen thousand bottles of water [laughter] you can't know no one for right now 'cause I'm a little Thursday we haven't we haven't had a drink and two hundred miles and take one for the road\nOne for the road for everybody and one drink now yeah I just need\nFourteen thousand bottles of water I'm sure the ... that they're stopping get probably has more to your out he bottles of water okay yeah so I'm sure it's they just stop it stuck east yeah OK along the way ... um\nYou keep saying something about a political stunt you keep talking you know there's the funding funding funding has like chain while they were here oh okay oh all these questions about where they get there they got them from a who organized or cause the care of\nAnd ... ...\nOr ... initially organized and in October force Facebook post he shared a graphic promoting a migrant march\nThe graphic told migrants in protesters together on October twelve at a bus station in San Pedro Sula one of the most violent cities in the world quote we don't leave because we want to violence and poverty chases us out Mm\nCalvin ... go as a sign these negative all these negative motivations so Len go ahead\nOr a Facebook post completely organic off Facebook post where he just wanted people to run away from violence that property that it it that's why well so proudly shining on during I eat a lot of these other nations I sang corrected thank you\nI stand corrected you know the the the Arab Spring at nothing to do with the coordination of the Muslim Brotherhood and groups like that that\nJust a Facebook post I stand corrected ... it's about time men gods eat was just a spontaneous group of people that had seen a Youtube video Youtube video and it just ... spontaneous Lee happened that's what happened right when people watch\nA poll that had seen a Youtube video Youtube video and it just spontaneously happen that's what happened right when people watch you write that he is generally speaking they riot generally speaking that's what you guys it's a riot starter yeah yes it is\nYes it is so I'm fights I'm Glad you're finally admitted\nI wind would Mike Pence said that Venezuela is behind you probably hasn't read this political article yeah well he's also a liar we know that for ... yes\nIn a longer among during and hatred and lives he's lying hate monger who mongers in many different places such as hate in life\nSo so so a bat yeah what do these guys make it to our border I think they do yeah yeah is Mexico gonna stop 'em well a way Greg Abbott said yesterday they would\nReally yeah yeah he was on where they will be stunned he thinks Mexico will stop that will stop them when is that going to happen I don't because I don't know I don't have my crystal ball or my connection to the Mexican president or ... article to tell you what's happening you know the longer have that right haven't yet\nThe locals in Mexico are saying it's the caravans grown to fourteen thousand people now and they continue to North but I'm\nHopeful bill there's two others the news that we've broken this morning there to other caravans that are forming behind this one\nWell because they've seen you know the seriousness of the countries along the way that they're just well no they're not going to stop so yeah [laughter] they continue to come and can you imagine if we allow these people all fall\nFourteen thousand or however many are there and then the Caribbean after and the one after that what does that say to future caravan\nNo you're over just how important it is over it's over California will be offers to collapse or yeah even if they\nAre or what the Democrats are saying they are they're just all downtrodden people who just want to come to America and find jobs well okay but are we going to get fourteen thousand at a time month after month after month after month\nThat's not going to work out well for us I I guess they think we can just accept an infinite number\nAll well into our country the good news is they're all good people yeah they are right except for the fact that all of them no no actually well would not according to the people in the care of him\nNot to hold it in a way to do what do they know\nRaul it's a good point not according to those in the caravan and yeah and they they talk to a migrant in care of and then found asked them\nAbout about the criminal element mhm listen\nTo him and those everywhere [noise]\nHis criminal thing here I mean it is oh
