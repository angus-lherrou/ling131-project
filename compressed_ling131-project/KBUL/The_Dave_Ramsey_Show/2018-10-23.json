reject the west and establish global Sheree a law\nThey exported this organization all over the middle east anti Semitism towards a Jews their biggest and most effective tool and harnessing the Arab rage Muslim Brotherhood they're the ones who invented modern day jihadism\nThey are the ones who inspired Osama bin Laden and the other founding members of al ... to\nDo any administration a member from the Obama administration\nYou cannot call them a largely secular organization when you read\nJust their motto Allah is our goal the profit our model look around our constitution jihad our plan and death for the sake of all of the ... of our wishes they are not primarily a secular organization the Muslim Brotherhood of the calls jihad the industry of death\nAnd they mean that in a good way in their own words to a nation that protects the industry of death\nAnd which knows how to die noble e God gives proud life in this world okay that doesn't sound secular doesn't sound like somebody we should be in bed with\nBut the Muslim Brotherhood ran up against a problem and that was one of them the kingdom of of Saudi Arabia\nBecause it was backed by the west any of these kingdoms in the

bad guys\nBut so is turkey and so was he\nEverybody here all that's Saudi progressive fighting for democracy\nNo no\nNo he was fighting for them\nThe Saudi progressive fighting for democracy no\nNo no no\nHe was fighting for the Muslim Brotherhood\nIn the Nineteen eighties and nineties he was one of the king's main allies he edited several Saudi newspapers which he was basically Winston Smith in Orwell's Nineteen eighty four sitting in the Saudi version of the ministry of truth ebbing editing out all thought crime\nMake sure that there was never anything hostile said about ... or the

that\n... because he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and they were at odds with the well hobbyists\n... show he was cast aside\nAnd that's when the western media fell in love with him an active member of the Muslim Brotherhood not us smear or conspiracy theory in his own words yes I joined the Muslim Brotherhood organization and I was not alone\nAnd quote\nHis Muslim Brotherhood friends in clerics were all in prison in Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring\nHe got out he came to the U.S\nHe established a political party while in exile called democracy for the Arab world now party\nThe

is that a smear campaign\nTo say that he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly was in his own words so why is that a smear campaign because I thought the Muslim Brotherhood was largely secular\nAsked people how much do you know about the caliphate how much do you know about the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood how much do you really know about what this man wrote this man wrote\nThat he ... it was a mistake to think that\nYou could have any kind of state in the middle east with out some form of Islam assists\n\nNow that's different remember then Islam and his ...
