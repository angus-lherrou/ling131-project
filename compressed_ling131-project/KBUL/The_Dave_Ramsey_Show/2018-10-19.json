the way who was who was leading that at the time ah or at least commenting publicly there are a lot on\nThat now we're hearing from the same media people that we should be jumping immediately to we absolutely know it happened and how can we haven't punish Saudi Arabia yet yeah and I think that that's been the transformation of of the news is that everything now is seen through a Trump prism\nAnd clearly the you know the Saudi Arabian explanations have been suspect there's no first of all they didn't know anything about it at first ... well he was gone and he left a we we don't know where he

Glenn\nSeventy Seventy easy came up with one quick thing on the Saudi Arabia situation yeah\nIs it possible for us just settle on a pronunciation of this man's [laughter] I Would I Would like to call a ... a conference of I I ever went on the all media mhm what are we supposed to call this guy because I heard Chris shaggy initially yeah I heard that one on CNN ... we're supposed to CNN\nAnd the bigger than the name of the first name and news right I mean this is the big yeah it's a big one right then\nI heard your show ... that could show are no cars could show me to show me yes because she'll\nBe the one that I think is I thought it was like the main\nThat's what I thought I thought that we've been hearing that name since the eighties with al ... who was a big arms dealer yeah and he was in the ... he was mentioned in the Iran Contra yeah hearings no this is the name has been I thought it was ... yeah that doesn't that's not a determining factor any more like if you\nCall it Copenhagen for five hundred years it just turns to Copenhagen one day and I just started saying Copenhagen they it's ...\nIt's guitar it's guitar nope it's cut her\nAnd that was good or for a while I was younger for a while yeah uh I don't know I'd like you I don't know how this happens Osama bin Laden than it was Osama bin Laden [laughter]\nIt was the al ... al ... al ... was may Q. U. I. D. A. and Q A E D a whole different spellings I don't understand it so I heard Kush Chris shot because shot the initially then could show ...\nUh and now on the way in today I heard in New York Times or person\nSay ... cars showed G oh you really a show gee\nIt's a whole new one and now we're like a week into the store and there's already three different products\nOr like a weekend of the story there's already three gentlemen pronunciations this guy's name ... can we settle on something\nI Want to call them Bob I'm fine with that you would have I mean what's his name Jamal I'm fine I'm Jamal Jamal was killed at the embassy we can all say it's it was ... and what does all know it's Jim all\n... ... or ... ... and then whatever the pronunciation is tomorrow but\nYou're right we got to get together on that because that drives me out of my mind there probably is irritating yeah it is [laughter] it is I I I never understood that Osama Osama thing how did that happen why why\nDid that happen because it's even less explode couple\nRight the here you have a situation where it's it's been name it's spelled the same but were pronouncing it different at least you can understand that\nOsama what to do something but they shouldn't be a letter [laughter] and he just said no no no no it's a new it's a you know the guy went from like mid range pick in kick ball to last pick I mean like ... when this happened years changing the ... the guy is dead\nAnd you know ... you know no one ever said you know Osama's wrong it's it should be Usama Osama why no no it just started and if people just started using it\nVery strange it is very strange uh and like some of it I I guess I understand like for example ah here we say the tiny little country that James Bond goes to the casinos Monaco right ... ... if you're over there they call it motorcycle\n... everyone calls it Morocco no I've never heard that I Will say she here's another one here we say Mazda for the car ... if you listen uh as as as a Canadian sports celebrity I Do quite often to Toronto blue jays games on the radio they seem as though\nIt's mad stuff Toronto that's ... really irritates me I wouldn't get us into that I Would say I mean would you be pissed off at the ... yeah they'll call us mass that were not asked us if\nWe are I've also noticed the jaguars are being called jak you what do you are on the commercial on a\nJaguar what it's like they like if you come up with a name on your\nOwn maybe you can describe to us what how how it's pronounced\nBut what is the word we already know and we're going to say you were a hundred years yeah stop it we it's an animal yes and they're not just a car it's an animal to write what he ever says jak you are [laughter]\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that yeah I think that's jak you are trying to seem refined\nRight like this like um there's something nothing a little snooty about the way they pronounce mhm er jaguars like as so that's that's that's stupid animal over they're ripping up my dog and listening Jackie water [laughter]\nSo weird I even get yourself so worked up about that I Know what I Hope happens every day is every day when she brings breakfast to them they ask her where\nDid this for money [laughter] they just torture her with an app for the rest of her life [laughter] and you can I can understand that you know sometimes\nI I think even you know like conservatives get made fun of when they do these types of things are like when you watch uh you know that there's a there's one cartoon the kids were watching at one point that was and it was just it was just like a nonstop commercial for recycling\nAnd it's like I Know it was a captain planet or whatever do well that that is an actual that one is actually a legitimate effort to change kids' minds about environmental is emitted yeah you know people who created it actually talked about that but I don't know what this one we might have been type of pig or something it's usually type of pick I like to pick a lot\nA and a pet but it was talking about you know recycling or something I don't know how important it wasn't looking in the recycling whatever like I don't have any\nPassion for cycling I think there's some there's some\nThere's some conflicting evidence as to what good does\nA there's been several studies that have shown not much not much if any clearly you work for all cola I apparently not know but uh yeah like I don't know I Do I really need a giant a commercial about environmental is among my kids programming\nI I feel like no no but I mean he also can get a little bit worked up about that stuff you know I mean you can get a little a little fired up with trying to\nFind the political messages and these things even if there is there I mean kids\nGrow up into you know adults that can think for themselves\nAnd you know you kinda have to at some point I realized that you're not going to be able to control every little bit of that you can just you can do your best and I guess with her values probably the most important thing is to point out I mean she's probably doing you know I'm very worried about\nUh you know she thinks Brett Kavanaugh's are everywhere and and at any point or they're going to be an assault going on and\nYou know what I mean maybe this is this is consistent with what she wants to pass along to me it's just it's a little ... it is and I remember when people were concerned conservatives were concerned mostly\nUh about some of these Disney movies because of the things that they put in the Disney movie like\nI'm In the is it the rescuers are the rescuers down under one of those uh there's a scene where the character is going down a street on I don't know some type of vehicle and there's a woman\nThe character is going down a street on I don't know some type of vehicle and there's a woman a on the ... in one of the buildings they passed that make it\nFor just a ... I remember hearing over that yeah yeah so conservatives who would talk about that and it would be oh whose job but you can't even see that that's a it's a ... you don't even know which there and then there was the lion king a scene where a\nSimba as as a grown lion\nHow to plop down on the side of a cliff and the dust shoots up informs the word sex\nIf you ... [laughter] I heard this yeah ever that but we were insane for talking about any of that yeah\nOh please that's nonsense but you're supposed to tell your kids are ... do you need to ask where is that apple is from why why do I need to eat the apple where the ...\nCentury she's saying that rape cultures happening yeah Disney yes and that's a terrifying message I was ... to send their children [laughter] five although we've we've had this before I mean the ... the one I always think about as Willie walk on the chocolate factory\nWhich is a movie I ... I mean I Love that movie but what happened at the scene where they're just going through the tunnel and in all of a sudden like a really quick like subliminal things you see like a chicken get its head cut off [laughter] like we want the hell is this in his children's movie it's terrifying that whole scene is terrifying\nI like I don't remember that the oh my God like they go through the tunnel and it's like really like psychedelic weird and like it's that I remember that being yeah well I live close to what's going on in there it's not good [laughter] I'm really sorry she gets his head cut off like this like a clear up\nOf this is why I'm bringing up and it can be think I don't know it's I think as opposed to the scene is supposed to set the like off putting a if it's supposed to give you an off putting feel like it's supposed to be like things are all everything's twisting around and like it's dimensions are almost changing and like all these strange things are happening you see like\nThe scary yeah what was the guy's name or with the with the ever left alas he wanted the everlasting job stopper and he kept harassing the poor kid in for it\nAnd then he worked for Willie won't get the ... I don't remember a cat I Wanna say squid word but that's ... [laughter] I got a lot of things messed up my mind and made out of his hat [laughter] and then he's going through and it's supposed to even that weird like you're almost dizzy feeling yeah and they flash like a bunch of really fast images and want to like like they just\nKind of get chickens head off in the ... very strange yeah so we've been tortured with is up for a long time and look how well we turned out the world's fine right everything's going really well I Can't\nSee how there'd be any downside [laughter] I I guess you can get to that point\nWhere your over your over parenting right oh definitely and that's certainly yeah it'd be the way\nUh you know that things are going now ... years um we recently started a letting our son ... cause I listen to Lenore Skenazy a lot she's been on the show before she started an organization called let grow and a ... a free range kids and basically hurt mission in life is and you\nMay have to do some things like you don't need to helicopter parent over them all the time she's famous for ah she lived in New York\nStill doesn't believe and she let her nine year old to go on the New York city subway system by himself\nAnd she was called the worst parents in America and Europe ... honestly my immediate reaction when I read that story initially was she's the worst parent in America right like your ... year old on the subway\nBy themselves like I Can't even imagine the amount of panic I Would have but then you you kind of ... I don't think I could do it either um would you step back and he said well wait a minute like George Washington was like I think he won the revolutionary war and eight years old or something like they need the\nOr are we supposed to be as kids are much more self sufficient you know I Know when I was a kid like we would leave the house and we would go play at a friend's house is that all the time to time will be gone the whole day yeah and that whole thing about us coming back\nAnd um you know you come back when it gets dark or when the streetlights come on and I think it's\n... we use that a lot of times to signify things were safer and better than what's not even true I grew up in the nineties this is like the eighties and nineties more the eighties but no I'm dangerous in America by far more dangerous than now there was a much ... I mean the crime rates were all hire\nA murders were higher kidnappings were higher everything was worse school shootings wherever that the rate of four times what they are now when I was in high school and I didn't have a minute of panic over a school shooting in my entire life\nAnd I think we get to the point where we are just gets so freaked out we recently had are are you know we have her son like walking walking our dog with a little chore and he's doing it by himself\nOr just up the street a little bit and back and I can tell you just that\nFreaks me out like ikea and everything in me not to walk to the end of my driveway and spy on him to make sure he's okay the entire time and I don't know why that is that certainly is and how it was when I was a kid yeah uh and I I I somehow live through it\nI think that's the the instinct there is to just make sure you're mentioning every little thing that you think could go wrong in their life so that if it that thing does go wrong you can't blame yourself\nYou know it's like it's almost selfish instinct where you're just like wow at least I told them I I remember telling my kid five hundred times not to go down a dark alleys and they went to a dark alley and well it's really sad but at least it's not my fault that's a that's not really healthy instinct for parents I I Do feel like that is that the basis of it because of course you don't want no one wants anything bad to happen to their kids\nBut it's additional to that like you don't want to be the person who let your kid walk down some of the street and were something terrible happened there was going to look at you and say what the hell are you doing allowing them to walk down that street why were you there yeah um so it's like a double whammy and\nI think that leads to a lot of that over parenting stuff and ... and I'm sure this is the boat she's in her ... across the bell right like she's trying to protect me look you're not going to ... you're not going to say anything to four year old reading Cinderella that's going to protect them from rape culture that's not going to occur\nYou're never you're never going to be able to solve this problem you believe is so prevalent ... by a story you tell them after ... reading Cinderella or watching it\nFor the Little Mermaid um or any of these uh Disney movies because they're already going to be a messed up from\nSimba falling down and blowing the word sex right to the year from the dust ah that's going to mess them up a lot of teen pregnancy is quite a lot on Tripoli Seventy Seventy easy Kay [noise]\nThis is Glenn Beck and talk more [noise]\nYou know that feeling when you just know you're experiencing a whole new level of excellence I have felt it a few times a first luxury car even my first iPhone\nYou're experiencing a game changer that is exactly the way I felt and you will feel the first time you sit in an ex chair I knew immediately the generic chair they suck and we spend so much time in those stupid chairs get a great chair\nAnd ex chair most of us spend more time in our office chair then in bed that's why the ex Jerry's so important ex chair now on sale for a hundred dollars off go to ... chair back dot com right now that's the letter acts chair\nSo important ex chair now on sale for a hundred dollars off go to ... chair Beck dot com right now that's the letter X share back dot com or call one eight for", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Billings", "day": "19"}
