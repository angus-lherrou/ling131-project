we didn't want to look at it if it was it's horrible that we've made good progress on that\nYes we have however we swung from one end all the way to the other with no middle ground show what I'm Upset about is that everyone believes this this doctor\nOkay just on her ... a testimony which wasn't even you know significant and uh they're they they just believe that because of the health they went through and to me I don't understand why they don't listen to the facts\nAnd this is one of the things are so disturbing about this the obviously the me too concept is really really important and very important like it it really is it could make a real difference and instead what it's turning into is\nHere's a tool for Democrats used to destroy people's lives which is an awful outcome or what a great outcome would be out of this in my opinion\nIs that going forward or people like Phyllis\nWould would be believed\nWould at least be taken seriously not paying you've taken seriously believe just they have the evidence taken seriously and and then and then would\nNot fear coming out because if you had a evidence and you had a real story to tell it would be believed correct\nAnd that's that's that is the outcome that I think rational Americans are looking for them they want this to and they think this is horrible but they don't want to go the other way this has to become um\nYou know the Phillies as you said you knew that the anger wasn't going to get you anywhere in life so you had to deal with it\nIf you deal with the is the situation um you have a chance to grow it is much better if the person who has done it to you has\nUm has ... it's a consequences or or has has you know admitted it at least or something it's hard when people don't apologize or don't admit it and they just get away with it is really really hard\nBut that sometimes what happens but by by moving on with your life\nYou're not trying to convict every man and that's what's happening right now there are these women who have suffered this and have not healed and so they want everybody to be believed because no one would believe there's\nAnd so they don't they don't you know that they don't know if it's true or not but nobody believed to me and this woman's gonna be railroaded what no your situation is not their situation\nAnd we have to base it on facts Phyllis thanks for your call hey Jay in

it's great and I kind of at my wife and I kind of have like ... points\nAnd I and it really hit me when I was listening yesterday is a social media outrage is what's driving this country more than anything like you say in the book you know\nTommy thirty six ... All right is and and it's got to the point where we just our life is so much happier by not engaging with politics on line yeah and part of that social media mob it it's it\nGot to the point where my wife and I just for like looking at each other oh my gosh\nCan't handle this and I I even took on more volunteer opportunities will help with youth basketball everything like that and and I feel so fulfilled now\nYou get did you end up social media or did you did you just cut down on it\n[noise] I've cut down on the uh outraged the absolute engaging with some family members\nThat were progressive where you could you couldn't even talk to them it's like beating your head\nAgainst a brick wall him was so frustrating I mean we don't even when we go to family dinners we don't even talk about politics and we're all you know a lot of us are constitutional conservatives but we don't talk about it because it's so bad right now\n... it's it is it's what's it this book is perfect it's perfect titles it's perfect for I think everybody should be reading it\nThanks a lot AJ appreciate I'm going to send you a copy of the book or do you want to book since you were listening to it yes autograph that's\nAll I was like a a a hard copy and God Bless\nGotta thank you very much screw it is a you know the the next step is once you have once you have calmly done this and you have backed up\nThe next step is to re engage with your relatives but on bigger principals don't talk to them about Kavanaugh because they'll immediately go to the talking points don't talk to them about that\nTalk to them about the bigger issues everything that we need our moon them is the declaration of independence and the bill of rights e pluribus unum I've spent a lot of time thinking okay so what what brings us together what is the uniting thing what can we all agree on\nWill not all of us but a grand\nGood to be able to agree on all men are created equal life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and the the the ten amendments to the constitution\nOkay let's start there that's what brought people here and that's what's being\nLost in the conversation we're arguing over parties and personalities that sound with Kavanaugh is really about it's not about did he do it or did he not do it if she lying as she telling the truth it is about\nAre you innocent until proven guilty do we presume innocence do we look for facts\nIs there a system in society outside of the legal standards where did the legal standards come from the legal standards came from a group of people in our founders and prior to that\nHere in America they came here and said you know what I can just be taken off the streets I can be destroyed if somebody just says hey I'm I'm I'm the king or I'm a I'm a lord or I'm a Duke and this person did that they're believed it I'm not no matter what\nThe evidence is that's not right I don't want that those are the big principles and those are the things that we need\nTo slowly start to re engage our loved ones with because that's where you find unity\nAnd so much of the media coverage right now is just trying to keep a justification to someone for destroying Kavanaugh's life ... it's like hey well we think that there's a chance of this because of this have you seen\nRonan Farrow lighting his credibility on fire over the past couple of weeks on the story yeah he first came out and said oh well none of the New York times none of the other major sources would run the story about the woman who said that Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself with a party and then Ronan Farrow who is built of all this credibility with real reporting on things like Harvey Weinstein\nOr comes out and people take it seriously 'cause it's him\nWhen you read the story you find out about two thirds the way through that they couldn't find anybody anybody who had any recollection of this and in fact the woman who even brought it forwards said she couldn't remember who it was she couldn't remember it was Brett Kavanaugh she just remembered it a couple of weeks ago but it was Brett Kavanaugh\nHow on earth when no one would print that and no one did right now that's in lumped into your multiple accusations\nThey followed up on it in one of the most amazing stories I've ever seen they said Ronan Farrow again a comes out and says we found a a witness to the story to the ... exposing themselves to college party when you read the story what you find out is a it was all here say\nThey don't have anyone who was there it was people who said they heard about it at the time so it was one person comes and says I have a witness I Know this person they they'll do about it at the time listen to this quote from the story\nIt's an incredible the the\nThe person who was in the story says he initially asked to remain anonymous because you hope to make contact first with a classmate who did the best of his recollection told him about the party and was an eyewitness to the incident so the source of this person come into New Yorker he I Want to talk to that person to confirm it\nHe said that he had not been able to get any response from that person despite multiple attempts to do so okay\nReally shady why would you put that in ... listen to the next sentence remember this article was printed\nThe New Yorker did reach the classmate and he said he had no memory of the incident oh my gosh\nI mean ... the ... they are so desperate to get this guy off the Supreme Court that they will do anything Ronan Farrow is Burt is lighting his career out of fire right now so you got to stop the here is the best\nThing Donald Trump has done during this whole thing she has allowed to the press without blocking it up ... speaking\nHas done during this whole thing he has allowed to the press without marking it up generally speaking he's been pretty good yeah without without tweeting stuff and and becoming the story himself he has allowed the press to prove", "year":
