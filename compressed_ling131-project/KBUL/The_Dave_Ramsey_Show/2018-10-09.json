rise to civil liability\nPersonally this is why I Believe anyone\nWho falsely accused and I do not necessarily include Ford I don't believe there's enough evidence to say that she did it but I also don't think there's enough evidence\nThat she wasn't telling of is saying an event that she thought Brett Kavanaugh was involved in\nHowever the gang rape and the boating or the or boating weekends from hell those people should be investigated\nMe I'd probably primarily the person who made an accusation and then later recanted it on Twitter um you know here's someone who actually admitted that
