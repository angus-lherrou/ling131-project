don't know it's all coming from turkey\nAnd turkey is motivated to destroy Saudi Arabia possibly to destroy the west if you want to look at that they're looking to build a caliphate but they also may be playing another game to get closer to the United states\nI mean there's an argument to be made a they've released is a pastor recently and they want to\nMaybe send the signal hey these guys you're dealing with in Saudi Arabia their their ... should be dealing with ... sauce arms you should be working with us more closely and they're trying to negotiate themselves to the United states at at the expense more specifically at the expense of Saudi Arabia or because they they don't like that the closeness of that relationship\nOr there's an argument to be made there I mean I think a lot of this is\nYou have to take when you have to countries that really disagree with each other and don't like each other you have to take the reports coming out of turkey with some level of a grain of SALT I mean you have to we need more evident than they are we there was a tape if there is a tape\nThat at least are we don't need to hear it necessarily publicly but at least our intelligence sources maybe a a high level reporter uh somewhere with some credibility needs to hear them and confirmed that they exist because we've heard a lot of details about what is on the state but we ever that obviously if I were here to one\nI Would not released the tape if I had it I wouldn't release it yet\nI Would let Saudi Arabia play this all out his remember last week it was no this is crazy this conspiracy that yeah nuts ... now it seems that they are a saying yeah those things happen so now let's see Saudi Arabia\nAgain we still we that's all sources to when I Know I Do not know him out and say I know this was a rope thing that went wrong or an interrogation that went wrong there are reports through CNN\nThat they're going to say that right but they haven't actually set it and we don't know where that is coming from yet yeah I Will say that there's no there's no need for us to rush to judgment\nUh to judgment here and then I Know like people are bashing Trump because he kind of said oh well it's a\nYou know it's it's it's a guilty until proven innocent well first of all we should get evidence there is there any everything over international relations with the past Twenty years and we should make sure we have these things right yes there is also it's not an imminent it's not like okay it's weapons of mass destruction for example to use one that works in this context\nWhere where we could be facing an imminent threat\nOf ... you know a bomb going off in a place that kills a lot of people that you know we may be able to stop this is ... if this is this is a prosecution of a crime right in our eyes and if if they have actually killed this person they need to be held responsible\nHowever we don't need to make that decision tomorrow no we need to make sure that we get it right we need to actually figure out all the dynamics going on just because this is a media feed 'em today does not mean we need to make a decision today are we actually take it seriously and those are the facts only a media feed 'em because it involved a reporter\n... yeah and and and the stories so traumatic as you point out what was it wasn't at first Hitchcock movie rather window right we're window I mean ... you know it's such a dramatic\nHollywood type crazy twenty four ah you know Jack Ryan story that you you wonder I mean it it's capturing our attention which is ... is okay it's just that we have to make sure we're looking at where the stuff is coming from right now it's coming from people with incentive to make Saudi Arabia look bad my guess is\nBecause I think Saudi Arabia they're not our friends they've done a lot of really bad things\nI'm this prince ... I mean getting remember this prince took his own you know family members other princes hostage in a hotel and is likely a stole tons of their wealth\nIncluding planes and these specific planes are the ones accused of flying in and taking the remains out in suitcases so these are the planes the prince confiscated from other family members [laughter] I mean as he held them you know and they you know Ritz Carlton prison\nSo it's a legitimate worry that this guy is an absolute Kim Jong own style maniac\nAnd if that's happening with Saudi Arabia it's a lot worse than it is happening in you know in North Korea and a lot of ways I mean we already have a relationship with Saudi Arabia\nThey're very influential in that region we know they do this but we know this stuff goes on in this region already and we deal with all these countries that that do it right but we just have to make sure that there's no reason to feel pressure\nTo not go through and intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation\nAnd you better take this tape seriously because if I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kinda finagle around and tell them to everybody down\nAnd then when everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I read the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you do you do the tape because it's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're not friends of ours they are not friends of ours they are selling us crap that quite honestly I live in Texas we don't need it we don't need it\nOpen up the fields here in Texas start pumping again and bring the price of oil down and let's get off of Saudi Arabia we don't need it [noise]\nThe NATO identify as Hispanic yeah trying to be more Hispanic and he he crazy he\nAlso went so far as back in twenty twelve try he tried to ah joined the Hispanic caucus in the Congress\nAnd you know [laughter] she didn't know he did yeah he tried to get into the Hispanic caucus 'cause some of the El Paso residents his district is Seventy seven percent Hispanic\nSo some of the residents were upset that Sylvester race was no longer going to be in the pretty powerful Hispanic ... so he tried but joined it they're like Mm no the nicknames not enough [laughter]\nYeah I mean if we go through the intersection analogy of a Beto uh nobody's intersecting him no nobody's intersecting him he is still at the top of the hierarchy in the patriarchy pyramid\nI think one of my favorite parts of the debate last night was when Beto tried to make this case that every decision Ted Cruz makes is about money so like he supports the second amendment and that's because of the n._r._a. and he supports the call\nAnd it's like you're you've brought in thirty eight million dollars of nations right we're out raising cruised by what for two one five to one\nAnd of course as Cruz pointed out he's had plenty of special interest money come in and it just coming in through other names that's coming in through a pack that he quote unquote doesn't control which we all know how that game goes\nI mean the idea that you're going to come out and making ... an argument about how Ted Cruz is about money when the entire story arc of Beto is based on the fact that he can raise money well he's not competitive in this race he he has never come up behind anything yeah she is only in the\nRace to run for twenty twenty\nI bet if he loses how is he has he run for tried I don't know but there's still talking about it other than the euro was talking about how he is he is the he's there John F. Kennedy ... Democrat hope right now\nAnd other may I say the great white hope yeah\nIs that he's there John F. Kennedy ... Democrat hope\nRight now and other may I say the great white hope\nYeah yeah yeah it's a it's been fascinating to watch this um\nHe also tried to a pin head up against Donald Trump says they have the big rally coming up what his next\nWednesday or Thursday in Houston\nAnd by calling him lying dead ... like Trump did and he said that's why the president called him lying dead and it's why his nickname stuck because it's true\nWhich is never it's never stuck in it for never stuck it's never been true and what prompted him to say that about a battle was that he had voted for Bill that would raise the price of oil twenty four cents a gallon to put a ten dollar surcharge on every barrel of oil\nWhich would raise the price about twenty four cents parents have gas the pressure yeah yes\nSo a federal said that was untrue but he voted\nAgainst the bill that would have stopped that bill so it really is true that he did he put in the book and they can both kind of claim that they have the truth on their side in that particular case\nUm but it was interesting to me because the CNN fact checked Beto on some things that he's been lying about during the campaign one being that his mother is a lifelong\nRepublican loves this life long Republican right now you know because he's so wonderful and use so uniting yeah she's going to vote for him for the first time or the first time he's a life that in law and that first of all your mom is good for you while\n[laughter] water ...\nWow you got your mom right\nAnd then it helped me out because I think see an end even looked into this why sure did yeah yeah I voted for\nA hardcore Republican named uh Brock Obama in two thousand eight primary Obama yeah yeah\nNow here very very ... [laughter] okay so here's the interesting thing I Love this part of the expos aid from CNN\nAnd she can't remember who who she voted for twenty six point he remembered ten years ago but not to [laughter]\nWe're really you don't know who you voted for you know an order for Hillary and just didn't want to say it didn't want to say it\nShe couldn't if she voted for it if she voted for Trump it wouldn't work to\nHis advantage yeah\nShe was she was there so it was part of the Trump saying yeah you know she wanted to change the water as they would have worked right oh but you can't go to that she voted for Obama in a way this lifelong Republican and then she can't remember in sixteen\nThe other interesting aspect is that this lifelong Republican has voted in every single Democratic primary in Texas since two thousand [laughter]\n\nAt all I have even went so far is donating money to build bombs [laughter] I I Love\nThe federalist on this to ah I I I don't know I Know a lot about better but at the same time I don't know much about Senator Kennedy's Josh Hawley who is thirty eight years old meaning you know around eight years younger than rising star Beto the attorney general Missouri and the Republican nominee for the U.S Senate\nWhen I Do know is that highly is slightly leading McCaskill a two time incumbent independent ... average pull in a race that could decide which party controls the Senate O'Rourke who's up against Ted Cruz an incumbent his down seven points and falling it wouldn't be completely surprising if cruise ends up winning Texas by nearly the same margin he did in two thousand twelve guys\nIncumbent his down seven points and falling it wouldn't be completely surprising if cruise ends up winning Texas by nearly the same margin he did in two thousand twelve as well as with Holly I didn't know much about Arizona's geo presented a nominee Martha McSally either I'm probably not alone she didn't get to keep its with\nStephen ...
