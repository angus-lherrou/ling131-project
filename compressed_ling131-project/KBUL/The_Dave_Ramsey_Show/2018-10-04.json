uh put on hold and uh we get his address she didn't even among now we didn't live mock he all he did play the audio real quick as we go into the bottom the are\nThis is Donald Trump yesterday mocking or just stating the facts\nSo he wasn't mocking he was stating the facts of the trial or the or the hearing\nAnd a A N\nCondensing the ridiculous miss of the accusers claim\nWe must stop using the word victim\nThey are accusers they may end up being a victim that we can call them but if we're going to presume innocence and I know this is an old fashioned idea if you're going to presume innocence you must presume innocence which means this is the accuser your honor\nThis is not the victim because one she's a victim\nWhat happens well we're supposed to believe could you look up the word believe [noise] uh yes I I tend we are now being taught believe the victim believe okay ah two definitions of the word belief mhm definition number one except something as true\nFeels shore of the truth of okay just your or something is true so people now are saying believe the victim which is translating\nFeel sure that this person has been harmed or injured\nIn a in an event of some sort okay and end up in this area and his response ... yes okay so you are being told when someone says something I have to believe and\nAssume that we give me the definition again except something is true I have to accept this as true fields sure and feel sure that it's true that this person has been harmed or went through an act caused by this person\nWow that's a that's quite a statement that doesn't seem logic\nEnact caused by this person wow that's a that's quite a statement\nThat doesn't seem logical at all\nBut should only happen after ... ... you know that was beyond a reasonable doubt write like that standard as there what's the second version of believe um hold something as an opinion\n... sink or suppose\nThat seems like the one they're applying yes they're just trying to make it seem like I Believe you I'm sure the truth when in reality it's just their opinion there supposing it's true mhm they think it's true\nNow do you want to be judged or have your dad your brother your\nSon your sister your mother your friend have so world assume that something is true because someone stated it with out evidence the answer is no\nBut we are being taught the next generation is being taught to believe\nThe victim here's the thing when you present evidence and I see preponderance of evidence I Will believe the victim\nNow that's not even through court of law I just want a preponderance of evidence I Want to see it now you'll notice that last week it was looking pretty dicey for Kavanaugh\nThis week it looks like there's been some things that the press is reporting on some people coming to the table saying okay I flew with her in a small plane in Hawaii and a small plane a single engine plane it only had one exit it was cramped\nIt was just us she didn't have a fear of flying she didn't have a ... ... we went out to go circle the volcano\nWhat are you talking about a fear of flying she didn't have a fear of flying\nOr people coming out now saying the reason why she had the second door I was there\nYou all you have to do is go look at the permits she was building an office in her house it wasn't for escape it was because she was having clients come to that door and not to the front door\nI have two front doors because I'm afraid not according to the permits not according to why wait you put a front door because you were afraid why did you put the office there what'd you put the semi Asher him there\nOf all things would you want to be random clients coming over your house all the time when I Want to separate that from your business as much as possible\nK. so I don't know what's true I don't know it's true but I certainly do not supposed to believe her I don't think she's I don't know if she's a victim or not I don't know she may be a victim but he may not be the perpetrator\nRight I mean ... the only person who should be calling her a victim is herself if she let let's just say this did happen to her\nShe can fairly call herself a victim because she knows that happened to her if if it's true right but even if it's true none of us should be calling or a victim at this point\nVictimhood from society identifying you as a victim is when other people have some confirmation of the trial going through there are enough information to prove that there is one\nProven victim between the two of them right now one proven victim\nThat is Brett Kavanaugh who now can't teach up at Harvard because all of the graduate students are saying we're not having a rapist to teach who can't you can't build a coaches basketball games anymore because they can have a rapist ... he is now a victim\nNow that I've noticed assumes that he's innocent um no no no wait wait wait negative ... a victim even if he's guilty he's a very dim of mob justice right because they have not perfectly correct he's a victim of mob justice\nIs he is not rightfully victim\nThis point it sure doesn't look like it this is mob justice so far um she also is a victim she's a victim of the Democratic party and leadership she has been victimized she has been dragged out when she said she didn't want to be dragged out\nShe was lied to when they when the Republicans said we'll go out and meet with you you don't have to fly they didn't tell her that\nShe's a victim by the Democratic party and they don't care\nThey do not care that is the real tragedy of this to people's lives are for ever changed one if she is making this up\nIts on her\nAnd quite fun frankly so it was the victim mode of him it's on her\n\nLook at what's happened for political purposes only and if you think the Democrats\nAnd I think there are people who vote Democrat I think there are people who vote for the Republican I think there are people who vote\nFor Kavanaugh actually feel bad for Christine forward I think they actually feel bad for because they don't know she may be something happened I was willing to say last week that I think something happened and I don't know\nHow it is becoming less and less clear to me that even something happened because of all of the other testimony now that is coming out but saying no I I was ... her boyfriend for ten years nine years none of this none of this happened\nI I don't know\nRight away and I frankly do not believe her by either one of those definitions I don't suppose it and I don't know it's true I'm now look I could be wrong on this but she had ... not ... it's like you know it can be a hundred percent sure that just didn't occur we weren't there but that's why we have a system to try to figure out those situations and were never there for a crime okay for almost never there for them\nSo you'll notice that you are presumed innocent look up two words assume and presume\nIn our standard you are presumed innocent until proven guilty you're not assumed you are presumed what's the difference presume is usually used when you suppose something based on probability\nSo the odds are based on what we know she doesn't know the house she doesn't know the time she doesn't know the months you know nobody here\nThe people that she said here they'll testify that they were there ... all of them disagree all of them say I don't have any recollection of this at all so she has no witnesses\nShe ... the the documents from her doctor conflict with her report she has changed the time four times in the last four month or two months so and that is sketchy because it it appears as though she kept moving closer because Brett Kavanaugh would have been out of state\nIf it would have been where she originally claimed mhm so all of those\nChanges so what's the preponderance of evidence\nWhat are the odds based on the evidence the odds are he didn't do it that's the presumption of innocence what is assumed innocence assume is used when you suppose something without any evidence\nSo no one is asking you to assume he's innocent we're asking you to look at the facts and then play the odds based on those facts what are the odds that she has it right\nSo let's stop using the word victim\nWhat are the odds that she has it right\nSo let's stop using the word victim and let's stop saying we're going to believe every victim we're not we're going to take seriously the accusation from the accuser", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Billings", "day": "04"}
