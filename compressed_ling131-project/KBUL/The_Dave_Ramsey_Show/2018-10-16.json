[noise]\nIt's actually really kind of an exciting time because labels are worthless Thomas\nPaine road heaven knows the proper priced too attached to something so celestial is freedom it's true every single generation I think except for the last the boomers had to earn and renew their freedom\nThey didn't buy or sell the label the greatest generation that that that generation didn't have it wasn't them who came up with that title [noise] he was actually the boomers\nTheir children at the time there weren't labels like we have now for every you know every subset of every generation people saw themselves as people and Americans they saw a crisis not as anybody's fault but rather\nOh crap their turn to stand and do the right thing is what they did with their crisis that made others years later bestow upon them the title the greatest generation well I don't know if you noticed this\nBut ah we're living in a time of great crisis in up people and I don't think it's going to India and be much different or a smaller scale and the great struggles of the past\nAnd in that struggle all of the labels that we think we have now will fall away all of those that have been bought will become worthless and every new label for each of us will be purchased with blood sweat tears or actual courage\nAnd what we face in the end\nIs not going to be smaller than what many of our grandparents or great grandparents faced in the world wars it's not going to be any less frightening than the global economic unrest of the Nineteen thirties but it's not going to be greater either it's just going to be hours\nAnd just like the generations gone by it will be our choice whether or not we survive I think this is a blessing the boomers never got to see who they\nOur choice whether or not we survive I think this is a blessing\nThe boomers never got to see who they really were\nThe boomers feast it off the crisis of their parents they never really had to choose for themselves\nLike the greatest generation did life or death freedom or slavery they never had to push themselves as a group beyond what humans thought was even possible to achieve something as valuable or as celestial as freedom\n\nOf the crisis that we're now beginning to see is a blessing it's a blessing our parents never received each of us it's going to have to choose we're gonna have to pick between black and white slavery or freedom good or evil life and death the choices are going to be that clear\n\nWe will all know in the years to come who we really are\nIf we choose carefully who we really are\nOtherwise we will be painfully aware of who we simply allowed ourselves to become\n\nWe can become through this struggle exactly who we were born to be our best and highest self\n\nIf each of us were honest and we began to see the struggle in the proper like we did Mitt that\nIt's the softness of our foundations that have caused all these troubles it's are wanting an easier life not making the hard choices not having to say no not having to say yes\nBut Brock Obama nor Donald Trump or the problem or the solution there symptom look around you\nAre not the enemy no matter who they voted for\nAnd if you're not there yet or your neighbors not there yet\nAsked them to ponder this\nWho and your family came here I don't care if it was three months ago or three centuries ago why did they come here\nThey came here to make a better life\nFrom a country that would not allow them to follow their dream for one reason or another from a country that that didn't value hard work\nTo a country that didn't value hard work and allowed you to keep what you built so you could live better than you did before or you could have a better life than your parents or your grandparents you could afford a better life for your children so they could achieve even more than you did\nThat have that opportunity is not coming because we have just to bless land because\nWe have all kinds of climate and you know Great Plains and mountains and and shoreline it's not that\n\nDoesn't even come from the people because quite frankly sometimes people suck it came from our mission statement it\nCame from the American thesis that all men are created equal in endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among them life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and while that mission statement was and always will be aspirational\nAs it's never been fully achieved\nIt has done great good even in its\nIn its worst interpretation it is done great good\n\nIt shaped and given the best chance to succeed when it's protected by the guard rails of the constitution and the bill of rights people came here because of our laws which come from the American ceases that's what created the modern world\nIt is indeed why people still die in the middle of the night on the desert just trying to get to this side of the border\n\nAnd I ask you went on his question\nIs it really that much of a stretch to believe that you and I are not alone in our ... out of our doctors\n\nTo really it's that hard to believe that our neighbor who knows how sick we all are really wants everyone who disagrees with their doctor to die\nIs it possible that our neighbors have\nSchnur as we have an hours but we haven't talked about that\n\nIs it really that much of a stretch to think that if we stop spending all of our time looking at what's wrong with America or what's wrong with them we might be able to see and search for the things that are right\nWith America and good about our neighbors\n\nPerhaps were not as sick as all the doctors tell us are perhaps our doctors our\nPoliticians that are parties are more akin to bad crooked chiropractors that you've gone to and have done more damage to your spine than good and will continue to bilk us out of every single dime week after week until we finally stand up and saying you know what no or we're broke\nAnd I understand why we haven't wanted to listen because most likely our friends have all said don't go down that road\nOur family matters that don't don't don't go to him and then you really believe that new font and now you're sitting here and you realize geez they're right and I don't want to be wrong I don't want to tell them that they were right\nThen again perhaps we are beyond help and we only have ... months to live\nBut if it is that way I don't know about you but if we're going down I Want to go down with my friends in my family around me and all of them all of them\nThose who told me not to listen to my doctor or the one I angrily chased away because I just knew they were wrong I Want all of them by my bedside\n\nI think we should spend some time especially when we look at what's happening in Portland in and realize it's really easy to jump on the bandwagon and light fun\nIt's really hard to put fires out it's easy to lose friends and family and chase them away it's a lot harder to bring them back\n\nToday there are four stories in the news that talk about our founding documents and our structure of our country our Constitution's say they all failed well ... no not really no they were just forgotten our founding documents really are only an idea that's it I think a really good idea\nThat says yeah we should all be able to choose who we want to be you know build our own life charter own course\nAnd be left alone if we want to be left alone or be you're right on top of each other and we want to but whatever we choose we can live our life with dignity and security\nThat's a pretty damn good idea\nBut that idea has been failed\nIt just that nobody really remembers it or believes in it anymore\nI still do\nAnd I think you do and I will bet you that your neighbor does as well\nI'm not a doctor well actually I Am I'm a doctor if humanity's which means I can treat any anything in the human body so listen to me here I'm I'm a doctor I think our illnesses all in our heads\n\nI think we've been convinced by those who suffer from some sort of societal Munch housing by proxy\nWere fatally ill and will only survive because of them and I have to tell you\nSocietal Munch housing by proxy then were fatally ill and will only survive because of them\nAnd I have to tell you that's why they need us to be sick and I don't know about you but I've had enough time in bed we're not as sick as they tell us\nThey've convinced that they've filled in the line for us because we never had to fight for it we never had to fight for what that blank is as a country we say I am what worthless racist over you know\nWe as a country we are a powerful force of good\n\nWe are people who make mistakes but learn from them we is that people are always looking at a better tomorrow not a dusty\nBroken passed we came\nHere for a reason and one of the reasons is we wanted to leave the past in the past we wanted to charge a new course\n\nIf we choose to see things the way they are and couple that with who we always have ... they strive to be\nOur best selves better not not better than the neighbor just better than you were yesterday can you just be slightly better than you worry yesterday not perfect not like him not like her stop comparing yourself\nCan we be better than we were yesterday if we can do that and see each other in the best lights put our past in the past\nAnd our strife and are coming crisis in the right right like down the road down the road after we've done all of this hard work some other generation that will come along we look back and name and give a label\nTo us\nI Believe that label is going to be good I Believe that label could be great\nBut one thing is for sure it will not be the one we choose it will be the label we have er into\n[laughter]\nSponsored this half hour is simply safe [noise] simply safe you know what I Love it simply safe is the craftsmanship [noise] have you seen their cameras to\nEr yeah I mean they they spend a lot of having those I remember them saying they were going to come out with them and then delaying them and making sure that they had the right\nRight and I'm like why are delaying they said can't get the cover right first they didn't have a
