really good friends I Love Henry\nI Love that book too\nAnd one of the things I'd grass from reading that book and other books\nIs this there is a difference between forgiveness and reconciliation\nThose of us that are wise in emotional maturity spiritual maturity\nAnd those of us that are Christians are called to forgive when you forgive you set yourself free\nFrom the bondage of the fence you're offended and when you forgive when you're a victim and you forgive you're not setting the victimize or free you're setting you yourself free\nYou can forgive someone and not be reconciled to them\nIn lady called a minute ago and was trying to figure out how should she reconnect with a brother in law she's having trouble reconnecting or brother in law after he had affairs and everything else and he supposedly come clean for the last two years\nHis wife has forgiven him and taking him back and been reconciled to him but\nNot the sister in law she didn't wanna be around it so here's the question at what point\nFor someone's misdeeds do you forgive them and then at what point are you reconciled to them they're different\nGuy\nSomeone rapes you what a horrible\nGrotesque violent unbelievably violent crime I Can't imagine can't imagine going to say something like that but to not forgive\nThem of eventually as you begin to heal from your emotional scars\nIs to not set yourself free from that very difficult to do I'm not saying it's easy but when you when you do forgive them you shut them free but you would not be reconciled ever to someone who raped ... meaning you wouldn't go on a date with him you know someone steals your wallet\n\nYou can forgive them but you're not gonna you know leave your wallet with them later your new wallet for them to watch over your money you wouldn't be reconciled with them probably ever in that situation one of the case of that young woman she was not personally wrong\nHer you know the guy's wife issue was wrong right and uh her sister in law was wrong and\nBrother in law however I don't know how it worked his brother in law but anyway as is letting it I guess her husband's family as a way I understood it but anyway the the ...\nHer brother in law however I don't know how it worked out his brother in law but anyway as it was ... I guess her husband's family is well understood it but anyway the the lady that the the wife is who was wrong to she forgave animals reconciled to the husband as he supposedly just putting his life back together I don't I mean everybody's life back together I don't know the guy\nYou don't know the guy well once you knew that you can always do it well you know people that I haven't done it can always do it\nYou know any one of you listening is capable of adulterers affairs\n\nEveryone's capable of that and if you think you're not capable of it you're just about to have one I mean really that's just ridiculous so at what point do you forgive someone when they've done something wrong at a distance\nLike that\nI can forgive him and you know I Hope he's turned it around and I'm not going to sit around and ring my hands and be mad at him and worried about him\nI Hope we turned it around I Hope he doesn't hurt her again and his wife\nI'm I can I can do that now at what point am I going to trust this guy again that's what reconciliation is at what point am I going to trust that his conversion his turnaround Israel\nSee we run into this all the time with their coaching because one spouse lies to the other one about money what we call financial infidelity\nYour husband your wife lied to you and ran up a bunch of credit cards and you didn't even know it it's hard to trust them again after that\nMap you're going to stay married you're pretty well instantaneously gonna have to sit down and go okay I forgive you but I'm not necessarily going to be reconciled to you financially\nI'm a I'm going to watch over your shoulder on everything that's going on or we have a couple of come in and the guy is a ... is a you know he he's a been found to be a gambling addict\nWhich happens like every week\n\nFootball betting is destroying families finance us on be livable so he comes in he discovered she's discovered he's a abetting\nAddict an online betting addict the gambling addict and now he's gotten treatment he's in gamblers anonymous any seeing his pastor and he's seeing a a counselor and he's doing everything he supposed to do does that mean she just turns over the checkbook to him and let him go run havoc again no\nNo it's a matter of fact we recommend that when someone's recovering from an addiction like that that that they not have control and they don't have any access to money\nFor a while until trust us rebuild over time but ten years later ... should be rebuilt ten months later it should be better than it is now two years later or should we better than that it should per aggressively rebuild trust and so if ten years later you you're still or you know\nYou have not bet on a football game again you've not lost any money gambling again or you trustworthy at that point yeah as much as anybody else's and so we're not going to treat you like you have no ability to handle money the rest of your life but for the short term yeah we're taking all access to money away from you till you prove that you can have a little bit\nAbsolutely but then gradually trust is rebuilt and over time it's rebuilt\nIf you cannot when someone has\nOn something like we're talking about here has ... has not when when someone has demonstrated over an extended\nPeriod of time that they're not entering into the negative behavior and you can't forgive them in you\nThat they're not entering into the negative behavior and you can't forgive them and you can't begin to trust them in that area then it starts to be on you\nAnd two years clean if the guy's clean from his double life adult for survivors or whatever he was doing porn addiction whatever it was sound like it was all about\nTwo years is a long time you should be some level of trust rebuilt assuming it's all real now if there's indicators is not real\nBut they're still looks like he's sneaking around if he's still got behaviors that make everybody question whether there's a real then that's different but I'm assuming this guy straight and if he's great for two years than\nYou know it starts to be your problem if you can't begin to trust at that point especially given that his wife already which she might just be in a neighbor she might be\nShe might be ... and that could be what's going on [noise]\nCould be that he's cleaned up his life and you're just suffered you can't forgive\nThe that's the difference there's a difference in forgiveness and reconciliation they generally happen at different times [noise] generally forgiveness should come faster than reconciliation\nPet a dog and it provides may\nWhen I got to be reconciled whether\nThis is the Ramsey [noise]\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance was not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide\nFor their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are in your baby steps it's a necessity\nOne where that'll that'll breach route their way to go\nLive I'm preaching and a couple of weeks after an eye on

decisions and because of that you're going to suffer and we're going to suffer and that's the only way we're going to get out of it and we got to make make that decision and so we made the decision that you know you either got to take\nThe pain of discipline or you've got to take the pain of regret and we had to pay a regret for so many years and we said we're done with that and we want the pain and discipline\nAnd so we had to tell her kids um had to tell my son were not doing basketball training anymore so we've got to who found in the backyard lets me and you go back to her and all of them will train together right\nAnd that was hard I'm In the same thing with my family we had to tell our extend my extended family that we can't go on that family reunion that we\nHad said we're going to go to because fish and I agreed we're not going to go and do anything we're not taking vacation we're not doing anything until we're at a debt\nAnd that was the hard part for me was just saying though

means that you're buying life insurance through your company that's what you would have to I mean by that that's the only type of group life insurance that is because you can't buy life insurance on

if you're paying for and it's usually not that much cheaper it's maybe a tiny bit cheaper the big problem is it's not portable and what that means in the insurance world is you leave the company\nYou

[laughter] yeah [laughter] well I'm trying to avoid it by ear you're all you're doing the cooking it up it's going to be a bigger fight once it cooks up [laughter] you might as well have a smaller by quickly so here's the thing if you're afraid\nTo discuss with your spouse a purchase\nOr a financial issues that you want to discuss that is not a financial problem that is a relationship problem\n\nNow I gotta tell ya there's times I I mean I I have a ton of money I'm a multi millionaires times though I think I Want to buy something and I'm also down talk Sharon Hi Eleanor bothers toy\nI Want to buy another gun she's like you don't mean not again you have too many guns already people already would think you were crazy if they knew what I mean God you and I collect guns by the way so yeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're gonna find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so\nYou know you don't need another car you don't need another but you don't need another inner tube to pull behind the bar actually collect those I've got too much too many like toys right ah for the grandkids and for the kids to play on and so you know I I get ready to buy a toy e and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our\nBut I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked to share and about this she gets ready to buy purses too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys this too expensive\nBut like she says one of those purses is equal to one of those\n[laughter] uh well maybe maybe to guns\nAnd it's funny how as adults that have the money even\nWhere there's not a stress on the finances have it a little bit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your life not theirs and one of the seven habits just talk about money even when it's hard and it's almost always hard\nTo talk about it keep it clean and\nIf your spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas one is you've got a broken relationship and they are intimidated by you\nTo the spouse is an arrogant\nRebellious immature prints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with their lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child and the grownup body and goes and buys whatever they want to buy but know that it's wrong so they hide it from you\nMost often we find hidden that though is the what the guy was on the last call\nOne of the spouses has been given all of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling well ends up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and now the shame is multiplied and it shame based hiding its guilty\nCondemnation based hiding so they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job of handling the money\nIn which case if that's your spouse you are partially responsible just like that guy said\nHe was he on that because he should've been more involved you shouldn't have dumped this on his wife and you shouldn't dump it all on your husband you shouldn't\nDump it all on either one of your both of you should be involved no one ever you again can carry the ministry of weight once all the decisions are made but every body ought to know where every dollar is going\nPretty simple stuff\nSo you probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who would almost been on Oprah more than anybody\nOprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we could get all I've been on every other show back in the day you know I've been on a sixty minutes I had been on Larry King remember Larry King was on the air I'm Sally Jessie Raphael you remember her with a red glasses you know all that I'd been on all these different shows\nYou know everything out there ... except I couldn't get on Oprah and they would call and teaser so finally they call and we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah\nAnd the very first family\nOf course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah\nWould I Do that because Oprah was wrong [laughter] is what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea\nAnd uh I had told the producers I said what's partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not loving his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars if she unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy hadn't got he he doesn't know what's going on under zone root these free can clueless when his relationship\nAnd so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and if you say that it's partially spoiled and he owes her an apology I don't think I agree with that and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology because he hasn't been walking with his wife to them\nBut he owes or an apology I don't think I agree with that and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology cause he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand all over the debt and he don't even know what the flips going on under his own roof\nAnd she's like well he delegated to her I said oh this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you're delegated in business you would always inspect what you expect you would never just walk away and hope it happened you wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that this is marriage is not a joint venture God did not say and now you are a joint venture\nYou said I Know you are one and these two are not one they're not on the same page and so\nYou know the poor lady sitting there crying because she's so ashamed and overwhelmed and the guys angry 'cause he's finding out he got eighty grand and that that he didn't know he hadn't oh man they looked like a Jerry ... Springer episode or something and um you know and I'm a I'm Stan I'm making him apologized to her for not being a good husband\nBecause of your wife can run up your husband can run up a hundred thousand dollars in debt and you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life or their psychopathic liar\nOne of the two but most of the time but you just did you just dump it on it and then and then you cry because they didn't do it right after you dumped it on them and walked away in close your eyes and what we'll do ... well\nYou know you thought but you didn't even care enough to get involved in what was going on and so Oprah's all upset with Dave because Oprah was wrong [laughter] didn't work out well the rest of the show what we got through it [laughter] so here's the rule of thumb and\nWe see couples who have a good marriage have been married ten years or Fifteen Years or Twenty years\nSit down and start doing a basic budget together we're every dollar has an assignment every dollar has a mission every dollar as a name before the month begins on paper on purpose every month before the month against a unique budget it takes about ten minutes\nOnce you've been doing it a while but it takes about three months of doing it to get really on the same page and get a rhythm going\nWe see couples that agree on their spending before the month begins on paper on purpose increase their level of communication\nIncrease their level of cooperation\nIncrease their empathy for each other for the stress the other one's been carrying that they didn't even realize\nTenfold [noise] they begin to agree on their goals and their productivity with their money goes through the roof\nYou feel like you've got a raise when you do this together on paper on permission before the ... begins give every dollar a name that's why we named the world's best budgeting software\nThe best for your phone every dollar of every dollar\nDid you know there are more than two million real estate agents in this country two million\nAll you want to do is buy or sell a house you don't have time to sift through ads on line or email twenty different people to find a few agents you want to interview our real estate EL peas have years of experience and are the top agents in their markets in fact\nYou know when you decide to get smart with your money is kind of like God looks down and said hey I can trust that one and you know I think that's something that kind of happened with with us 'cause you know a lot of different opportunities started coming our way in terms of just income and and of course a lot of increases came our way as well\nAnd so God just begin opening those doors than we were able to pay off with a much quicker re a lot quicker than we thought because I didn't even mention in the beginning it was definitely very overwhelming I mean just looking at all the student loans we thought how you're going to pay this off\nHow are we going to get home do all these different things started a family but um you know definitely dollars on our side and and of course you know he was able to open up those doors for us to get on the same page and be able to pay off this in a pretty good time\nYou know how how do you explain to other people will cause I Know I Know what the answer is but how do you explain to other people the level of intensity\nThat is required 'cause you guys I mean it was not panic but you were focused to the point that you sacrifice so deeply that normal people looking at you all had to think you lost your minds I mean you guys were on your game on\nYeah I don't know where do you get that fire from was it desperation\n[laughter] yeah I think it was mostly that living with us get in line with unacceptable for us and and we just had made the decision and our heart that and we weren't going to do that and so I had and we had\nAnd it was unacceptable for us and and we just had made the decision and our heart that um we weren't going to do that and so I had and we had just individuals that kind of had the perspective that I'm living with a student loan was um you know and it was the normal you know it was just a mediocrity and like that was just a part of life\n... going to be a room mate for life\nRight the right guy though people you know are some responses that we got where like you know you don't need to do that or you know that you could fit this into your life that we had just made a decision like you know art student loan which just so astronomical that we couldn't live with it\nAnd so and we weren't really we were ready and willing to do and told to do those zero budget you know there's Iraq's and budget everything out and every dollar hadn't assignment and every extra dollar went to a student loans though we were making payments like in the land of making payments to have you can do for a month\nRight we have to have a big shovel and so we put everything we had towards the end we had like zero last for like just everyday living like eating out\nGoing shopping um socializing entertainment like that did not meet our budget line item and not for our budget and so um you know the sacrifice was overwhelming and they can and the like it was really a marathon to the degree that it was extremely painful to\nLive to two years bike and that lifestyle you know but and I would have to say like during those times like\nPrayer was everything like I really had to really have to pray through um just the frustration of that type of lifestyle and really be uplifted in the spirit um\nPet really be focused and can maintain that lifestyle and he\nKinda and he had countless hours that he worked countless hours like twelve fourteen sixteen hour days or weeks then months at a time um but he was just very focused they just they prepared state in prayer to really a ton of meet the marathon that we were I'm experiencing\nAnd those are the hands
