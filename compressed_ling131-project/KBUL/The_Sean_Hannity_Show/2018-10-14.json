the machine gun until the paperwork goes through an is approved and these days I think it's been about six or seven months for approval\nSo really not a big deal then it no more so than it's a pleasure\nWell I think that they the great interest is oppressors has taken a lot of the mystique her away from machine gun ownership and people were said well if I'm going to fill out\nPaperwork for SP our first suppressor I might as well by a machine gun I got the money and that has driven the price of machine guns up\nWell which leads us to this question to explain why Nineteen eighty sixes important date for a year for us\n\nA Ronald Reagan signed the firearm owners Protection Act into law in Nineteen eighty six in the last thing that was added Alaska amendment that was added to that act which has to be a poison pill to kill it it's called the ... amendment\nIf you watch CSPAN of the time and listen to the vote it didn't sound like it passed but the Democrats were in charge and they declared that it had passed on to voice\nThat grandfathered all previously registered\nIt's we're in charge and they declared that it had passed on a voice vote that grandfathered all\nPreviously registered machine guns but said basically that civilians you know citizens cannot register any new guns period it was\nIt was made after that date in Nineteen eighty six you could not be registered correct\nWhich means there is a finite number you you can't they're not going to be more of them\nThere is a finite number roughly between a hundred and Seventy five thousand than a hundred and eighty five thousand I haven't uh I don't\nThink it's right in between those two they lose about a thousand per year registered gun fires blow up or whatever [noise] um so it's not just fine I mean it is actually all the time we had shrinking um the interesting thing is that\nWell in Nineteen eighty six or let's say Nineteen eighty two when I was in college Thompson submachine guns sold for seven hundred and twelve hundred dollars mhm now you're talking twenty thousand dollars for are transferable gun or maybe more you know I mean\nIf it's if it's in super good condition or its original finish or if it's a rare variant of it it could be you know a lot more [noise] so\nIt's the talk about that odyssey or you should have bought a car loaded up\n[noise] back in the eighties auto Sears four Seventy five dollars and my understanding more that dealers couldn't give them away because there was a two hundred dollar tax that had to be paid to buy the Seventy five dollar auditors here\nIf you had if you had the forth all the foresight to have bought in registered in auto she are back in the eighties for Seventy five dollars plus your two hundred dollar tax day today they sell for about thirty eight thousand dollars\n[laughter] super\nPopular because they are Fifteen is so popular\nOh ... ... that's better than buying Google or anything else so it's\nPretty much the best deal that was ever ever offered\nTo me like that because there's a finite number and actually the number of shrinking each year uh\nI Can't think of a better description of something that might be a good investment\n[noise] it is but like so many things you have to know what you're buying and you have to buy it right\nI mean now there's a saying that if you pay ... you never pay too much she just bought too early\n[laughter] but\nYou know if if you know what you're looking for and you can\nGet a good deal on it it can be a very good investment um yeah I don't think they're going to [noise] to have the same increases they have in the in the past Thirty years but they're going to go up they can do not go up\nRight is there any reason if you bought one say well I'm going to put instead of putting twenty thousand dollars in the stock market with three thousand dollars into a machine gun is there any reason not to go shoot it while you're sitting on your investment\n[noise] the only reason I could think of if you had if you put some money into buying let's say an original cult that had an original barrel okay\nThere is a slight chance that if you got a squid load that ... the ... machine gun than exploit going through could Bolger barreling created about okay you're so\nAnd the ... machine gun than X. bullet going through could Bolger barreling ... about it but I sure so you wouldn't really want to do that but\nIf you were to buy 'em either non matching see in Oregon or or to gun there is no reason to not to shoot those because you can just\nYou know take the barrel often replace it I'm\nNot sure ... let me tell the ... the real question that you know because it's the one you get all the time I'm thinking about it yeah I'd like to get into the into the world to get a machine gun which ones should I start with\nWhat your pain level on price that good at me like three different choices three different price levels\n[noise] one of the least expensive entry level machine guns has traditionally been the Mac ten and ... um when I got into it which was always three years ago ... selling for about forty five hundred dollars a day you can't touch one for under about seven thousand or Seventy five hundred\nAnd this is mostly because the six they're so popular people started making accessories for them\nIn order to make them more useful because you know I mean a Mac ...\nThe old joke was hungry run out of crime here so I'm gonna have to get you to move through these these elections as fast as we can't okay\nOkay uh any of the two guns\nTypically cell from about eight thousand to Fifteen thousand dollars and these mimic these or or reproduction sort of of a\nClassic guns like in the forties Swedish day that type of stuff and you don't have to worry about shooting those because they're not they're collectible because they're registered but they're not collectible as originals\nAnd then when you get to the originals I'm\nGoing to come down to thirty seconds than going to be ... your choices\nAnd the forty tops if they'd be selling popular yeah in every movie you've ever seen with World War two step\nTo exactly and they're fun to shoot this new recall and they're just they're slower cycling I mean I Love that it'd be forty\nYears I got to get out you\nThank you buddy I really appreciate it out of a problem\nToo is always always fun man or are you willing\nTo listen to the losing a C. section and a\nBy eight six to talk about human machine gun\nOn the machine guns love that\nSix years we'll be back\nRussia systems adjusted the means to become patently obvious to everybody and it's very simple if you are a Democrat and you've engaged in any kind of questionable illegal activity you get a passing and if you're a Republican you don't people know that we have to just dozens of justice in Washington\nAnd the Democrats are not held accountable the same way Republicans on\nHim to limit coal systems and just\nRush Limbaugh ...

he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting\nThat Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country and we have in the Cape memos that reinforce that we've subpoenaed that McCain memos and we've asked Mr burglar assigned\nTo come in and answer our questions neither one of those things that happen\nSo that that you know Mr Rogers is leading that you played shots he talked about ... he he talked about facts and and the here and it is and how art art or rule of law and justice system works well one of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency show what the documents give us the Cape memos and more importantly comments or questions that's\nOne of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency show what the documents give us the Cape memos and more importantly come answer our questions that's what bothers both of us\nWell why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I can tell you that your committee has shown weak leadership and I'm I I hate to criticize anybody a but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house the majority leader of the house\nOr Jim Jordan and I with chairman Goodlatte in the room and and two or three other staffers we all agree that what we would do is move expeditiously to have him come into a transcribe interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in\nA than we would subpoena him and compel him to do that and I can tell you that uh it's it's more excuses on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired\nOf so we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and could\nLiterally force him to come and testify under oath an answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme a plan that you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe but now James Baker all saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states\nIn the hopes that it would provide materials that they can invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about setting sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm and that\nAnd they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... the guy who was in effect learning stuff just department\nShould not be joking with support is about recording the commander in chief of the United states\nThat ... that even if it's a joke that's not something you do it particularly at the time that this was happening remember this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on late night the president fires give them call me on may seventeenth Rosenstein named Bob Mueller the special counsel\nThat there is one of the huge already happened in between there remember Lisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was little menial leaks\nStrategy so that they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of a reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was the page and struck we're talking about and it seems we got our answer now\nWhere you're writing and I think not only were they leaking arid of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this\nYou know we're we've got actually a memos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there are a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet they knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media could not be substantiated\nI I Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead in\nI'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein red defies an application many side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony is chilling the amount of documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well didn't\nThey will read them do we know they failed to read them or they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here\nI'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed that out\nThat the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warns that that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated they never verified\nBill Payne the Pfizer warrants that that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated they never verified they never corroborated any of this deal ... of this of course of ... deals\nYou know ... and as a result that was used as the bulk of information to attain the warrants and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they they that's correct ... even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given the British or but here's the other problem\nIs is even Bruce or knew that some of the things that he was writing there\nWere not accurate and and yet somehow they get put in a a three oh two and they get used as a justification to actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sick thing it truly is sick me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte in doubt a demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow under oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes\nOf of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte to do he indicated that he would do that so now is the time obviously to get that done and make sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there to answer these\nImportant questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may ninth and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen where he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got to subpoena we've got to bring him in so we asked the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions under oath will take a quick break come back we'll continue also more coverage of hurricane
