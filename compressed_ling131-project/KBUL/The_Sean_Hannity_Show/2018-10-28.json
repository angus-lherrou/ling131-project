the world of competitive shooting the same always pops up ...\nHas been winning for more than two decades six on us PSA open national champion hip sick world champion in Nineteen Ninety six that goes on and on still winning and training people all over the world these days Todd welcome again\nTom how do you know my friend found me again\nI Am well I've been following what you're doing it I guess you were just over in Germany working with the military and law enforcement over there\nYeah I I have been a busy boy this year I had been traveling with a about the last ten and twelve weeks straight on the road here and I'm just getting I'm getting off the road and caught a bug and trying to um recoup and get paid to get out um next week for the um put an array\nA world championship over a pacemaker range up in West Virginia so I'm kind of gearing up for that and uh yeah getting back on it met with Germany I was over there I'm working a Black Hawk and a black hole part a group and um they guys had been sending me just about everywhere to get things done to help out\nUm law enforcement military NATO I'm older you know other distributors dealers that we deal with all the time but ah yeah it's been a couple of weeks over there I Would have German infantry school a lot of work and what the um get GST nine guys and some of the other high and military guys and absolute blast great great people to work they had a good time\nLet me ask you because some of these guys like ... nine I mean some of these units are top level tear one really good guys I mean they're good shooter are good at what they do\nBut you come in with a world class you know world champion background and competitive shooting [noise] what do you bring to them that you can help them with\nFrom the competitive world that they need to know\nWell you know the funny thing is I tell everybody who is ah ever take a class I'm a\nA law enforcement military government side that I tell I but I never been in law enforcement and not been military ah only thing I've done is shot over five million rounds might thirty seven years of competing\nI I tell you know something about policies are geared to like you you got to push you gotta find something else better than the next company and you got to find the next trick that we can put on the market that makes that\nProduct so much more inferior over you know another company and so I'm always struggling to um work but you know how their guns Smith who are older competitive guys that were you know we're\nBrainstorming off and different things to go like hey why can't we do this and and you know then we you know go out and get them you know made in in ... in and spend the time to make them\nMore accurate more faster and more reliable and where we're always constantly trying to strive to do you know in the customer wants yet for sure\nI question for you been shooting professionally I mean like professional shooter for decades now it looks to the rest of us like that would be like are a lot of fun I mean I get that it's a lot of work that you're all of that but is it really as much fun as it looks like it is\n[noise] well I'll tell you what the fun part about my job is Tom and as you well know working in the gun industry eight is the best place to work\nWe are a huge family I I I wouldn't work more anywhere else\nAre the hardest part for me is traveling any more traveling with guns going to the airport flying out literally almost every week dealing with TSA dealing which you know UPS and FedEx and all these people are shipping andme oh no you know getting in rent a car getting in the hotel\nBut once I get there I'm having a ball it shows getting to where we need to be with firearms and that's the hardest part\nOf my job these days are and I and and I just I I just read it from time to time and so you got to know the lingo you've got to know what to say and if your going to travel with firearms are are you will know I'm sure you have plenty of\n'em talked about that on what your viewers and his top the top part about it but once we're there hey we have a blast we we just you know I I Love being in industry and you know love and you um every single time we you know hit the hit some type of show um you know you're very\nIt's it's interesting you mentioned the family aspects and I'm [laughter] I Know people think we're making stuff up some time but it's like\nWhen you're out there shooting and you're competing against him pick somebody who were wherever it's a jury ... or ... or somebody and you guys are always trying to beat each other's brains out but then when it's over your you're hanging out together you shooting the breeze you know each other's families you know the names of the kids\nAnd the same kind of applies to a certain extent between all the companies you may be working with Black Hawk or somebody else but you're perfectly good friends with people who work for the company's\nCorrect I mean we're trying to be on you know I'm every every single quarter um when it comes to the market but no matter what we all end up kind of cycling back for me I've got friends at this company that copying in that company I've known for you know\nTwenty eight Thirty years now and so yeah but yeah we are truly a big family and um you know I I may rag\nOn this guy about his product and he may rag on mine but at the end the day when it's all up and down with a goal like hey let's go to compare your dog let's go do it on notice go onto something\nThey truly are a big family but I thought that\nOne of the things I tell people are trying to tell them about the fires industry a similar people move around inside the firearms industry but it's almost unheard of for anybody who's been in it for any length of time there ever leave it because of ... how could you go be in another industry after you've been in this one\nUh yeah in fact I mean it's kind of like you know it's you know it's a ... at the company does have some downsize going on in\nThe end up laying off some people um typically don't take long for you to transition you might transition from a from let's say if I'm a gun company to a a machine apparel company and you might go on to tackle side you may go in the animal's side mom in these companies they want you because you have the\nKnowledge and you have the people that you have the contacts you know you got the ... people you can you can make that phone call and and uh and make those sailors in a sense late yeah I you know I Move probably six different times over the years and um but yeah I got friends I mean I got bosses who laid me off we were still good\nFriends that I'm an ... yeah I understand how business works so I helped\nMe out here if you said that comes to use as Todd I Need a shootings here for two and [noise] what are you more and you were watching shoot at whatever level which is probably the first one or two things are going to be looking for to see how can I help this guy she better\n[noise] quite so sources just take an individual who is having a hard time shooting a hand gun shy and don't is pretty much been might been my forte over the years\nOr so I enjoy shooting ... D firearms to ... to ... runs so I tell led by the grip stance and target control is by far the most difficult part three is to try to get somebody to do all of those aspects of that farm is the same way every single time so my\nMy my today's tip for for your listeners is to go out in the new graphic gun you take it out of the holster you're putting your hand you purchase sites on the target\nDuty jak the same thing fifty times in a row and he he don't people one shot at a time if you continue to do that on a regular basis in just take those fifty round and I'm going to get good at doing one shot at time\nThen ... on doing two shots and then three shots in for shots\nAnd the thing about is it's like playing golf like playing tennis like playing pool you do the same thing the main way every single time and that's where\nI'm looking for consistency um you know if if I go all the gun and I'm a thirty second up inside the whole story and I'm trying to knock off a hundredth of a second I own a drawl mom I Know that I missed it I I missed that target so I'm looking for consistency is where I'm looking for from my from my students\nI like you said you know even if you're not from the trigger your draw you break it down and it may be what you're working on ... and you don't have to be going fast a lot of times to be working on something although you're you're going to get there but you may be working on I Want to make sure I\nI grew up to the exact same way in the whole stirred comes out the same way my hands me the same way it comes out and sometimes\nAre you not you're actually protect me for not for you but for a lot of us we're actually working on our I work our focus of when the gun comes into our focus the focus comes hard on the front side that actually takes practice in training done\n[noise] well it takes a lot of training so first of all you know I listened to my listeners out there is a huge Fifteen Years oh you're twenty five oh you fifty five no um you know vision is also going to play a big part in it so so how many times I I get a gallon of range and he's forty four years old and he's going to like\nWell I I don't know why missing well here to try these prescription glasses right here that oh I can actually see my sights\nI'm like well I I I don't know why missing well here to try these prescription glasses right here that oh I can I just came up sites\nThat is\nA real big on thing that I Want to be able to push to your listeners out there is that if you don't have a clear front site you can hit the target right do\nYou want to understand it you know your vision is something that you need to pay close attention to the very beginning or something I have learned 'cause I'm fifty five now and I want to be able to tell my students depending on where they are in their life what a site picture should look like but\nIf your eyes are dead on your at fifty five I'm In you need to be able to have on some type of a\nA word is going to be able to give you that focus you need in order to see that site and your target\nGet the correction that brings that front cited a sharp focus for that's got to have a toddler so I've got screwed I appreciate I have a ... a lot more of your time that I had planned on it but man once we get going I Can't stop I really appreciate your time\nTime is always good to hear from you my friend and a anything else in the future you and I need to get on a range and do some students it's been a while now\n... you probably needs a few tips right now don't you\nAre probably ... yeah that's why it lost a couple on the way so yeah right [laughter] I Would love it\nAnytime 'cause me and I tell you any time I get to hang out with the I learned tons and it happens so fast I really appreciate you do what you're doing and we're going to get together and shoot a little bit\nYou got to catch up tuned Tom thank you\nAll right take care of Jared I'm telling you a used got a a graduate course and shooting and gear and everything else from a guy that's been doing it for as he says thirty plus years\nIf you ever get a chance so here's the thing people like Todd they have classes you can go get instruction from him for max Michelle from a lot of these top guys are Rob lake's them you would be amazed at how much you can learn to\nGo on kind of news is okay maybe you're not quite ready for that\nMaybe you are why not [noise] I Love the fact she says she can help you\nUse your self defense\nNot done it because she was getting into competition shooting is simply make you better shot symbols he's six six talked gun is a magic number here on Tom's Russia and this is guns [noise]\nHere is the president himself he was he was an Stewart Barney show to watch the news channel the banks Rush Limbaugh and what about in your tweets and so for these people are saying we don't want any more than ... anybody ever tried to tell you stopped\nWaiting no and that's my only form of communicating really other than having a press conference every hour of social media is so frustrated they can't stop it in a\n[noise] oh you know I don't remember\nHere's the thing we get so many guns and scope straight through here and that was that was probably shot close to six months ago\nI honestly don't remember but it's it should be on YouTube um yeah it should be on YouTube now if not it'll be going there real soon roof you are all of our videos on YouTube a Roku Amazon Fire Apple TV [noise]\nUh but I honestly don't remember trying to think what we put on that\nOkay you know what I I I guess it's going to be wrong and I'm going to make like one company happening tick off six of them so that\nThat doesn't help our fight starts right [laughter] exactly well I'm I'm Glad that you're you're willing to be unable that I was always a good thing to\nThat's right I Am willing and now I get to excess arise whichever way I'd find a a fitting in my case strike\nExactly what

I talked with it is always a pleasure to have with me here I a serious old school all worlds style real journalist they've worked with a gun ... foundation hey Dave how are ya\nWell I'm okay for an old Tom how are you\nI Am well I just I was mentioned the deal and I know that you know you've been in a avid follower reporter on all of that's the thing with Dana lash and it's kind of just more of a symptom of\nThe [noise] the last ... weirdly it's weird to me the left the folks frankly supporting the Democrats are the ones who threaten and actually try to kill you know kind of like look up Steve ... tried to kill conservatives and Republicans\n[noise] yeah it's a remarkable phenomenon I I think they pronounced that hypocrisy but I'm not sure we have to go back to my phone can away and also find that out but\nMore at Smith dash ... dot com [noise]\nThey've worked from the gunmen executives down nation a lighter author of a number of books a obviously a writer\nAnd editor at the gun bag I they were talking about a\nDianne Feinstein and you know basically they keep swapping out semi automatic and calling us our weapon you're talking about an issue initiative\nSixteen thirty nine or in Washington state which would classify every semi automatic rifle as an assault weapon including twenty twos and I want to go back to what I said about this term assault weapon since Nineteen Ninety three when Dianne Feinstein steam wrote the Clinton gun ban assault weapons bill\nAssault weapon as a made up term\nEnded there's a reason why it's made up is because it has no definition therefore he can be\nIndependently expendable you can because there's you can't look it up and say well that's what this is so in this case they expand that to twenty two rifles or I actually have heard them expand that to hand guns assault weapons could be handguns\nIt is a political term is it not\nYeah it is and it it's a creation of the anti gun crowd because all they wanted to do for years and in fact even decades I suppose is make the American public terrified of firearms\nAnd yet you turn on a TV and your entertainment a cop shows\nYour detective shows a western ... they were all shoot 'em ups and you're you're kind of sad if by the end of the of the hour the half hour of the bad guy has been the destiny and he usually does that with a ... a ... and ... it's such\nA contrast of logic on the one hand it is the American public wars those action films on the other hand\nYou've got the anti gun crowd but trying to say no no no you can't have guns on her bed right under terrible they'll jump off the table and get you\nAnd you know I grew up around guns that I knew ... too and I have yet to lay a firearm on a table and have attacked me in the middle of night it just it's not going to happen\nWe we we do have facts on our side we do have is on our side and I was just playing with some numbers this morning suit kind of like one of the simple math things that's playing with this\nIf you use round numbers and this is kind of a fun one for people to have a new one that can remember if you use round numbers there were some where and in two thousand sixty somewhere around eleven thousand murders committed with firearms stuff just can you can quibble at this ten thousand or ... thousand but let's call loving thousand\nThey are according to some surveys and some gas is because that's all it is about a hundred and ten million\nThey are according to some surveys and some guesses because that's all it is about a hundred and ten million gun owners in America\nSo those numbers that makes the math easy eleven thousand gun murders a hundred and ten million gun owners if you run that out what that means is\nOne hundredths of one percent of gun owners commit murder which if you flip that around with that means is Ninety nine point nine nine percent of gun owners do not commit murder\nThat's yeah that's correct and I pointed this out several times in in my columns liberty park tourists which is another little project that ... has going and it's pretty successful right and but\nBut I'm the senior editor there and I pointed this out uh many times that the the anti gun crowded routinely lumps all the suicides all be X. solve a justifiable homicides that you\nKnow shooting a bad guy getting shot by a good guy in a in with a legitimate criminal homicide\nJust to to try to convince America that there's some kind of a bloodbath going on thirty three thousand people dead from gun violence every year\nAnd when you break the number down as you just see Julie pointed out\nThose the the facts are on our site again suicide as you know is it is a horrible thing but it it's an emotional thing it's it's a it's guided by all kinds of different factors\nAnd not depended upon the to use because we have to Japan where they have almost no firearms and their suicide rate is twice that of us\nGo that's right and and I was I was doing a press conference longtime which I usually like to be on the other side of the uh the microphone but\nUh we had a bunch of people over at uh the the the citizens committee officer the second amendment foundation been talking about some gun bill suicide came up and I ... early in my career when I was running a weekly newspaper I went to a half a dozen suicide only one of those and build a fire\nI helped bring to did people off the bottom of snow call me falls in my pickup truck because nothing else could get down there and I ... in the local authorities kinda commandeer be they say you know working at a truck we borrow it in and of course I was down there taking pictures and and doing covering the story for the paper but\nThose are those are terrible things naturally and we we all uh don't like the melon godly but of course has been a a spirit on the front end of a an effort to curb suicide in combat suicide\nBut the numbers again our on our side the facts are on our side eleven thousand homicides a year\nThe other a gun deaths\nAre something else and it and it's horrible to to lump suicide in with criminal homicide\nLet me ask you to jump in here 'cause you're honoring list widen journalist parrot these phony numbers that they get from the gun ban lobby\nBecause they're lazy and ah I I have to say that right up front ah laziness is a big part of what is wrong with journalism today in another part of it is most journalists\nDon't have any ah ah background with firearms at all I'm One of the few journalists out there with an honest to God degree in journalism who's also a gun and yeah hey I sat down and I and I turn this into my beat my beat is\nWho's also a gun and I sat down and I and I turn this into my beat my beat his guns I can cover school board meetings or city council her all of that stuff because I've done it in the past\nBut right now my beat his guns in uh it's always kind of interesting occasionally I'll get a phone call from some reporters simply some and they'll check on me about affect your back there and I won't white to Mosul yeah that's\nA that's right that's what happened or no you're wrong you got that fouled up and here's why I don't mind doing that but unfortunately most journalists they have to call somebody like me 'cause I Know nothing about guns\nSure and then then the a lot of will say well we'll call the gun experts will call the ah every town or you know that type of ... and they do they think that's the the gun safety experts 'cause they commandeer that term David I'm going to have to scoot here tell people where they can read your writings more\nYou can read my stuff at the uh the gun Meg of course for him senior editor\nAt liberty park press which is online only and a senior editor there I write a once a day for an outfit called conservative firing line and I've got a weekly column with American handgun or on the line so I'm pretty busy boy\nYes you are in a while you'll be up to the gun rights policy conference\n[noise] yes I Will and I I look forward to seeing you earlier I probably rub elbows so\nI Would imagine and it's a way that will be in Chicago and about what two weeks now ethic\nYet two weeks from today I think we'll be actually wrap on it up because it starts in ... on the twenty first so\nOh boy yeah I Know we're all seeing their partner\nSound like a plant thanks thanks yeah if you're interested in that and I tell you it is fun and instructor and you\nCome away with a while that was great the gun rights policy conference it's free can't beat that price ... go to the second amendment foundation website yes he asked about or G. S. A. R. dot org ... Scott the information there would be best if you signed up before you got there so they know how many do expect\nBut it's a day and a half and you come away with almost more books than you could carry their breathe as well\nI'll be there will be there are a lot of the leaders of gun rights movies you will be used as well All right let's get the doors open let's talk about gun will kind of guns are you shooting what kind of guns or you buy\nIt if you had your preference if money was not an object what would be your next gun eight six six songs\nRush question how long has the median been telling us and it's only a question of time and something happens\nThat'll make Donald Trump's never happens again we keep watching his reading list on the nail down now practically every day over from business\nDown over the fact that they can maybe\nRight right well and tell us the a suppressor gets here I Am still wearing earmuffs and all that\nBut here's the thing I called about my a couple of days back about a week ago I guess it was I had a package you arrive in the mail from Franklin armory okay and I installed my new binary trigger have you had a chance to shoot it is\nOh yes that's what I'm calling about it is so amazing when I was a shooting single or a a semi auto in the past ...\nYou get you get you get to know the rhythm of your own gun and you can squeeze trigger fairly quickly and and you and anger really quick well\nWhat their spine airy\nIt's double that of course because you fires on the squeeze in and fires are getting on the release\nIran so fast that my gun couldn't keep up\nSo [laughter]\nSo uh I I slowed down my what was before\nSemi auto fast trigger motion slow that down quite a bit and I was still shooting faster than my semi auto you laugh at the shore how come I ... I was I was feeding their release Expedia releasing and getting one shot ... well now\nI had to teach myself to squeeze slower right and still get a faster faster Rick\n... let me ask you your your speeding up your rate of fire how is your accuracy when you're shooting fast like that\nWell because I'm using some sign loads the recoil as almost nothing\nThat's like that well because I'm using subside loads the recoil there's almost nothing and I have a red dye so my old eyes are staying right on target I haven't noticed a drop off bowling pins we're just trying all over the ground when I was shooting of\nThat is cool now the other thing I Know they say what is this okay this is the Frank armory it's a thereby Mary firing system when you pull a trigger the bank and then when you release a trigger goes bang now here's the deal because everybody always ask I always ask them when you pull the trigger goes bang enter you say okay I'm done shooting\nBut if I really should target is going to go bang can but there's a way not to do that right\n[noise] yes and the labeling it's clear\nIt it it describes it that a toddler could understand that I you you\nThe sugar depressed and you just click or something just say if you like the trigger go and it's safe\nFor ... or so when you got to pull back you just put the gun on safe now you can release the trigger and it's not going to fire\nPrecisely what you sound like I had the guy\nOh I'm so excited about it yes absolutely that's all there was one of the thing I got so excited I forgot what it is it's\nA lost my train of thought\nThat you know I tell you what got us back to college back some time give us that that the other thing whatever that other thing is ... and Jim ... points out says yeah but you still got to keep your Muslim safe\nDirection yeah because you are releasing the trigger and it's a mechanical devices\nYou never know okay what do you know what that is okay we're always keeping those mistakes direction matter what\nEight six six talked gun I'll be right back with more guns on\n[noise] it's America's favorite twenty two rights no matter how where where what you like to shoot\nThere's a

the school's trigger full released trigger from Franken harm or you use the guns on code and you got ten percent off so he was particularly happy Franken army Franklin ... dot com\nOr my friend re Elgin joined us again that from the first hour come back in the rave course been in the ... a long time been a shooter been a hunter forever either up on a a a ranch in Nebraska yes that is you did what did you guys have any guns out there [laughter]\nOh I'm Sorry I was absolutely question I think we had one somewhere I Can't remember yeah I Would probably be somewhere around there my dad was\nPretty good shooter is very is excellent whether I follow the news then pretty darn good with a shotgun ... a rifle is his his big deal\nWell of course the rifle was the working to ... out there and that's and that's on race just working to within\n... exactly it is it's part of your part of your life part of your daily uh\nActivity but the crazy thing was we had no deer back in those days is and and of course now is full of white tailed deer and there and some mail there actually but uh and those days if one of the ranchers around their heads saying that there was news in the neighborhood for the next two weeks\nAgo yeah and just learning it's it's the one of the great American contributions stories is that there are more deer in the United whitetail deer nice now than when Columbus landed on the shores and exactly\n... and do that to be true\nAnd you know had that happen well let's see hundreds paid for it it's real simple it's no mystery nobody is paying for this except for hunters we're we're kicking in I think the numbers like three million dollars a day yeah with her excise taxes and then her license ... name\nIn at such a little known fact right and people just don't uh they think ... some missed mysterious government agency did all this\nWell yes we are money money hunters money yeah because nobody else has taken the money and that's a for those who don't know most people are aware of their firearms and ammunition you after the manufacturers pay a federal excise tax on that\nAnd that money is dedicated through the Pitman Robertson funds\nTo habitat to um wildlife restoration and for shooting range is exactly yes yes so it's a pretty cool do you hold on one second I got a call coming in here a long one Peter's with us out of Pensacola, Florida have

that we'll get your calls on that in a few minutes I'm One of the things that we have been airing and many thanks to our friends of project very pest dot com\nIs their undercover videos of exposed\nNow three senators in key Senate races for this election year and then Thirteen Days first it was Phil Bredesen of Tennessee in his staff caught on tape while the they think the people of Tennessee are ignorant and they had no problem saying yeah he's only saying that he's voting for cabinet he would never vote for Kavanaugh\nHe's just saying that to get elected then you'll get there he'll be is a liberal and they will do the right thing\nWe had a similar situation in Missouri with Claire McCaskill directly or own words and she's ... she is as liberal as Brock Obama but she's hiding her positions as it relates to Planned Parenthood the second amendment\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about so many people\nKnow I Know and it it it's better to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio in talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri there in Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it\nBut thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting\nAnd it and let me tell you something else on if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks\nThen how wrong is that for them to mislead the voters if it's ... it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to miss represent in such an awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that an asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station and misery every single one has covered these videos and I think the same things that happen in North Dakota this week\nYou know I think well it shouldn't happen in North Dakota I mean if she's planning to be a super liberal I think the people in North Dakota and fairness to them they need to know why can't you do it in Pennsylvania and twelve other states\nThere's twelve states that prohibit what they call to party consent laws and I think that these laws basically means that you know if you're if you're talking to someone you cannot record them without their permission whereas an ... like in New York and DC in North Dakota and misery already hearty consent\nAs long as I'm with you I can record you know I think these laws are unconstitutional I think they do to fight the guilty and I also think Sean they give the guilty away out\nThey give them a way out they give them a way to say why didn't say that when in fact they did and and unfortunately a lot of these

more we still have undercover\nPeople and play is the ... in it this is the theme there's supposed to represent their states their constituencies but they say they don't they say it's all about Schumer it's all about the national wave we don't care about our own people in the states that they're going to see next week\nAll right great work project bird tossed dot com James O'Keefe quick break right back a lot more news to get to when we come back more of the best of the Sean Hannity show stay to [noise]\n\nJudge Gibson here President Trump defines leadership the first major tax reform a Thirty Years' unemployment at an Eighteen year low jobless claims lowest since Nineteen Seventy three the Dow\nHighest ever milestone achievements and now noble goal has mended and exclusive collectors being twenty twenty President Trump freedom coin\nUse whatever passion you have and and vote at the ballot box that's how we deal with it in this country we don't threaten people we don't intimidate people we don't go after women and children in restaurants\nOr like we've been witnessing when we don't listen to the rhetoric of people like Maxine Waters to get in their face creator crowd\nFollow people into the grocery store gas station department store and say you're not wanted a anywhere anymore which is what she said oh Spartacus getting their face or Obama saying getting their face\nAnd we all have missed the bird just tear up Sean Hannity\nAnd all the other incendiary rhetoric or Eric Holder kicked up more Hillary\nYou can't be several Rand Paul was right something's gonna happen thank God we have the best law enforcement in New York and elsewhere that have been able to stop potential tragedies from happening maybe now the Democrats will speak out about members of their own party and the horrific rhetoric they've had\nBut back to my ... point Brendan struck a is a now a conservative and he's leading this movement which is has to walk away from the Democratic party or he joins us as well as opposed Paterson who remember he carried the nuclear football under the Clinton Administration\nWrote the book derelict dereliction of duty a welcome both of you brand and tell me your story what made you decide you worry I guess pretty laughter a Democrat and you started this campaign in this whole thing for you is gone absolutely viral what happened\n[laughter] so it's great to be our son thank you um so I you know my whole life I consider myself a liberal and my whole adult life I considered myself so I was at Democratic Party voter I always voted Democrat [noise]\nUm and that was true even in two thousand sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and I was one of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the media has been telling me for months and months at a Donald Trump didn't have more than a three percent chance of winning and they also\nOn that he was a racist in a big hit and homophobia and a monster and basically the second coming of Hitler and that his followers or no better and you know they I think that the liberal media did\nFor me as they did for millions of others are very effective job scaring people making people believe these stories and this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media\nRanting you know screaming sometimes crying you know saying you know I'll never understand how people could vote for for this monster and on one particular day I had posted about um you know I\nI'll never be able to understand how people could vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd and mocked her reporters disability and it was on that day in January of two thousand and Seventeen but somebody\nReached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen\nI'm just asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking that Trump mocked the disabled reporter\nAnd for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back ten years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter\nBut what's clear when you watch the compilation\nIs that this is a a voice in a bit that Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who was caught in a lie or doing something shady or\nGrumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid and our son but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really realized that the media was capable of creating a completely false narrative\nAnd then isolating a moment out of contact to push that merits if it had nothing to do is news or the truth brand\nThat let me ask you something now once your eyes open and once you become aware of their bias and it's like you you you ask yourself ... myself but it's even worse than it's ever been how did you not see it before do you ever say that to yourself\n... yeah yeah it's absolutely the kind of thing that wants to see it you can't see it and what you just said is actually kind of the next\nPart of the story because then I went back to the beginning of the campaign and revisited all of those other moments like Trump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women you know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same thing time and again that's not what happened that is not what happened\nBut they made a decision after he won that primary or it was clear that he was going to win the Republican primary that it wasn't funny anymore that he was running suddenly it was scary and that they had to turn this man into the the scariest candidate that the world had ever seen so\nMe ask you this when I when I tell my audience\nTo expect and I showed a lot of the ads that are out last night and I've been I've been showing these instances people that are in the public eye that are conservative or support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants and I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I'll be giving your best shot\nYou know I noticed that it either happens to a guy with his wife or or an older person or women\nYou know what when there are a bunch of cowards the when they do that because I'd never treat anybody that way but you know this is the narrative every two and four years in elections in America that Republicans are racist sexist massage in is\nThat there are homophobic dino phobic Islamophobia that they weren't dirty air and water Obama use those actual words\nThat they want children to die\nAnd they'll have some commercial with the Paul Ryan look alike thrown granny over the cliff because they want to kill your grandmother that's what they do that to their play book we're watching it unfold today even Thirteen Days out of the election um do you see now that all of that is not true there's not one thing that's true about that look if the stakes for Apple\nThan Americans women in the workforce um the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded for these demographics ever\nYeah no absolutely seeing that now and in fact I think a lot of others are starting to see it as well which is resulting in what you just said that even I think that most\nAh these minority groups in particular that I think the Democratic party for so long has taken for granted that this oh these are just automatic vote well that's not the case anymore I mean people really are starting to wake up and they're starting to walk away because they're seeing so\nCalled him and how many ... have joined your mood but\nSo the movement began on Facebook and in that are rich in that first initial Facebook group we now have over two hundred and five thousand of it on ... or something like ... yeah all social media platforms we have about four hundred thousand\nIt to be clear for anyone who doesn't know this is a testimonial campaign so these are just people who are going on social media and clicking follower clicking like\nThey are telling their stories about why they are walking away so I mean they're they're making videos they're writing these stories down I mean people are there this was forming like a network of support and people are leaving are walking away from the left\nOf the uh let me bring in bus Patterson as we've been around the block of time or to a new around the Clintons a lot a Hillary cui we can't be civil with with people we disagree with something like okay you know if you don't want to be\nYou know I ran into what's that that the senator from that we ran into Linda when we were in Washington\nBlumenthal I ran into him on the streets right when I was going to do my show one night when you know and this was right in the middle of the Kavanaugh hearings and he was being a lunatic and I knew I was blessed and senator or you\nWhat's going on man 'cause I'm I have no what am I going to confront him on the street and didn't scream adamant that I mean I don't get this behavior I don't it's not affect him I said if you like to come on my show one day here's my number that's it why are people acting in a way\nYeah well you know my story Shaun I I went up to the White House or as a air force\nBlacks lake you know like in the nuclear football for President Bill Clinton for two years after I lost that position you I Love the White House office of the bedroom and travel with a certain\nAmount of work they were ... world and after I left that night I also walked away so I mean I'm not quite that the transformation that Brandon is but I I went in as a military officer proud to serve less\nAcidic resulted in election and ... and then granted I hooked up on social media so I mean I'm going to be a day's waking but Brandt as can be a great time of expecting thousands and thousands of people to be walking away and string it testimonials and I can't wait I mean it's going to be fun and it's also going to be asking him to send a signal to the rest of the country that\nDemocratic Party stands for nothing to get a substantial that they they ... they fetish\nThey lived in Spain and talked about the mainstream media status lies thank God for you shot and what you do um but it's time for people to wake up whether you\nKnow I'll tell you one thing I don't like being lied about um you know he's twenty ... I I don't I'm not a racist and I don't want to be called one I'm not a sexist or massaging is or homophobia ... Islamophobia I Want\nClean water not dirty water clean air and not dirty air I Love all children they're all children have gone\nAnd I I Believe that you know what we got to take care of the elderly whether they can afford it or not we're country rich enough to be able to do that these lies that they tell\nReally pissed me off because that is not any conservative Brandon that I Know but conservative policies especially when you compare them to eight years of failure of Obama we see a dramatic turn around\nFor the forgotten men and women in this country in other words Sean Hannity Thirty years ago that's what I Want for the country\nI think that's what we all want a for the country\nI Am glad you guys are doing this uh Venice\nOn Hannity Thirty years ago that's what I Want for the country\nI think that's what we all watch uh for the country\nI Am glad you guys are doing this event it's on the twenty seventh it's wearing a DC\nWashington DC right that we're having to walk away march on Washington it's on the national all that's going to be John Marshall park starting at twelve o'clock Saturday and then we're ending up at freedom plaza for the main rally which will be around to thirty pm", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "28"}
