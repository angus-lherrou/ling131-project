different choices you can live on a budget you can take out an extra job for a short period of time and pay off that that is\nBut the sad thing is that they had read like that they've just lost hope they don't think you're ... you're exactly right I Hope that someone is now at least someone doesn't say I would rather\nNot I'd rather not give up cable and go to jail because in jail didn't have cable in jail [noise] no I don't think so I mean I Know\nI think is limited and it's like murder she wrote from Thirty years ago so here's the foreign Dave Ramsey has a plan so we're having fun with this crazy that but the reality is if you're joining the show today and you feel that loss of hope you feel that desperate\nThat your basic freedoms you give up your basic ...\nWe've got a plan is called Dave baby steps total money make over ... throat joined the show the conversation on a daily basis take inspiration from the men and women that are showcased every day on the show to their debt free scream\nWell and on this show and the right to Chris shall we always have a couple of come in and share their story and when I left in its edits ... all of you listening to what you\nIt's it's everyday average Americans that's where it is people don't make crazy and kinds they don't have like a super being taped like no these are every day people choosing something different is wrong and that's it you have to choose something different for a different outcome and so that's that's the parrot but again anyone out there you can do is\nTrying to do both AAA eight to five five two to five is the phone numbers that is how it started to take the step today triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Eric who's on the line and Kansas City Eric how can we help\nHow's it going good how are you sir\nGood um so I have two options I'm a registered nurse and I'm not going to grad school either nurse practitioner school she earned a school\nWe owe a hundred K. on her house or get free otherwise um we have a four month old and we're looking at having a second baby in the next year\nI'm In the school like a cash flow and work full time through high school would be a little bit longer it's about a five year program in totality a which is a prerequisite and and I could not work two to three years\nAnd the dead of that would be Ninety thousand dollars at the end of it\nAnd so I mean the payouts are different obviously in ... make a hundred K. give or take a journey make fifty one Seventy five\nDo you really want if all those money things one issued\nBuilding in the house and all that which one would you want if you could snap your fingers\n[noise] [laughter] it's hard for me to personally answer just because there is a vantage isn't disadvantages to um I don't think I Would take away your name over right okay but I mean I Would be happy as empty as well\nOkay so the question becomes a can you take that next step or what do you call it the ...\nIs that right yeah nurse practitioner okay el okay MP okay and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\nNot without going back to that tree or program and doing the same prerequisite\nFlight but my point is let's say you're in ... for five to seven years and you've got no debt you may even pay your house off in that time and so you can cash flow your way through that as you move up the ladder how old are you\nTwenty nine yeah I just wonder can you do it just logistically can you do if you go into the into the situation\nYou're going to cash from all that so no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to cash for your way through that ultimate role\n\nI'm really know what are you making now sixty\nOkay you'd have a forty grand bump basically a year with that and how much does that scholastic and you said that you the cash flow\nOr that one would be forty K\nTotal and the other one is nine thousand\nCrack how you could you just start bumped salary honestly\nAnd go and do that is forty can invest that but you're gonna make forty came back and a year so yeah Ken's right if you do that I Know from the point is that many years have at that and then go back to school yeah you may not be able to do it and that our school right now like that 'cause you don't the cash for it so I'm not going to see them on that for that\nBut go ahead and go through the school get an upgraded job upgrade basically and you enjoy other or in a sense that's an increase in income at least\nAnd yeah and then move into the school and a few years and cash for that yeah\nThat ... I just want you to have that idea in your head I think well you\nPaused you're sitting there trying to run the numbers and I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there's a ladder to that ultimate goal might it take you seven or eight years yes but guess what eight years from now you're thirty seven [noise]\nYou can cash flow your way so I think it's both saying that's what I say because both of them are what you want to do both of them or something this you're good at art folks more of your calls about your life your career your money here on the day ran to show don't go anywhere [noise]\nYou one of the millions of empty nesters are look around their house and just see unused space it might be time to downsize but when you raised a family and I have a lot of emotions tied to your home it can be tough to separate the facts\nFrom the feelings and that's where an experts advise comes in handy Anna in Portland, Oregon knew she needed a real estate agents help when she decided to sell I had lived in my own for twenty five\nYears and it was overwhelming to think where to begin your E. L. P. helped me determine everything that needed to be done and was patient and put things into perspective with is help we at twenty\nPeople and families that need the specific health that that they can give you the referral a cause that would be huge as well so that that takes a little bit of time to kind of build up your book a business you had that financial coach but it's totally do well and to make that money for sure and so I definitely would go through our training on that route\nAnd I think you bring up a good point racial Chris at twenty eight I think you do need to look at the differences even if they're somewhat nuanced somewhat specific between the coach\nAnd the plan or because I think you can be a financial planner and make that money a lot faster and it's still a coach me Dave says all the time\nWe go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that's that's our one of our local guys if I sit down with Jeff and I we want to know that he's got the heart of the teacher all that's on Yahoo ... right well I Do think you've got to do some specific research there Chris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me\nAnd at twenty eight you have plenty of time to get there are but in the meantime while you're pursuing the plan I Can't say this enough\nYou're not being dishonest you're not being a shy stir in the current job so let go of some of that guilt um and and I think you're going to be fine I just would not let that way on you\nTriple eight to five five two to five is the number two in Komen Rachel crew sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour let's go Kimberly who's on the line and nodding home Pennsylvania Kimberley how can we do\n[noise] I um I Am fifty five years old I had been teaching in public school and the health care for 'em Thirty years\nOn and I just found in the last few years that on time coming on or something else I'm like I said that the last year really then I'm drawn to real estate I looked into it\nUm yeah I can collect my retirement um if I retire with a little bit of a penalty\nOn as opposed to going all thirty five years and my only on\nA challenge or block is convincing my husband is a good idea because it would be a bit of a different here either\nInterested in salary but I Know that I can make that um I I really get excited thinking on helping people find homes and properly and and I find that really interesting okay not what I Love my teaching them but it's time for it\nI get I get good news I got good news for you and your husband okay [laughter] so for you to become a realtor a successful realtor it's going to take you a little bit of time\nAnd I think the fact that you just reveal to us and our audience that you're still enjoy teaching\nThere is no big hurry you're not calling in a completely burned out and so I Would not take the penalty either I how many more years just for fun real quick how many more years would you have to stay in the role of teacher before he retired without penalty for five years\nOkay I just want to throw scenario but what if over the next five years you built your real estate business showing homes at night and on the weekends\nI think that's extremely doable anybody who's ever been successful in real real estate knows you're going to build a pipeline your husband's only real concern sounds like to me rituals that he doesn't want you to lose that twenty five thousand dollar that's just that's a scary thing certainly your age\nWhat if you kept the teacher salary for maybe three years still pick a little bit of ... but I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business\nOver five year period is going to be here before you know it you step into retirement full benefits\nAnd by that time you should have easily replaced if not maybe another extra you know twenty five thirty percent above and beyond what you make you I think you can just absolutely double your income while still being a teacher I think that's the thing that I'd want you to consider Rachel\nBugging out saying that great situation to be an because real estate usually agents show how this when people aren't working so that means it is nights than it is we get that thought what the busiest time and so\nTo say hey I'm going to commit for maybe when you and your husband can decide that a year two years three years old can even go to five years if you can\nWhatever it is and say okay we're in commit the amount of time and if you start to see herself that while I'm really good at it because you sound very enthusiastic about it you sound like a people person which means you're gonna be a great residents of the major 'cause most people do great when they have great people skills it sounds like you can really so\nEven though you're enthusiastic you still may not be great at it you can kind of get some things on your belt while you're learning for again a year or two\nMaybe three years whatever your husband decide\nAh and then kind of step into it yeah I wouldn't go cold turkey by any means but I think that this could be excellent because having a great real estate agent you're in that or anything about it is it still commission based that you get to decide what you make basically like how much you work how many have you sell super fun versus going from where we're at the salary as a teacher\nTo do something like that can be very incredible for you personally and you may find that you're really good at it and maybe in a year ...\nAnd I think once you show the hubby replaces the twenty five right I Want to be one reason why she go and followed by and feed is just on the show he trained the top it'll stay session America Ryan looks to be offended by and I find

and how are you [noise]\nI'm good how are you better than I deserve sir how can I help\nAll right so a little bit of back story I'm sixteen and I worked all summer to you know to try to buy a car but I've always wanted to be paying in cash\nAnd I wanted to ask if I should be slapped for having such a dumb idea to spend every penny or any of yard or I should have it for something else or uh put it may be in Iraq\nAnd I just want to know you know we're we're we're should go with\nHow much money are we talking about um about Fifteen or sixteen thousand\nGood for you very well do you think it's a very nice car for sixteen years old\nYeah um I I've worked a lot you know I don't think she'll be like a day mhm cheesier and I don't think I've got like a day and like three or four years about just thinking about it and how great it would be but so what's the dream car [noise] it's a a BMW and three forty six one so huh\nBecause you're maintenance on that's pretty serious\nYeah a K continuing to work you know what I hear from other owners is that costs about on average Fifteen hundred to two thousand I'm a year to just keep it in good shape and maintain it mhm and you know I'm an armed thankful that my job right now\nI'm can pay me enough to to you know continue to fund it mhm mhm [noise] um\nWell you picked out a very cool car no question about it on way clear for sixteen years old no question so happy unless automobile it really is a it typically is going to be a car though by someone who is as a um a really really good income and the Fifteen hundred dollars\nTo keep it running every year is a minor part of their world instead of like a hundred percent of your income you know it's interesting I was a big part of your world a year it's not a hundred percent of your income but I mean it's a big part of your world is sixteen years old and a you know I'm more concerned about that owned going maintenance cost of this thing that I Am an actual purchase\n[noise] um well I I I did the math and I make about [noise] uh you know Eighteen thousand a year and now\nThat really doesn't change it do other than the uh\nIt doesn't change and I mean a Fifteen hundred dollar maintenance fee for you know to keep a car running and that's if everything goes pretty good you can drop five grand and it pretty quick on the beamer\nAnd again the car you're talking about a beast of a car it's a wonderful lower on my car guy I get why you'd want it the and and if you wanna spend Fifteen dollars on car and you worked and saved up Fifteen thousand dollars and you do it I'd\n\nActually is in Los Angeles I actually welcome that Iran's you show\nAnd thanks for taking my call sure what's up in your work\nSo um my husband and I don't agree [laughter] he recently came back from a deployment and said he wants a divorce\nAnd bankruptcy so um we are fifty thousand dollars on a diet and last year remain thirty five thousand our debt breaks down to twenty five and car tenants tune in Fifteen and credit card and I'm just not sure where to go [laughter]\nOkay and um [noise] show or what do you make\nRight now I Am not working I recently moved back with family\nSo you're separated yeah OK and family is in Los Angeles yeah okay and um do you have children no okay\nSo I'm I'm guessing based on that separation that the divorce rate is going ahead or not\nSay it will be okay right\nWell whether you agree on filing for bankruptcy or not is irrelevant um he decides what he's going to do and you decide what you're going to do if you're not married\nAnd even if you are married technically because you don't file bankruptcy as a married couple um in other words when I filed I could have filed insurance not filed accepted she'd sons from the papers or she got to file too but um and we had to follow on all the different corporations now well sees that we had at the time that was Thirty years ago [noise]\nUm so uh in this case he could file and you not file\nThat's possible whose whose name is the student loan and\nMine okay so that doesn't affect him anymore that you're doing one either way whose name of the credit cards in Baltimore evenly are all our you're both on all of them were both on all of them okay\nWere he to file and you not to file you would be left last man standing and get to pay them\nOkay okay that's how that would work whose name was the car in Baltimore who's got the car\nOr they're two different cars and we're both on them and he has run an ad in the air\nSo she'll twenty five is cars and waste the breakdown of the twenty five break it out for me\nAh Fifteen in ten\n... okay okay the rule on I an asset that\nHas um\nThat has a lien against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt and keep the asset\nOkay so you could you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt the ball it's not going away you've got your student longer that's done okay the cars then you cannot keep the car unless you keep the debt\nYou can ... from the debt\nOkay you've found on me but the only way you keep the car and show it sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of debt and that in the ... the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they would lean on the car\nOkay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is over\nAnd how it works is why they would lean on the car okay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is or is a um a ... or in the event of a bankruptcy you resign for the whole debt and you keep the guard so which of the cars is yours the Fifteen of the ten\nMinute Fifteen okay and what does that car worse do you have an idea [noise] I'd say about ten okay All right\nAnd so you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan that you're going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card debt you understand if he files and you don't you've got that and then you got the other car now in the event of a divorce what I Would demand is\nThat if he's going to keep a car that he refinancing and get your name off of it\nOr if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car the he's driving is it worth at least what's vote on it\nAnd say about that okay so you could just sell that car and break even but I'm a you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess is what it is and you already knew that okay see and so the scenarios are\nThat um you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll land into\nUm I'm In a veterinarian and so I Would say about an hour and working fulltime\nAre you a ... am no oh no\nI'm a ... year attack okay\nAll right and so I'm In that's in the Los Angeles area or are you going to be somewhere else okay All right so you're going to land on that and then you're going to clean up your student loan debt and the credit card debt and the car debt if he walks on all of it\nYeah okay now if he chooses not to file and fight through it than the two of you got to work through this together and you're going to be what does he make\n[noise] ah last year he made about a twenty five\nOkay be coming out of the military\nNo scale and he said in the military [laughter]\nYeah you'll have no security clearance you understand that he understands that I'm sure there you file bankruptcy or security clearance has gone\nSo I mean his chances are moving up in the military are are are harmed pretty dramatically if he finds a bankruptcy but he didn't make any money should be and and you just came home of a deployment and he's lost his mind to show it was like oh my goodness\nYeah [laughter] I'm so sorry\nI didn't care and I just trying to start over and it's not going to be as easy for him as he wants it to be how old is a\nChronic seven yeah okay\nWell um I I think you sit down with your pastor and if you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine um\nI I think if he files and you don't you've got to force him\nA to sell the car that is in his name and probably we're going to say oh you're too okay I'm In and get you get you a five thousand dollar loan for the difference and then you work your way out of the credit card debt the little bit of a car loan driving a beat her and the student loan debt is going to take you a little while with your income\nBut you can do that it doesn't mean you have to file just because he files mathematically or legally\nOkay this is just making sense to you here [laughter] so I'm Sorry your face and all this one of ... listen if you get in the middle of and you're going to the question you call me back I'll help you okay thank you thank you Chris is with us in Minneapolis Hi Chris\nAnd if you get in the middle of and you're going to the question you call me back I'll help you okay thank you very much and thank you Chris is with us in Minneapolis Hi Chris how are you\nGoing to do how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWith a question about life insurance or I'm not very uh ... uh I spoke with your guy the ... and ah [noise]\nYou know they had them kinda borderline whether or not and get a term life term [laughter] I've got a wife to kids at home and I'm the premium it'd be pretty expensive uh [noise]\nIf I Do get approved for I guess my question is two parts [noise] into it will go for it even if it's you know three four hundred dollar a month premium um\nThree or four months for how much coverage\nFor a time with my my pay a million\nFor a million dollars okay ... what is your medical problem\nAh basically ... to\n... you know that I get ya okay are you are you overweight you know crowd I had to give me too [laughter] yeah okay\nYeah that they can help you more with the diabetes if you get the way down which also by the way up to the doctor already told you that you knew that right\nOh yeah I'm working on a good good for you so hard struggle um\nSo what I might do is make sure my family's lot left with nothing and my smaller policy until we can do those two things and let let's get the weight off and get the diabetes more under control at that point and see if we can get a better rate two years from now or something\n... and um you start to see the ... the actual economic value of taking care of yourself in those situations in addition to just how I get to live longer hello you know so [laughter] you already knew these things right right um yeah [noise]\nUh but but I mean what if you took half\nAnd the least you know she's are or how much you own your home [noise]\nOf two eighty what does she does she work outside the home now she works out she wishing them\nDown so if you had like five hundred and that would pay off the house and put a couple

one is ask yourself if there's any one that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or is do they have a friend or a pastor that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak into their life\nThat's a possibility the other possibility that probably will be more
