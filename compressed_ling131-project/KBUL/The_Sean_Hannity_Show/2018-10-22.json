he's late with us real fast his his wallet was basically his bank account he has no bank account yet\nI'm what I'm wanting to know is how do we go along and do the envelope system with budgeting has money and putting money away and trying to help and figure out what to do with all his actress\nOkay well I think you teach them how to do a budget and that's where every dollar has a name before the month begins right yeah it sounds like it's a fairly primitive easy budget\nYeah there's not much that there are and they all like Thirteen hundred dollars only are\nYou know and let's get the car paid off and build up an emergency fund and skill that without um that'll make sense but but um\nYou know we're teaching these basic things that you and I both know about apparently you been doing this stuff that we talk about for a while and yeah we're going we're going to be on a budget we're going to avoid that we're going to build up an emergency savings and begin long term investing\nOutliving we're going to be generous with some of the money and ah so the whole thing that you get when you got someone that's living in a fairly primitive situation like this meeting no bank account\nYou know he's a young young guy getting started is that uh it's real easy for all that money to just disappear\nYeah and the big thing you've got to get him doing is being intentional with every dollar\nOkay I'm a I'm In love she said yes we start out with\nUm a while to get a bank account going like you're talking about on a debit card for that and then you know I I think he just lay it out and say okay you know where do you want to be in five years in one of the steps that are going to get you there and so you know how much are you going to spend on entertainment\nOr how much are you going to spend on what's it take to keep the car running gas wise\nAnd your insurance and your car payment and then just you take this income and give every dollar a name ride down the page I mean this is a one page budget you can do in about eight minutes you know yeah there's not there's not a lot to this deal is not like it's complicated\nOkay yeah we got some level or set up for like um ... and the ... like a car like emergency fond of are you going to your car stuff I Do things we do have said in his corner about ten percent of his ... home we put in your savings Warren\n... well no I I Would I Would work the baby steps I mean not so Couzin dollars aside as my margins Avon and then after that I got his car paid off and then after that I'd have a fully funded emergency fond of

daughter that than her freshman year of college now and then another one that will be starting next fall and then two other teenagers and the baby said I'm\nSo this business of making money\nIt's struggling it makes many now but we still have a good bit of debt from how much profit\nUm profit [noise] uh [noise]\nGosh probably well I have to say probably doesn't like it at that time in the past few years but um how long are you going to live in this mythology [laughter] um I don't know\nWe every time he has said okay I Need to go find a job for them there it's like that door closes and the business [noise] door stays open and um [noise]\nBusiness doors not open it's not making enough to support your family\n\nAnd so we need to sit down on this business and give it a deadline than in the next six months it's going to start\nSupporting our family after all these years and making enough to start getting rid of some of this debt or we're going to\nClose it and get a job\nBecause I don't think you're making any money\n[noise] I'm In my room [noise] well\nI mean we pay ourselves and the business and I was bringing home about a hundred thousand a year bringing your you're taking a hundred thousand dollars out of business yep well that'd be called profit okay you can't live on a hundred thousand dollars well we can we had a lot and how much that if you go\nWith it I got about fifty two K. and we personally had about um Ninety six K\nWere you in the business doesn't have any debt you son personally for it okay so that all his dying wish she got a million dollars in debt and you have a hundred a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt and you make a hundred thousand dollars a year is that all you makes a hundred thousand or the that's what you're pulling out and then you make a profit to\nNo that's all we make that's what I mean\nWe are happening all income when you do your taxes is a right to pay\nIt has banned that were made with an accountant to adjust something there say that we're taking the distribution of the aisle profit and\nThat it doesn't change it right but that's how much we're ... we're paying ourselves from the business okay a year so you need to find out what the president if you don't know what can\nYou get back you give me three different answers you so you need to find out if you make if your business is making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you guys can't live on her does over here you got other problems\n[noise] right yeah\nAnd you can pay off that making a hundred thousand dollars a year and work your way through it and know the twenty nine thousand dollars does not need to go the kids' college fund it needs to go to clean up his dad gummed ... what made\nOkay but it ... the only way that makes sense is if you have a system in a plan where you actually know if the businesses making a profit and if it is making a profit what the property is and it's all coming home to pay off these debts\nMhm or if you want to pay off the fifty two thousand at the business and call that business that I don't care but we need to be reducing debt\nRight quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars you will do that but you guys aren't living on a plan the business is not on a plan on your personal lives on a plan I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I Know and we just got ... in the mail today and when it started to do that\nThat's a good start ... and I'm going to send your company the contrary leadership on the business side so uh because here's the thing you need to be going I'm not going to quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business you know I'm not going to quit that ... ...\nUh because here's the thing you need to be going no one's gonna quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business you know I'm not going to quit that but what we are saying then is is that when you did fine tune in give I think you're good at making money I don't think you're as good at managing it\n... to fine tune our systems at the business the profit and loss statements the budget shut the business and so we know exactly\nWhere every dollar at the business is going and exactly where it's coming from and then exactly what's coming home and what is taxable income\nAnd then lay out a game plan to pay off a hundred and forty two thousand dollars worth of that\nBetween these two different sets of that\nAnd work your way through it you can do both and use the twenty nine thousand towards that go if you don't do that and you sort of the joint on thousand that the goal and then you never pay off the debt it was kind of wasted wasn't it so I'm not asking you to blindly throw it at the ... the ... and throwing a system at your business in a system in a detailed\nBudget at your home and all of that applied directly on this problem solved the\nProblem goes away and the twenty nine thousand is part of the solution to that but the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the money at home and at work pulled on I'm going to give me a copy of the book entree leadership is is that I've

and when you buy a home and when you move in the house and there's ten thousand dollar stealing your emergency fund after you move in and you have no payments but the house payment that houses a blessing\nWhen you buy a home where he got eleven thousand dollars in debt and you have no money left in your savings account 'cause you've cleaned it out trying to BP in mind you move in a house broken and that Murphy will move in your spare bedroom and bring his cousin the Sallie Mae and they will set up housekeeping and broke desperate stupid in your house will start looking like a country song\nAnd I'm sixty eight years old and\nTwenty years ago they bought a universal life policy which is a type of cash value policy a portion of your premium folks when you're having universal policy goes to pay the insurance costs\nAnd the insurance is cost goes up every single year because it's based on annual renewable term rates and so more and more is going to insurance cost us the policy gets older less and less is going to the investment\nTo the point that they like cross the line a few years ago and contacted Sharon and her husband and said oh now the premium that you're paying one hundred percent of it won't cover the insurance costs so now if you want to keep the insurance not only is zero going to investments\nBut now even more has to be paid to keep the insurance active and that's how far we've gotten the discussion which is what I just said all correct Sharon\nYeah yeah okay and what is now face amount of this policy eighty thousand eighty thousand dollars and how much money do you all have\nHow much money do we have from\nYou how much you and your ... and ...\nWhen we did have retirement account and how much they pay total eighty four thousand ...\nUm\nWe have a ten thousand dollar emergency find we our debt free or how to pay for\nGood health kind of like so you don't have to how much is on our cash value is in this right now about al ... or so and you have a pension plans as well you know\nOkay and so you're living on Social Security and eighty thousand dollars worth of for my husband\nStill works He he um had thirty six thousand and income ... any more than Twenty one out in such a parody\nOkay and that's all I I don't know I got you in the face amount of this policy you said was eighty thousand dollars yeah ...\nWe did look into turning Sharon for him but number one it's really a lot like ... that number two he has battled cancer a couple of times yeah non Hodgkin's lymphoma and so basically nobody will talk yeah very difficult very difficult and well we don't know we we can lower the death benefit\nSo what is the premium how much is that a year and a half an hour and a much having having a month yeah okay All right so eight hundred a year and you make thirty six thousand dollars a year\nIt's having a month yeah OK\nLet's say eight hundred a year and you make thirty six thousand dollars a year\n[noise]\nUm well here's here's the equation and here's the way it works in your mind okay the purpose of this is to give you an extra eighty thousand dollars\nIf he dies before you do okay\nAnd so is that worth eight hundred bucks at this stage it's there's no investment value whatsoever so we're not going to the only question is you know you you don't have a huge mistake\nOr that you've you've got a small mistake in the show to double it basically if he were to die would be very helpful mhm and so keeping the insurance sounds really good with that in mind\nYeah they they don't look at what only last three or four years anyway and they send you on a felony\nOkay and they're going to make you stop anyway they're going to pull the plug on yeah oh yeah okay and at that point you would catch it out and one of her cash value isn't there a\nBand and [laughter] if I Would like to get it out now\nYeah well the way to get it out no way to get out now is closed policy down\nRight which I mean they're good at\nWhich which means that you would you know if he passes away you'd have the four oh one K. money the paid for house and be living on Social Security right yeah but you probably can make it 'cause I gotta feeling you guys were frugal people oh yeah\nAnd so you probably could make it on that but it's not going to be a dream come true um [noise] so they have given you notice that at I'm\nSixty two are I'm sure are Seventy three or whatever Seventy years old they're going to shut the policy down regardless\nWell I Know I guess if we can say hey you know that it would be over two hundred a month yeah I think we have a guy okay right\nOr we we could\nLower than that benefit and and keep it going they felt like they could do that which is what I wanted to do I want her to catch it out so that we're doing nothing\nYeah there there's not a great answer okay that's why I'm human and hauling a little bit I'm trying to think through it\nUm uh\nMy tendency is an eight hundred bucks a year right now to keep it for a while\nOkay I'm Seventy seven dollars a month even if you use the casual values you can have the cash value to begin to pay the premium ... and ... you know it's going to do is going to use up some of that eight thousand dollars I'm probably going to do that\nAnd let the eight thousand dollars pay the premiums starting today and I'm probably gonna leave it in place a couple of years when it starts being two hundred a month instead of Seventy seven a month at that point I'm probably going to join his tribe and say let's cash it out\nMhm and close it down\nBut I don't think it's going to make sense to keep this long for a long long time Republican keep a couple more years houses health\nBut then how is his health\nHow race I'm the first time I went to if they can't they're free for five years and that kind of his and cancer free for two years good though I mean he goes and he gets a fat and every every six months or so to make sure it's not coming back or they they got some\nGood I'm Glad to hear that ... ... ... ... I'm gonna I'm gonna let the a cash value pay the premiums for the next two years and keep it open\nUh-huh if a ... and I'm going to check on his health at that time\nYou let's say that he's got another episode with cancer going at that time then you pay the premium no matter what it costs and you keep it open and if he if he's being if the cancers come back at any stage rights you keep you keep the thing open at that point but if he's doing really really good and everything's clean and two years from now\nI'm back at any stage rights you keep you keep putting open at that point but if he's doing really really good and everything's clean and two years from now you haven't seen a spot nothing's no problems anywhere I'm I'm probably drop and at that point\nOkay that makes sense to me it wouldn't it wouldn't be insured yeah you know but um but but but you're also not paying\nYou know three thousand two thousand dollars a year which is what it's going to be at that point yeah\nWhich is starting to be ridiculous with that kind of money you could throw money into a investments to start having some money\nAnd um but but at this stage ... I'm\nI'm hesitant to cancel it it's it's obviously a bad policy so I'll be sitting in a bad thing but it's your only option you're stuck with El Paso that makes it hard to discuss it hard to think about but I'm going to hold it two years like the cash value pay it at the end of that time if he's healthy or instill cancer free I'm dropping it\nOtherwise I'm going to keep it if it's if it's got a health issue at that time so good question thank you for calling in and I'm Sorry you had this problem\nFolks you hear me yell and scream about cash value life insurance whole life life insurance universal library blood is rip off you just\nExperienced it you\nShould experience the back end what happens\nIf you buy one of those pieces of crap policy\nAnd you're sixty eight years old this is what happens is because the money they put into that stupid but policy will be three hundred grand right now in mutual funds if they put it into that in a good investment instead of getting ripped off by the insurance company\nAnd if she was sitting there with three hundred grand plus the other four one K. they'd have about four hundred thousand bucks plus their house is paid for she wouldn't even called me\nBut instead guess who's fat sassy instead\nOf her the insurance company\nSo when your whole life agent says I don't really agree with Dave Ramsey because your whole life I just trying to rip you off\nThat's why your whole life agency and that and there's only two kinds of whole life agents ignorant and crooked does if you understand these numbers and that story right there and then

eighty to two hundred a year accounted let's zero three scream\nBoy those go [noise]\nThen you guys very very\nWell done I Love it\nSarah is with us in Ann Arbor Michigan Hi Sarah how are you\nI'm great things for taking my call they sure what's up so I have a question\nAbout um some of the movement tree the final parts of the baby step we currently are added that um\nWe are we in our emergency fund that fully funded are currently cash flowing to kids in college and um so it's about retirement versus our house pathway currently oh about I'm Seventy eight dollars an hour then our home\nGood and what's your household income uh just under two hundred thousand a year so nominal and how much is college\n[noise] and our kids are about forty thousand dollars a year right now for the two of them\nOkay good good health for all of that [noise] so my question as they currently have about seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars and our retirement account\nMy husband's company doesn't match that we do Fifteen Percent not a problem mhm my company I'm very blessed with 'em I invest five percent may give me ten mhm [noise]\nSo that's the fifteenth so my question is do I find a different way to invest that other Fifteen Percent or the other ten percent to make mine a Fifteen or do we put that extra about three hundred and eighty dollars a month towards our mortgage\nIs four thousand dollars a year doing much better\nWhen I saw that sure well I mean you know you're acting like that makes a dent in your mortgage it doesn't\nMake much better day in my retirement account\nYou know so I I Want you to put at baby step for Fifteen Percent of your household income you put Fifteen Percent of your household into I'm into retirement it doesn't sound to me like you're doing that right now\nNo I haven't been 'cause I've only had ... and then you know worry and I think that can prevent 'cause I put in my ... and they put in a timely amazing match you\nKnow it's wonderful man to love the Macs were not going to lose the match we're going to do ten percent somewhere else like you said in Roth IRAs we can do it during the four oh one gave you got good options if it's raw four one K. particularly I Would do that but I I I Will be putting Fifteen Percent of my income away in the return to the point is you're going to pay off his house\nAnyway\nRight and really the exact same speed\nBecause for a thousand dollars isn't what's going to get Seventy eight thousand dollars paid off\nWhat's going to get Seventy eight thousand dollars but also when you got to concentrate on that when you get a little bit of a bonus a tiny little inheritance or you just squeeze the money out of your budget but ... these three hundred dollar deal here is not\nBonus a tiny little inheritance or you just squeeze the money out of your budget but it there's three hundred dollar deal here is not\nThat isn't that doesn't move the needle towards getting house paid off the house is going to get paid off because you guys have been concentrating and focusing\nIn probably what's going to happen is when the kids would get kids off to roll you probably just going to finish up the house and like ... year a cause that forty you'll be down to about forty by then and then that year you'll just knock it out so um you're fine you're doing really good obviously\nI mean you're doing really really good overall but I'm going to do ten percent you putting\nFifteen Percent but that other ... percent in ... in their retirement\nAfter baby step or types of five your cash flowing six is everything else we can find reasonably within the budget\nOne question I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance was to replace your income for someone who counts on your show if you have a spouse or you have kids yes unique term life insurance is the only way to protect them until you're out of debt and the build up your\n... your only digging a deeper

A. J. loan to have no P. M. I. P. M. I. fans for private mortgage insurance\nWhich basically is insurance that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on you and lose money on the foreclosure\nThose rules for so it hasn't zero benefit to you under any circumstance it's only because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio usually what I'm saying\nOkay ... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus a month per one hundred thousand borrowed\nSo you're in a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage you got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone\nIf you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we push people towards twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference\nVersus ten percent and so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payments no more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down and you get your mind on your first time that's not the end of the world and the ... of and then they will drop the PM I later after you get it pay down\nThe fact that we're in fact in California where home prices are no fairly high compared this country vacated\nAnd now it doesn't make a difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just 'cause you're in California they don't like okay I don't want you on that doesn't count\nYou know we don't do that so you still gotta use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're at the higher the ... market you're in the more difficult this discussion because when you get all the way down to ... percent I'm not requiring twenty percent but you get you get J. D. how it's much to your advantage\nTo not have that stay that way I Am I\nYeah I mean because you are talking about three or four hundred thousand dollar loan I mean we're talking about some money per month to going out the window for insurance that's worth absolutely zero to you right\nSo that's what I'm trying to avoid here but it's not but so if you buy and you don't put down twenty percent
