do not need to spend any money on education and do you get your interest income up\nFashion design there's not holding it back you don't have enough volume to your business actually justify spending

women how ... how how business works and how to grow there'll be some people in their own fashion design that can help you and I want you to start making fifty or sixty thousand dollars a year before you worry about taking a fashion design class\nAnd then when you get to that point because you're working that many hours and you're producing that much stuff and maybe even you've got your first seamstress are just working for you\nThen we'll start worrying about your designs but we got to get your volume up in the business acumen you have to get the business to where it has legs under before

over there that they've said All right Billy is with us from Dayton, Ohio hey Billy welcome today Ramsey show\nHey Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nMy wife and I are in the process of trying to consider buying a house the challenger running into is that we own to rental houses and we currently rent the one we live and then\nDon't want to take on more debt and and so we're trying to figure out whether we should sell them rental properties or um you know how to just sort of finagle that and I'm not getting into too much debt\nOkay do you have um what is one of these rentals worth\n[noise] well one of the challenges that we face it the rental properties are actually out of town on the on the military guy and we're currently living in Dayton, Ohio but a rental properties already Georgia in Virginia so I'm the value\nSell them yes I Would not long distance landlord okay\nNo that's your health in the we're asking for trouble you need the money you're in the military or you're trying to buy a home and you need the money and you don't need to be alone you got you did not set out to own rental property everywhere these uh rental properties by default\nWas not there you're not you're five your strategy to buy rental properties all over the United states\nTo 'em that's been it's been a clinician and I've been getting from a couple of folks that have been talking to my mom I haven't been see though is that they've been successful I've had renters that have been paying the mortgage and um they seemed like there there's the possibility of value going up\nAnd thrown under the values go up but I'm also sure somebody's gonna change their hardly all in your living room because you're out of town [laughter] this is going to happen I I have got rental properties man I got a bunch of them will probably for forty years and um you've got to be I I just\nDo any long distance landlord and I don't have any property that I ran out that is not in my town\nAnd you did not fire you did not buy these properties plan you ended up with them and you're trying to move on to the next phase\nYou if you are long distance landlord and you don't even own your own home\nPersonally puts up both of them are made it like you do what you want to but that's what I\nList as the day Ramsey show [noise]\nI get this question all the time they wouldn't it be smarter for me to sell my house myself the answer is really simple the typical for sale by own our home sales for one hundred and Ninety thousand dollars for the typical home sold by an agent is\nTwo hundred and forty nine thousand dollars I'll do the math for you that's fifty nine thousand dollar difference so here's the secret to making more money selling your home you need a high octane rockstar real estate agent in each one of our real estate endorsed local providers these folks are the top ten\nSo I think your bank wants to see you deeply in debt does that's what banks do\nSo well is when a bank says hey I got a great idea what they're really saying is hey I think I can make some money off of you I mean really it's like playing with a skunk and wondering why you got sprayed\nIt's a skunk so don't pet it\nLets you this is what you're dealing with that a bank so no chase no no no no no Allen on Twitter says I just got laid off and I need to move my four oh one K. to my Roth IRA should I go ahead and do that if I have a chance of coming back and working for the same company in the future\nI Would roll it to a regular IRA not Ross IRA because if you roll it to a traditional area of no taxes\nAnd unless you got a real power money and just want to pay those taxes right now I Would not converted to Iraq but what role at to a traditional even if you're going back because that portion then at least as in your control you restart your four O. one K. there's no advantage to having left your money back there no mathematical advantage of eggnog vantage\nAt all so I Would take it\nWith me my accent in Abilene, Texas say Mike welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nHey thanks for having me on sure how are you today better than I deserve how can I help\n[noise] um well not to

... a thirty year mortgage if you calculate it three Seventy five your mortgage balance that day and and just put it in the calculator and come up with your Fifteen year payment\nAnd that you know take your regular payment off of that not counting taxes and insurance okay take your principal interest payment off of that and if it's three hundred and forty two dollars more to buy a Fifteen Years beautician an extra three hundred forty two dollars a month you're going to pay up thirty off in exactly Fifteen\nOr Claire is no benefit to refinancing alone in or ... except to save on interest rate and interest rates are higher now than your current interest rate is about point higher as a matter of fact\nAnd so you have a you have a thirty year mortgages pay like a Fifteen and it'll go off in

how to go slow and I take my time and be patient with it and I was very helpful but now I'm having a need for another problem whereas\nI'm so basically since then I bought a house remodel the air being be making a lot of money about fifty thousand dollars a month on gross I'm about yeah about Fifteen thousand dollars a month and I'm just blowing through that crazy sex addiction\nUm I'm spending just insane amounts of money the ten thousand dollars a month on\nProstitutes and strip clubs and I'm ... therapy all the above\nAnd I don't know what to do have tried everything I go to sex

that and that's been going\nOn it's been a long project I finished but I don't know what to do about this how it should handle it what ... anything else that you would try that I have\nA cold or I'm twenty two and um\nThe inheritance came from who who passed away\nSo my dad passed away about two years ago I'm\nGuy he was missing plane and I might be coming into a lot more money 'cause I felt a child a wrongful death situation is um it it's a long story about your mom my mom she's out of the picture that divorced I barely talk to her um right cheat sheet at the picture\nI ... as you know John that I'm not a therapist I'm not a trained councilor um I have worked with addicts for Thirty years but goes one hundred percent of the addiction to broke\nIf if they don't feel their addiction

they they ... they're they're good but they just I don't know how\nWell I Know that all behaviors obviously have a psychology involved um as a person of faith as a Christian I also believe behaviors or spiritual and show to treat or something like this only as a psychological thing is usually a half treatment\nTo treated only like it's a spiritual thing might very well be a half treatment but um
