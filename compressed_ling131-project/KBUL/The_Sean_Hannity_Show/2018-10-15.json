a hundred and forty five thousand wow great what he'll do for a living I'm a physical therapist ... and I'm a engineering assists\nThree years three years and so shortly after marriage the two of you look at this pile of debt and something happened tell me what kind of your story\nBut we were just kind of doing a normal thing um we were actually started out on the the ten year forgiveness program and I actually heard you come across the radio um while I was driving around in my work track and uh just was always interested in finances but really never knew\nWhere to start or where to begin and we picked up on your program and within a few weeks I purchased a total moneymaker ever read the book I talk or and I said we got to get on this I said we're doing it all wrong and uh and we started it out\nAnd uh she just kind of followed my lead on it oh I Would just like that yeah it was it was I mean she's a follower and she\nWas really good I have some leadership [laughter]\nShe is a world where she didn't read the book really at all um and then eventually after I don't know about a year into the program she was starting to get mad at me because of the the program and everything I said we just need to\nUm instead of yelling at me we need to go the financial peace and then you can hear it from the source right from Dave and and you can ... you take somebody does my back exactly\nThe

the engineer guy he's going to do the numbers I'm the\nMedical personnel let him do the numbers and then you get in there and you see it for yourself so what happened when you went to the class coordinator gave you a national ownership really in this thing\nHere I think it made it very tangible for me something that I can see and that the leaders of our class they were very open about their debt and how they had read it and that was something motivating for me\nFor me it felt like it was this constant uphill battle and I had this crazy burden because it was all mine yeah it's a little bit of a guilt trip yeah lately and so that class honestly made me feel a little more support it and just give us the opportunity to truly jump in and know that actually getting out of debt what's realistic\nWhen you first start Jim how did you do it this fast we a lot of debt and twenty I ... it was a long\nYeah it was hard we started that fast the very beginning of January in two thousand and sixteen now and uh it was it it it was hard\nI mean two years and four months running and yeah and that's what that is a long long time but it's a hundred and forty three thousand dollars and you

hundred and fifty thousand bucks a year and I'll even Thirty years old and I make payments in the world in life is pretty good yeah that's awesome show or who are your biggest cheerleaders\nI think it was kind of each other and the very beginning we we didn't talk about it a whole lot um we kind of had some friends and families that were saying like what what are you doing ... and uh I think after we got\nRolling through the process and we were getting some traction panels quite a bit of money ... are quite a bit of dead\nPeople started to come around now when you look at somebody go body paid off a hundred thousand dollars a couple of shut them up you know an absolutely no\nYou know it's like you don't have to shut up it just says it\nThat's great very cool you guys very very well done what is the key to getting out of that\nFor us I think it was giving it together first of all the also being\nI work three jobs and worked every time I bet on and also never really strengthen the path I feel like once we decided to jump into the plan we did not stray from that in honestly whenever I Would buy something like if I spent too much on groceries I Would feel bad because that was money\nThinking how am I ... no\n... gave you gave your boundaries in the process you know what about you oh I'll take the\nI I\nIt it was it was it was good I mean we we we weren't where it was a key for him for you what was the main thing that got you out of debt do you think the work extra hours or if you raise your income over fifty thousand dollars Courtney finished a residency program that is huge for\n'em so she got a big raise and\nI Would I Would say call 'em and and be dispatched to utility company and just uh the extra income any chance you could get extra overtime home do it you know

you'd you'd just be exhausted\nBut it's weird how it's exhilarating 'cause you know you're winning ... you know you work your butt off when you're winning absolutely and it changes everything and now

earn income or capital gains also aren't capital gains tax much lower than earned income uh that is not considered earn income it is considered investment income\nAnd it depends on what the money's invested in as to whether there'll be capital tax capital gains rate or tax on an ordinary income right if the investment is\nIt's less than a year old it will be at ordinary income if it's coming out of a traditional i._r._a. or it's never yet been taxed\nIt'll be on an ordinary income if it's coming out of a four O. one K. traditional not raw\nIt will be taxed at ordinary income as it comes out um all of the money will be a hundred percent not just the returns because none of it the growth has never been taxed nor the money you put in has never been to act on a traditional so you'll pay ordinary income on those\nIf you have investments simply invested in the piece of real estate you don't pay any taxes until your salad and then you pay taxes on capital gains portion you own investments like a a mutual fund\nOr a low turnover mutual fund you'll have no taxes on that are virtually no taxes on that until you sell it and then you would have capital gains if you've held it over a year so that helps you can check your tax guy this is that I Ramsey show [noise]\nIt's time\nTo take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not

might sound would be you start with Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement that's by ... period\nUnless you're in an emergency situation you you do that now I'm ... and then you move on to kids college you've got college looking down you're looking on the borough will gone on college\nAnd so that's probably going to take everything above and beyond your Fifteen Percent going into retirement and your rights houses probably on hold for a little while\nWhen you've got two teenagers and no college funds you got some catching up to do right\nYes sir you know and so you're going to probably that's five is probably going to suck up all your extra money right now because of the situation you're in the age of the kids um before you get to six so you're just gonna keep paying your house payment for now and get these kids through school\nOf Ramsey solutions sunny from San Diego California drop by\nHalf wash a sunny what's Hi Mr ... fall it's such a great honor to speak to you um\nAnd my question is I'm just immigrated to the United states and I've lived a frugal life I'm like save my money them careful with that but since I've arrived in the United states um I've had a ... some of my acquaintances telling me\nI'm that you'll frugal living will make your social loud cost you ... if you'd done by an expense awards and expensive cars and all of a status symbol of the um you will be treated as a social out often I'm came to understand what would your take on that\n[laughter] oh I Love it or did your emigrated from\nA United Kingdom United Kingdom okay and where did you grow up um I was born in India I immigrated to the u._k. when I was Seventeen okay and you're how old are twenty nine okay and how long did you live in a ... eleven years were you a social outcasts there are no okay\nWell uh where did you live in the u._k. a city called ... off right pretty good size city it is it's it's a nice ... a a word legitimacy and you weren't a social outcasts there for being frugal no but um I was like what do you live in the United states um I live in San Diego\nThere to [laughter]\nYou might be a social outcasts there now are getting okay there are people and certainly in San Diego that have common sense as well\nSo um I don't know what crowd you're running with was there but um it's different than the one you ran with an India or the one you ran with an ... for sure because they have been bitten by the bug of consumerism but plenty of Americans um\nIn any city um will or not consider us social out cash for having good common sense values now\nA that's assuming you're you know you if your clothes are not necessarily expensive but they are at least clean mhm and your watch um I'm I'm I'm worth ... well over ten million dollars was building worth twenty million that you're standing in is paid for and that's my watch pretty on assuming\nI'm like it costs about a hundred and fifty bottles um problem is I don't care what you think and if you think I feel like I'm cool because I have a watch I don't really think you're cool so um you know that's the thing you got to decide who you want to influence you um and where you want to end up so what brought you\nYeah it was a childhood dream that I hunt mhm um I read some land left um\nBecause this country guarantee freedoms to all people to Supreme Court ruled that no one can be false to a re signed the pledge of allegiance and that just got hold of me I was about twelve years old and I try to uh apply that in my school in India or get a naive I was ... um didn't realize the American constitution doesn't apply in India\nAnd uh and I got 'em if Egypt or me out and got in trouble yeah I did I think that the principal and the fact that the principal one day when I make it to the United states you wouldn't be able to do this to me anymore\nSo freedom that is correct freedom okay and now people are trying to take your freedom\nFrom you\nAbout forcing you to conform\nTo something using a social pressure but not all\nOkay and so I Would treat it exactly the same way as hard as you have fought through you know twenty nine years of your life to get to be standing here um I wouldn't surrender my freedom that have tried to stuff\nNot all in the name of someone being impressed generally speaking a here's a good rule of thumb people who are impressed by things that you have or aware or not impressive people\nWhen you get inside of their hearts and inside of their minds they're what we would call shallow and so on the\nVery people you might attract by having some bling\nBy having some jewelry or some watches or the proper\nClothing or the people that you really don't want influencing your future and your character in your life you've paid a huge price to get to be here and enjoy the freedom and so you're a man of character\nAnd um the uh ... and the show the people that are telling you that are probably not people I Would want\n'em to be influencing me I might want to influence them and try to help them but if I were in your shoes I Would say that doesn't need to be your inner circle that are teaching you how to live mentor and you decide billing you and so forth um and so\nYou know check out a folks that have a little more depth of character and aren't judging you based on what you drive now again it needs to be if you drive an old car um that's a while you're trying to achieve a financial go or something what needs to be clean\nAnd maintained you don't take good care of it but um it it doesn't that doesn't need to be dirty and doesn't need to be missing the same thing with your clothing or your hair or whatever else you take care of the things that you have been and manage them but\nMost wealthy people or do not by a expensive things to impress other people\nAre a few do but most don't that's how they became more if they know they do by some expensive things that I buy some expensive things but there for me\nAnd for my family and for my wife and that kind of thing and they're not for what someone thinks I'm I'm I've got a really nice home but I didn't buy it for somebody else are we live there you know and what you think about are good or bad doesn't really matter to me and so\nI I don't know is that helpful is that helpful part of the matter is that what you were looking answer I think I needed to hear that outcome what are you doing for a living I'm a ... day in IT okay what do you do a developer your develop it okay All right well you probably need to come to national work rush\n[laughter] Saudi as an honor to meet you sir if you got quite a story brother quite a story well done thanks for stopping by their\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five ... this is the day Ramsey show D is with us in Atlanta Hi Dee how are you handling\n[noise] um I wanted to ask if I should say my tax up here and she reported off information um on our Seventeen taxes and as a result we're being charged that ten thousand dollars\nYou're being charged ten thousand dollars in penalties yeah mhm not taxes\nI Want to pay their taxes and penalties yeah okay I made a show like a percentage on the information as well that the\nFalse information she lied intentionally and you get through that\nYes why we do know\nI guess to get back more money I don't know like for instance she claimed that we have a business that we don't own she claimed that we're paying for cars that we don't own cheaply claims that we're paying 'em from mileage for their business again that we don't own\nThat's weird like I mean does your husband have something to do with this when he doesn't have hit that we can see what you know I mean they just randomly\nOut of thin air she'd dreamed up a business that you don't have an cars you don't have a knowledge that you don't have\nRight now we have the church but you know churches don't get tax so there was no there's nothing in them the documentation that mentioned anything about the church that they use our uh our number is eight five but when the three number ... job this random\nAre you are you doing a work outside the five oh one ... see three as a venture list that you're being paid uh outside of the church now you know you don't do speaking engagements and get paid for that on the side\nNo everything's through the church or a hundred percent\nYes and even for the church we don't make any money for the church in his own in states\nWe both work independently through another company\nActually you have your by vocational pastors okay yeah okay um well I\nI think if there are two I don't I don't know you need to see an attorney is the answer the question 'cause I don't know whether you have grounds to sue someone or not this is a very bizarre thing that someone would do it is just out of the blue eye is not a mirror mistake I mean it's a complete fabrication\nAnd so um I mean this was ... it sounds like fraudulent activity on your behalf now you've signed the tax returns though didn't\nKnow anything they don't you know but you had to see the tax returns [noise]\nYou you you didn't allow someone to send in tax returns are due to seize shirt and I you may have trouble I don't know you need to see an attorney and asked them a hot my guess is the most you could hopefully get back will be the penalties\nThe taxes you already oh and you still owe the penalties are due to them not being paid on time due to this um and I think that's the most you might get back I don't know as soon as\nSaid you know that if you combine that data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every American to shed their\nPersonal info compromised or act over fifty percent of our listeners and viewers tell us that they or someone in their family has been a victim and Seventy percent of those folks have had it happen more than once she this is unbelievable once these get your info the risk never goes away\nWas handle no\nYeah and they were offering us you know we could do that by Dr ... and we were planning to keep it but I looked at the options and started looking at if we get the buy back and got the cash settlement and got rid of the payment and the position that would put a than it actually had us at that point to where we would pay off in thirty six months\nAnd so I had about two or three o'clock in the morning I called my brother back him what I've been doing and he said he would buy us F P U\nUm for Christmas and allow us to you know to the program at home we kind of live in the middle of nowhere and then I told him that I Would text pets but not today to talk to him and I was a little nervous because the car with kind of pets and I didn't think he\nReally man that's driving the tractor\n[laughter]\nHe's like I'm not driving the minivan but yeah but he I texted him and surprisingly he was like most and I told them about my spreadsheet that I made this nice color coded spreadsheet and I sent it to him and surprisingly he came back with let's do this\nUm and I thought you were\nYou were ready to University of ... and then you come home when you go to the university\nBut we didn't end up going to what we did it um through the program at home or go to our church is an hour and a half away and run run\nWe didn't end up going to what we did it um through the program at home\nHome study I Gotcha yeah our church is an hour and a half away and run right\nNow now now days you could just watch it all on line but it was different then yeah\nVery good you guys so what is the key\nTo getting into that you made already one thousand an Eighteen month what folks from Arkansas for\nAdults like in that they paid off the phone as another ten thousand and then we also got about an eight thousand dollar cash settlement on top of that\nNo one was that one most yes yeah All right and then what what is the key to getting out of debt than you did it in Eighteen months\n[noise] um I Would have to say for for me it was communication close communication to where both of us know exactly what's going on with everything all the time rather than\nIn the past where I had largely let her kind of control everything\nMhm which she she didn't have as good a job as I could possibly expect\nExactly what she was by herself but she was by herself I didn't have a full understanding of what was going on right how was\nBeing done exactly where we were I knew small numbers I did not have the big picture and you know guys being visual creatures the disparate she gave me the big picture in color coded clarity\n[laughter] so it's definitely a huge last summer the control when pat not involved but you've gained um someone else's shoulders to help carry the load right\nYeah it became amazing actually what happened with fat with it flows me on fiber gasping because\nHe got so on board that what that and got on that point you had a huge impact on this because he was told there'd be no more extensions and that was back like just a few months before we started at man I'm about\nTo be about a year into it\nHe gets a call he he was home marrying one of his trip and he gets a call from work saying they just got back three weeks before but they wouldn't need him to come back a month early and he gets off the phone and he's like or do I do and I'm like\nI don't know they want to go back and he's like well what would it with our site we were out of town and I don't even know how I got my spreadsheet their numbers if I just knew um but I sat down and he was sitting at my brother's house actually calculating\nAnd I'm like you know if you do this we can be out of debt in June\nUm instead of you know another year and a half and it was like wow you know what I think he jumped on board and he actually told them that have been extended for the month you know if they would give them an extra two weeks on the end as well that would guarantee us to get it all paid off in that time\nWhen congratulations you guys were so proud he just got a copy of course opens returns from our book for you that is the next chapter in your story to be millionaires and outrageously generous
