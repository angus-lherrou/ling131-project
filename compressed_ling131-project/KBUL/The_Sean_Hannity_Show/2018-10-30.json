the place of the medium double you\nAs the status symbol of choice I'm Dave Ramsey your host you jump in and we'll talk about your life your money it is a free\nCalls that AAA eight to five five two to five Brandon starch the shower in Phoenix, Arizona Hi Brandon how're you\nDoing better than I deserve but a little confused oh how can I have well my wife and I were a debt free except for our help uh-huh and we've got a one and a half year old little boy yeah eight and we want to [laughter]\nWe want to play and prove college but before he goes to college is most likely for our faith going to sort of a two year mission right and I know that probably doesn't apply to the ah the college savings plans mhm\n[noise] we've got a chunk of money right now about seven thousand dollars that we're going to put somewhere but we're trying to decide whether we should put it down on their mortgage which one way or the other will be paid off before he goes\nYeah or by a couple of good a portion\nThat to be something um to to build up that the future mission in college fund\nGotcha okay and your debt free accept your home correct in addition\nTo the seven thousand dollars do you have an emergency fund a rainy day fund up three to six months or expenses\nWe'd do you how much is in that\nAbout good\nOkay what will your ... what we call baby step for five and six maybe step ones with thousands saved too is that free but tiles three is a fully funded emergency fund\nBaby steps for is putting Fifteen Percent of your household income into retirement which you should just start doing that as a part of your savings you're investing plan right now maybe step five is kids college and beyond that\nAnd right now maybe step five is kids college and beyond that\nSix is pay extra on the house as you can as fast as you can show what I Would do there's money is I Would hear a market for school and mission trip\nBecause you guys are obviously LDS right we are yes\nOkay cool so what what I'm going to do is say out of the seven thousand I'm probably going to drop five thousand of it into a five twenty nine for my one and a half year old\nInto a good growth stock mutual fund that's all for college has to be used for college take the other two thousand and just said it in a mutual fund in your name\nNo big deal just regular mutual fund and your name and you just on the file when you drop the paperwork into a file right mission trip on the file\nWith us from Springfield, Missouri\nWe just finished the you\nWere on babysat to\nStand for the last five years we have been building our home\nPaycheck to paycheck\nAnd um it's not a hundred percent completed yet we had to borrow money on it or to kind of get things rolling a little bit\nBut um we got an offer to do a care taking position and the guys have a a four hundred dollars a month to take care of his vacation home I'm In the same town we live\nUm [noise] do we sell our home\nOr do we keep it and continue making painted on it\nIt's not completed well it were at that point it needs a paint and flooring and you're living in it no no um well we were living in a mobile home um\nBut then we got this offer to live in this house basically for free and he pays us that live here and take care of\nI got that okay so that's ... so you've never lived in this other house no okay somebody will tough to sell it and the conditions than yeah like they can't get financing on it right so you're going to take a whipping\nA what will it take money wise to finish it\nUm\nWhat never had a professional answer on that but probably about eight thousand ten thousand dollar\nYeah and what is your household income\nUm well my husband he worked forty hours a week what her household income [laughter]\n\nProbably thirty seven thousand a year\nOkay so your husband is the only one working well we have a business um that doesn't make it out in running but it doesn't make money [noise]\nHis income is about twenty seven thousand in the business makes about Fifteen thousand nearly\nOkay [noise] and then\nDuring the care taking condition or it'll be making about forty eight hundred cash but we get housing for free\nYeah I got that part until you get into if he decides he doesn't want you to care take anymore and then you don't have housing for free anymore that science so I mean he could walk into more on fire you pretty much I've changed my mind and then you you have a housing issue again right so um\nYou have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring as it is\nOh well we had a appraisal and if it were completed it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand\nThe smart completed so probably a hundred and fifty hundred and forty five\nNo no not if it's not completed it won't know um\nBecause you you it's a further discount than the cost it takes to complete it it's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer cannot bothers house\nOkay because they don't have any money and they're trying to get a mortgage and they can't get a mortgage on this house\nAnd so that limits your in but they didn't limit your selling pool to investors and they're going to discount that a lot deeper than that if you get a hundred out of there should\nBe flying I'm thinking so um [noise] how much will be borrowed against it so far\n[noise] the house itself we owe thirty thousand but there are some property\nA hundred thousand\nYou owe a hundred thousand against the house and the property yeah which would bring a hundred and sixty if it were fixed if you sold the property is well yes\nOkay All right yeah I I Would look at trying to pick up the other ten thousand dollars in an additional loan and get this house finished and let's get it so as soon as possible\nAnd then just continued sending money and how we yeah\nYeah we all have you know you should have some equity in your pocket at that point I mean I'm not a time but you're gonna get a little money out of it so you know it it just hasn't worked out for you you realize that right yeah you've got way too many hours in this house\nAnd and really didn't get much out of it went all the smoke clears here right you'll get a little bit but it's not it's not it's not\nWorked out very good so you know you're going to have to reset that and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you guys need to look at your income\nBecause your household income as you I'm very very low income and ah so I I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term and I want to think about some part time jobs in the meantime\nBut um yeah I Would get that house finished up I'm saving scratching and clawing painting and [noise] you know if you borrow three thousand bucks or something that's fine but let's get lost her and get it sold as fast as possible\nNow is the land is such that you can sell off a piece of the land without selling the house in order to have the money to finish the house that's what I Would do first\n... showing acre off the corner use that money to finish the house then get the house so in that way there's no more debt involved Olivia is with us in Lexington high Olivia how are you\nDon't hire you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nAnd I had a question and I had an African amount of debt and and I'm wanting to pay that off the air that right [noise] um you know when I saw in ... and ... and and that is going to be so [noise]\nAnd I think ... ... budget and\nPet therapy at the end it likely not going to get paid and how kind of the quake that I'm not really sure way to put it in the budget for how big of a priority like\nHow long you been clean and have any kind of good for you well then what is it\n[noise] I'm actually in ... okay all\nWell no I'm not going to put therapy on hold right now there's just something you need you need some accounts or to walk with you as you finish this life transformation and that that is essential to you having a life\nWould you agree with that statement yeah [laughter] now\nWhat I Would do is is number one it's not a permanent situation um the therapies not permanent is not going to be there the rest of your life\nFifty years from now you're not going to still be going to the therapist okay I Hope I'm and then uh otherwise they're just not very good [laughter]\nBut ah at some point you'll you'll pull back from that and the second thing will happen is is that as you continue to address your income injure out go you're going to find ways to make more income and as you have more emotional healing you're going to feel more energized to make more income\nAnd so if this month you don't pay any extra on the debt but you pay your therapy\nGood if next month the same thing happens okay but by this time next year we ought to be making more money right let's do something let's kick her life in gear and let's start to clean up the debt\nA Seventy five whole day's you've been clean [noise] that's a great start\nRight but it's not like you told me you've been clean for two years by the time you're going for two years we ought to be have different having a different conversation about the money would that make sense to you [noise] so let's get you killed and then let's see all your money\nAnd as you and it's not going to be suddenly like a switch flips undergo OK I'm OK Now getting the money no it's not all or nothing it's coming gradual it'll be incremental\nYou'll feel better you you know when you're Ninety Days or your four months you ought to feel different than you feel right now and you ought to be able to do more and make more and save more and more and you know you you all have more focus on the money 'cause you'll be more healed and\nHave to spend less severe emotional energy just coming through this right now your game on just getting through this is that right [laughter] okay well I Want you to finish turning the corner you turn the corner you're finished turned the corner and let's let's gone out\nAnd then as you make incremental progress\nMore and more than money from your new income and your increased income\nThe debt ... foot for today\nWe want to take care of Olivia\nHow often do you look at your bank account and wonder where all your money went how often or you're stressed about bill's afraid your paycheck will last the whole month you shouldn't have to live like that you shouldn't feel powerless over your money and you don't have to you can take control of your money\nWas the financial ... membership you'll learn to manage your daily finances pay off debts spend and save wisely and invest for your future if you follow this course\nAnd uh our youngest has Down syndrome\nAnd so uh right now we're actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church and or just getting to the part where we're ah we're working on whales and so because we had the special needs a issue we we get involved or attorney and getting our wheels together good and through that conversation we ah you\nKnow I'm a we've been discussing a special needs trust or world I'd have to play in planning for our baby's future yeah your animal ...\nSure uh originally a kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs stress kind of functions that same way that the other boys have a college fund in baby steps five\nUm the uh and that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special conditions with special rules because of course\nAh you know his his speeches are boring it's too early to know what is your fully what his needs are we've been blessed that he's [laughter]\nHe's healthy developing well you know there's this guy to limit for him just like anyone mhm um and we don't have to uh uh you know it's hard to really didn't know if he ever have any limitations [laughter] but uh but now as we're getting into it and we haven't find anything quite yet\nBut it would come down to the wire why things that I'm uncomfortable with is that you know if I start investing any money or finding try I I lose control of that to the track speed we've named and while while I trust the trust the inability to go with our wishes that makes me uncomfortable\nNo you don't you don't need a special needs trust unless both of you die right the special needs trust does not need to be funded prior to her death okay so that\nIt sounded from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth\nOkay\nIt's not ... I wouldn't even have it formed accept upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as I Want to he was alive as long as one of us alive to manage your ass that's one of the things you're going to do is care for this child\nAbsolutely out of those assets now that the when the trust is needed is if both of you die it gives the trustee me the the the the direction on how to handle the assets interspersed them to take care of this child's needs\nAnd um and what that needs to be is a a big hairy term life insurance policy that ... that is the beneficiary of it is that special needs dress or a portion of the policy you know thirty percent or twenty percent of the policy in the beneficiary line goes to the special needs trust\nIn the event that both of you die kind of a thing in the primary beneficiaries your wife okay but then past that the secondary beneficiary is\nSome portion would go while you've got minor children into a family trust to take care of the minor children your oldest two until they get them through college the other portion would go into the special needs trust to perpetually care\nThere are children your oldest two until they get them through college the other portion would go into the special needs trust to perpetually care for this other child throughout life not just through college and so it's a larger amount needed to do that and then what happens is let's say we fast forward Twenty years\nAnd this child is Twenty years old and you've got a million and a half dollars and mutual funds okay your other children are grown and gone\nOr close Twenty years from now right\nThat the dream the dream that law yeah we're kicking them out so they're going [laughter] that's the legacy baby [laughter] but it's out of that then what we've got is we've got some portion of my million and a half dollars in my example\nIs gonna be parked in the special needs trust in the event both you and your wife or to pass\nThe rest of it would go to your\n... more traditional airs directly\nSure but you know we put a million dollars in a in the the youngest child special needs trust at Twenty years old because he's going to need care and that's eighty thousand dollars a year it'll produce ... that'll take care of him and maybe one of his brothers is the trustee\nBy them you know\nWould you would you go ahead like we're doing right now would you formula trust as illegal activity no now and I'm David unfunded or would not let it would have would make a caught in in the well\nWhy not why would I Would just make it a clause in the will to be formed upon both of your deaths okay because you don't need it now you don't need to be filing tax returns for the next twenty five years on this thing\nYou don't need to ... earn more than all the time you don't need to go all the legal expense to form a trust so let me give you another example okay ... as a as a special conditional\nVersion of just taking care of minor children right then the differences that might be perpetual\nOkay but you know my children grew up\nAnd moved out on her own their own show my need for a trust to cover my minor children\nA in a live in both of our best expires\nFormed a trust for my minor children at that time in the need for that expire\nAnd I would have done it for nothing in this case is not going to be ... you're going to need a trust\nA say on the on death in the well that's what I was a new everyone that's that's how we do\nI get asked all the time about what people need to do to improve\nTheir families money situation to the most overlooked things are term life insurance and\nDisability insurance both plans make sure that you have income to pay bills and take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen for term life you need to carry tend to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most families stay away\nFrom cash value or return a premium plans there just a rip off\nDisability insurance is just as critical how are you going to pay your bills you if you're unable to work disability is the leading cause of bankruptcies foreclosures\nThat's why I send you to

because there's new cracker plant going in so people are coming in from out of state sucking all those up [noise] but I found a couple of houses that I could purchase\nAnd the pay my rent right now it's eight Seventy five a month or my payment was dropped to about six hundred thirty dollars from mhm [noise]\nUm the other part of it is a when I retired from the post office I rolled Meyer a per se\nOf course savings plan into an IRA good that I can borrow enough from right now with that I already just to be able to put towards ... percent down ... on the house so I wouldn't have to pay the ... ...\nYou know just like you know in your face the American idol you don't want to ... percent\nNo you're you're you're turning your two broke to buy a house you're in debt okay you're in debt you get your borrowing against your retirement I mean you're straining every corner to pull this off okay um and besides that you if you're moving from an eight Seventy five rental do six hundred dollar payment you are moving down in house substantially\nSo we're going to move down and how substantially moved down to a different rental and let me tell you if the rental market is squeezed because of a plant that has come in the buying marketed squeezed as well\nSo what you're telling me is not logical you're using this as a rationalization to buy out of order I if I were you when you call me and I ask what you should do I would rent something else move out of that rental moved to a cheaper rental that'd be fine\nAh for a short period of time that while you clean up your debt your debt free you build your emergency fund up three to six months of expenses then you have a good down payment and you can do all of that and a few years if you're careful and watch what you're doing and then make your purchase\nBut when you buy a house and you're broke you're asking for trouble I mean a Murphy will move in your spare bedroom bring his three cousins broke desperate and stupid owning a home when you're broke and be a financial curse rather than a blessing\nSteven as in Virginia Beach Hi Stephen how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI just want to know what would be a martyr to be All right now I have a higher rate and my name and I know you can only put five thousand five hundred into a year yes or no hypothetically at me and my wife only had\nThat with my mouth that amount of money five thousand five hundred to go toward the investing whether it be smarter to put all of it into my IRA is or should I open up the road from my and my wife's name and then flip the five thousand five hundred and\nPut two thousand seven hundred and fifty in each of them and watch it go that way what's your household income\nOr a household income and fifty thousand okay Mm\nSo Fifteen Percent of that going in it baby step for into retirement\nIs more like a ten thousand no it would be more like Seventy five hundred okay um [noise]\nOkay so you wouldn't fully fund to but you could put some it it doesn't matter uh which one you do mathematically let's say you chose the exact same mutual fund then you put three thousand in more than three thousand and another\nOkay one in one Roth IRA and your name one rather and her name or are um you put six thousand in the same mutual fund it's going to grow exactly the same\nSo it doesn't matter\nUh he'll I even had like a thousand dollars I can I could open up ... ... five hundred and ... am and five hundred her you know the guy that\nIt doesn't it doesn't have you any mathematical advantage whatsoever [noise] the only advantage is just a relational\nIn that if she feels like that you know you're fully funding yours and she's not got anything for retirement which is not true because if you ever got divorced or died or anything else she's going to get half of that money even if it is and your name\nOkay okay so it's not true but sometimes people just you know like she just wants some and her name that's okay so you can do half and half if you want you need to get to the point you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement that's baby step for and that would be\nYou had your emergency fund them ... which may be why you don't have the money right now\nThat's why we put baby step for after getting out of that and after having emergency but we don't folks temporarily not to save for retirement till you clear your debts that way you have the money to put Fifteen Percent of way\nAnd a Fifteen Percent is more than one route that re for you guys but conceptually if you just even if you did Seventy five hundred thirty seven hundred fifty bucks each\nThat'd be fun or if you did fifty five hundred and two thousand and the other name that's fine if they're in the same mutual fund you're going to get the exact same results whether you split it or not doesn't change a thing\nAnd James is with us from Fort Smith Arkansas Hi James how are you\nGood thank you for taking my call sure what's up my wife and I are planning to buy a home next year and have a little trouble deciding or for agreeing on type house would not want to get some kind of outline and towards getting a fixer upper\nThere'll be a cheaper house with lower mortgage payment ... and that gives me the opportunity to learn\nLearn how to do those our parents myself mhm and she wants to move on ready house mhm\nOkay and it'd be your first home\nThey are second all we've had a house for a while ago and then we moved can look in rent printing for well over a year now you know\nThe other home that you had was at a fixer upper it was not it was ... ... ... and um so what is her fear\nIt's just for a we have to cook it you know and so it's kind of a hassle Amanda how ... I didn't want anything major just you know there's some minor cosmetic type stuff\nBut I couldn't you do it for you moved in\nA financially I think we'd be able to afford rent and a mortgage\nNo I'm saying oh yeah okay I see what you're saying that you use a fixer upper would take a few months maybe and you wouldn't have to do is ...\nI'm a part time real estate agent so I live in a house for two years and then turn around and sell it\nI can sell it tax free\nShowed any way out of my adult because so attracts for anyone\nTo be a real estate I show how structure where you first residents should be limited to your factory grows on that anyone for anybody [noise]\nI don't think there's a I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to this is just a question of what you guys want to endure it is your home and we are homeless topsy turvy because it's being renovated all the time\nSome valid point on hers you're not going to make as much money on it to your point so it's a valid argument\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches or being reported every day and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy now I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked out when they become an identity theft victim\nAnd those who have credit or id monitoring plans to\nFind out really quick how unprotected they are in so many ways that's why ... id theft plant to our benefit package was such a smart move the Sanders plan covers all types of Heidi theft takes over all the work and even covers your bank account if it gets act I know my team is getting the broadest\nOkay I currently have a four hundred thousand dollar term policy so\nOkay yeah then that she's probably All right without the survivor benefit because that's going to replace your forty thousand dollars that you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay that that that invested ... percent will be forty grand so that that's pretty good you're in good shape\nAnd you can probably do it this way um\nI Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\nYour ear in a way above average shape I'm In good shape is is is way above normal because normal just sucks okay you got to weigh better than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life\nFor the next forty years is going to get old\nAnd you don't really have any income coming other than that because your investments aren't big enough to create it and so I\nWould you know how you can do it you can do it but I think you need to have in the back of your head you may be going back to work at some point\nI'm considered that I've thought about it for health insurance and um [noise] um and I've heard of these mega share programs do you\nThink this is not driving this for me for what's driving it for me is you don't have much money\nRight and you got the pension but I understand you know think about what what are\nYou know forty thousand dollars is going to buy in forty years when you are Ninety\nNothing yeah nothing that's the problem was got here so\nThan you are Ninety\nNothing\nNothing\nThat's the problem with a guy out here so it doesn't have a good long term prognosis of you guys just being a live and we get better how you could live without a million dollars a mutual fund it just becomes like a no brainer\nInstead you got like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe voice grape everything together episode overall properties and\nYou know the farms got value but it's not producing any money so what might what I'm thinking is ... and again you can do whatever you want to talk it through with you OK I'm not saying you're you're you're you're wrong or you're bad or something but that's my concern of what I'm hearing\nIs and so I probably would think about what we always call an encore career and say what could you do that would be really fun\nThat you could make fifty grand or a hundred grand doing for the next five or six seven years\nAnd you enjoy doing it shorter business you'd have fun doing it and make some bank and bank all of it and health insurance as part of the day I don't care if you're working for somebody else you start a business but just do some what you're doing out and make your smile anymore so you need to get out of there\n[laughter] you picked up on that her yeah and so you know but I but I mean when you're you're young you have a lot of a lot of\nService to humanity left inside of you that you could get paid for\nIdeas concepts things you could do I don't know what it is but something that just I mean I I'm just a little bit older than you I'm fifty seven and David I plan on work and it's not 'cause I Need money I don't really they monitor got money coming in layers but I'm working because I have a vast\nYou ought to find something like that and then you can work in the hunt and fish and work and hunt and fish and farm and you know but but\nYou know I'd like to see your bank another five or six hundred grand and the next eight years and have fun doing it\nThat's what I'm saying that's what that's the only challenge of got is I think there's God's got something to Saudi you there's something you could do more than hunting and fishing that\nNot the table or by this law you've earned the right to do that and you should get out of the place you're getting outta but what's your encore career you take a bow and you come back out on the stage for the encore that's what the encore career as a lot of people in like a lot of money on that Richard\nShow is not that money's everything but I I just want you to have a little more pad between you and Murphy then this scenario gives me here\nAnd I think there's some magic left inside of you that we all need still that's what I'm saying and\nIt might be you take a year and you do nothing behind fishing farm and then usually at the end of that year I'm going to go to ... and that's okay\nBut but Ninety ... for for the next four years oh you're a guitar fishing [laughter]\nYou know a lot of fishing [laughter] so so\nFind something makes you smile and you know that's

how are you [noise]\nI'm fine and yourself better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nWell the reason I'm calling today to talk about bankruptcy so my wife and I combined we have about a hundred and thirty four thousand dollar than that I'm\nA hundred thousand is student loans and the balance will be a credit card debt\nWe recently met with a financial adviser and they suggested that we filed for bankruptcy because it would take us a long time to pay off the bat they suggested that saying that it will be better for us to just start fresh and I just wanted a second opinion\nWhat is your household income sure\nOh combined it's about eighty five\nOkay you have any car debt\n... mhm I'm no we don't our cars are paid off\nOkay what are your car's worth\nUm [noise] I Would say about twenty thousand combined\nOkay All right\nWell here's the facts that the quote unquote financial advisor didn't know\nUm apparently or he wouldn't have given you such stupid but advice student loans are not bankrupt double\n\nHere we did talk about that during the conversation they never go away but he was just thinking entirely because of the amount of credit card that we have\nFollowed like our ability and really have a light a match wait a minute this moron suggested your bankrupt with thirty four thousand dollar for the credit card debt with a household income of eighty five thousand\nThat's absurd dude that's what I was thinking\nThat's absurd does the ... the hundred thousand dollars for a student loan doesn't change anything because it's it's going to be there regardless if it's not a bankrupt ... so we're dealing with you're going to file bankruptcy and thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five no you should pay it off in one year\nAnd a year yeah one year live on safety\nPay it off in one year take six extra jobs shell so much stuff you can't breeze no eating out no vacations and you're a hundred percent debt free in one year what are your car's worth\nYeah I'll call the work world Tony okay each\nUm hers is a newer mazel over oh they're so\nProud of ours are working on her her's is worth what about Thirteen thousand mine is about seven mhm\nOkay well um\nCan do what you want to do I if I woke up in your shoes I have to tell you I've worked with families that were in dire straits over the years\nYou're not one of those if you choose to file bankruptcy is just 'cause you're two dead young lazy to address the situation let's even say you did it over two years it's only Seventeen five a year\nAnd your debt free other than your student loan which I'm not talking about the student loans will be gone in one year I'm Talking about the credit card debt to be going in one year\nSo how fast do normal people that call the Dave Ramsey show that work our plan pay off a hundred and thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five about four years probably\nAbout four years yeah\nThat's the normal routine for people around here that would be student loans and everything and um you know I I Would not move down in car initially\nOut of your wife's car into a into a six thousand dollar or five thousand dollar car initially I might end up doing that as we go along we'll see how it goes what do you do for a living sir\nI'm operations manager\nI'm okay and what does she do for a living\nThrough the past the okay\nAll right cool um does she ever do any outside speaking for money\nI'm no windows ... that's about it gun or does she do speaking Miami says she speak on Sunday mornings\nYeah see that's very very different under\nOkay All right I mean I Wonder if if you know she might feel do some ... occasionally for somebody that was ill or on sabbatical or something in that congregation pay or a little bit or\nMaybe she works and evangelists to outrage and they pay you are a little bit for speaking skills or maybe dot dot dot you do something I don't know I mean if you add ten Fifteen thousand dollars a year to this equation\nOf income and you guys tightened down your budget than nothing I mean nothing where you have no life because we're going to clean this mess up you know you can clean up the whole thing in four years maybe three but four for sure uh any clear up those student loans really\nReally really fast as a part of that equation I'm Sorry though that credit card debt as a part of that equation really really fast but you got to cut them up you've got to quit using them and you got to stop living the way you've been living goes it's not working agreed\nOn despair is that makes sense yeah something like that\nNow the Bible says that no discipline seems pleasant\nAt the time but it yields a harvest of righteousness you guys make good money so I Know you're not stupid people you're not ...\nYou're not dumb you just been doing some dumb things which makes you just like most of it was added a lot of dumb things in my life to a win money in particular as high end up teaching is because I got a P. H. D. and D. U. N. B.\nBut um you know if I don't I don't know who it was they gave you this advice but you need to stay away from them\nBecause they gave you really really bad advice that's my opinion I think you can not only can work through this I think you should work through this\nI think it'll be a testimony to God's power and you're all his life that you turn this around and that you attack at an attack at an attack at and that you can start having a sense of self control the sense of discipline and it'll change your marriage on communication levels it will lower the stress when you're working the plan together\nAnd you can do anything how old are you guys\nUh two twenty a town I just turned thirty two\nExcellent show when you're thirty six and she's thirty two year debt free as I feel\n\nSorry for the life no vacation glow eating out for a short period of time for a short period of time you\nLive like no one else\nNo one else I think about what how much how much money you would have and how well the you could become and how generous you could be if you didn't have any payments right now\nOh my gosh\nI think about the piece that will be in your house the stress that would be gone\nSo it's worth it to pay a price to win\n\nBut there's a price to be paid the price would be bad you got your own home and you don't get out of a whole lot jumping out usually you climb out scratching and

we're back undercover again okay would retreat enough to get undercover in the battle but we're not gonna as we're not going to surrender\nTo the to that we want to take that ground back again someday\nBut for today are for the next two years or whatever it takes to turn it around absolutely I make this move definitely make that move it all sounds very logical to me good question I ride Derek with us in Phoenix, Arizona Hi Derek welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey how's it going his honor to talk to you to have you too sir how can I help you while you're talking a money maker her book or just changed our lives I got it as a wedding gift and it was the best wedding gift we implemented it\nAnd pay off twenty two thousand dollars a day ... months and then that ... free sense so it's been awesome good um my question to you [noise] and then you help with this because sometimes I feel like I'm controlled by the year and over stinking when do you quit your day job which is good\nTo go fulltime entrepreneur\nDo you have the full time job or do you have the entrepreneur gig running\n[noise] yeah that's what my wife does she sells the clothing for that little row um and she's doing very good at it and so I work for a local government here in town a mechanic just trying to figure out when that time is to leave that retirement and benefits\nAnd so I work for a local government here in town a mechanic just trying to figure out when the time is to leave that retirement benefits should security\nYou wouldn't believe it was her the mechanics thing to sell women's clothing [noise] the [noise] school because she argue already involved in the business\nYes she's been shown it for a year and a half um she's she's ... she she makes in one week would I make a gross in a month as a mechanic\nMhm um so I wouldn't be going fulltime helping her with English and shipping in the back office stuff while she sells all the dresses and ... ...\n... ... ... and what do you make a make fifty two thousand a year\nYou can't hire somebody cheaper and fifty two thousand dollars a year to work in the back office shipping stuff\nWould that be the the best route to go\nIs less pretend OK you walk away from fifty in order to really job you could have hired somebody for twenty to do\nThat comes to a short\nWhile she she gross is she is gross two hundred and ten thousand so far this year\nI don't care what she grocers okay unless you're going to add more to her business in savings okay or in revenue than what you are making now than it is not making sense\nOkay 'cause grossing two hundred and ten is fine as long as your expenses aren't at three hundred and ten no yeah she's got cost goods sold out of that that's not profit we're talking about there\nYeah ... is a is around a hundred thousand out of that\nShe's going to have taxable income of a hundred K. and she needs somebody to do are shipping\nShe needs a lot of help she's ... we're working to fulltime jobs that were working from eight AM to kinda eleven twelve sometimes mhm okay\nSo the question then becomes what are you going to add not can you quit okay so it's just a business perspective it because the other thing to scare me here is if if this thing\nA ... out on you then you're both out of work if you quit yes if it flamed out on you if the fad the ashes on this particular clothing line five years from today is this thing still operating this multi level deal right\nUh well we're I guess you'd call multi level\nMarketing and I would call him it's on network marketing thing your recruiting people\nKnow that's that's the misnomer a that's a misconception of ... I buy wholesale\nShow retail just like a discount store buys Michelin or Cooper Tires I you don't ... you don't recruit people\nYou can but yeah you can also okay\nUm no I I Would hire somebody to do the shipping\nTwenty thousand version\nAnd then when it gets so big\nAnd you're making so much money [noise]\nThat that you can't see that you buy you in the money and you weren't with then that's fine but right now I think you're caught up in the high [noise]\nThis is a rancher show\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money there\nYou don't get each has dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money they have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their well being would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to Sandra insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six\nForty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible it really does make you the hero of your story and they put you on course\nFor better things ahead\nNo now meet Neal Gail within the breed character you can find any any how\nThey just trade what ever they catch and like your brother in law\nThey never leave and you make them\nNeal deal get help with dealing with this problem\nBio saved environment helps you safely address molding mildew issues in any business or home with their environmentally safe treatments they help you get rid of the problem without using harsh products for unfriendly treatments smoldering Neal do or not your friend and if you even suspect they may be present in your walls floors or damaged areas it's time to act because\nThey'll never go away on their own they love mosquitoes date stamp places so you have to take action visit B.
