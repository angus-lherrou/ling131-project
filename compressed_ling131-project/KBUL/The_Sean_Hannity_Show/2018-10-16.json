good and reliable employees in the industry that doesn't usually use rather than meets the higher the how can the gadgets hoping to brave certainly the one way that we can possibly find reliable and get people to be a part of this law candidates it\nOr\nYou don't know any painters that are good and a lot of people well we do know painters um that are good I don't really ... ... that's the part is that there hasn't been reliable you don't know any painters that are good and reliable people\nWell we do know that and it's they have their own businesses as well\nMhm so the only painters that you know that are good and reliable people already have their own business\nFor the most part yet because they work we're trying like we we put 'em all that on Craig's list and like nobody's responding to it and so I just we just don't know where to look in order to get\nWell most of the turnout would rely people run around with good reliable people yeah and then most of the time to push is run around with due to ...\nSo usually when I'm looking good reliable people I look around other good reliable people not could be that you look and some of the other trades and you know one electrician that's a good person or a trim carpenter that's a good person and you start asking them who do they know that's a great\nPainter but you could bring your own to the job\nA part of the problem they jot as you're in a very very hot construction market in Denver and so every body's got work even do ...\nYeah and your has your husband's got my work in a hand or maintenance so that that you've got a bit of a labor shortage or when you've got a construction boom always in the city and that's what you're facing a little bit of but the way I have found like you know an example in our world it wouldn't be a painter but in our world it might be someone that's in technology\nBut you are facing a little bit of but the way I have found like you know I think is ample in our world it wouldn't be a painter but in our world it might be someone that's in technology someone that is a a a great Rubio unreal developer as an example there's a shortage of\nTechnology and Web developer is out there right now in most cities including Nashville in Nashville is actually a tech hub\nBut um you know there's a shortage so where do we find those well we you know we'd go on like you've done website you go on Craig's list but we get in technology groups and associations and but mainly\nGreat developers no other great developers great painter isn't or the great painters or somebody is not a developer who has other influence in and other knowledge of the tech industry there's a great person will no somebody's developer and send them our way and of course you're going to pay them\nAnd pay them well and I'm a ... paying a new fish doesn't make them anything except that will pay ... so\nYou you want to pay people well but you that that's not the part of the only part of the equation as you've already discovered so the only way I don't know how to find them would be to find other people in other trades that are excellent and people in the\nPainting world that are excellent and try to move them onto your team once you get a couple of excellent people they will have a tendency to help you find the other excellent people uh sixty four percent of people that joined our team last year were internal referrals someone already working here\nThat was a thoroughbred wanted new in thoroughbred that wouldn't want them to work here in another area now we have the advantage of being a little bit larger and having a vast array of jobs not just a single job available but but how that's how I've always done it I've I've found thoroughbreds Roma thoroughbreds and donkeys run with donkeys\nAnd so you know you just got to find out find your thoroughbreds and and people on in the community the thoroughbred since I Do there is a steak dinner in it for you guys send you a good guy you sent him a steak dinner you send him nice seeing him and his wife through scripts or something because it's worth it\nTo get somebody in there and you know being being good that way and I'll tell you I'm gonna send you a copy of a book that is one of my favorite hiring books that I've written the last two years and it's from my friend pat Lynch you only it's called the ideal team player\nAnd the ideal team player is three things hungry humble and smart hungry humbling smart\nAnd that's what you're looking for in any position in any organization in every trade and every organization has some people to qualify other high quality people every single one\nAnd if you can put them together in a trade that by and large is not that kind of people then you really a brand differentiated yourself from the other people in your market place\nSo hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we will send that to you open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five five two to five or ... is with us in Wilmington, Delaware\nHi Lucia how are you Hi there thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nI'm I'm a new car and I ... and ... and my question actually that out of the four oh one K. profit sharing with my former employer I Lived it over like you said ... role ever IRA\nAnd then I got a statement and allow yesterday basically there was a other section when the fees or over three thousand dollars and I further looking into it there how fortunate perfect I'm there for eight different ... and had to come here every three thousand dollars of my money\nHow much money was in there that much actually it was only around the Eighteen thousand dollars\nI don't I'm not aware of a mutual fund that has a forfeiture fee\nThan looking I Am it's a ... eight different names and then it said for\nIt was and it adds up to almost thirty one hundred dollars that's a yeah I thought I thought especially when it was only you know a small four one K. to begin with\nYeah really um did you roll it with a smart Mr pro\nI wrote it ever into a previously on another area that I had already event\nSo you don't have an advisor\nI don't care\nI'm\nI Am sorry I Do not know the answer to your question our normal into the ... the only thing I can guess is is that you bought a ... that your company your former company the mutual funds are high the mutual fund or some gun\nThat have got some kind of gotcha and they're obviously okay but I don't know what they are go ahead and get in touch with one of the more of us are pros in your area and just see if they will answer that question for you okay maybe they can tell you exactly what happened at least you'll have the mystery solved die Ramsey too stupid to answer that question because I just don't know the answer\nThe others don't that I'm Sorry I Wish I did read Joel is with us in a Decatur, Alabama Hi Rachel how are you\nI'm a great day how are you for taking my call\nSure what's up [noise]\nSo my employer is going through open enrollment or our health insurance benefit and I'm kind of on the bed and I'm hoping that maybe he could kind of helped me ...\nUm they've introduced a high deductible a program with an H essay which they will be contributing to and I'm trying to decide that I keep my traditional the the a plan or should I jump on board with his high deductible plan\nOn how much is a premium on the ...\nThe premium only eighty to ... pay period they calculate to about Twenty one hundred a year\nAnd what about the other one\nThe other one will be around thirty four hundred a year\nAnd try and thirty four hundred to Twenty one hundred she'll Thirteen hundred dollar spread yet and try and how much does the doctor will only that\nOkay so on the radio it will be four hundred per individual or the ... and for the high deductible it's Thirteen fifty per individual but there is a twenty seven hundred for the family\nYou know and how uh how old are your kids my kids are ten and Thirteen are there any ongoing illnesses or something by Ron Howard the duck double\nTap into well I'll say like why am I right now we just hit that adoptable at one of our family members emerging about it in a year or so I said\nOkay so here's the thing you just compare your Thirteen hundred savings versus the actual risk you're tracking\nWere fairly healthy we don't usually run to the more so the hot adoptable lower premium makes a lot of sense for us and that's how you look at it\n\n\nAsked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity\nNot a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace those stay at home parent responsibilities I only recommend term life insurance since is the most affordable way to get the right amount of coverage and not break your budget go to ...\nMy hero yeah how do you do that what do you tell them what's the key to getting out of debt\nI think it's the budget you gotta start there um and I think now on this side of it you just have to believe that it's going to work and just keep plugging away at it um\nAnd small steps add up to a giant stuff at the end\nAnd I I Would add to that ah the giving them the ties in um was really cold I mean where\nWhen we started I used to routinely saying click while we're driving in church like boys what we're give what we're tied into the church today you know we could do this or do that and\nI'm just slowly over time that's changed and I don't have this um you know deficit mentality any more aware and taking away it's we've learned how to live have joy\nWithin our means and once you hit that point it's um it just makes the road a lot easier to drive\nKnow so you have a two hundred and fifty thousand our mortgage approximately when you started this and um it didn't seem real that would ever get paid off somewhere along the line you looked up and said\nOh this is going to work and it started like you were writing downhill instead of climbing up he'll you know what I'm Talking to our living point do you remember where that was in the mortgage balances like when you got it down to fifty or to go down to a hundred or when was\nThis but I think it was last year I I went back to work for one year and it all of my income went towards a mortgage because it was about\nFifty fifty thousand laps and we just just piled on every month and it was like you just can't counting down month by month we're going to make it and it was\nIt was off it'd be you wouldn't have even going back to work if you didn't already have those numbers calculate knew it was just for a year now they're talking to this year we're done by some in for a year\n... you can embrace a year of pain so by Ben you knew it was really going to happen it was real it was before that that you believe that yeah I mean we were under water on her mortgage for about three four years for me it was like when we\nUh oh it as much as what the equity was um then it like started feeling you know we can breeze and and now at least we can sell it and get out of it around right

out what the president value of those payments are because that's what you're going to receive and that's what they're saying that they're offering you and it's probably the discount rate is the
