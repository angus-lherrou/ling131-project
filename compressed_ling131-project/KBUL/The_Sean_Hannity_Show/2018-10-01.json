you are oh sorry how much of that car a Seventy nine of the car okay so most of it's a car okay yeah mhm\nAnd then a a eighty five hundred a school mhm and I wanted to use that savings that I made to kind of put a down payment on your home but after listening to show not exactly sure how it should go about it\nAnd then what's your household income fifty to five\nGood for you okay well I I Want you to get into another home I don't want you to do that with a debt\nSo we've got two options um one is pay off everything and rent for a little while and save up a down payment and then by or two is sell the car gets bigger and use the money that you would have paid on the car is your down payment and pay off student loans\nTo either one's fine with me I'm the cars not that abusive it's just it's just the large lion's share of the problem right so the you know what kind of car is it\nIt's a twenty sixteen showed emailed the people I get I Love it okay All right well I mean do you want to rent for a year in order to keep it\nAll I'm renting now so I sold my condo and I'm renting now you know I mean well it's funny you home because they're all okay with that\nSo if you just you know write a check and be debt free today and then ... money really really really aggressively for a year and you've got your down payment right\nYeah and that's you know what that's what we're doing but a debt while you're moving into the home with your emergency fund in place um and your debt free which is how we always tell you to buy a house I'm open you know sometimes we you know where you're selling and buying you have to do it a little differently but in your case it's kind of cut and dried isn't it\nYeah it's a pretty simple pretty simple analysis you're either going to solve the car and buy a house now or you're going to keep the car and buy a house next year\nWriting months or something like that how long you want to save up to do that and I I think that's what I Would do probably in your situation um yeah I think it is Karen is with us in Miami I Karen how are you\nWe have 'em as he recalls great how much it I'm about thirty thousand dollars maybe a little bit more depending on this [laughter]\nAnd we were trying to figure out what to do we have one last month over to the ... down on our house mhm oh we\nAll agree with that we could all that without our emergency finally started finding retirement and we have girls that are nine years old and we didn't know if we had ... and in their college fund or if we could pay off on the other conquer than on the house at that point like on\nHow much is that the Trump or something I'm about thirty thousand years at all it would take it all OK and what's your interest rate on your home\nOh for\nSure it about market there and you are a hundred percent sure that thirty thousand dollars will cause the amount of be dropped\n... we talked about it will be thirty one thousand them what we have we have the money to do it\nYeah and you can

you fought\nA feller ... foot high crime honorary hired in my line of income\nHousehold income or around and play with a hundred thousand\nOkay here here's what here's where you are in our baby steps and you've probably already know this but let's review show our\nOther listeners are caught up you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement orange you\nCorrect yes baby step for five is kids college the Sixers payoff files are like so really the question is where we can put this all five or we'll put this on six there's not I mean ... there's not a dumb or wrong answer here either one is fine\nWhatever makes you feel good whatever's good idea I'm I'm probably going to take twenty thousand of this\nAnd put ten each in five twenty nine pounds for these girls\nHow come you're getting your college sneaking up on your fast\nAnimals throw the other ten at the house um and then I'm gonna system and then I'm going to set up a monthly amount to add to the ten beginning at the first of the year so that they ... are kind of on auto pilot and so you're going to put you know ten thousand and plus hundred bucks a month each or something like that not in my\nCurrent I'd be on a ... year old\nGirl and then you know then we can just spreading around but however you want to do it but ... I Want to put a substantial amount orange college and then you make enough to be able to just beat on this mortgage pretty rapidly but six hundred dollar a year or return on the thirty one thousand dollar\nInvestment is not that great but yeah so I'm going to start the kids' college and then I'm going to just start paying off the house the natural result of working your baby steps six is you're

I'm I counted up to 'em that they're taking care of it so\nCredit where do you mean they're taking care of that\nOr they ... they are fake I pay a whole lot I\nHang out with that now we don't need you to establish any more credit you don't need any that you you don't make enough money to breathe hardly okay so when you are one hundred percent that free\nAnd then you build an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses are like five thousand dollars of set aside for emergencies then you would start saving towards your home and by then you are also in your first apartment and you just start saving as fast as you can\nAnd you won't put down as much as you can possibly put down how old are you you said you're twenty four\nOkay go ahead well you got a good plan so hopefully in the next twelve to Eighteen months you can see that income spike up as you start using your cosmetology degree\nAnd um because you know when you were Thirteen thousand when you get your twenty six thousand quick as we can this doubling that's still not a lot of money but that'll at least get you out there and get your moving in and get your career to start to build\nSo hey thanks for the call we appreciate you listening Ian is whether it's a prince Edward Hi Ian how are you\n[laughter] Hi Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nMy wife and I we've got five ... five kids and we just moved into our dream on three years ago or ten twelve acres a lot through for the kids turn around but the last few mind for just started your plan where they just have to\nAnd we're just thinking um I mean we've got thirty five thousand at besides the house and we're just not sure if you want and we like to sell the house has to be free or which is ... through the next ten Fifteen Years in and just make it out than\nTen to Fifteen Years me pay my house and everything\nYeah like ... where you know we have twenty eight years left my mortgage\nMhm so what's your house you can come about Seventy K take home pay take home pay All right yeah and um then what is your house payment\n[noise] it is around twelve hundred a month\nOkay house payments not on the line here that's fun you know but you gotta lotta carrying you got a lot of kids and you're not used to living on a limited budget and you're going to start that\nWere egg yeah\nBecause you got thirty thirty five an hour to clean up I mean you really need to clean that up it's probably going to take ... year and a half two years but something like that you need you no longer than two years you need to have this debt cleaned up right what is the thirty five thousand in debt what kind of debt\nA law or the last my parents and part of it is lamp credits twenty five line of credit and ten grand and alone from our parents\nOkay Mm So just a line of credit what'd you bond with the line of credit\nOh it's just been life has just been there about a piano a few years ago [noise] or just miscellaneous things\nOkay and that's over right yeah not doing that anymore right\nNo no no we were like we are just sick and tired we just want to be free yeah we love the place\nI don't think they need I don't think you need to sell the house houses now killing your twelve hundred bucks out of a fifty eight hundred dollar take home by not out of line\nYou're oh you're okay on her house but you do have to get your written budget get on every dollar you're written budget and get that going as quick as you can every dollar dot com and I'm starting to you know using the app on your phone\nAnd you guys need to squeeze every dollar so that you clear there's thirty five because if you can clear the thirty five you're going to have pretty good room in this budget even with five kids and you can clear I did just going to take a year and a half two years just a year and a half two years or Seventeen five a year out of Seventy thousand take home that's doable\nYes I'll lay down and you can do that a thirty five thousand outta Seventy thousand with five kids that means one year I don't think you're going to do that so somewhere between the one in the two and that's how I'm landing on Eighteen months Richard is with us Richards in Salt Lake City Hi Richard how are you\nGoing great got how can I help [noise] so I Would go wandering about emerging pick on we have a fully funded emerging that uh of three to six months [noise] good to have about\n... came out and then now I'm at my job offer an H up they account match up to Fifteen hundred dollars a year great um should should I fully fund the account and shit I count that\nTowards the handler emerge Fonda\nHolly funded to get that match that's wonderful and the ... of course can only be used for one kind of an emergency and that's medical bills it will lots of other kinds of emergencies pop up and so um do you do you do both of you work in this house for as a single income\nYou know single and I'm okay and what's your household income of around sixty and what do you do er nurse\nYour nurse okay very very stable career\nMeaning that if you were to lose a job you can get another one in twenty minutes nursing is just a fabulous career field so in terms of ah accessibility even add hours anytime you want to add hours you can back it off you can change direction all kinds of stuff you just really and landed in a sweet spot there so very very good on that\nGiven that you've got that type of a career that's not\nSo specialized that it might take you six months to find a job if you lost it or something like your six minutes um then given that that's the situation I Would back and do you fully fund you're at it you find that I just say between the three to six months of expenses range I Would back down to three months\nOkay and so that's kind of like partially leaning on the ... say as part of your emergency fund but it's certainly not we're not really counting it because I mean you can have lots of emergencies that have nothing to do with medical on your life\nWhen you can get you again you could lose your job you could um have the death of a relative and you had to pay for the funeral or wanted to pay for the funeral you can have all kinds of different things happen transmission blow out of the car and all kinds of things that can happen that aren't\nMedical and you can't use the ages for anything but medical [noise]\nSo I don't generally counted in the emergency fund but I'm looking at your career stability and the fact you got a big fat I just said with a big fat match on it which is just wonderful both of them then that makes me very comfortable being on the three months side of the three to six months\nRange for your emergency [noise]\nQuestion I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance to replace your income for someone who counts on your show if you have a spouse or you have kids yes you need term life insurance is\nThe only way to protect them until you're out of data to build up your wealth you're only digging deeper hole if you waste money on cash value plans since it robs you of the ability to make real progress and that's why I send you to the sand or insurance and I have for\nAlso very cool well we're glad we're part of it gives you guys are heroes man what a great story you're absolutely right what do you tell people the key to getting out of debt is\nI'd say there's a few things are obviously one hundred percent if you're not a team with your spouse there's no way you're going to get out of that I don't see how it was enough troubles and trials in life that if you guys I'm working together at Thursday's when I was struggling that she wasn't and vice versa\nUm and then obviously the plan that you guys set forth um and then you have to be with yourself and I think not not live the entitled lifestyle that you're going to borrow other people's money to lose I mean\nYou know we talked about this and if you make thirty thousand dollars in this country are more blessed in probably Ninety nine percent of people in the world and I think you just kind of have to wear your shoulders and say hey this is what I Want and\nIt wasn't fun you know she was she was working three literally three jobs she had three different jobs really I got credentialed at another university and I would go and cause I have a lot of time off with my job and I I didn't want to I didn't want to drive three hours and stay the night on my days off and and at the university and and work extra but\nYou know seeing them in the rearview mirror made me want to do with that much more and just get it done and it's you know I I mean what did you might get that gift for my average income was probably you know without working extra is probably one Seventy five I'm not much on that extra\nProbably another ten or Fifteen just in the short period of time and then and then I started getting more opportunities at my at my institution um and you know I I got the only lease it I think you would approve of\nThis is Dave Ramsey least um when I sold my truck I was going on Craig's list and I was gonna buy a beat her for a thousand bucks in my dad's got more cars and he knows what to do with and I said hey I'll give you a thousand dollars if you let me drive the Pontiac for the next year and it's an old beat up Pontiac and I'm driving two miles to work in um said
