just wanted to mention the whole double standard between a fact comes from Clinton President Clinton and then how Hillary accused Rudy killed all her all the all the people that she abused and then\nYou got Keith Ellison where there's plenty of evidence and accusations against him where there was no best vacation but\nIt's basically the double standards\nIf they were here you're raising a great point if they cared about the issue they would be demanding FBI investigations\nWe can go back now to Juanita Broderick and we can certainly go back to Keith Ellison where there's Dr reports and text messages and audiotape maybe even a videotape of him\nYou know being emotionally abusive physically abusive towards his ex girlfriend so yeah I think that would be a consistent opposition for them to take but they never ever going to do that are they\nPretty much it promotes the Democrat agenda\nWell that's it I mean that's what it all comes down to politics alright Christian good call we appreciate it All right let's go to Don is an Iowa Don how're you we got about a minute it's whole yours sir\nHi shot at you for taking my call and thank you for a continually bringing up the true for everybody\nI'm Glad to be here every day thank you for giving me this microphone\n[laughter] I'm basically all I wanted to say is is the obvious\nThis of this whole case is that um Ford is perfectly willing to do to judge Kavanaugh\nWhat she has accused him of doing it to her assaulting her or him on a daily basis with this fall state in the first and then just so much fake uh evidence everywhere\nListen she she identified and there's a there's a part of me that really sympathizes with this is such a serious issue and and I don't think we give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled this including the president they handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves\nShe gave the names of four people and none of the fork in corroborate her story including the guy that was supposed to be an eye witness to it at that point\nThey really can't go any further with it and he adamantly denies it so it's um it's a matter of just simple okay if somebody corroborated it we'd be in a very different position today I got to take a quick break final have power\nFree for all our Sean Hannity show and we will continue from our nation's capital Hannity tonight nine eastern on Fox\nAnd you're listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show we'll have more of your favorite gas topics and memorable moments that's all coming up [noise] [noise]\n\nHi Michelle mocking here if you tell them I work you know the one of the biggest outrageous I reported on with the trial of abortion doctor ... now\nAnd how the woman goes into a funny comes out data there is no police report and\nI helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions directly from governor reasons not to fact of course when the guy was he came to me for help I jumped I personally donated to make sure this film got me because no movie opens open your mouth it's amazing\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they fall for this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to\nDebate the details of this or that tastes when actually there's nothing to do with the details with justice without this is a tactic designed to hold onto power when\nRon ... an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the San Francisco to erase squash this has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some use some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron dissenters as a racist you knew that it was going to happen because it had to happen\nAt work right there there are in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad in Missouri by the Democratic party said uh you know be like Republicans black cross a crosses are going to be burnt on people's lawns\nA ... well the James Byrd at I mean Al Gore telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you in the census at all\nAnd just really outrageous claims and you know one of the things I'd like to see come out of this that what has now become a predictable tactic that they get called out on this Brett Kavanaugh up until two weeks ago yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen\nAnd now all of these allegations all of these solicitations\nAnd it doesn't matter like if Michael ... is making the claim that thirty six years ago\nThat there was a gang of boys that were routinely drug ing girls and then waiting in line to gang in trail rapes them and that this was happening with a regular occurrence but nobody said it at the time nobody told\nA parent that it just kept going on and was covered up for this long but there's I Know where I go to where I went to school at one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds\nWorld tradition kill us I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive public gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody and no one else does either in she on the\nTenth one was right for self and didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven years okay I don't have time for that actually there's a whole country\nWith all sorts of real problems to address it tends to what you really have to be a Republican senator since you had to take that seriously these people fall for the same gag every single time it's been the football\nAnd you have like the senator from Arizona's like really need to get to see hearing really if there are plausible claims being made yes they should be investigated this is a guy who's had six FBI investigations into his background in space Twenty years who had a clearance that allowed him ... codes to nuclear arsenal\nHe was fat vetted\nAnd yet we need another on the basis of claims that have no sense to actually shut all member attacking Christian for it I'm just making the obvious point she claims that this happened she named for people she says repressive off or say it didn't happen and no one has the brass to ask questions and I mean\nLook it's a joke is what's actually happening it's a joke and only the Republicans in the Senate don't know it's a\nJob well this is either some said they had no recollection amber of anything like that ever happening or being at any party in the case of a best friend she said well I I don't doubt what professor Ford and saying about I don't have any recollection\nBut also professor of foreign identified one person and that was mark judge mark judge having been in the room when the alleged assault took place\nAnd he has said over and over again that's not true\nNow they made statements under penalty of felony\nAnd if they so when the FBI goes back to them if they changed their story they would be admitting to committing a felony\nSo I'm not really expecting a whole lot to change here except now the Democrats put out a statement earlier today and they are now demanding all the witnesses telling the FBI how to do their job and meanwhile when they had a chance last week to talk about Mr Ramirez or\nA Michael ... client they passed it and they punted and they didn't bring it up\nBut now they want to end it into that aspect didn't put so\nBut why we playing along with this I mean they actually\nThat I can tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra work done it was supposed to be limited in scope and uh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way\nJeff Flake is not in control the Senate they could pass it without flake and where are the leaders other than ... and I hate to say it Lindsey Graham seems we only person\nWilling to tell the truth but we're the rats were the other Nineteen Republican senators out there on television and make their case not just for Brett Kavanaugh but common sense and presumption of innocence but where are these people and\nThey they control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of the agenda pretty much that the president Lana under giving the finger to their own voters and on this one thing they can't just tell the truth\nWhy is that some art and were they afraid of exactly I don't understand\nWhat do you think that you've been in cable news a long time you were back in the crossfire days I think even had a stint shortly at MSNBC I don't know how that worked out for you but\nUh I got fired yeah um well I mean I think they are one opinion network and that's it and as Paul conspiracy all hate Trump all the time but I'm now you've been doing really well in the Fox news channel news shows doing really well and a ...\nHappened with cable news today I mean we're on the opinion side of things and Fox obviously as a news division but I kind of look at what I Do is talk show host as being the entire newspaper we report news sometimes it straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions or their interviews where people give opinion\nUm we do sports we do culture pop culture it's to me it's the whole newspaper all these other people claim to be reporters and they're anything but\nWe break a lot of news on our show and we have reporters working on the show there are only job is to find new things to flushed out\nInterviews I mean I you know I I had been in this my whole life to my family did I don't feel insecure about you know why you're not a journalist whatever I don't care what you call me but we bring new facts to light\nEvery night and I see are dropped more than ... workers to really confusing time it's I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen why did Trump got elected ... ... didn't get a black crow up what actually happened and what actually happened was\nThe people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions\nAbout our culture our economy our foreign policy they never sent sorry and they never learn anything and so voters got mad at punish them and good for them but why would so that's I that's what I think my job is is to explain what ... me and I think you know maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right now\nNo I think the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it I don't it like for example there'll be days on his radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that have opinions\nAnd that's what it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism it's part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway talk\nA little bit weird that like all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed to silence quiet [laughter]\nThere you know what I mean there are less than nine Tucker there's yeah I Know there's a handful of us Tucker there's not that many and by the way it is a orchestrated effort and millions of dollars being spent

win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to a rocket mortgage dot com\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed that these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes\nAnd the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWell the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mr Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't sure sure herself if it was Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News anymore if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate the stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nThey're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate the stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nOr even the Democrats so I'm declined to fully embrace street Julie sweat mix story but on the original story the Christine forward a story I think what we're going to find and what we're already finding\nIs that people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like PJ Smith and mark judge amazingly enough they're telling the FBI the same thing I told Judiciary Committee which they have no memory at all or to support this\nNow I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections or you're not remember\nA Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal of this party entry in Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two thirty six years in three months ago by the way\nI'm listening who is that the party and it didn't match up with a with Christine forks account of this but they thought this was a big deal so let's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that that I think there are three additional people calm Bernie and squeeze\nA who had not been interviewed earlier a and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about\nA Christian for it's a allegations so uh I listen I I I don't think this FBI thing FBI investigation is a bad thing I think that they will find out\nThat there is no evidence to support this did find out actual real evidence to support it than I've changed my mind but I don't think it's fair\nWell if you go through I I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell I'm now she's the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes and she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be\nExtremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so\nThey brought in an independent prosecutor to to question professor Ford who showed incredible respect to her\nBut she pointed out that he said she said cases incredibly difficult to prove itself\nAnd then she goes on this cases even weaker than that and then she Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues there was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault\nHappened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually the failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh as the assailant\nAre inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember key details\nWho invited forward to the party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place how did you get home from the party um and and it goes on from there but every case is similar in as much as there's no corroboration there are a big holes in the stories\nAnd at some point when do we ask is this becoming a witch hunt we know that Deborah Katz says her friend sending out emails\nAnd she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly consistent on the issue of of sexual misconduct and they're sending out letters to the deer so and so do you know anything please call us and you know those letters when ours\nI Know police some core operation you know the ... case right here at times they said they call they talked to dozens of people not to me that says twenty four people or more\nRight in the mirror at times they said they call they talked to dozens of people not to me that says twenty four people or more I mean that is a lot of people can look at it on on the Rachel ritual thing you know she was a lot of criticism of her and um I think that the the way she approached it was not\nA really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they always did she had to be interrupted every five minutes but she did\nIt listed a lot of information I was looking today at her questioning of a Ford about her therapist and the therapist notes and the white we even know about this because remember\nFord says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty thirty six years\nTwo thousand twelve and she ... she says she's in marriage therapy with her husband and she tells\nThe therapist about that and she later also tells an individual therapist\nAbout that as well and she checks the therapists notes and the therapists notes do not mention the name Brett Kavanaugh and she says as a matter of fact it's only her husband remembering that at the session she brought up Brett Kavanaugh's name\nThat is the only evidence\nThat it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the ... there are would be confidential but of course she gave them to the Washington Post so there's probably no longer a confidential so even even her account of how she finally\nMentioned this to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have the Judiciary Committee Democrats now they're wanting to investigate the quote ice throwing incident in college and this is what it sounds\nLike you're telling the truth is that that's what they say\nWell now we have the the democratic hope uh Hawaii senator the one that sent demand to just shut up and sit down on Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants that investigation into the ice throwing incident\nI'm at a ball game and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity\nAbout was he truthful about is drinking he said he ... he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college in high school kids I drink too much beer but they're saying well he must a blackout in this event um\nNobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said to somebody I blacked out correct so this is a fishing expedition this is now a destroy cabin on expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him\nSo here you know objects question mhm yeah go ahead we're out of\nThe things that he claims yeah I'm from an emphasis on me at the sex misconduct allegations too was he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact\nThat there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking although he mentioned many times in his testimony that he did um in fact\nDrink today vox published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking trick is mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nAre they going to let it go there thank you so much Byron York a widow sanctions on Washington Examiner eight hundred nine four one Sean is our toll free telephone number as we continue

victims people I Know in my life\nOf sexual abuse I Know there's evil in the world I wrote a whole book about evil people that would ever drug rape or girl are evil these people are predators\nThey need to get off our streets but you gotta have some collaboration to these things\nAnd it just comes out of Seventeen Days ago just on the eve of the confirmation vote for judge Kavanaugh and if you go issue by issue case by case you know it it comes down to do we believe in the presumption of innocence due process and simple common sense or do we believe in guilt by accusations\nBecause in each case there hasn't been any corroborating evidence at all in each case what you see is a lot of smearing a lot of smoke a lot of blood shunning but no evidence\nYou know in every single one of these cases they're shifting narratives and stories Kaylee Macedonia is with us author of uh the new American Revolution the making of a populist movement Jeffrey Lord former associate political director and the Reagan Administration he wrote the book a while ago way before\nAnyone else picked up on it what America needs the case for Donald Trump I think Jeffrey thirty four days out of a mid term election which historically has not worked out well for the the party in power in the White House um I Do believe there has been an energizing\nOr across the country are you ... if you will of pretty much anyone that his conservative fair minded Republican even never Trump or is that they recognize what is going on here and I think they're all pretty angry pissed off I think that's right Sean I talked to people\nUppers that they recognize what is going on here and I think they're all pretty angry and pissed off\nI think that's right so and I talked to people I mean people are living and I do

nonsense [laughter] this is a Lynch mob plain and simple\nAnd and let's be crystal clear here if President Trump not a ... nominated God himself for the Supreme Court they would find a reason to do this kind of thing and it doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh dropped out tomorrow which thank God he's not going to do\nAnd they substitute somebody else some version of this is going to happen again and again and again because at the end it's all about ... wait\nIt's all about the idea that they get to run the country from the Supreme Court instead of the Congress and that's what it's all about\nWhy would I think it is I I Do believe that after the the shock of November twenty sixteen I think that there's been a collective melt down by people on the left has and their and their outrage

said I'm going to make things better\nOh that's pretty simple way to win\nThe media has failed you accept the idea that President Trump is our president you saw that and underneath all animosity toward candidate Trump ... only increased tenfold when he became President Trump at something that they weren't prepared for the fact\nThat I seen the fake Rochelle roughly time without Robert Mueller and his team in ... accent fire announcing that victory all tore everything the president ties that would include judge Kavanaugh up the price side all of this is the fact that people are waking up and they're taking notice when you have to click on that show\nForty nine percent as opposed to forty five percent believe that this is harder than attack\nNear campaign I get to that cat and all that
