[noise] yeah yes and I lived there for most it doesn't ten and eleven I anticipate it something like this breaking and the reason I did it because when the president said this morning that he's sending secretary ... to Saudi Arabia that means the secretary of state when it does these people in the world\nCertainly in the government has canceled all the plans to fly halfway around the world\nUm I I Do is incredibly serious done and not to say\nAh we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with whatever it is so if there were parts you keep it believed and we're still going to have to because if if the records are out there is what what comes out or is that the Saudis are claiming some sort of responsibility for this looks like they're not going to they're going to claim the senior leadership was not involved\nBut that people are in charge of it in order to be held accountable there's a lot\nTo how was your that there's no until now because of how would they not know until now or what had happened in their consulate in Istanbul\n[laughter] that's a fantastic question and I think the big takeaway that I have from this report we'll see what happens the secretary\nOn pay me to them and let the readout as it does not only need to to come clean on this and satisfy President Trump the secretary pail you know they have an audience and the and the Congress and the Senate that they're also accountable to\nMind you this massive arms deal is a memorandum of understanding it has not been signed by the president there's bipartisan consensus for sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually\nThey're very vocally I'm an supportive of the relationship I don't agree with Senator Paul for a number of reasons that I could go into\nWhy I think the relationship it is important but the Saudis need to understand how serious that says\nWe need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to see massive\nA movement away from their big finance form it's just a few weeks secretary Mnuchin says to be there we saw the Dow fell off the south\nMassive a movement away from their big finance farm just a few weeks secretary that each insisted that we saw the Dow fell off this afternoon as reports\nAnd they were threatening stake here yeah well they were threatening\nYou know maybe even using the power of their oil of impact any\nOf the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S dam bond you know I mean it's getting more bizarre by the minute how does somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] [noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely she'll never really to aggravating factor year one year already brought up the fact that this happened I'm In a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single a protocol moral ethical role imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well and you know aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media not that this is ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm just suggesting that this makes it even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual or cause so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in a diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nIt's highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's the side that said way back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis there's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them where on a razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I do think Trump get one more thing or shall I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they seemingly tried to\nMake these veil threats that they were going to respond\nYou know we had to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah yeah and just\nTo say that the thing that not only the threats that worried me that Dan just said it seemingly the Saudis need to answer why they live with the president on this\nYou know the president came out and said that the king and ... among the crown prince that called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale unless there's something that we do not elevate it looks like they don't like it the president and I think that they need that there's a lot of explaining to be down there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and so we didn't know but I mean I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia\nOn the air and well okay you're going to happen I mean the the only been to women I\nChronicled the lot on this program and ...\nWomen voting and driving et cetera and and being told how to

to go out there and create fights and put start brawls I ... I won't support them\nThat's right I agree too now whether a group we're getting into some at Twitter group as a hate group has to do with its ideology and what it's doing\nWhy can't you will say that the media covers weekend you've heard of Proud Boys which is supposed to be I I read a male chauvinist group um and the that's the first time you've heard about a first time I've heard about it and people have been in the news for how long now\nAnd you're telling me well I barely know anything about them and you're also telling me something that I find kind of disturbing from you and that is to

no police report and\nI helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions not suspect or the ... amazing ... perhaps the most prolific through to live in America bring friends and family you do not want to pass up the unique opportunity to change hearts and minds about\nRedistribution scheme now if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors and we've talked about health savings accounts and we also talked about atlas MD Dr Josh amber\nAnd Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all if you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child\nThey negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction if you have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine at a greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store\nIt's actually it's now been implemented in his working in over five hundred practices around the country\nIt was pioneered by my friend Dr Josh ... joins us now atlas empty and Dr Lee as grows president of doctors were patient care I'm I Am I pretty much explaining it right is there anything I'm missing and I would call this concierge care for every American\nI the only problem is Sean every time you talk about it at our phones will start bringing and we've got regular patients to tell you I have a lot of them too right where we have a you know a A R over and over there and yeah we're fulltime family physicians but no you nailed it\nSo and you have all these ... now the bottom line is I think most people are like me and I have friends of mine that are doctors or you know and friends of mine that will take care of me friends of mine that will take a call at three AM if I'm not feeling well all which has happened occasionally in my life\nAnd these guys you know I ... I mean I pay them and they take my insurance does but they do it as more of our friendship but this is something every American can have access to\nAbsolutely\nYeah attacks plane how you're making it work there and how it works for your team exactly\nUh you know I think this is like a lot of things um Silicon Valley style\nOr Netflix or Amazon Prime uh people are being be Hoover they they want a better product faster cheaper easier and and that's what Dr gross and I've done with our respective clinics\nIs just decrease the paperwork the headache the half of the middle man so that now medicines are pay the pill now you can call ticks email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cell phone\nSo this is now they implement how many places did you get this finally up and running around the country I don't think you're explaining detail enough here explain exactly what this service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and\nIt's a flat membership rate based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits office visits ... free tele medicine's so you can call tax email your doctor we have no co pays for anything any procedure we can do in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies joined injections ultrasound heart monitors lung monitors um and then wholesale medications and labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out and let their doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they supported and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist in say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\nYet it's working everyone I think you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between you know\nThe Affordable CARE Act I mean we want to go down there they are trying to take us on the path of socialized total government controlled health care you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decision was based upon their individual DNA we're going to take a one size fits all approach to health care it doesn't make any sense and\nYou know Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump any more than Republicans Wachter healthcare chosen diagnose Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians into health care with it that the government control health care system when you can have a better way through a direct primary care relationship\nNot as we leave this is the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more and you get far in theory or care because it never really was about the patient really was always about\nRedistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth in America at the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income one percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners\nPay Ninety seven percent\nSo what they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young and generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need\nYou know allies them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying for one check up a year right out of their own pocket and also getting a catastrophic plan if God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or at a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr amber\nYep this is a one size fits all model um it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to\nEnsure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring you medicines that cost a penny a pill I can get a thousand ... blood pressure medicine for four dollars and Ninety cents\nSo the big box retailers will show you Ninety pills for ten dollars is highway robbery we knew cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases\nThe fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is can compete on quality\nAnd and lower the price just like your Fifteen minutes we'll save your Fifteen Percent on car insurance we need to get back to a competitive model for the patients are in control and cares affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nAnd where are you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do they are the innovators in this upfront pricing lower costs no government mentally All right well that's true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know for example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would then would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nNow health care of local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors and one thing that's clear the calorie is not coming from Washington to save us\nNow if we wait for ... from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other fix this problem themselves and that's exactly what this loop and the movement does is it eliminates\nAny it asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our ...\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but as it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the healthcare after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh number Dr ... gross the probably one of the defining issues that caused people make people think the Democrats are actually going to help them and it's not\nA we appreciate your time eight hundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone number if

Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist printed that she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nI'm male focused on Massachusetts whatsoever\nOn this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nBecause you're one percent are but she also herself deducted fifty thousand dollars worth of closed in one year to lower her own taxes ...\nFifty thousand dollars in old clothes that's like the Clintons deducting they're used the underwear as or if that's all true they did it as a tax deduction by the way I don't think anybody wants their old underwear\nAnd they put a value to it you know I've always said this Jeff that basically liberals are generous only with other people's money that we had the latest numbers from twenty sixteen come out and the ... bottom fifty percent of taxpayers in this country they only pay three percent of the bill just three we have redistribution\nTen percent pays forty percent of the bill you know I mean so I mean I don't know what else\nThe tax cuts the fact that they want their crumbs back they want to impeach Trump they want endless investigation they want to keep Obamacare disaster they want to eliminate eyes open borders I mean that's the whole thing and hate Trump that's it\nYeah she wants to get rid of ice in fact it was a Cambridge a warrant supporter about a month ago there was arrested for putting a five hundred dollar bounty on ice officers I mean you know her rhetoric actually is dangerous in when Republicans wanted to fix health care make it actually affordable about a year ago a she was the one that said the Republicans want blood money from the American people now this is right after\nThey wanted to fix health care make it actually affordable about a year ago she was the one that said the\nRepublicans want blood money from the American people know this is right after congressman ... had been shot by that Bernie Sanders supporters so you know she really doesn't seem to be able to temper her rhetoric whatsoever and I think if you saw on Monday after the backlash of putting that video out\nA and she got a lot of backlash around the country including Democrats like David Axelrod even was critical\nOr she went on a twenty six I Believe tweet a rant about Donald Trump I mean she's just obsessed with Donald Trump and has no focus at whatsoever on Massachusetts and what's important here whereas you know I've been a legislator here for eight years I'd actually\nPut ... billion dollars in tax cuts back in people's pockets and they know it and we've been campaigning pretty strongly I think that again you're going to be pleasantly surprised in November six with what happens\nIs that I Hope so are you may not notice about my background but I live five years in Rhode Island ah in Warren Rhode Island not far from the ... borders with Massachusetts and you know I spent a lot of time to sit by the way when it was the greatest NBA time in history with magic\nVersus Larry Bird and and parish McHale and DJ and Danny Ainge I mean it was probably one of the best teams in one of the best rivalries ever in sports I'm ...
