offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide to help folks maximize their benefits and say\nCare well let's all hardly they tried to fix it\nWell millions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie as well Republicans didn't support preexisting conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific battle\nAnd in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill that was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate is gone I mean it will all all Obamacare was was one huge redistribution scheme where you're going to have the young and healthy literally buying plans that they don't need or want be enforced by law habits or penalized if they don't get it financially and then literally\nRedistribute that money to the ... the elderly and disabled and some redistribution scam\nAnd meanwhile they're young to get off a lot better by paying for one doctor's visit a year to make sure they're healthy and\nBuying at their age you know catastrophic insurance which you know it's going to be like fifty bucks a month\nAnd in case they got cancer or heart attack or a bad accident so uh it was never fair to the people in this country they sold us a bill of goods and it never worked out the way they said it was\nExactly right we tried to repair it a ... and then of course we repealed it voted to repeal it and replace it with a much better program and then of course it failed in this\nThe only telling half the story which is that somehow we voted to repeal Obamacare and in doing so uh and the coverage for pre existing condition like the only way to have coverage for preexisting conditions\nIs Obamacare which was on its face absurd but\nThat's what they're doing everywhere now normally because people know me and the district 'cause I grew up here like you said and a\nLook you know we we went through hard times here my mom moved here as a single mom\nA running from the abuse of her father and my father and you know the and my brother grew up in a house with an outhouse no running water no electricity you know but we may well I've lived in the American dream Sean and so's everybody else in my family because we live in America and people will be here but they redistricted\nA you know they changed the district and then the other thing they did Sean was pump in all kinds of outside money and they're doing this everywhere but it's coming in from Soros style Bloomberg Michael Moore move on dot org and Nancy Pelosi you know she gave my opponent over a quarter billion dollars\nA to run ads against me and you know folks here just aren't used to that of course they're being barrage look all these wise on TV and they're thinking you know what's going on here you know we thought we knew her congressman and of course they do but they're having all these lies ... you know pumped into their TVs or every night and uh\nSo and listen to anybody that tells you that negative campaigning doesn't work they're lying that's why we keep saying it but this is the only thing they have\nTheir not going to talk about how the economy turned around in the last two years they're not going to talk about Thirteen additional ... Americans on food stamps after eight years of Obama eight million more Americans in poverty no president\nIn history ever you know he's the only one that couldn't reach three percent GDP Growth than a year he told us manufacturing jobs and never coming back he accumulated more debt than every other president before him combined\nThey don't want to talk about that part in order to talk about that one million new jobs or four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs are eight million fewer Americans on Americans on food stamps and poverty they don't want to talk about any of that\nWell that's exactly right because they have no message so you're right the whole campaign immediately went negative and ... and I'll tell you this to Sean of course now I've spent a over thirty five years in uniform and proud to do it\nMy opponent of course his my name is Scott Perry his name is George Scott I live in a little town called Dilbert he lives in a little town called Hillsborough I've got two kids he's got two kids I've got an army career he's got an army career so the ... D triple C pick this guy a just a run against me and of course also he now he is joining the clergy but\nEven though he's joined the clergy that hasn't stopped them from lying about the attitude of hundreds of thousands of dollars up on TV and you know we have reports from his congregation that he's literally asked for campaign contributions from the pulpit and he's actually campaigning is

guys and the Freedom Caucus we spend our time trying to do with the American people elected us to do without raising a bunch of money but this guy raised more money in one quarter than I did in over

friend of mine these amazing he did something that nobody else did they actually took the time to actually look at Donald Trump's real background railroads his family his father and you know you tell a lot of gripping stories in a book about how well the mean horrible landlords\nActually weren't so mean after all when people came on hard times they would work with people and help people\nThat's absolutely true story that's actually the Carol want a family in thirty forty your friends and stuff and I wanted to relate that story and an all tell it quickly\nOr Fred Trump showing up to collect

he gets a job pays the rent that he was owed a and it's just a wonderful story that their family never\nGoing to be told by the mainstream media above people talk about what does the president has compassion for these people does the president had the apathy and the answer is yes he learnt that at the uh riding shotgun with his father was he was either building these buildings helping to fill these buildings\nAre collecting rent from blue collar people that were living shot so\nSo I wanted I did a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story arc of the Trump family which is a great American success in many ways that had any family or just [noise] it's also an American success story the arts are different uh and the generational transfers are different uh but they're both part of America that both part of the fabric of America\nYou know the the generations that built this country that none of them is Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations I

waiting to cheat in five minutes doesn't leave my teaching sensitive and it's a lot less expensive than visiting the dentist\nA son when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harbored al ... who came and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include you know truthful I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them in our eight ten but oftentimes ah you know the ... the the firefighters happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there was a silence there\nAnd everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes who perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates and for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us\nI had her suspend her campaign and Arizona and should make a different choice to not vote for years and said that this is really personal for those of us who served and was shot at by the Taliban and and saw Americans perished over this\nUh you know I hear the emotion in your voice and understandably so I mean you said six deployments that's amazing\nYeah well again it was an absolute honor there's so many Americans who have done that and more are both on the ground in the air and I see I mean this is this is you know why we fight\nTo protect our way of life and our freedoms and our liberties a and it you know this and it is you know in addition to this\nA comment saying it's okay for an American to join the Taliban to basically commit trees and she also was protesting right after nine eleven protesting our troops in a pink to to\nA flyers handed out at protests that she led depicting our troops as skeletons in saying stop the U.S terror in the middle east so\nThis isn't just a one off for her uh this is the pattern she advocated is shutdown Luke air force base\nI hosted the president President Trump at Luke air force base on friday to see what an amazing national security treasure it is she's trying to cover up or tracks and with George Soros\nChuck Schumer and the millions of dollars that are flowing in to you know cover their tracks and Turner into something that she's not in the greatest political cover up in Arizona history\nA lot of people think she's moderate a lot of people think she's right of center a and it's just not true and we\nGot only coming out on a three weeks before the election I mean it's almost on a daily basis it's like you know a a deep dive dumped has been made but I Would think that has is common knowledge\nOr had to have been common knowledge about her I mean I I wouldn't underestimate remember the allegations against the blind shakes attorney that she invited to Arizona State university I mean that's another slap in these two people\nYeah absolutely look at you know we sort of joke that the Democrat Party should have done better in internal opposition research on her before they had her Wii Chuck Schumer top recruit\nFor them to try to flip the Senate majority we knew about her radical cast a we've been telling people about it in Arizona every single day uh and that and the last few weeks or right some some videos and and things are coming out every single day but unless you're on conservative radio conservative TV Fox\nOr another on social media you're not finding out about this and so we still have another a number of independents\nAnd Republicans who are not tuning it unfortunately that need to know every time we have to put up and add to put some of these statements and like you just played it cost us about seven hundred thousand dollars to make sure the message gets out to the voters as they are voting every single day right now\nAnd she's had so much money dumping into her you know and if people do on a supporter of course they can go to make Sally for Senate dot com 'cause we really do need to help to make sure Arizona's are aware\nOf Arizona are aware of all of this they will never vote for her if they are aware of your heroic background they absolutely will vote for you\nUm I've only gotten to get to know you in in recent months and I got to tell you I'm more impressed every single time I talk to you and I think you'll be a great senator from the state of Arizona I Hope you're not going to turn into Ben Sasse and run away from me after you get elected but I'm ... more than willing\nYou know John you may not remember but back when I was a major in the air force I took out in the Pentagon because they were making our service women wear ... when they were in Saudi Arabia and I put my career on the line and I actually sued the department of defence\nAh fought for eight years and got legislation passed to overturn this and I actually went on the Hannity show during that whole thing ah to talk about how important it was to protect our religious liberties and not say\nIt was a very you know that that was that was a gutsy move I mean I I don't like the idea of American\nSoldiers are are on ...\nThem and help them which is usually the case ah I don't think that we need to go by their customs were Americans we get to follow her own customs or else you don't want us there then you don't want us there\nExactly that's exactly oh we we were there it was with the U.S military policy it was ridiculous I stood up for it I thought for it took me eight years but I finally got legislation passed as a citizen or to overturn it and make\nSure that our values were stood stood up for it yeah well I really do we both love and why the president anew and here I'm a bit more than\n... if you're not paying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention Christian cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban while Martha McSally doing her six tour of duty twenty eight years serving our country ah she's got one of those crazy pink hats on you know talking down our troops and accusing them didn't you choose them of torture as well\nUh she was a line with a radical uh anti border patrol a group down at the border trying to help uh you know help with illegal immigration and that group ah ... accused the border patrol of torture yes it was a ... or getting radical extreme group that she was very much involved in a in the inner path\nWhat do you think the president needs to do with the seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border if they make it to the border what's the best plan for the president\nOr this is absolutely ridiculous we have got to stop them from coming in the president needs to use all elements of power that he has shown we're seeing little mini caravans coming in every single day though because they're taking advantage of our loopholes in the law\nUh I work very closely with President Trump a it's often called the good that bill that was also the Knicks Sally bill that would provide thirty eight billion dollars for the border wall to\nSecure our border and close the loop holes that the cartels are taken advantage of it has to stop\nEvery single day right now there's people coming in in ... uh and that's a a sector that is being overrun right now\nAll they do have been down there many times they don't\nThey released into the interior of the United states sixteen thousand five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recorded\nAnd this is not ... rather than John Paul it's a Democrat's fault for obstructing a closing these loopholes and securing the border and the president as frustrated as and I and you need to use everything he's got in to to get to to put pressure on Mexico\nAnd then they usually for building a wall and finding and fully funding all yes and you have\nBoarded our bills thirty eight billion dollars including building a wall yes or\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell so and I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on that House bill I'm getting my asked for it right now because it's being misconstrued by the Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people who have family\nMember wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare yes\nHas failed in Arizona there's only one choice in fourteen of favorite counties which has no choice people lost their health care coverage we had people right now at three conditions who can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I worked hard to make sure that we were moving away from that uh and and toward something that gives more choice people more flexibility at the state level more free market get the federal government you know to not be doing this one size fits all top down penalties taxes and mandates it's failed\nSo we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ... vote I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions\nOh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nA ... a really a rock star a hero who served their country and an important race for the Republicans as the not only ...\nOr it's a ... a really a rock star a hero who served their country and an important race for the Republicans as they not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate that'll make votes for Supreme Court justice is a lot easier\nGoing up against the very radical leftists in the name of Christ and send them a thank you so much a Martha ... for all you've done for your country and and the positions you take and ah you should win this race\nFar and wide when the people of Arizona fully understand the record the background and the radical views of Christ and send them a thank you for being with us Martha McSally\nThanks sonic

just saying that to get elected then you'll get there he'll be is a liberal and they'll do the right thing\nWe had a similar situation in Missouri was Claire McCaskill directly or own words and she's

and I think that these laws basically it means that I you know is if you're if you're talking to someone you cannot record them without their permission whereas an ... like in New York and DC in North

what she said oh Spartacus getting their face or Obama saying getting their face\nAnd well I'll have missed the bird just tear up Sean Hannity\nAnd all the other incendiary rhetoric or Eric Holder kicked up more Hillary\nYou can't be several Rand Paul was right something's gonna happen thank God we have the best law enforcement in New York and elsewhere that have been able to stop potential tragedies from happening maybe now the Democrats will speak out about members of their own party and the horrific rhetoric they've had\nBut back to my ... point Brendan struck a is a now a conservative and he's leading this movement which is has to walk away from the Democratic party or he joins us as well as opposed Paterson who remember he carried the nuclear football under the Clinton Administration\nWrote the book dereliction dereliction of duty a welcome both of you Brandon tell me your story what made you decide you worry I guess pretty laughter a Democrat and you started this campaign in this whole thing for you is gone absolutely viral what happened\n[laughter] so it's great to be on thank you so you know my whole life I can\nAdult life I consider myself I was the Democratic party voter I always voted Democrat\nUm and that was true even in two thousand sixteen I went in voted for Hillary Clinton and I was one of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the\nMedia had been telling me for months and months at\nA Donald Trump didn't have more than a three percent chance of winning and they also had been telling me for months and months that he was a racist in a big ... and ... and a monster and basically the second coming of Hitler and that his followers were no better and you know they I think that the liberal media did\nFor me as they did for millions of others are very effective job fearing people making people believe these stories in this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media\nRanting you know screaming sometimes crying you know saying you know I'll never understand how people can vote for for this monster and on one particular day I had posted about um you know I I'll never be able to understand how people can vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd and mocked her reporters disability\nAnd it was on that day in January of two thousand Seventeen but somebody\nReached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen\nI'm just asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking the Trump mocked the disabled reporter\nAnd for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back\nTen years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter\nBut what's clear when you watch this compilation\nIs that this is a voice in a bit that Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who was caught in a lie or doing something shady or\nGrumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid and our son but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really realized that the media was capable of creating a completely false narrative and then isolating a moment out of contact to push that narrative it had nothing to do with news or the truth ran\nThat let me ask you something now once your eyes open and once you become aware of their bias and it's like you you you ask yourself ... myself but it's even worse than it's ever been how did you not see it before do you ever say that to yourself\n... yeah yeah it's absolutely the kind of thing that wants to see it you can't see it and what you just said is actually kind of the next\nPart of the story because then I went back to the beginning of the campaign and revisited all of those other moments like Trump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women you know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same thing time and again that's not what happened that is not what happened\nBut they made a decision after he won that primary or it was clear that he was going to win the Republican primary that it wasn't funny anymore that he was running suddenly it was scary and that they had to turn this man into the the scariest candidates at the world had ever seen so\nMay I ask you this when I when I tell my audience\nTo expect and I showed a lot of the ads that are out last night and I've been I've been showing these instances people that are in the public eye that are conservative more support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants and I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I'll be giving your best shot\nYou know I noticed it either happens to a guy with his wife or or an older person or women\nYou know what when there are a bunch of cowards the when they do that because I'd never treat anybody that way but you know this is the narrative every two and four years in elections in America that Republicans are racist sexist massage in is that they're a homo phobic dino phobic Islamophobia\nObama use those actual words that they want children to die\nAnd they'll have some commercial with the Paul Ryan look alike throwing granny over the cliff because they want to kill your grandmother that's what they do that to their play book we're watching it unfold today even Thirteen Days out of the election um do you see now that all of that is not true\nThere's not one thing that is true about that look look at the stakes for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce um the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded for these demographics ever\nYeah do I absolutely seeing that now and in fact I think a lot of others are starting to see it as well which is resulting in what you just said that even I think the most\nAh these minority groups in particular that I think the Democratic party for so long has taken for granted that this oh these are just automatic vote well that's not the case anymore I mean people really are starting to wake up and they're starting to walk away because they're seen so called\nHim and how many people have joined your movement\nSo the movement began on Facebook and in that are rich in that first initial Facebook group we now have over two hundred and five thousand poverty on ... on social media platforms we have about four hundred thousand\nIt to be clear for anyone who doesn't know this is a testimonial campaign so these are just people who are going on social media and clicking follower clicking like\nThey are telling their stories about why they are walking away so I mean they're they're making videos they're writing these stories down I mean people are there this was forming like a network of support and people are leaving are walking away from the left\nOf uh let me bring in bus Patterson as we've been around the block of time or to a new around the Clintons a lot a Hillary queen we can't be civil with with people we disagree with something like okay you know if you don't want to be\nYou know I ran into what's that that the senator from that we ran into Linda when we were in Washington\nBlumenthal I ran into him on the streets right when I was going to do my show one night and I went you know and this was right in the middle of the Kavanaugh hearings and he was being a lunatic and I knew I was ... are you\nWhat's going on man because um I have no what am

Clinton for two years after I left that position you'd I Love the White House office of the bedroom and traveled with\nThe Internet or wherever they were with the world and after I left and I also
