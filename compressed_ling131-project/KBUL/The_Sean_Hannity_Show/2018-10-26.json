you have not counting your house or fifty three thousand\nHow much debt do you have not counting your house or fifty three thousand [laughter] and so on your home more clear that yes and then somebody would a much more would you put in your pocket past that\nAre probably about twenty five plus thousand math or you know we'll defeated everything\nOkay and so um what's your household income today\nAbout eighty thousand okay so you just don't like the house\nWe're not in love with it or we bought at four and a half years ago um 'cause we wanted to chase somebody else just draining and then we're realizing it's not our dream and\nWho's your dream Libya tracing just\nDecided oh on whoever else this man you know I'm so we we don't we're not in love with it uh and we have different goals and our priorities have changed so\n\nOkay so where are you going to live\nA well that was kind of in the plan which we could basically jumpstart through a baby step three and take the money put uh some of the other money put it in as our emergency fund and then either rent for a short period of time what we built up more of a down payment or use the money and buy a smaller property\nI'm and smaller house um that uh that we can you know they will enjoy\nMhm so I [noise] um\n\nThere's nothing wrong with any of this equation um but I Will be a straight with you I I'm afraid I'm hearing something else that in order to be happy you have to make less money\n\nGiven joining us America was the lead you are with us this is the Dave Ramsey show Marian is with us in New York City Hi Mary Ann how are you\nHi how are you trying to than the than I think it probably on your show\nCertainly thank you how can I help\n[noise] okay [noise] so I've been following your plan for like a couple of months now I had the emergency finals and I'm working on baby steps too good on that night and I have made progress not a ton of back I asked\nMy issue is I give a chronic illness and I still work full time and I am not letting it take over my life good on my question is is how do I I check 'em for my deductible\n... recently I recently switched ... well started again\nAlso the chronic illness you're going to hit the duck double every year\nRight um it's\n... the guy that happening on the go at it it's not they don't have and it's not life threatening are you going to do it every year\nYeah\nOkay so now also they look at what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail the idea is that I couldn't hear pain condition and the doctors are unsure of where it comes on okay so if it was over there but I Would do is I'm sure because it's relatively new got I got I yeah\nWhat I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kinda guessing what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in as a budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand though the duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a\nYou know a\nA whatever a line in your budget for medical expands ongoing phonic medical and just call you call it chronic or whatever just give it a name and money set aside for that so that every\n'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up and leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year\nI mean my issue is that I'm literally um like penny pinching\nI don't like seeing where I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you like any right now on what I'm I'm hoping overtime on the opposite you know pay out more\nSo why are we going to get an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem where\nI had that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand I that\nI make I don't think a lot on the license social worker and because of my condition actually switch that job I had more flexibility\nOn some in a fee for service division as opposed to a salary position mhm and then I make anywhere from Thirteen hundred Fifteen hundred ... a paycheck and\nI knew he had twice a month on line you back twice a month okay and you said you're living with them\nI guess I'm I'm living with a roommate I paying nine Seventy five for rent you give us a lot um and I do get some help from ...\n... and what is the nature of the bed student loan\nPratt is everything credit card I'll also because they can hear it I was trying lot of holistic thing on medical and then it's student loan or most of it is like a week out there that have like a total of sixty thousand\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things in the food pantry\nNot eating not eating outside and you're paying more than half\nYour life from your lights and water and your rent and your transportation so food shoulders loading in transportation utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the center city in this city is only the debt you've got is not necessities\nYou take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you work as a end of the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going in here for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming you told me that that's why you called yeah yeah yeah\nI mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying ... said I got home we had a full how do I prepare for it you save uncover it so\nNow that's our short term long term okay we got to get your income up and you're out go down and knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get to take care of the short term and make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be\nPrepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but uh we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards is time for a plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell me and my wife I'm going through a baby step the right now I'm In fact we gets paid off our second credit card the day that we are deli credit card and moved on if they don't mind\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're already the babies that too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday at um after church we had a big argument about hiding I don't know that we want to ... percent and um I realized that we were not in position\nThat we can get later on but what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of a ... law and get your input on it we\nHave our campers can fight it but we want to live without thinking about what you got up\nAnd giving back to the church and then having\nThat extra five percent and kind of giving it to um other charitable organization that we believe in that are about it Wednesday or a ... you know when the crisis mission and so we're trying to looking at trying to do what we can to people who need it\nUm but then she don't have an ... strike ... percent a church and then you are or what we don't what we can't give you know we're not in the media and she wants to give ... percent of the church and\nWe had a big argument about high then yesterday I was\nOut on the the definition of dies the definition of the time was when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term in Jesus reaffirmed within the New Testament is tent that literally means chant the word means tent\nIt doesn't mean sphere that doesn't mean twenty is it means to him now you can decide\nWhether you want to tie they're not you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says ensure what may wrenches opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker ... Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you\nI Love ya and um you can give are not given all still love you the best way to live your life is to to give\nAn all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed does in the New Testament is a tie the tens of your income evangelicals are taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years at that time this is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top before you do anything else and it goes to your local church\nSo if you want to biblical answer\nYour wife wins the argument [noise] that's the biblical not your wife and his argument so she was correct biblical [laughter]\nActually both are probably true [laughter]\nIn order to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nThey actually managed to make something that was already difficult to understand even more confusing it's never been more vital to your business should consult with attacks professional to determine how the new tax law will affect your business employees and quarterly filings\nA thirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's ah about eight thousand on line and a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that\nGot it and what's your household income [noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years and um we're making about one one oh five one twenty ... a year where did you use to measure the old drum\nYeah that that's what I was making before a yes before okay um what do you make now why now I'm In real estate I'm actually I got my license in March and June ...

I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're gonna move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay offs and other firing until now\nBut here's the money that you've got ... the the business that you have coming should create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYeah and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there ending for clothing by then the second week of November everything should be closed do stay close\nTo three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not sell her car today I Would show your trial today\nAnd I but I Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the ... I'm not putting up with that crap\nOkay this idea that outlined make money I can keep ... well that's if your roommates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that\nSo uh but but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through a budget\nThat has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth of that making about a little over a hundred but instead has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven thousand dollars worth of debt a year for two years we can keep her car but if you're not willing to do that as a household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble than\nShe is not willing to join armed with you and fight and outside enemy that has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her toys\nYou have a marriage problem [noise]\nOkay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit\nYou run around started selling mama's car is not way good way to get mom on board [noise]\nHello so let's try that other approaches I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes right looks like your incomes going to go\nThen you might be looking at a different career and he's going to be looking at us on our car do and you get her car to drive you drive a cheap car while we get this ...\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the reason\nThe only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share exit team they have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've exploited thousands of timeshare owners this year alone\nThey're the best in the business because they simply a more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process but there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit team is so confident in their acts of service that if they don't get you out you get a full refund called eight for\nFor nine nine nine exit and schedule a free consultation eight for for nine nine nine ... or timeshare exit team dot com\nOf the ... are changing and old man winter is just around the corner there's still time to protect your home and rent for wind in snow with a new roof from reduce the\nLower middle panels are made in the usa just end up new winters worse reject your home and family when Bridgers steal\nYour local billings showroom or go on line the Bridgers deal Doug gum and create lasting beauty with Roger steel\nPlenty of every time you went out you can cash in now with the capital in the car you or your four percent cash back on dining and entertainment like celebrating every year the traditional [noise]\nWhen you and your crew or courtside during overtime\nFor going out now you have far more introducing new favorite card from capital I earned four percent on mining and four percent I mean you can send your wallet terms applied capital one bank usa innate\nAll the you know I find it even harder to keep up with a card and now I wake up and I need to buy\nYour own Kanye watching what's going on [noise] guy is hey OK\nSelling today at three on NBC for\nStick around for news for four pm most amusing Leon Harris will catch you up on everything you miss during the day they dug Camry helps you play with our exclusive ten day forecast join us for news for the first is what we are working for you or\nMetro PCS is now metro by the mobile\nNow you get new plans with unlimited high speed data a months long all under the mobile network check out the new metro by the mobile today and discovered the smarter way to get unlimited metro by the mobile [noise]\nDuring a gesture that fraction of customers even greater than thirty bucks for a month later this reduced immature customers men do to reduce speeds versus some customers video streams of forty coverage out of a a when some areas the store for details in terms of conditions\nAre tied to the house when you do get back say\nIt's hard to recover from open heart surgery with how he\n... it's hard to get well when you sleep on the street\nIt's hard to take care of the baby with untreated depression\nElse goes beyond the hospital\nAt Providence St Joseph how we believe health is a human rights to see what we're doing to advocate for the vulnerable and invest in health for all future dot P.

to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go there we're going to retire from our jobs and will laugh in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go and and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\nThe camp will be a uh the the operations\nOf the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... ... all and we'll be rented or we currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on it\nAnd um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent\nFrom you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be or non profit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of a\nYou know\nNeed to get with the insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I'd be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the time that they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or you or somebody separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something\nThat because I rent or can't insure\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nOr how to keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do some ... let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands if the land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah so you keep that separates a and so treat the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenet for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying and so treat these things separately and your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of insurance people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay then we'll salad I might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so huge that you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that ride airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you what how that how the liability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families or adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that writes your policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs too much of this cover company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it caused this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the farm plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in his shoes is but the main thing you want to ... do do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight in any of this um\nNo I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\nAre no agreements that keep someone from ... you cannot contract away liability\nOkay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins\nOkay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building\nIf you slip and fall and uh because we didn't properly and stole the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a Harley Varmus before he walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called ... those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk I but I I hold harmless is\nThat what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts keeps honest people honest right it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employer you fell on your face 'cause you\nDoes it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps people honest right it's like do you know you are you're walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not after writing a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nUh and it'd be proven that you that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I\nI Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are all find Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still level [laughter]\nThey'll still loose so I mean ... they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you and thanks for the call and you're ... you're joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five at two to five you're jumping we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll talk AAA eight to five five two to five All right Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a question and I'm a new holiday that this is something that you've touched on our website and find new to the baby fat and I know that number wine is paying the thousand dollar\nAmerican the fine my question is do you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing happen mhm I stay at home with a kid mhm fungus funding and how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an unstable environment with this job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off\nHow much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years and never happened to act really lucky we haven't been laid off I don't know if you go in and they get sent home pretty quick I mean within a couple\nOf weeks she don't couple of weeks to do something and he is going to find something to do when he comes home and they did get laid off so\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed paws over money make a little baby step thing and just pile of cash\nBut just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOf the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program that functions\nOne dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program that functions like a membership club think of it like Costco you join for a small yearly fee and you say big every time you use it\nSo what do you own your primary and what do you owe on the rental\nMy primary to fix the and it's worth about five if the\n... and the rental\nAnd all my my rental Ohio one takes the end is worth about I Would say or thirty fellow that's four fifty but I if I'm at a little bit less\nOkay so I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right [noise] right\nAnd so on you know if we state taking say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental for probably go ahead and pay off the rental um might pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know when you start doing what forty fifty grand a year and that\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh four twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the year of paying off your car um Oregon show the rental now and be done\nRight I mean that's what I really had in classroom whether to to do that and and pay off most pretty much tell the rent on pay off pretty much all my dad on it but I also have in mind that for that like I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in three years she's going to go to college\nI don't have a house payment you can cash flow that right okay\nYou know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore\nRight now my credit card check that out there next time you get hit by a car you pay cash for it I'm All right you never grow money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that that's the planet you can to get on track\nYeah you can't sort or ride this out of that horse it doesn't work\nYou can't shorter routed me got to ride him or not\nAnd so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental\nAnd pay off everything cash flow college and have saved up bought me some other rentals with cash or go along out there into the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have and go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff but you got to stop it\nYou got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle than yeah dumped the rental on pay off the cars and pay off the house um\nAnd it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a sap build your emergency fund and then start building George junior college fund and then once you've got junior college covered um by just don't want to just do it in a savings account the should junior college junior colleges do it in their\nBuild it up build it up build it up build it up and work your way right through it and then um\nThen once that's done then you just start saving up and paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're working the baby steps here are the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the sale at ... I Would I Love rental property but I Love being there for a more\nAnd so I don't borrow money and life is good when I don't have any payments any where life is good it's awesome\nI thanks for the call man we're pretty sure you're joining U.S Open phones this hour as we talk about your life and your money it's a free call the phone number is triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five day what's your opinion on used car warranties I don't recommend any extended\nUsed car warranties or especially bad\nTwelve percent of what you spend on an extended one day actually\nListen up later is if you want to be a better later if you want to thrive but not just survive in today's market I got some great news\nOn November night we are to live streaming our entree leadership one day that's right entree leadership one day live stream is a full day leadership prevent that you can stream from anywhere you'll see me along with every day millionaires and retirement expert Chris organ\nPastor and founder of the ... version Bible lap Bobby Grunwald and founder and CEO of charity water Scott terrorists and\nDiscover what these top leaders due to disrupt the market place you can download the event workbook interact with other attendees through a live feed\nAnd get all the same great content as if you were attending in person know travel required may get a day for you and your team to watch to gather registered today Dave Ramsey dot com slash advanced or text anyone the twenty Eighteen to\nForty four to twenty two for more information\nAll the you know I find it even harder to keep up and now I\nHarm Kanye question what's going on is he okay\nAllen today at three on NBC for\nStick around for news for four pm most amusing Leon Harris will catch you up on everything you miss during the day they dug Camry helps you playing with our exclusive ten day forecast join us for news for the first is what we are working for you and\nJohn tester talks a good game in Montana but in DC you vote with losing liberals listen presidents from\nTesters days one thing when he's in Montana\nYou he does the exact opposite when he goes to Washington to\nJon Tester became part of the one we took more campaign cash from lobbyist than anyone\nJust er threatens decide with Bernie Sanders or a thirty two trillion dollar government takeover of health care sided with Nancy Pelosi dangerous sanctuary cities were illegal immigrants and says two sided with the liberal mob attacking our Second Amendment rights and earning the rating from the n._r._a.\nIt's time to retire a liberal Democrat Jon Tester\nResident Trump writing Jon Tester is not on your side vote\nSenate leadership bumpy born is responsible for the content of his advertising not authorized by the kind of kind of this committee WWW dot southern leadership funded or\nYou need another day another dollar yeah speaking of dollars how much did you want for cutting you better by quick before the liberal make it illegal making criminals out of you and me and John tester voted with ... did\nYou see an already downgraded yeah to a deed on Supreme Court justices gesture voted with the gun control ground every time I used to be with us but now I think the second amendment's about shooting cows that are paid in must be all that liberal money you get from New York in Hollywood\nOr they'd probably shut up the lawsuit it'd be supported gun rights\n... goes right to John Test being bought and paid for by anti gun liberal shame well at least we can do something about November since you've been recounted the John ... paid for by in or a political victory WWW a PBS none were not authorized by the candidate candidates\n... do you think he retired and he'd been in the world when you'd be kind of have been killed in Niger losing your good nutrition quality health care and education and they got ... children die for it today\n[noise]\n\n\nDollars coming here today second tendency to say he had his the hardworking former who have the first share\nSolving Powell said a dream doesn't become reality three magic ... sweat determination and hard work [noise]\nJohn's with us in Wichita, Kansas say John how are you\nA good day thanks for taking my call sure well I'm\nI'm well me and my wife uh she got married about six months ago and we just completed wait for financial peace university and um we have three cars one is paid for one that's worth about what we owe on it\nDirty and did what he promised when he promised he would do it as positive attitude and infectious spirit\nLifts everyone interacts with your E.

term policy on hand um when he was younger and he wants to and then they take that over and make the\nPayments um I got no one that is the time but we have four ... I'm not exactly sure what the best thing to do if I'm not the beneficiary to that it or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took the shot when your husband was a child yeah oh my God\nThis is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd it's quite a million dollars\nWow it should be canceled okay\nIf it's a whole life insurance policy about ... million dollars is a very expensive\nRight and yeah and like my parents you know we found out that that in history I mean he's a great guy I'm not worried about you know that they\nFound like I don't care as a guy doesn't matter of fact a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah they are out of a movie and like going on you know a wild one\nBut it's strange yeah long you been married for a long you been married for five years you know the five years they've not address this issue that's strange yeah really I mean they should do do you should address the issue is\nThat they should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums and a half a million dollar policy all that's a whole lot policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a poor right of return that when you die they keep your money\nShow our whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\n[laughter]\nSo if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your term in ... but you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and your husband and\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and on your husband\nAnd I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and say that I'm I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's right I don't want anything to paying for something you know and then it can but you have fallen pancake\nWell it's not only nah needed because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yep 'cause you need to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm a question uh regarding up part of my retirement savings ... comes here's a thing called a pension from my company [laughter] and that overall is a bad guy eight percent of my total as ... or\n... or ...\n... well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be by eight percent of my total have had you know\nAnd and my question is whether the cat has a lump sum yes or ... okay\nYes here's why okay if you die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all going to die or get when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch of IEDs and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefits the money's gone it's gone\nAnd if you live I or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we've got an account for you over here two hundred and eighty five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you could think that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal\nRight\nYes I did [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but some are\nStill it's still love you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you out of the same concept applies so the ... the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die\nMakes this a bad deal\nAnd so you always take pension lump sum are almost always take vengeance lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good roast duck mutual fund so it sounds like your net worth ... million\nUh yeah it's a closer to close that it's been a it's probably about four oh well yeah total total network to assets house and so forth\nNo well ... congratulations how old are ya\nI'm sixty three\nWhite ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my ah my family and my wife's family\nWhat is somewhere in a hurry to court hunger dreams from my um my family and my wife came on forty a millionaire or that but before that happened\nA a millionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents type relatively young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern is because of the amount inherited is ... maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nOf its lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool as I'm ... I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell that twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise] [noise]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below your means when they got a modest lifestyle which uh we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was you people do stupid things I've done a stupid thing which I think if you can limit\nStupid thing to do along the way that's good I like that\nBecause every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do stupid things begin you can minimize ... along the way\nAnd we we have a modest lifestyle live below you mean um yeah Lloyd\nSo do you think there'll be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nIs probably a probably even higher if they if they made a ... you know maybe I get minimize that as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and the ... all the math on networks to your benefit a at a Wal alive and you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand to have\nI thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me interview you for
