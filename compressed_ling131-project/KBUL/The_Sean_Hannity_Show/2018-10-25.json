Stephanie how are you\nAnd thanks for taking my call sure how can I help\nMy husband and I and we are currently I'm doing that and I'm Rick you um do we also have an eight month old daughter I said we're not quite to the college saving yet\nBut we do have grandparents that instead of buying on Christmas gets their birthday presents what like to put away for her college savings and I'm just

Christmas I'm not sure okay\nAll right when you can open some mutual funds ... two hundred and fifty dollars others five hundred another's a thousand minimum to get them open okay you're going to open an educational savings account in a mutual fund an e as say\nIt requires because the child is a minor that someone be in charge of that you can't be the custodian that would be you\nAnd your mom and dad can or his mom and dad can add to the child's educational savings account the\nOnly limit is you cannot put a total between all of view of more than two thousand dollars a year into that account\nOK you can and a five twenty nine but more than that but you know we're not talking about that being a problem we're looking at the minimum and you've just got to get some money scrape together to do a lump sum to start\nThe mutual fund you know so maybe two or three people with some money to get maybe you just put it in a savings account to get up to five hundred and then you open

then had to live in a hotel\nIs basically about I'm a ... a voluntary retirement scheme that um is in Singapore so I can put up to thirty five seven thirty five thousand seven hundred dollars a year and I would get tax relief on the\nCalendar year ... which translates to about four thousand dollars a ... ... now I Want to take half my emergency\nFund and put it into that account because I might not reached a thirty six thousand just gosh\nBlowing it felt my salary mhm\nLord of the penalties for withdrawing or should I Do that one of the penalties for withdrawing I don't read for what\n... yeah it's about fifty for a ... percent on taxes\nA ... percent on taxes are but I I really don't need the entire emergency fund I currently have thirty thousand I'm a picky picky and fifty thousand and put it to that I can rebuild my ... my emergency found in about three months\nIf you don't need it why would you rebuild it\n\nI mean I don't have to have all the thirty thousand I just built it because I feel very comfortable with having that as a cushion\nRight and what is your income a year\n\nAbout a hundred and sixty\nOkay so what is three to six months of expenses\n\nIt is about joining the three thousand\nOkay that would be in the ... that'd be three months or six months\nThat will be fifth month\nOkay right so you can be within the range of three to six months of expenses at Fifteen thousand and um if you want to use some of that money that's fine and if you want to build it back up to six months later that's fine but it doesn't sound like you need more than twenty five thousand ever in your emergency fund\n\nYes but I'm not a fitness center here I'm also not a U.S citizen I'm I work here on my ex patriot and I just feel more comfortable because if I Need to leave the country I have about sixty days to get all my affairs in order and leave\nMhm\nOkay so you're just going to keep a little extra well so what I was there and that's why I feel more happens if that ... that event occurs a while you're down on cash because you've funded this thing\n\nSo it's very unlikely um I just received a new role and at least for the next two years I'm probably very safe at my work life\nMhm okay\nWell the thing is is here here's what's bothering me is the proper amount to have in your emergency fund there's thirty thousand dollars then the answer is no\nDon't drain it down because this is not an emergency you use emergency funds for emergencies period if the proper amount to have in your emergency fund\nWhich means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later\nSo you decide what the proper amount in an emergency fund is when all the smoke clears but don't tell me you're using your emergency fund to fund this and then you're going to\nPut it back which tells me you don't agree you know you've got the in your mind the proper miles thirty grand I think is what you're saying and so the answer is no don't put the money and retirement\nDon't use your emergency money to do that but if you're willing to reassess your emergency phone and say I've got this thing over funded I'm going to back down in the twenty range than I might go ahead and do this deal\nA because we're not there but but if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies\nAnd don't monkey with it is merge and she found this is is foundational before you move on to investing of any kind of so you got to decide your definition that's what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash one and it sounds like emotionally given the unusual situation that you're in you want to keep thirty grand around\nAnd so you should keep thirty grand around\nIf that's it don't mess with that but if not if you're going to permanently lower it then use some of that money to do this then hey I'm just fine with that a cage is with us in Salt Lake City Hi cage how are you\nHey Dave how's it going matter than I deserve what's up [noise] hey thanks for taking my call today\nPretty high cage how are you hey Dave how's it going matter than I deserve what's up [noise]\nHey thanks for taking my call today I'm I'm a college student I'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance um but the more that I go through school and the more that I listen to you and makes me want to really make a living being a financial coach dressed in many years ago and still here today [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I wanted to get your advice on whether you think it still possible or somebody like me to run the type of fitness that may be your advice on [noise] the basket and his model to maximize success on the early going of starting\nTo well the um you know the based financial coaching where you pay someone pays you a fee just to sit down and do one on one coaching which we do some here and we go we we have a program where we sort of our people that do that that come through our training to do that\nIs it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that\nUh because it's it's very much uh the inventory is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours in the day for enough money to equal a good living\nAnd I can be done but are coming straight out of school difficult to do I'm not saying that can't be done but I'm just saying it's not it's not a slam dunk okay it's not an eighty thousand dollar your job your first or two years out\nIt's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side and work with someone like one of our smart Mr prose as an example and those guys are in the business gals are in the business of selling investments\nAnd there's nothing there's ... there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact that it's almost paramount that you do coach people while you're selling them an investment so that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're selling so I'm On a home near coaching them and this house is going to you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is is a really out of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that you're in a sense your financial coaching them\nAnd so but you get paid a commission when they buy a house and so uh you know this idea that some people have that everybody gets paid a commission as a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd\nThere's plenty of people on strike commission with high levels of integrity that do the right thing so you might explore that angle\nBecause truthfully you can make more doing that\nThen you can\nJust doing a book billing by the hour and I'm not saying making more as the whole answer but you know as a as a young guy coming straight out of school as a financial coach you probably don't have to get a little bit of miles on your before people are going to trust you\nYou know I could be I mean there's some people trust you and if you're really good you know your your stuff then you'll you'll get business but ah I'm just saying it's it's a tough road to just do what we did back in the day and it's one of the reasons is not is one of the reasons we quit doing that as or exclusively but we did\nYou know we started doing events we start having a class we started\nDoing other stuff to go with it uh but this is difficult to make a scale up when there's only so many hours in the day you can bill out at an hourly rate open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Amy is on Facebook dot coms life day Ramsey\nThey do you put all of your rental properties into an El Al

how to use them for my name's Ken Coleman host of the ... of our Ramsey\nSolutions media productions and thrilled to be sitting in for Dave this hour triple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five is the number to jump in and let's go to Cody who's on the line in Seattle, Washington ... how can I help\nYou can thank you for taking my call so I'm\nAbout five years and she my career field and ITN cyber security and um I currently make a hundred and five thousand a year I'm I've completed a all of these baby steps I don't have a wife or a cat and\nA and then half all yes I've been given an opportunity to take a job that is less stable either in a in full time\nAnd it pays a approximately three hundred thousand a year a hybrid like air to control thing and I I've been raised with you know try to keep a stable job um you know you could be on\nFive days a week and make sure you know you get your paycheck and uh but I I think since I'm pretty young and I don't really have you know I don't have to support a family or anything I was just curious what your thoughts were on a either thing at my job or taken this position\nWell let's start with how excited are you forget the stability issue which I'll get to momentarily how excited are you about this opportunity\nIt it's pretty awesome or the or the field itself I I enjoy doing it um I don't consider going a job but like a ... or anything like that I I I enjoy it so yeah a opportunity to your eyes to take the other one is pretty exciting\nYeah okay that's great that's that's one question the other question is when you say stability you said you're going to make three hundred thousand dollars that's a massive\nThat's over half\nOkay it two times what you're making OK so where's the stability she meaning that you're not going to have normal hours but you're still going to make three hundred K. that I understand you correctly\nYeah so um I I ... I basically work it out for like a twenty hour work week and I multiply that by the hourly rate so it can\nIt's all thing so uh you know I can have worked for three weeks and then I can be I have no work for you know months on end\nYeah but you're going to make three hundred ... that's pretty clear correct\nAll not even if I get twenty or twenty hours a week\nOkay got it on the earth All right but is there some question as to whether or not that's going to be consistent is that a moderate goal or can a conservative goal or an aggressive goal the twenty hours a week\n... ... ... ... that's pretty moderate um 'cause I I've spoken with some of the other people that work in that position and um and they they say the thoughts about average um yeah OK yet but they may have some months or they they get a paycheck and\nYeah but ... this is a no brainer because you're completely debt free you've already gone all the way through baby step seven you have no wife and kids I mean you're in great shape to take this opportunity and here's the other thing you've probably planned for it yeah how ... what is your uh three to six month emergency fund look like how big is\nThat that Fifteen thousand\nYeah I mean juice out a little bit how long would it take you to get that up to thirty or fifty\nYou know uh what\nWhat like our position\nYeah or just in this new position because you're in such good because you're such good shape you you know just taking a new position you can stack up some money and take you know my point is is let's say you get into this new role which you really want to take and I'm telling you to take it\nBut let's say you're feeling that the first three months live on way less you already can anyway so the new job is actually going to allow you to maybe put six months away\nSo you got no risk at all 'cause you can jump back in the cyber security I think it's a no brainer I think you're over thinking it because it's not the forty hour week buddy you did all the hard work to get to the point where you can take a job like this you don't have to work forty hours a week\nOkay you got me yeah\nSo I ... to celebrate tonight my goodness don't oversee this I mean half of half of the ... love to be worked ... is that right now [laughter] I mean buddy this is the kind of smart risk you know because you put yourself in a great financial situation to be able to go after this there's really hardly any risk at all I'm\n... and here's the deal you're saying that you all you have to do is get twenty hours a week\nAnd that would put your three hundred K. if you only do it and you're still going to be making about the same it's not even a little bit more of course you'll be making more so again go go go oh that is fun stuff triple eight eight to five five two to five years as a career seem out on the day Ramsey show I'm Ken Coleman city in for day to go to Rachel is on the line in Madison, Wisconsin Rachel how can I help\nHow campaigns like hockey

congratulations that being twenty four\nAnd and knowing where you want to end up\nSo uh the first question you asked me are your skills that\nElections are being twenty four and and knowing where you

traction\nYeah ah everybody in America as well so that going while that's extremely valuable who doesn't want somebody you can do that [laughter] pick the industry\nI mean think about how valuable you are and again I Want to remind you something Rachel I tell my audience this almost on a daily basis here's where we sit right now in two thousand eighty seven million jobs available in the United states seven million\nIt's historically there are more jobs available then there are people who are unemployed and you just told me you're really great at systems and processes and you're really good at collaborating with other team members that's extremely valuable\nI Believe there are people listen to the show right now or go I Wish I could talk to Rachel I'd interviewer tomorrow\nSo you need to have terrific confidence there now you asked me a resume question here's the deal you put your experience out there you're you're twenty four years old so they take that into account you don't have a Fifteen year work history you're twenty four\nAnd as long as you are open and honest as to why you're moving I think a a solid hiring managers going to ask you why are you interested in working here and you just tell them\nHey I I was in the space I really have a love of administration I Love leading people in systems and here's why I Want to be here and so I'm Rachel I Want you to go to Ken

choices or there with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching\nIntentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that

and you say hey listen this is the ... this is the place I Want to be in\nAnd so I'm here to pick your brain into areas number one what was your past\nWhat are some areas that I could get better and where can I grow uh what do I need to learn who else do I need to ... do you have any relationships you know of any open jobs this is a very simple conversation it's going to yield something positive\nAnd so this is proximity and then even if there's not a fulltime job available because ... and this is the this is the part that I Want people to get that are in your similar situation\nLet's say you do all of that and there's not a position that is right for you at the time\nIt doesn't mean you throw your hands in the air and take your ball and go home what it means is you say All right I'm going to practice proximity in a in a non paid situation so I'm going to go volunteer or or I'm going to say can I just shadow you for a day I'm going to get in places\nWhere some type of audio video production is happening and when you get in those places you will continue to meet new people and those new people\nDoors for you so you're on the right track the first step is just talking to your body that's just the first step and that's how you ... practice proximity is people in places so again folks if you're in a similar situation let's apply Nelson situation to you\nHe needs to simply asked to day and then start to ride it out and find the answers when he goes and looks on line or wherever and he makes a list who are the people that are doing audio video production in my area\nWhere the places what companies are doing this and that's what he's looking to connect to it's not difficult it's going to take some intention alley and some hustle that's all it takes\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Joe who's on the line in Charlotte North Carolina Joe how can I help\nYou can big fan big fan of the hallway the organization appreciate all you do thank you\nSo I'm looking at it I I'm kinda continues you know what I'm Wondering if if what I got as a hobby or district career so just a little bit of a back story after I've been paying job that extra benefits to pursue I thought was my passion I take about fifty percent pay cut to to make the switch\nAnd and I went to this new profession you know I'm I'm quickly learn in that I don't know why are they from that I think I might have jumped the gun I just want to get some insight from you\nWill tell me what the profession is that you just jumped to\nFinancial diving what is it a financial diving\nOkay so you jumped into financial advising specifically what are you doing day to day give me the quick rundown\nA day to day ah basically just knock on folks doors ... who I Am what I Do and you know try and get them to be with me so that I can help them with a retirement plan and education\nSo are you working for a local firm or do you open up your own shop\nNo it's it's a it's a national ...\nOkay so they're not providing any leads it's all on you to go out and knock on doors like you're doing\nExactly they provide zero leads okay\nWhy did you jump into that I mean I I think there's a question you may have jumped too soon 'cause you implant financially but your question was is this hobby level you know is this the right thing for me and and and and I you know there's a little bit more to it than that I think I have a hunch on it but quickly why did you jump for this why financial planning\nSo you know the life of the day for the last ten years crowded and you know I always had a passion for maybe that would help out with their finances and playing out retirement\nOr when I went to a fair you know kind of told my story you know that you're given like a great day and um you know just just you know trust in the process I I went ... went with it in a it shift that it's not working out\nWell did you plan financially for this\nA somewhat you know I had about three to six months of expenses which of ah quickly depleted ... and uh you know I thought I was gonna you know and then every job I've always had always excelled so you know I thought that's really no different go in you know kill it you know and and and ah you know I have no problem work on commission\nHave even animal well here in the way here's the situation you went after a a\nFinancial advisor role that's what you went after because you want to sit down and help people with their finances with the problem is you signed up for a door to door sales job that that's what's going on and I don't\nIf straight commission sales is the thing for you the reality is you need to get some feedback I mean today from your leaders\nAre in maybe some some of your co workers to see why they think this isn't working pretty quickly you got to make a decision or and so maybe it wasn't the right place maybe it's the right thing but maybe it's not the right place 'cause he's got the talent to give people advice and coaching [noise]\nUm and you have the desire to do it\nRight place maybe it's the right thing but maybe it's not the right place because if you have to tell us to give people advice and coaching\nAnd you have the desire to do it maybe you're just not the right format the right setting to be able to do that so get some feedback reassess let's get stable and find

I'm a U.S how much debt\nSeventy five thousand [noise] okay um\nI mean it's not a deal breaker and seven hundred and fifty dollars for the thing that sharing and I did when we were looking at things like that was we would if we found one thing like that that we were going to not cut to hit our debt free go we had to find something else we're going to cut deeper\nOkay so like that means that if you were going to cheat and go out to eat once a month now you're not got ya or the if you thought you were going to do X now you're not and inside jak instead we're doing select soccer\nUm and how many kids do you have three okay and is he the oldest or the youngest or he sold the oldest okay\nAll right and um well I mean you get yourself out of debt than the other kids as they come up and do you can do whatever you want to do right with them in terms of ah\nYou know activities in sports and stuff you can afford to do all of that the thing that we decided was that all of this is for fun\nBecause um I mean Daniel my son played ice hockey all the way up through high school we knew at six years old he was not going to play in jail right we we're pretty sure at that point you know and uh so we made decisions to invest in ice hockey to have fun\nRight not because we were trying to create a future career for him\nLane and not play we went with the way that there are a couple of different options and when we put him in as less than half the cost of the others yeah\nYou know and you know so parents go bananas on this stuff is my point and uh some of them you know they spend

Carl how are you\nDoing very well thank you for taking my call I'm sure which one\nWell I think ... is that um there's three in the household and my husband and myself and um my dad passed away two years ago so mom I moved\nIn with us [noise] so um she couldn't make it on her own so we just kind of combine our income [noise] um our monthly income with three of us combined is thirty four hundred and forty two dollars I've done the everyday dollar budget and\nWe're like forty seven dollars a month over budget as things stand now\nUm we had back in January we had some identity theft going on in our account and that but us almost I think twelve to Fifteen hundred dollars in the ...\nThat the bank to for over a draft and stuff so that could us\nWhat why did the bank charge you anything\nIf there was a ... to\nMe it well it was um I ... that was charged to our account\nTo know whether you switch identities the banks shouldn't be charging you anything\nWell they did and they said there was nothing they could do about it a lot can change banks yeah we did okay wait we actually\nClosed banking and we just have a debit card that I'm just like one of those little Walmart orange you know\nSo we don't even go through the banks anymore\nIt's just a debit card [noise] but um they charge us\nLike six nearby six hundred dollars in overdraft\nMhm and they wouldn't take them back mhm\nBut I'm near in that time because all that was going on a weekend behind on our house payment\nAnd I'm a couple of more thing some of the smaller next that we had what we call the smaller nights but we're still have a hand on our house I've got to the house and loan people and they're working with us but we're having to pay extra a month on our mortgage payment\nSure how old are you guys fifty nine so I'm fifty nine and he's sixty and mom Seventy nine\nOr you guys on some kind of a fixed income or somewhere you know\nYes it's a disability out three of us\nAnd none of you were able to work\nYou know I Do a little side business with crafts and things like that\nWas the nature of your disability\nUm man is a hip displacement what's wrong with him um he had um he has a he had broke his back and he has a um a piece of the bone sticking close to his nerves back and he also\nHad a triple bypass surgery\nA few years ago when he later and he got like twenty five percent of his heart mhm\nMhm okay [noise] um well\nWhat what you guys have more than anything else is an income crisis right due to the fixed income and that's why I was exploring that question that does sound like you've got some pretty serious limitations um but what I'm going to do if I'm In your shoes is what you've kind of started doing there with the crafts\nAnd even in his shoes are obviously none of you all are going to be involved in physical labor of any kind of crime but if\nThere was something that you could do like I talked to a lady the other day who was just going to garage sales and she was buying clothing for a quarter and a nickel and selling it on ... for a dollar and two dollars and she had done that like ten thousand times and made like ten thousand dollars\nOkay and that\nDoesn't involve any heavy lifting obviously it involves a\nKeystrokes on the computer to set up an ... account and sell some stuff on ... I'm not saying that's what you do I'm just saying that something like that that is\nThat that that is in the line with the limitations that you guys have because if we can add a thousand dollars a month only your world it would change your life\nWouldn't it be dramatic and how old is mom mom Seventy nine\nAnd how much of this thirty four forty two comes from her\nEleven forty yeah she passes away you don't get a real problem\nSo we've got to solve some of the income issue one way or another here um and how much is your house payment\nI'm forty eight I think\nThat's kind of that's your that's just due to taxes and insurance going up\nProbably yeah OK and what's the home worth it for a hundred and an honor in July of ... where we only want to do and it's yeah it sure would be good when you know\nSo I think more than anything the the the magic wand here is some kind of an idea for you to create some income and I don't know what that is but I Want the three of you to sit around and talk about what you could do\nA ... year obviously not going to do anything this physical I get that you got some serious limitations I understand that\nAnd I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help you uh but it man a thousand dollars a month\nWould change your whole life thousand dollars a month for a year and you pay the house off\nAnd that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem and right now you being a serious problem two thousand dollars a month income change\nYou feel like you were rich like you were a multi millionaires or something it would change your life that much\nAnd so in is that possible yes that is possible it's very possible but you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or\nWhatever it and again it doesn't I don't want to put a bunch of strain on you physically but um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation with you over the phone so you could have an intelligent conversation with somebody on the phone and sell them something\nRight and that that's a possible thing you can do um the you know and it doesn't cause you to work\nHours a week necessarily but if you could do anything that creates a thousand two thousand dollars a month it would change your world and that's that's really what I Would work on rather than

matter of fact you probably won't even hardly notice\nEverybody talks about oh children ... five hundred and sixty two thousand dollars to raise you out really not really they eat the same broccoli you eat after a certain point\nThere in the in the same warm house you're already in after a certain point and so the actual cost of a kid is just not that\nIt's not devastating\nBut again you don't
