sure whether I should put that money into buying another business or what very stark try and pay down my mortgage or you know I'm you know putting money away for retirement and so forth\nWhile you bought a business\n[noise] um it could be cut by um it it gives\nA a good return as it appears right now what the current owner who's doing I'm Derek 'cause there are so could represent a career in general you know no no it I I'm a dentist it'd be another a dental practice\nAlso you'd folded into what you're doing\nYeah yeah so I own one practice right now uh upper ... who I'd be trying to purchase another ... country that you would combine with ...\nUh I'm pretty much yeah in in some respects it'd be a different location\nOh shoot up second branch in a in a sense okay yeah oh cool cool and show what would you be paying for the practice the second one\nUm [noise] so the practice itself would do for half a million dollars five hundred thousand and then the real estate or would cost three hundred thousand so it'd be a total transaction of eight hundred thousand\nAnd how much do you have\nI'm white now I have a hundred thousand dollars saved\nUm right now I have a hundred thousand dollars saved Tom so I'd have to finance the rats\nOkay All right and do you have other debt other than your home\nYou know just just our home no student loan debt no doubt on your former practice\n[laughter] no we paid a art student loan off and um my or their practice or it's been paid off\nAnd what's your household income\nWhat is your income when he put Texas only your\nUm between my wife and my cell it anywhere between eight eight to nine hundred thousand a year\nThanks for joining us America was the lead you are here well you can say big and they all my stories Dave Ramsey

and\nAnd you'll find deals deals and deals on books that will change your life or your family's life hurry the sale\nOkay I just took a new position at a at a new company I'm traveling a hundred and ten miles a day roundtrip commuting okay I'm I'm averaging about four hundred dollars a month and gas\nAnd I'm having a little bit of trouble [noise] kinda stomach moving to this new city because of the fact that it's ... higher up there [noise]\nMy rent right now is only seven hundred dollars a month up there for all and that's on a two bedroom apartment a one bedroom apartment up there starts to ride around a thousand dollars [laughter] so my question is which I Do about that were a drug addict or [noise]\nUm I'm driving to carry North Carolina\nI think you went shopping and one into town and there's another another town [laughter] Kerry Kerry is not that dramatic it's not thirty percent more expensive than Burlington\nI'm wrong something's wrong with your analysis here\nWell everything that I've done research was I Can't find anything less than non fifty thousand dollars a month for a one bedroom apartment [noise] and I've been digging for almost thirty days now okay ah how to offset the cost of gas and be closer to my job\nYeah again that I'm not I'm just not doing what you're doing but I'm a I'm a I don't have the emotional ability to commute like that some people do but I Can't do it my commute seven minutes or so I Can't relate I'm the I'm\nSure I I just I really think that I mean I ... I have\nNever seen anything that indicates that scary North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive than the rest of North Carolina I mean now maybe you need to move twenty miles from there instead of a hundred and ten miles from there to get something cheaper\nBut I'm the numbers are giving me just don't work I I just ah truthfully I think you haven't looked in the right places I think you're looking in certain neighborhoods or certain types of apartment complexes\nOr whatever I'm going to continue to shop and learn and I'm probably I mean I'm ... you may need to dial it out pan back a little bit and dial out just a little bit mileage was from where you are looking to get you may be in the most expensive in the town I mean I can imagine that there is an area of carry this that expensive\nBut overall this I carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive rents than Burlington no that's just I just don't believe that\nUm I can be wrong but I I don't I've never seen that indicates that the one in North Carolina is that much more expensive than the other end now you want to compare Manhattan to apple in Texas we can talk about this but that's a different issue and that's not what you're proposing so I think you're\nUm you look in a different end of town of Kerry or you move a little bit further out of carry but not a hundred and ten miles out of scary and let's see where we are at that point\nUm but I don't think you can\nUm what your your numbers just don't work hey thanks for the call Sharon is with us in West Palm Beach Florida Hi Sharon welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nAnd I'm On my baby steps and I just finished paying off\nMy three good for you and\nI have gone up he was talking to him and I said that payment money\nI'm going to be an attack in my

steps again in some attribution at a walkie right through that and you are getting advice from the smart Mr ... that is consistent with what we're teaching so that's why I think for the call Jennifer is in Houston, Texas Hi Jennifer how are you\nHow Dave hey what's up\nSo I'm calling because I'm ashamed of my dad and I wanted to know if I should postponed getting married or if I should continue to get married but I'm a baby step to to stack up money for the wedding\nOkay I'm a what is it going to cost you to get most of the wedding going to cost\nWell right now we're in this stage in\nCleveland

ah parents or his parents going to help with the wedding cost or do you have any idea\nUm I think it just be as I Know the the thing about it we talked about marriage really briefly overview about finances I Know he has a substantial amount saved up in cells\nAnd then he ... the writing and they'll give you an idea for just how he pays for the wedding then and you keep getting out of that\nOkay that'd be paid for the wedding um should I before we do it said I pay down some either that or\nI'm sure you know you you have a lot of debt you own or work on yourself\nUm I mean it listen ... that's what the package that comes named Jennifer has a a master's degree and a hundred and forty eight thousand dollars in debt and all of the other things that are wonderful about Jennifer the package that comes with him is he is out of debt and he has some\nMoney we don't know exactly what yet I think you guys need to really get into this and talk about it but when you combine these two things then you're going to you know you're going to finish off the dead are going to spend a limited amount on the wedding so that you can use the rest of his money to clear your dad when we are married after we get home from the hunting [noise]\nI understand you've got some shame about your past\nYou can do it over when you do that\nOh my gosh [noise] uh no I don't let that hold your back it up you got plenty of good stuff I had to listen to that Iran to show\n[noise] and\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped\nYou can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and\nThe only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share exit team they have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution\nSo how Allen actually had a when we met he had already paid off all his school loans and had a lot of the evenings and I'm like hey you want to get married I've got a hundred and fifty five thousand in debt\nKnow I don't think I really don't see doing that on your own do yeah\nYeah and our church I'm at the time was offering it for you and so I was like oh we need to go to this class because I'm terrified and I don't know what to do and\nI'm so we did that in that was in two thousand twelve where she did that while we were engaged and so we got married August twenty twelve and so\nTo this day you know before we got married we had our budget ready to go on the spreadsheet ... from the nerd and to this day we could tell you every penny we've spent since the day when I got married so that's been that's been an interesting journey but definitely blessed\nTo have a new one month later ... things done yeah so what do you tell people were key to getting out of that is well\nGosh it starts with communication or whether it's we're married are engaged by herself you need someone to talk to you about it um and then it's sending the budget and being disciplined on it\nThere's no problem changing the budget for its just intellectually spending ever since and figure out where it goes and being ... and just went to do it oh\nYeah we've gotten very good at 'em cash flowing things there's been a lot of and of course over six years a lot of unexpected expenses\nAnd we always say that if it weren't for the budget than we wouldn't know where to get money from ... um we've actually catch loads three cars in the span of time um and then about two years ago we um\nWe we were having some trouble I'm getting pregnant which you never think that that's going to happen and that and\nYou know fertility stuff isn't really yeah it's not like getting cancer it's not like a medical emergency or anything but it's definitely a very stressful um and so we we were very glad to be able to have the\nFunds and know where to pull money from and we actually ended up doing two rounds of IDF which was very expensive um and so we're happy to finally be pregnant and\nWe're not we're not going to call her day so good\nBut we just you know going through the stress of that and I see I've seen plenty of friends go through that or want to adopt and not be able to because they don't have the money or they have to fundraise for years and years and so we were just blessed to not not have to put that on hold because of money\nSo that was definitely a blessing when maybe\nOn MasterCard yeah that would be bad\nAbout that but we all the time for you guys yet or well done we're very proud of you who ... who is your biggest cheerleader each other probably other than each\nOther I think that's where we are going crazy ...\nRole in the ...\nYeah it was honestly a recording it for a couple of years and also on talking to all the families and talking to people in the

five years ... some odd percent of the five year periods in the stock market's history made money if you leave it alone it'll make money\nAnd so when it goes down with that in mind what that means is it's on sale you know and I was a kid there was a store called K.

as a on a fully fan or a health issues right\nYou know living in your car is tough\nThanks for being with us America this is the Dave Ramsey show says lead your hair you know it's interesting [noise] um and informative to all of us to stop and think about something hope\nCauses you to be able to move the needle causes you to be able to move forward when you think the light at the end of the ... at the end of the sun was an oncoming train your paralyzed your stop your overwhelm your frozen you get paralysis or the analysis that hopelessness\nWhen you think its allies and the tunnel is the way out of your trap and then you run to the light\nBut if the train is coming at you and run to that obviously right and and what's the difference in those two events it both light both a tunnel both the situation one is you believe\nThat if you run to the lot you're going to get out one of you believe you run to the light you're going to get killed right I mean ... that's hoping hopelessness and all of a U.S me included face that or have faced that at times in our lives\nAnd it's amazing to me the power of our brain and our spirit that God gives us\nTo do things that are way beyond what we thought we could do once we believe that there possible\nThat's called hope\nAnd so when I show you what you you know you make a hundred thousand dollars a year\nYou got thirty thousand dollars and that you feel stock but gosh if we did that at a thousand dollars a month or you're going to be out of that and my gosh and a thousand dollars a month out of a hundred thousand it's nothing I Swear thousand dollars a year you're going to be out of debt and little over two years\nAnd you suddenly go oh I see it ... it's the same situation you were in but now you can see it\nYou see what I'm Talking about and once you can see it that's called hope I can see my way out one of the things is steals your hope is when you have lost your perspective perspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things\nIt's happened to me it's happened to you\nI remember one time one of my daughters when she was in high school certain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was very upset by\nThe world is coming to an ...\nAnd her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and comfort\nHer [laughter]\nNow why are we standing in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their\nHopeless well\nWe've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been places she hasn't\nBeen and have experiences that she doesn't have right so in other words we've been to our ... year class reunion we know she'll be glad he didn't call [laughter] that's what we're giggling about standing and All right so we have perspective\nAnd so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it\nThen you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer\nIt it's going to grow some things in your future you know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you that there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different than when you look out ten seconds\nAnd the young man I was just talking to an end folks that have dealt with an homeless situation says one of the problem is the the desperation just to eat and not be cold\nCauses you to have ten second increments of thought instead of ten year increments of thought gee I can stand back from that sitting here warm and with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more\nBut he can't see he couldn't see that you don't care that he wasn't getting it\nIt's like go go go deliver pizzas go blow leaves go walk dogs go shovel something somewhere you know go do something go you know work all the time because she knew that money come from work is where it comes from I Can't get enough hours will than work someplace else work more\nWork all the time but but because I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does mean out when we were going broke a tool babies in life the houses in foreclosure were that close to homeless ourselves\nSo how we get out of it or your mind off\nAnd well you know you you\nCan't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way out I went bankrupt but I didn't lose the house and if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that ... you know and and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter only thing is just perspective\nAs like I didn't grow up rich but had a friend that grew up rich and\nBecause he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out considered always worked out and I had the perspective that ain't gonna work out [laughter]\nIt's going to be awful and ... because he thought everything was always going to work out you know it all worked out a lot because I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes it didn't work out you say you set yourself in these traction these rockets with this thing but when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work through it\nIt's when you can't see the other side of it that you don't want to work through it because you don't believe it's going to work that's called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same they only different issue is your perspective\nAnd some challenges that might be right now that I think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you think you're stuck in this marriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're not stuck\nYou're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film strip you're going to turn the page and something else was going to happen better or worse tomorrow is not going to stay the same you are not stuck\nSo look the other side of it look out there five years look out there three years look out their ten months and say one of I got to do what's got to be true that's not true right now for me to never be here again that's a question he was asking\nBut he was having trouble emotionally buying it and I don't think I helped him a it's kind of bothered me that's why I Want to talk about a minute I'm not sure he heard me\nBut if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you took my wallet away with with everything I have been through I had no identity no I ... you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long\nBecause they don't believe that about me and my future and I know if I Do this this and this that I'll be out\nAnd I I work my way right out of it I don't I don't know\nI pushed my way through it and um and I haven't always been that way there's been times that I was so scared to show beat up and so hopeless that I couldn't breathe and I couldn't see what I'm Talking about here is ... is is vision site\nThat gives you hope when you lose your site when you can't see the other side of it\nThen then there's no you know that it's hard to take action\nIt it's hard to fix it and the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you've got to do a series of steps you've got to take to become unstuck wherever it is you are stuck wherever it is I'm stuck\nI think that guy's got to be okay I really do I think he's going to be better off than he thinks he's going to be I think it's going to work out\nGreat book to read if you already called pizza tiger the guy that started um dominos pizza Monaghan came out of the army made some bad mistakes and ended up living in a homeless shelter\n\nAnd then he ends up owning dominos pizza\nSo it's going to be All right [noise]\nYeah it can be [noise]\nYou can choose for it to be All right\nIt's not magic and it's not positive thinking and it's not easy\nAnd and it's one of the reason I re biographies of successful people is it lets me know that they went through crap and they made it [noise]\nAnd it and then if I'm going through crap I'm going to make it [noise]\nThat that's what I'm you know that's where you are it's where I have been and am sometimes\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make\nAs an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position
