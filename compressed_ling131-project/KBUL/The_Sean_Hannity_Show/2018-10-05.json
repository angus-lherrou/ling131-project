E.\nThey've got football they got cheerleaders got cheerleaders they guy lockers\nMan I if I could get over to middle school I'd be happy then you remember that and that was in middle school I got to be about the ninth grade and I was fourteen Fifteen Years old and one of my buddies got his driver's license\nWe're glad your hair but ... in Miami, Florida five an hour you\nHave it on one that fall thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nUntil a few years ago a resigned our children are from Florida prepaid college planned and my husband and I were both making more money at\nThat time and since then our income has gone down and we added another child and we have gotten into the credit card debt and they have a car loan now um we can take the money out they'll have invested over the past three years without penalty\nShould we do that or should we just after I got to leave that money and continue contributing to their\nPrepaid plan how much is in there\nUm about eighty six hundred\nEighty six hundred dollars and how much do you own your car\nWe have a ten thousand\n[noise] um has been made plenty high and I have a small business that ain't going to out Trump out the year\nOkay so about sixty thousand give or take All right [noise] yeah um no I Would not cash would stop adding to it um and um you do need to get on a budget and follow through with what you're learning and financial ... University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to its you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a new emergency or no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college in a five twenty nine or an e essay and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plans here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in\nPrice and so if I prepay a an item I pay a thousand\nDollars and increases in price to twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of an increase in price because that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an interest rate they're not giving your growth rate\nYou simply are saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now tuition for the last\nSeventy years as average about seven point two percent\nInflation right\nSo that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent average annual return over that same period of time minded\nAnd so on you make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is\nA ... and it's a blanket statement but ... and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans and the process I mean they're just horrible administrators\nNow some states are well run my state happens to be well run show in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration\nWith a with the stability of the fun of still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say a row you already six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned called vacation because you're broken you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt\nSo you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew's with us in Fort Worth Texas have Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent uh when you first off for a\nA help stealing the recipe you for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so but\nTo my question because this was a wonderful thing it's fixing to happen or we were my family my parents have received an inheritance of mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a fuel oil wells but not not a time\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a fuel oil wells but not not a time mhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter]\nOr over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should shell mhm and cash out or hopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom and we want to you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly mhm\n[noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual uh oil prices that sustain a drilling a and and that's one reason west Texas is struggling right now prices are so far down that there's no boom okay I mean when gas for five dollars a gallon it was a boom by you know what I mean\nBut are you doing and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on\nYou know what OPEC does on turning on and off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue all of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all to get just about everything I Know just in a [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them\nYou have to sell although it was an all or none\nNo it's not an all or none are with you it's it's simply a they're looking at the three million for all the and or or you know obviously one point five for half\nOkay so you're just added on how one\nYeah and my biggest concern is a risk yeah I mean we are not oil people\nYeah I think I don't think I'm asking is women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling half\n[noise] we're deciding on how much to sell\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it would I go by oil rights within my answer would quickly be no mainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it\nThat I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay but that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars in the middle kitchen table would I go go by our rights in West Texas where the if the answer is no then it's time to sell\nFor the same reason I say you know that you wouldn't die and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know when we're afraid the stock market might crash\nYeah well it might but I Know I got to start getting less rock markets less risk than drilling holes\nYeah we're hundred percent sure that you don't have I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be an old person to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just sell like yours off\n... uh no this is I'm I'm helping uh my mother and father and make it to say\nOh I see so is it just yeah they can make the decision for the whole thing or not\nYes okay All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least to sell Seventy five percent of it\nOkay I probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they're just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death of ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that you know if it struck out after\nSo you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that you know struck out right after I sold it I regret it the rest of\nMy life you know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that\nSome advise set of families entire portfolio three million dollar networks we caught\nI wouldn't do that personally and if somebody asked me\nAs a financial coach they do that I Would say that\nI Would take the majority or all of that\nThe news to have a blessing like that do\nThis is the Ramsey show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the

in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nAnd you know going in you know the the condo the other

or\nShould I put it someplace\nWe teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial bland and as you lay the foundation that if you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses um that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so twenty thousand our emergency fund is adequate as adjusted an emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans\nUm so I'm about Seventy eight year\nIs the household income yeah yeah okay\nAll right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a tension um that I put a about\nA hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the car does well\nOkay is that mandatory\nOkay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousand ten thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four O. one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have just opened up a rock or re ... with a better man which is one of the oil and high hundreds\nFor me I'm familiar with what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo shortcoming they're they're they're doing pretty good but none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in ... at this stage of the game there'll be a time and a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would just go to smart bastard die Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the investment business I don't care what you do okay in fact my income at all\nBut people have always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each uh unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there are fifty five hundred is eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds\nI spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stock mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a fourth in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international\nNow once you're doing that any of the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it in mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine\nOkay I'd just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and so you you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that and that's maybe step three is fit or babysit forced Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different being there in you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it\nAnd then once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget uh any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's maybe step six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement\nAnd invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr what you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I'll find in my budget I'm going to keep junk and on that house you're probably going to that house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction\nThat's in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you don't or better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand that a hundred and Ninety three thousand is pretty abnormal it's currently with U.S Department of treasury um it as a result of having been additional from a service academy or three years ago\nUm and that the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously a much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand of reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact that will eventually end up any collections account if I'm not able to pay the amount can fall I'm\nYeah I'm In what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year also\nWhile I learned you guys are on the Internet um side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three in the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can give you got wonderful income you'll be different two years\nIt's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start to untie thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money you're gonna get a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies\nThis enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYes or so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either ask that serve through in the service or you're assigned to\nThe recruitment and death and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time and it's for given\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge and have to pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news in the short story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nCommon theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices\nWhether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip\nRecruiter dot com slash Dave to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new it finds them for you it's powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes\nMedication regime and hand it plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago\nBut that never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January cook myself you know of of her checking am because\nHeart when I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs you know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I rest\nMy case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to\nParticipate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent from mom of intentionally\nBut if you can get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and that be perpetual\nBut to do that that was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again but you like go to the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was unhealthy\nYeah and I'd like to get her up and running and healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life she's got to balance that stuff but if she does\nEvery time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again broke you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that habit and those that love them but the good news is I have seen hey innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nThem now she only did he medicating if she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not Medicaid\nWell there's you you don't want him just you know you know all the rest of their lives\nAs well I mean they had control there she definitely has a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen\nOr as as semi mentally\nIll and she is she's not on a couple of different meant\nWell her ... her only shopping is what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nYeah and it happens to people all the time though what\nDid she say right now when they call her\nAnd so you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nYou know how you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you just you know because they're going to just I don't\nThink I should be talking she should\nBe telling them to be either one of the American long conversation it's I got nothing you get nothing because all they're going to badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs going then we start negotiating and trying to work your way through the debt right\nWell my husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate\nAnd I are going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months out there they're going our pliable\nToday but she's got no money and you're not giving or any you know so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nAnd so let's say I mean she'll she'll I'm a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight under there and she'd say look it can we work at a deal yeah or you know are they\nGonna Thirteen hundred bucks you ever seen any money in two years I'm no backup and working again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that in a settlement in full will do it and get an in writing and no electronic access to your checking account\n'cause whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's filthy industry\nSo you got a free somewhat rattlesnakes because they are\nCovering person here\nWho's going into a rattlesnake thin\nYou got warm weather emotionally on there\nBut you can you can give us a cheerleading ...

religion Alexandria, Virginia\nKimberly welcome to the day Ramsey show\nMay thank you so much for taking my call sure what's right [laughter] that's my\nMy my question is is my dad is Seventy five years old\nSteel works He works in a steel plant\nMakes about four fifty to six fifty\nA week um about couple of years ago he got sick I found out that he hadn't paid he's behind\nOn a lot of itself had a somehow ... got a fifty thousand dollar loan from the bank\nAh he doesn't have them attention he gets about Fifteen hundred and some security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do\nAt this stage for him um I Do provide him I took over all the bills and I did provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that\nFor him to buy food and what are you doing with the rest of that I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying all and pan on his bill ... has about um Fifteen K left on the equity loan ... two thousand on a credit card mhm\nEight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house and\nThere's so much are you able to put on the debt which\nI'm putting everything\nWas the turning out to do everything on on that much money does that amount to what is it\nA month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about four thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nIt it will have on the car eight on the house and she won a credit card\nOkay All right and it ... you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're doing in a year\nOkay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a dead an ear right rank also get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and they're still working at a steel plant that I understand that right yeah so there's going to come a moment and it will come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I'm afraid of you know my prayer is at least that he gets through this year\nMhm and that way you free and if he's a hundred percent that free house and everything you can probably make it on his Social Security if you had to write okay not yeah not ideal not what we want but we can probably get there and uh\nThen the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get debt free then let's build an emergency from under three to six months of expenses but we get past that then let's start building some mistake for retirement but the fastest way to build mistake for retirement is to clear that debt and to have that emergency fund and Bush\nAnd he is still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay that sounds good well let me ask you this one at a bank loan and I'm someone at his age fifty K. and uh you know four and a and to be paid off in twenty forty three and knowing that\nHe wouldn't ... live that long\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid and the second reason is counting on my house I've got to lean against the house right now that's true then show the house will be sold upon his death\nOr they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is you know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry I mean they'll they'll loan anybody to breathe or not breathing money you know what I'm saying\n... has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nAnd ... and so the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it was like no they would have offered a dog that credit card\nSo I mean in dead people get credit card offers so it you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off or it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just be you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how are you\nOn the umpires have I got to require retirement OK\nI'm here about a year ... and I'm a ... and then I'll have a four weekends off of what he good mhm I click here at sixty two it'd be better to file for Social Security and weight while before it does if only for we have for\nThe whole time of day\nYou can run the math out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nOkay and that's the way you're comparing it to see other words if you're white from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more than a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes up you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking after four O. one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation oh\nDefinitely [laughter] yeah so you got you got to kind of gas and you've got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... deaf age of a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that and those numbers included infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety according to the stat tables right now\nAnd so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question man thank you for joining U.S Open phones AAA eight to five five two to five Todd is in New Hampshire Hi Todd how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\nUm I I when I spoke to the lady she said I can ask your question and I just got the starter pack off of your website for myself for my for my daughter who's thirty one I'm fifty two and\nUm I've been a dream or I guess or a free spirit as you would say from listening to your show addictive way now for the last two weeks [laughter] I Know who you were before that it's All right bye\nYou've never been able to agree on money um she's the shaver um the spender and just I don't you know I don't know what the money situation is where I go and spend it [laughter]\nAnd um [noise] five we've set aside step one we've got a thousand now we've put aside to the shaving she wants to say more than that but she I'm she's always ran the show and I've been kind of this kind of go along with her at this point um [noise]\nWe paid off to credit cards and we paid off on the credit card my question is is by doing so many things right now I'm In the one thing I'm concerned me it's about down the road is my retirement and I worked for a company for Fifteen Years so I've got\nAbout ... eldest daughter pack was the total money make over a boat in there\nYes it is I started to read that I have\nRead a total makeover has every detail about the seven baby steps as the seven baby steps on steroids\nAnd so it's going to walk you through first thing you do just save a thousand dollars you get on a written plan you and your wife or an agreement and we're gonna we're in agreement that we're going to work this plan together okay I Want you to do that then you're first goal which you squeeze out of your budget as you said with thousand dollars if you've already got money saved\nThan we would save only a thousand dollars of it stop all investing\nTemporarily temporarily temporarily and then you move around a baby step two which is your debt snowball and that's where you pay off everything except for home busting your debts smaller slug\nCaused by getting rid of those that famous and now you've got the ability to invest\nAnd make sure you and your wife or what does\nPlus space it this is a hectic time of year but here's the deal it's not an excuse to lose track of your spending especially when we made it so incredibly easy for you with our three budgeting tool called every\nDollar with every dollar you give every dollar a name at the beginning of the month and then you track the expenses against your budget throughout the month it's really that easy in fact you
