I worked for the postal service they have and get a student loan debt of like um about Fifteen thousand dollars [laughter]\nAnd I'm Still friends one of them as I'm asking me to go for a business\nOr like a friend um subway business so I was thinking about taking a loan for that and my other friend if I'm all for me like to go buy a house with him to the share like a two family house so I take one apartment uh he thinks the other\nAnd it's going to be of course with a mortgage loan to so I wanted to know what should I Do [laughter]\nMm okay well\nWe tell folks not to borrow money around here if you listen to the show very much the shortest path to wells and peace in your finances just to avoid that and on top of that I Would tell you to avoid partnerships as the only ship that won't\nNice in your finances just to avoid that and on top of that I Would tell you to avoid partnership should stay on the ship that won't sale\nShow 'em what that means is that if you still want to remain friends with both these guys I Would suggest you say no because at the end of these stories are nightmare\nGoing in partners with somebody in debt to go into the restaurant business would you know squat about is a good way to end up bankrupt and lose your friendship forever going in partners or somebody to buy a house\nAnd then he doesn't pay is half or can't pay his half or you don't pay your for camp by your half is a precursor to the ending of our friendship and a foreclosure shown no I wouldn't do either one of those\nAnd that's my reasoning I think you'll have a lot better life if you avoid both of those paths and you can you can develop a career path that does not involve you're going into debt to start a business it's a matter of fact most businesses start without bet\nThey just start small we started this one without the card table my living room we didn't have a big fancy studio we went down to the local radio station drove over there and they let us use their stuff because we work for free there\nI Know you figure out a way to get going and you what we call bootstrap it\nAnd it works but you don't have to go get an SBA loan and go deeply in debt to buy a subway franchise in order to be in business that some mythology Thomas is with us in Philadelphia Hi Thomas how're you\nDave thank you very much for taking my call sure what's up I'm I just graduated with a degree in actuarial science back in may wow and I'm working at McDonald's making nine dollars an hour why\nI I've been applying and applying and I just I Can't find a job and I don't know what to do\n... well I I Would assume that the primary job for that would be an insurance companies correct\nYeah I've been through me and my last year of school I got very turned off the actuarial science so I've been applying to finance jobs and I can't get anything because every one kid that you have experience and\nI don't have the experience and I I graduated early so I did I did summer classes and they can't get internships summer classes\nMhm so what kind what kind of went into a job where you tried into\nFinancial analyst financial I'm like I've I've been even doing accounting\nLike account label and ... you know entry\nLevel stuff mhm oh you do is get your foot in the door\nI'm OK well\nHere's here's one thing I Will tell you and Ken Coleman will tell you this as well go to the Ken Coleman show dot com and download his free PDF on how to put together a resume but resumes in applications without relationship are useless um I'll give you an example\nUh we have eight hundred people here just under a hundred people work on our team we hired a hundred and fifty to two hundred last year we had Fifteen thousand applications for those honored hires you get lost in that ...\nAnd it is not that I don't wanna answer and talk to every one of those Fifteen thousand people it's just a logistically not reasonable and so what ends up happening is you get lost in the stack of that stuff unless you know someone that works there and you don't have to be best friends with them you just 'cause\nI got to tell you we don't ever hire somebody because somebody called me and says are ever ... but we would give them an interview and pull their pull their resume out of the stack\nAnd so some of these places you're trying to get on with you need to figure out if your sister that's married a kids play soccer where the guy that works over there or something like that where you can find someone that will put in a little bit of a word for you to at least get the door open\nAnd that'll get you in the door again you're you're not going to get hired because of that kind of a reference matter of fact there are very few references where you just calls up somebody and I get your higher but almost never happens that'll decent job anyway\nI mean if they're hiring those bodies you food at all or something like that but at a good job they're really going to want to interview you and learn about trees and that would be true here so we don't guarantee anybody a\nTire but we will at least talk to them and\nYou know what might be a very short conversation no you don't qualify than citizen or looking for but at least we'll talk to them and give the resume out of the pile if somebody knows I'm Sorry go download that and literally can almost show he'll help you with all this stuff is very very difficult out there but I think you can leave some\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nWhy in the world would you trust some random guy in a Q when getting your mortgage you really think he cares about your long term goals boy doesn't\nThose companies care about getting you into water were home loan programs that are pushing that week when it comes to ordering a cheeseburger the meal deal works fine well let's get real people were talking about the largest investment you'll probably ever make so don't be naive and trust an order taker who pressures you into a pre packaged alone\nAnd they spend money like water you've seen them do it oh yeah definitely and I it's craziness did all you do would you you just kept living like a broke college student\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years that because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important stuff that I thought yeah\n'cause now I mean you make three hundred four hundred five hundred wherever you make it it's you're going to be unbelievably will show you said your how thirty thirty one thirty one wow\nWas this fabulous income congratulations I guess I'm so proud of you who was your biggest cheerleader I Know you had to have good tractors that was easy yeah but who is the biggest cheerleader or\nI Would say my parents or my mom had followed you for years and also people in my church family as well because they I talk a lot about you and we're encouraging me to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans yeah\nSo I mean you went from being completely crushed by student loan debt to completely own and it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the day I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't really have\nAn other planets I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later in the final payment\nYeah she paid off almost two hundred thousand a year for two years ... ... you were on which is pretty incredible\nBut you're making four Fifteen minus taxes which takes a big chunk of and so you weren't living you weren't you weren't splurging on anything now uh you weren't starving to death but you weren't splurging\nAnd just completely lean to show as you're going lawyer you're hitting this thing when you're hitting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah a Fifteen to twenty month only given month\nAt what point when you started doing that did you go wait a minute this is actually going to work how far in war you before the before kind of the switch kind of flip for you\nWell I paid off all the smallest ones first I had a total of twenty different student loans and so they wanted to attack the smallest ones first and then once I saw how easy it was to do that and then I started to have\nSome more hope that I Would be at what a pay off the largest ones I think my largest individual alone was right around fifty thousand dollars and prior to that I just looked at it and it was like there was no way like there's I'm not going to be able to do this\nSo your trunk and some of these like one or two a month yeah knocking them off the little baby ones when you first started yeah and that yeah but I had to give you a lot of emotional boost deaf in his debt snowball really kicked in for you then you can do what he was supposed to do it let you know that this is going to work\nMhm wow wow wow wow wow wow\nAll right so what is the big takeaway when someone says oh I I'm a ... year hundreds of thousands I Can't\nGet out of debt you say yes you can here's what you do you do this\nI think the most important thing is just to stop running from it stop trying to hide from it like I was trying to do um I was I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never get to that and I once I face it and once I took personal responsibility for it\nAnd realized that I'm the one who signed the papers ... you know I Need to get myself out uh then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change\nOr your parents' good with money and they are\nI didn't know what mine is but I learned most people's [laughter] [noise] yeah [laughter] yeah I definitely learned how to live on a budget that from my parents and also um they had been in quite a bit of a credit card that in the past they always told me you know don't be stupid with credit card and um you know make sparked more purchases and so I think I learned a lot of those principles and then\nYou know

years oh about ... me hustling labor I'm doing everything for about the last six years I've been able to replace myself in the labor I make a decent living now\nBut I'm just content I'm kinda happy with where I'm at\nA question it is and I mean I don't know I mean it it it is it bad to plateau like that if it if I'm if I'm content and but there's definitely room to grow so my question I guess\nI'm not sure which direction to head because I'm going to spot where I'm fairly happy\nWiring so tell me why you're happy define it briefly\nWell I think possibly and I asked myself there's a lot maybe greener big enough to believe but I'm I'm happy because I brought my business close to home I don't travel a lot anymore and I mean I've yet time and get their money they're too well\nCongratulations well it's almost like you're feeling a little guilty\nFor being content you know days purchased contentment Rachel cruise almost wrote an entire book on contentment content that does not mean\nThat you're in a bad place I think you're happy you're thankful you're you're grateful you've been able to work hard and get into a new space I think what you're feeling is the itch to continue to challenge yourself and by the way that is also a good feeling you can be content meaning I'm grateful for what I have\nBut I'm not happy with who I Am so I'm very content I I'm honestly living the dream this is the greatest time of my professional life I'm having a blast however\nI'm not happy with who I Am as a husband I'm not happy with who I Am as a father meaning I can be better so I can be convenient and grateful but also want to continue to improve running and he got a great business I don't I think you know\nI think you become a successful yeah amounts to ... well done um

to survive and yet you get ... once you get past the desperation\nOf that stuff and uh then the thing starts to you can control some of the variables and you brought in somebody to do some of the work you didn't want to do\nAnd you brought it closer to home and you're making good money and so\nThat that's the next step and that's what I Do as an example uh when I hit that stage people started saying well you'll never be successful radio if you stay in Nashville all the big radio shows are in New York or LA and I'm like well I'm not going to be a big radio show then 'cause I'm not going to

bit of a um a movement issues in my shoulder but besides that I'm buying\n... you got any future surgeries coming up a no okay well good well I'm Glad I'm Glad you're doing a good that's awesome okay same so uh what what are you are thinking of putting the money on [noise]\nSo me and my wife have agreed that we want to use this money to buy a house mhm but\nShe um [noise] when we were not agreeing on that she wants to put the majority of the money all as a down payment and save about twenty thousand for emergencies mhm and I think maybe the perfect time to get rid of all like that and also have a good amount for a down payment on a house\nAnd still have some leftover but she's not agreeing with me with that mhm and I just want to hear\nYour opinion on what you think would be the better move\nWhere she's not agreeing with you I don't know why she would agree with me [laughter] but anyway the uh uh we tell people not to buy a home unless your debt free how much debt do you have\nTo get a we have about forty five thousand dollars in ...\nI Would pay that off and I would hold twenty back for an emergency put to rest as your down payment if I were in your shoes I Would not buy a house with that still laying around I think that's dangerous you're asking for trouble in the show they\nShow my vote is going on your side of this argument I'm afraid but I don't know I honestly I don't know why she would answer to listen to make now let me tell you this I Will tell you that I Would not do any of this unless you guys get on a budget and you agree to never borrow money again\nOkay yes that I have a track to talk to her about that I'm actually a new economic trying to get her on board mhm but she's not really to come ... also having trouble getting her on board with the plan and his oil\nYou know I can imagine so um I I highly recommend you don't do anything until you can come into agreement okay because you're going to make\nA mistake when you Shannon I when we have an argument like this we we have to we have a rule we have\nNothing until we can come into agreement on largest\nThere's large decisions we decide nothing is the only thing we can do until we're in agreement\nAnd uh so I I recommend you do nothing until the two of you can get on the same page um do you think that she would go to financial piece university if I gave you a one year membership\nI honestly do think I've been talking to her mother trying to help me out just because she's so stubborn about this and her mother is on my side as well\nUh when I was there when I ask what I asked was can you get your wife to go to financial base university to the nine lessons and if I give you the one year membership Yes sir you think so why she fresh rubber\nI think that me and my me and her mother would sit down with her and explained to her um\nGo to the climate is free okay I'm going to give it to you but I'm only going to give it to you on the condition that she attends with you\nOK because if you go by yourself or the cause of divorce is you're going to get more and more and more and more excited about getting out of debt and living with a plan and you get it's going to drive a wedge further between you all and I don't want to do that\nSo I just if you can talk her into just attending one or two glasses with you I think she'll go on and go to the others I'm pretty persuasive\nBut uh but don't go by yourself to cause problems hold on I'll have Kelly pickup I'll give you the financial ... membership for a year and that includes the nine\nLessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else um but do not do this without her it's a it's contingent upon that my gift is\nAll right Dave is with us in Stockton, California Hi Dave
