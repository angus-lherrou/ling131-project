I've taught for oil and get your opinion on a couple of things here [noise] um my wife and I don't have any at all with the exception of of our house [noise] um we do at least our cars\nAnd um [noise] we do that um I have a customer in a in a good client of mine that\nI reciprocate or the money that they stand with me back with them so it's kind of a win win situation [noise]\nUm for both of us here [noise] the main question that I have is we have\nUm some investments 'em over a hundred thousand dollars with\n'em too off IRAs and some mutual funds and that type\nFor one I'm K. I have four one K. shifts pension I'm as well and right now we are paying above and beyond our mortgage um bought our house by about\nTen to twenty percent and putting that toward the house with the amount of investments that we have diversified compared to what we're putting into our houses is that the right formula\nWe tell folks but Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement once your debt free except the house and have your emergency fund and above Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement and your debt free except your emergency fund then I Will put the everything above that towards the house till the house is paid off [noise]\nSo took your income sounds point one five [noise]\nMake sure the total of all the Roth IRAs four one\nK. constitution you're doing is equal to that I'm not ready to them that much greater than that back some of the contributions down a little bit and throw the balance of our service not up for that has to get it up to that\nLynn we suggest you're listening to all of those categories growth frozen income aggressive growth and international [noise]\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings\nTo provide for their financial aid that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are in your baby steps it's a necessity not a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well as stay at home parents it's pretty expensive\nAnd uh yeah I'm I'm not gonna camp anymore fifty five\nIt was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game\nBut that but you're you know you got past that stage now\nIs that okay yeah it's cool thanks for dropping by things open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia they clear how are you\nHow they how are you know good how can I help\n[noise] um I have a question for you so we're calling your data sets for a little less than a year now and I feel like we are on their head on retirement but we're behind on college savings for two kids\nShow how old are your kids and they are twelve and ten okay and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement I'm a little over a million though your head congratulations ... so what's your household income\nDefinitely feel that way yeah we\nWe are I mean when you have more than a million dollars you're millionaire\nYeah okay yeah you're right [laughter] [laughter] so ... what is your household income a little over two hundred okay\nSo why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get plenty of money for college when you've got eight years before college\nWell we're paying for private school right now as well what are you paying for ... how much cash how much twenty thousand a year per kid or total total okay you make two fifty when looking at you like it you don't have like two hundred dollars me one eighty okay\nAnd if you can cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's ... ... that cash flow can be turned towards cash flow in college too if they choose a college it's reasonably expenses\nYeah OK okay that's a good point and yes nine\nSo I I you know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement you don't need it you're in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the moral\nBut I don't think your house to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for kids to school today we're going to offset some of that was cash flow in some college but some college we want to set aside\nAnd put Fifteen Percent of hip side so we're talking about thirty thousand dollar such fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in return I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say something to college you say ten grand a year per kid another twenty grand you can do that\nA front for from now until they go to school don't have plenty of money\nI mean you just Jack up to five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control and saw that five twenty nine get or the one that's more of us are pros and they'll help you do that click smart ... de Ramsey dot com for a list of them in your area the people we recommend them sit down when you help people that five twenty nine together\nAnd pop ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you are not working our plan at this stage\n\nBecause you put Fifteen Percent into retirement until college and it was done and houses paid\nWorking our plan at this stage\nBecause you put Fifteen Percent into retirement until college and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and then you're a baby step seven to increase returned wrote me on Fifteen Percent and Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand thirty ground\nSo that that's what I'm doing the math here I think you can do it I think you just got to sit down and not have this vague worry about it\nAnd instead of having an actual game plan will lay out you know this was important this is more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing show that we can do this and that's ten grand a year per kid for college\nTo kids that's twenty grand if

you need to have somebody walk with you who's not in the fog if you go through this\nAnd or give you some and maybe maybe give you some information to give him a little bit of a wake up call as well but back to your original question I have a friend of mine the teacher's divorce recovery recovery after a divorce and um I remember many years ago hearing her say divorced turns a marriage into a business transaction\nAnd so it it comes it's a real quickly the emotions are carved often shut over to one side and the actual technical legal financial details are on the other side\nAnd it becomes very transactional kind of thing at that point does that make sense\nYes it did show a here here's a couple of things to look at your student loans or your student loans are going to go with you unless you know you may or may not get alimony child support or somebody else but your student loans are going to go with you um and you're gonna have to pay them show what is your personal income\nUh uh it they took out\nOkay All right and so what you start doing is if this was a a direction that you you know after seeing a counselor and ...\nTwenty two year investment uh him with all the help you can get a you start preparing for living on your own for fifty thousand bucks a year and you you look at your student loan so much to learn that if you got\nTo Kim I'm Sorry the Avon oh my lord okay [noise]\nWell how would let them know that this was going on hardship for all until you get\nPast ah what else whatever else is going on here okay now do you own a home\nYeah what's it worth it to migrate to apple what's out on it a high tech savvy Adam\nOkay so no equity either to amount to anything or is your car paid for yeah as his car by for\nNow okay is your name on that loan\nYeah\nGood okay are there any credit cards that have both of your names on them\nAnd they're the one that I shoot him ... ... I'm Sorry\nYou refused to let him using it all better than that glass closed that account today just completely closed the credit card if he has the number he can use it if he's one of the users on the car\n[laughter] period\nAnd if things go sideways emotionally inside your house I have run into situations in Thirty years of doing this where somebody takes an Mexico drip and puts it on the guard\nAnd you don't want to pay for five thousand dollar cruise for somebody else you know and it'll end up on this card so close the account today just completely shut it down to zero balance\nYeah\nGood close it okay ... does your checking account have both names on it yeah okay sure your money separated by march is there any other debt or dead instrument that's open that as both of your names on it\nYeah yeah\nOkay I wouldn't accept her mortgage probably as both are names on it okay so here's what happens you can't afford to keep the south ...\nYou can't stay there yeah um so the house that needs to either be refinanced to get your name off of the mortgage or sold you cannot stay on the mortgage and given the house that would be dumb\nAnd people often do that in a divorce they often do that\nBut just you know the negotiation is the cars and his name he keeps his car your cars and your name you keep your car you're checking accounts are already separated there's no other debt you get your student loan debt I'm ... does he have any big savings or investments or to you and for one case\nOr not they know how much am I Am I Am\nA ten thousand mhm four one K. and I'm not sure what he had um but I'm thinking about five or six thousand not much at all okay as far as what it says income [noise] ah it around Ninety thousand\nOkay in most states your attorney would have to advise you but in most states you would be do some alimony after twenty two years\nAnd that will going with your fifty thousand is how you will reset your life and stay out of debt and start working your way through these student loans that are outrageous and we're going to take some time to work through\n'em but you're going to be working extra job you're going to be doing everything else taking any any money you can squeeze out of your budgets and you are not going to Mexico you gotta mess on your hands [laughter]\nOkay no on that\nUm unless it's to escape no just kidding [laughter] ah but the ... so you know you're going to be on beans and rice rice and beans you're going to get the cheapest department you can get\nThe rest of the student loans as soon as you can get stabilize after the separation which will lead to divorce unless it leads to you all getting back together\nOkay but you pro care for separation the same way financially you would prepare for a divorce and that puts you in a position of strength\nTo negotiate in the divorce financially I'm ... and that's something that you'll have to do and your attorney and you get representation and you'll be ready to pay them pile up money for deposits and for paying them don't pay extra on the student loans until you get the other side of this and I'll just put 'em on ... and pay nothing right now\nLet's get the other side of cash but my hope is is that you guys you can see a counselor who can give you some words to say some tools to get by by wakeup call maybe the two you sit down with a coach or counselor and walk you through turning the corner on all of this before you get so far around the corner we can get you back\nAnd may be you can save this thing I ... that would be best for everybody involved I'm assuming the issues that you have that are causing you such concern or a draft and I'm sure that I'm sort of like a pretty long list but um\nTo sit down restaurant ... see a counselor for your sake call your pastor say who can I sit down with can walk me through\n'em\nIn the right questions to ask myself the right questions to ask him um 'cause he may think you're kidding oh he may think you're bluffing and when you actually move out it may it may wake him up and he may be willing to work on that list at that point I don't know\nBut those kinds of things are best guided by a really good marriage counselor\nThat's really experienced in wise and\nA godly council a will help you in that situation and I sure hope you guys can turn that around that would be my hope for you it'd be better for all of you are financially as well as everything else\nSo good question thank you for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five you jump and

they're just you know it'd be nice to have a nice ring and you can get another ring I mean there's just stupid rings everywhere I mean there's not a big thing it's not like at your wedding ring or something and it was a an anniversary gift that you couldn't afford\nOne way and I mean sweet but dumb well you know right yeah I think\nSo but I think the thing is here yeah I'm probably taking it back but more importantly I Want to take his brain and screw it back and a little bit better you know and to you all this out are we really doing this or not because otherwise you're you're never going to get there\nBecause apparently he's not on the same page or on that's a big thing I mean Ninety percent of this question is around that ten percent on one of the keep the ring or not the same and so this ring is not going to make or break you get out of debt plan one way or the other but this behavior will\nAnd this lack of being on the same page will so you know what let's just talk this through and and make sure we're on the same page and then you guys decide together what to do with the ringing I don't know I I it just represents dumb and so I'm not ever going to really be able to enjoy it\nIf I'm you are because it's just in violation of where are you thought your whole family was heading\nAnd it's like just kind of you know it's you know you guys are just too old to do that

deserve what's up\nUm so I recently to cover you I got three only about three years ago um started doing if you think we are we ended up going out to get out of debt\nI'm from New York teaching a my father died about five years ago on a motorcycle act and and um there were a bunch of life insurance policy that went through our personal financial adviser has been advising my mother ever spent Ben I'm and the question that I have in a clear\nFive years ago whenever my dad died a three hundred thousand dollars and the annuity um and then the other end up like Peter conducted and they've been growing a little bit here and there um but\nThe question of the annuity recently we had a five year mark and advising ready to pull the money I turn into fan which I think is a good idea however the question is is that\nShe should have should have had that money impacted initially at the beginning of the uh you know and put up pretty ... she brings home about thirty five hundred dollars a month and retirement and Social Security but she doesn't need the wrong anybody at all you know and he knew that the beginning of the time\nWell yeah you're right that makes me question and other things that are going on that I don't know what they are from you\nI'm but I I I and I am I personally\nWould have put all of it and the good investments at the time um you know it is the home paid off\nAll tied up one hundred percent car the head off she has the wrote that the rope\nGood good okay and how much is in investments total there's three hundred plus I'm\nYeah we're looking at probably about four hundred and twenty four hundred and fifty thousand a total with all the embarrassment of you out another fifty to sixty onto the honor their\nHow old is she ah she thinks she just turned sixty okay cool and she didn't write out because you know like on an old ... year old on her way out\nLike right out good I'm feeling better fifty seven to hear you say that so um [laughter] uh I'm not on my way out today either a anyway or at least to do them out to my knowledge anyway so yeah I I'm probably going to question all of that I mean\nIt's um it's not it's not like you put her in Hawaii policy which will be like a deal breaker or something silly like that I mean it just the annuity is is you know got a lot more fees to it a lot more commission to it and if it was a variable annuity in the money was in good mutual funds are probably performed okay\nAre there okay um but it's not my favorite thing to do\nBut it's not to the point that I like question his entire competency I just really want to know if it wasn't right for her ... if it's not right for her now why wasn't right for her then that's a good question in your mind Mr advisor\nAnd um I think you've got the right to ask that question and talk it through with them and if you can't get a comfort level or if he goes up on you and starts having an attitude and that's when you know it's time to move to anyway\nSo you do that with any financial people or people that are advising you on technical matters when they start\nGetting like ... like you have to owe them an explanation instead of us versus them move

be wise and maybe that's not a good\nWay to refinance our house to pay a credit card mhm I'm not a void of\nAnd participate in but not limited to\nI Know you normally say not to buy a house if you're in the military\nUm but I've made good money last two times I've done it and uh I Am uncomfortable having my whole network and I'm In the stock market basically 'cause we'd be looking at the house about three hundred fifty K. [noise] um [noise] you know we have three hundred and Fifteen cayenne retirement already and [noise]\nBut I Would have to take out two hundred twenty five K. and non retirement investments in order to be able to afford a house up there in San Diego so [noise] you know I don't want everything in the stock market us at all and everything in one house especially if I'm only going to leave their short time and I wanted to know your advice\n[laughter] [noise] um I don't have a problem with you not wanting everything in the stock market I Would not long distance landlord in order to accomplish\nMy goals though so you're talking about keeping the homeless by foreign Pensacola when you moved to San Diego is that what you're telling me\nYou know sort of a we have it on the market I I I Am going to cash out of this now essentially they're going to die out while they sell for a a little ... about three fifty\nOkay in a you're not going to be able to buy anything in San Diego for three fifty\nAlone not unless I catch up on retirement investments uh you know at two twenty five ... and now I can afford something up there\nWith how much do you have in on retirement is that all you've got\nA two point five K. non retirement so you're talking about a half million dollar house then yes or what's your household income\nOr about one eighty\nThe reason we tell folks to not buy in the military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough\nFor it to appreciate enough to sell it and make a profit and\nAlso sometimes some military markets have an oversupply of homes on the market they're hard to resell\nSo you get stuck in it and you lose money on it in some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see incredible appreciation and incredible market activity in both of those markets you should so\nSo you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing\nAnd you should be able to do the same in San Diego and I do agree real estate prices are up substantially um I'm not sure that you have to use all of that I Would probably if I were in your shoes what would I Do if I woke up in your shoes\nOr I Would either a rent\nOr be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought in San Diego\nAnd that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not going to I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of been spending five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and non retirement um or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable\nIn order to have a house like that uh with having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now if you re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash a non retirement cash and money from his other home\nAnd it goes up to seven hundred and when your salad you're probably next move moving to a cheaper market\nThere's not many more expensive markets for you to move to in the military than San Diego\nThat's about the ... I mean Hawaii ... Hawaii maybe okay by a there's a couple of other I mean there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper in the San Diego I think we all agree to that so if you make some money and you're there are three years\nAnd you sell out you're going to put money back in\nA less expensive home may be a larger home but less expensive home the next by in the next station does that make sense\nYes or the so it's not really a permanent decision even if you use all your non returned my cash\nAlthough I'm with you I don't think I'd want to use it all I'd probably try to buy something\nAnd the for hundreds instead of in the five hundreds leaving me with some cash\nIn non non retirement investing a but the point at your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all in one house and I don't like it all\nAnd I don't like so much of it being um I don't like using up all my non retirement investing from a portfolio standpoint my answer to that is is not for that long you're not going to be there ten years and if you are that that\nMakes us going to change during that ten years um but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of real is different expense of real estate in the next next location that your station\nI thank you for serving your

start or retirement and I guess uh do you ... well\nThe first thing we teach folks to do is to get out of debt and have an emergency fund before you start retirement and the reason is because if you don't have any payment you are more money freed up to put into retirement and then we want you to put Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement Jason what do you make a year\nA ... about her

thousand dollar household income and no data\nAnd you're thirty four years old well done well we want to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses that criminals rainy day fund and then we would tell you to put Fifteen Percent of your household income\nInto retirement and that's going to be about Eighteen thousand dollars a year in your case going into retirement and now you're asking how to fund that if if she as a nurse has her four oh three B or four one K. available at our hospital or a doctor's office you would put some money there especially if there's a match\nAnd
