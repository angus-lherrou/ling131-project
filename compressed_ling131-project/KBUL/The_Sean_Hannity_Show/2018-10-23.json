E. F. U. costs there are several of us that are considered uninsured people so are one of my questions is what should we do instead of term life insurance and in my case\nI already have accidental death insurance in place should I go ahead and canceled or keep it since I'm now can't get term insurance\nHow old are you [noise] forty three and why are you not insure all\nHistory of diabetes I'm no longer diabetic but I I just got 'em that diagnosis removed but I've had that in the past five years of my history\nOkay have you checked with Zander insurance and see what they can Roger\n[noise] we're in the process of having them do that kind of a double check\nBroker on dry out or something yeah because you know every day that goes by you're going to be more and more in trouble in your situation so that's great news ... hopefully as a short lived\nIssue okay because in other words I think I think you're gonna be able to get insurance I just don't know exactly when or what it's going to cost that's the other thing you've gotta look at it or he could be unreasonable but I'm diabetes is a real tough\nDiagnosis for life insurance really tough so um anyway the answer your question overall is if someone's uninsured people yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental\nThere would be your cause a except that you've had the diabetes issue um but otherwise I mean you statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidental death as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kind of gimmick insurance is what it is a definitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay you know to the very last moment and if you're a term ... is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nNo I have not I didn't know about those\nSometimes they do a sometimes it's very very expensive uh but again you might be worth it or if you've got a non medical renewal it might just jump way up like triple or something what you're paying now kind of thing um so would you have like a ten or twenty year term it's run out\nPhones a purple eight to five\nFive two to\nChelsea is in Los Angeles how Chelsea how are you\nI'm doing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up in your world\nI had a question for you in regards to um\nOur the papers the salary my my husband has traditionally been tricked condition but where they're going to be given him a pay raise but with that pay raise their um say that he also has that they're going to be transitioning him into salary pay he usually works between five and twenty hours of overtime each week\nSo I wanted to make sure that when I hear they haven't given him an offer it yet but when they do want it to make sure that\nHow would you how would you recommend\nTo calculate whether\nThe salary rate is comparable with for example the hours that she was working before and the pay that he would get what overtime\nWhich will be simple you've been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that and overtime correct correct and so what was his income wash here including the overtime with about forty thousand is how will that compared to the salary\nBut that's the part that we don't know yet\nSalary of the ...\nAnd how will that compared to the salary\nThat ... that that probably that we don't know yet\nConsortium salary is ... if the salary is fifty that's a raise if the salary is forty five and the same number of hours or expect to be work it's effectively a pay cut\nRight\nYes does that make sense it's like I like as we were I was kind of weird because it's just more if they're wearing the ... member cheer mhm um I Know that he has the potential to work more hours so because of that I was kind of\nVery bad but the question was the question and it's not just more hours the question is is this a good deal for him apples to apples and not a ... ... ... and has he got the chance to move up in the company because he moved to salary\nYes he's going to be moving into management condition\nNo but I mean further up later oh okay but let's say like I say they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary\nWhere we'd be dancing wouldn't we\nYeah\nOkay 'cause that's like that's like getting paid a lot more\nAnd I'm working the same number of hours you know and it's like it's almost like he picked up more hours but didn't have to work on you see what I'm saying but it but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did him a favor and it's a ... and he gets paid forty but he's working in the same number of hours where he's working when he's making forty eight then that's not a blessing\nYeah it's just making sense to you yeah that makes sense\nIf it's even if it's forty eight to forty eight we still like the salary because of the upward potential\nOkay long term it's a long term good career movies moving into leadership into management and that's where he wants to head towards long term\nBut I'm the you know the yes but but again you just compare it to last year's income so the whole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand what's the salary do 'cause that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently\nChris is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how are you\nI'm doing good day thanks taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nUh well right now I'm a I'm like income about thirty one thousand dollars a year [noise] I've got a fourteen hundred dollars in credit card debt\nOr about eleven thousand a student loan debt that it\nAh that that about six months ago was about Nineteen thousand [noise] I've been working working hard and save money and paying it off as much as I can good or not I'm not a cooked right now I came up with the idea for an invention ...\nAnd I don't know whether to keep you know steam rolling my debt plan and doing all that are just you know kind of jumped ship and say hey this is something that could\nYou know be my future ... and potentially mhm\n[laughter] so [laughter] I mean it kind of want a young lady in financial advice from you know what to do with the remaining then I have and yeah my aspiration because I'm In the process I've been saving to ah get a v a home loan now is just about their so any advice you can give me I'd be greatly appreciated\nRight well I'm going to avoid buying a home until I got the debt cleared the only question is then how can we start working on the invention idea and make some money now 'cause we don't need to make a bunch of money five years from now we need some money to a day\nWhen I'm twenty thousand dollars today show the invention you came up with as a physical product\nYes sir it's a a odor the odor either slash a mold a little small machine\nPeople getting on their own okay and you've made one\nI ... made a very um rudimentary crowded tight mhm the next the next phase I got in like either the at the end of my rainy day fund or start coming in my regular cash flow\nAnd like my computer and get my three D. modeling and get me a couple of silicon prototype so I can go you know take it to a you know take the next level or what I Want to do\nSo again Dr jump off my my dad plan more do I have my invention [laughter]\nOkay um well what you're talking about you could spend anywhere from twenty five dollars to a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it there's really no in between I mean you could just go anywhere you want to go with this there's a lot of money to be spent on something like this\nAnd if you were a billionaire and you you know you ... what you would do is you would build a couple of them and you get them out there and test them and make sure that they work and that you there was a market for it before you went into production\nBecause you don't go into production on prototypes that are on tested or from an R and D standpoint or you don't go into production on something that I've got no market for it not been able to sell it\nBecause you can let you make a hundred thousand of them and having them in your basement if you had unlimited sums ever be able to sell them\nYou know ... I'd like trying to ah continue to do it the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one and let's find somebody to put one in there in the property and a commercial applications\nAnd let's say let me give me just let's just make up a pretend example okay like your ideal thing you build one or two in your garage and you'd convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the ... the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works\nAnd if the ideal works then and what I'm going to want you to his place in order for ten of 'em or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside to test it and then if they place that order they just place it deposit with large enough to build the order\n... and it finds itself\nThat's called organically cash flowing something in other words you you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order with enough of a deposit to fill the manufacturer your first order out\nWhat they think I should dial down uh my rather than just than all my extra capital towards paying out my credit card debt and my student loan debt\nI don't have time and much capital on this you've already we're already built one in the garage yeah build another one okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right [noise]\nWell I keep it in that but I I just see I'm a perfect if I Want it to be you know a good good like I'm proud of\nThat so now that it's a prominent lived there on Oprah factions [laughter] very they're very purpose of a prototype despite all the crap this broken [laughter]\nWant to get it perfect you're going to put it out there in the in the marketplace is going to kick it around and you're going to learn form and function changes informants function changes in this which has to be on that side of this which has to be made out of this instead of that and you're only going to learn that if you beat up about a hundred of them but let's get two of 'em in somebody's restaurant\nIn there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later are two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got um you know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got to have the ... I'm ... and then they give you enough money\nIn their deposits for the initial order for you to do your manufacturing\nAnd basically you got almost nothing out of pocket except your brain power and your sweat\nAnd that's how a lot of these things get off the ground\nExcept your brain power and you're sweating\nAnd that's how a lot of these things get off the ground\nThe way a lot of people lose a lot of money on them as they go into my production or something to prove the marketplace or the actual prototype\nAnd you're talking to a guy who's lost money that way so stupid stuff so do we usually go easy on this or that Iran's or show\nFour years one of the most asked questions I get is day one are you going to do a lot of them in and our city\nWas a radio show and book tours and are

the most overlooked things are term life insurance and\nDisability insurance both plans make sure that you have an income to pay bills\nAnd take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen for term life you need to carry tend to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most families should stay away from cash value or return a premium plans there

wanted to do it right\nYou know I thought about that Sharon I used to do that we would go drive the rich neighborhood and then go you know some day we can do that and here's all we gotta we gotta do
