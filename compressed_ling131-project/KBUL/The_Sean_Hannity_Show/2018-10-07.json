springboard grill a quick off our previous caller something I'm not at ... something I've said for years about time if I have a bait the law done everything no right to acquire my firearms and I'm Still doing everything right to keep them\nIf someone comes to take them they're welcome to have them as long as ... ready to receive all my reading ammo first\nOkay I hear what you're saying I let me ask you a question because I mean I hear people saying things like that yeah in in line with you know and I read the piece about the revolutionary war a before we started the show\nAre you saying that you would use your firearms to defend yourself against a gun confiscation program\nI Would use them to defend myself against a program unless they actually made a change to the United States Constitution they're up and then I Would have to leave the country I don't know where I Would go at that point but until such a change was made constitutionally\nMhm I I Would be forced to so\nOkay I mean and and just I'm asking you understand what I'm asking because that's a serious statement on you know some people say that I don't know it is actually thought about it through that understand okay what you're saying is I Will go to war over this with the understanding that I Will very likely be killed\nOh indeed and that would be a civil war as opposed to work to be between the states because the previous civil war was not one that will say well between distaste because constitutionally you were put into two different states\nAnd with this would be basically defending yourself against the government a government run amok\nAgainst tyranny yes or no\nThere it is All right thanks er I appreciate that done well lying for students with us out of Camilla, Georgia hey Stu your own
