right how about yourself better than I deserve how can I help\nUm my question is well we've been doing your program now for the last of amber and gotten rid of a lot of good my mother\nShe babysit their kids or our kid right now will be two here in November hum and she's planning on moving back so\nRight now we live with my mother in law which is my wife's mom\nAnd we could transfer their is filled have both of our jobs if she quits also we our health insurance goes to my health insurance which is a lot more expensive than hers mhm and\nSo what does your wife make\nEr about thirty two thousand a year mhm\nAnd I make around forty okay\nYou know she's not going to know that a lotta for daycare on that you want to lose money she basically be working for daycare and health insurance but mainly um I mean it's not going to just not twenty five hundred dollars a month but it is probably going to be a you know Fifteen hundred isn't it\nYeah come to the Eighteen 'cause one will be a newborn\nNow coming out to babies okay yeah I'm All right uh ... and what do you do for a living\nI'm In sales or my wife works for the state to yourself um pest control in termites or something like that mhm\nAnd that your company has a branch and the other city\nOh yeah ... throughout the state okay All right\nUm well here's the wage which\nYou know your ears and I think I Would want to decide\nWhere idle Leo's based on some formula other than where the babysitter live\nYeah\nOkay I don't like that formula much I get how you're going there\nBut I think you need to decide where you live based on the quality of life based on\nA line of credit is an approved alone\nFor that you take out only when you would want to\nKnow where you could get pre approved and have a\nLien against your house for a certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit [noise]\nUm and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically\nA show or is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that we tried to get the other way we went to to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one one would you get reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of debt because when you don't have any payment you know what you have money\nThe bar or a slave to the lenders so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the core worn out to the point is going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it\nIn other words a hundred thousand miles dodged neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started at that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point\nI mean do they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay it's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built that say a higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well bill I mean ... again Honda Lexus or Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um\nThe larger body Ford products forge building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck for truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing you think about that it's got easily another hundred in it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we can depends on your budget and how nice car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor it at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or no I got to got about fifty something on it\nAnd I'm sure there's a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day and um\nSo you know you just you're looking at that your situation to what is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nI'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't know how to address and looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how're you\nI'm Seventeen years old and a high school senior I've got about three thousand dollars and the count out donating should I invest in New Hampshire and then you're going to college the community college with a pilot program in St Louis and olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd years and then ending on how the program ... maybe ... service the fibers maturity and I keep them at the community colleges is either and you're right I Know of course yeah yeah\nI Will be true if you get some search some certifications and stuff in the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that\nOn crime so that's what you want to do you won't be a programmer or you want to be an hour or whatever mhm okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus um you can invest it a\n... here's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment a mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to ten and a nine point nine finish college and all your education\nWas he wrote that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you Dustin as a better investment than a mutual fund is\nAssuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know maybe I'll talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account at this stage\nUh with this amount of money in\nYour situation because again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree\nAnd your field of study whether it's a two year or the certifications in the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools and your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream\nWithout any of that and that three thousand dollar spent on that is more important than than the mutual fund and so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise]\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nI'm great Dave it's an honor to speak with you you too sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward type of Fifteen Percent for retirement and we're using the excess our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension take nine percent of our gross take home pay our dilemma is when we have an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from all agree to fail ration so when we say ... percent were able to save a lot for a mortgage celebration is it okay to do that or him recommend saving the twenty four\nPercent now they the mandatory amount that you're putting in are you ... are you vested in that is that a a ... choosing an investment for that or is a pinch and\nGet the answer is no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or OK er and it's nine percent nine percent yeah okay\nSo the the equation is do we put sixteen on top of that or do we only put six on\nChant nine percent yeah okay so\nThe the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nCorrect ... I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like\nThe pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly wrong state and now we're better than all those guys [laughter] ah yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we count as before then that means we need to put it in ten percent\nRight you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there you know\nSo um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit our show and just round numbers let's put in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but you know it's a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so um\nThat that's what that's what I Would I back off a little bit\nAppreciate your joining us today Ramsey show [noise]\nAll big John extraordinary things start from ordinary things that may start from changing the ordinary habits in your day to day life your seat changing these habits is the foundation of our teachings after smart conferences and I'm excited to announce this fall and winter we're headed your way at this event\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as long as two of you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nOne of the main things that someone needs to do to get out of that\nBudget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough you know it's there you make plenty you spend too much [laughter]\nWith drew generally true\nOkay so I I also think that they need to focus on why they're doing it and to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that\nMy reason why it might not be the exact same reason as his wife but the end goal that that way in front of us is what we're both gravitating toward ...\nOkay go what was your why\nRight here I I like um kids and your family tree I just the legacy I I'm listening to a lot of your

'cause we have our mortgage oil three rental property that we\nHave mortgages on and and that is true that fears we've had a fungal graduate high school he's in college we paying about half the tuition would have been taken out loans other half and I and\nI stopped contributing to a four one K. and see if I've got a beginner baby steps say but I just feel like I I'm not sure what to do next I I feel like I'm not doing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income about a hundred thousand okay\nChoking the two of you you and him a cash flow the school\nAnd I stopped the studio is\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on a these properties as we've been for the past couple of years okay if you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into bed I Would rather pay get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is there a reason they plan doesn't sound you\nKnow it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to be going to college to hear the next few years and you\nWill ... maybe ... four or five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement five is kids college which you are cash flowing in this case\nAnd ah the Sixers payoffs mortgages how are you know rentals in the house and so forth but really um you know in your case you're going to really you you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to\nPay on your mortgage is yeah which is stupid in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think a lot of our Confederate that we should just save up a a a three maybe four month emergency five and then\nYeah and then and then I stopped taking out student loans and\nClear them out and then to the same with the other day and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there's money above that then we start throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two so it sounds like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not shooting\nI'm In a house is tiny but then and then ... your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about about fifty sixty Seventy thousand hippies\nOkay or the fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen yeah yeah and for what is the only ones only twenty five thousand or write them a check like a year from now when I was going to feel good and my son is still alive and take out a low\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental ... there was one in there somewhere to make them at work All right I'm Still I'm just going to plink along on those minimums\nAnd take care of college without that first once we got college without that then we find money we throw it up to have to probably go knock out a little twenty five one out and then among next knocked my house out 'cause it's a pretty even with the other one's\nAbout first we're getting back in the four oh one K. or not\nOh I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now well okay yeah well no so did you get your emergency fund right merge and she found as maybe step\nThree and then babysit forest Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack baby steps four five six in order\nTo actually three four five six cars you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then if there was money left we keep going down the list and the next thing on the list as mortgages Dutch is that so there's still a prioritization even though it's simultaneously is that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before then skip a tree to tree I guess technically\nYou're given five are skipping five okay yeah yeah yeah and you have any skip three to yeah [laughter] yeah\nSo yeah you're on our lawyers wouldn't know what you're back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a ... with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nHigh ... the it's an honor to talk to you how can I don't think for you [laughter] okay\nUm we had our house currently on the market right now we live today in July for two teams [noise] um I Know there's not an ill in our area [noise] um we did lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [laughter]\nWe've had only one showing we've had hundreds of heads on line [noise] um what we're struggling with here and we paid one fifty for the house the average stays on the market and my area as three hundred and sixty nine [laughter] good\nLord what is wrong on the area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania\nWe have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half a million [noise] um and then me and said that that occasion because it's on lake we're on water on a on a dream but I'm\nA military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYeah so you're not in in Harrisburg proper them no no I'm In like northeast yesterday a near up here in New York border but so your biggest problem is you have a very\nLimited market yes the dummy three sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in\nI mean and all that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff right and you just have a limited market I don't know what to do your other than\nIs there anyone in the resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like\nAnd I don't know what to do your other than a is there anyone in the resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort\nIs or is or a a real her up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that usually there are signs everywhere the kind of specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the have stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our rental car that just not not purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort\nArea [noise] the higher and stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise] we need to get it or we have an hour drive to work we can't do it anymore\nYou know okay I mean can you know\nWe're on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like that we say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices your problem or you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at\nThey're looking at it on line\nAll they're just workers or not they're not clients are lurking they're just like the picture flip through them in the ... where it was I walked away they were not client's\nLocation Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor I'm saying that others are as his sold for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the lot you know\nBut he found a buyer square miles to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one\nI mean do I pick another well yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses\nThat when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and she says gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the person that can do that\nGathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel I'm Down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area\nAnd that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you and that a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't work in this area\nAnd they and they don't have a central Meyer stores you need to it's a very unique\nSemi rural ... situation\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nTheft has become an epidemic data breaches are being recorded every day and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy now I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked\nOut when they become an identity theft\nVictim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans to find out really quick how unprotected they are in so many ways that's why ... id theft plan to our benefit package was such a smart move the Sanders plan covers all types of ID theft takes over all the work and even coverage your bank account if it gets act\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and he wasn't that way on one of\nThose ads [laughter] I was actually not that way

lake house or something you know the the\n... what's your wired it was really difficult to to give out some things that you know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that but it also kind of boils down to the are getting older and we have you know what do we want to do with them as they get old ...\nAnd and what we want to show them and say we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart has you know we needed to see what was important\nAnd they're going to see them you know well and the other things are obviously in terms of time spent somewhere where there's the beach with a leg that kinda stuff with the income you've got and no debt\nEven do anything you wanted to yeah I mean you can go to like in Europe and if you want I mean it's you know you can do whatever you want to as as not even anywhere near as expensive as those houses ourselves right it's um you know you are your freed up to still have incredible\nUh family memories doing it doing recreational type stuff is what I'm trying to say interesting\nVery interesting\nShow 'em so a big pile of it was that what was the rest of the debt so our our whole debt\nAnd by virtue of paying those off we're able to pay off the home that we live in ... and so\nWe we use the cash derived from that ... plus cash flow and some savings\nTo pay for our home that we live and okay so it was just
