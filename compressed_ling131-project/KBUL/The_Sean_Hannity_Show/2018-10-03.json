talk about your life\nAnd your money it's a free call Shay is with us an arena Oh hi Shay welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave thanks for taking my call today sure what's up on the health\nInsurance question for you and I'm hoping you could give me some insight on it we adopted our two children about three years ago and they came from the foster care system so we don't get a lot of services but one thing we do get is health insurance until they're Eighteen and it's provided through our state Medicaid system\nAnd every year my husband and I kind of go back and forth on whether or not to keep it or to put them on his plan through his employer and we're getting close to that um [noise] time of year to make that decision\nOkay um what would his employer's plan cover that Medicaid is not covering\nWell they've both been healthy thankfully I guess or um you know the thing we always come back to is unknowns of any kind of health issues that they may however\nMany services because even though the Medicaid coverage is crummy you know and a lot of ways a lot of doctors don't take it and it's a basically welfare insurance um it has covered their needs up to this point because those kids are healthy and they've had you know minimal minimal\nIncident afraid if they had some kind of a major event that he'll Medicaid would not do a good job of covering and that his insurance might\nActually it's more the opposite I'm not worried about the major stuff because like we had to go to the ER for you know my you know got scraping the bottom and they pick up the tab for everything it's more the ongoing care there is um you know it's very hard to find providers who take it there's a bit of a steak\nThere there is um you know it's very hard to find providers who take it there's a bit of a stake then we feel\nA little strange having that kind of coverage given our own financial position you know that our kids are on a um [noise] there's a bit of a stigma that oh I don't feel they're having it so it's just it's just kind of a dilemma we face every year and\nAnd you are you know in November we can make if they offered you a a you know free food stamps because you are adopted a foster child you know that would feel the same way as what you're saying um it\nWould yeah I mean I well I look at you and he has to be ready to learn to type\nAnd that takes care of their you know their their financial needs and [noise] um so I don't know this is not an easy\nNow is a question and does it\nTo fire on all six nine zero for nine eight five\nThis is the Dave Ramsey show on the station where Montana talks news talk Ninety five point five\n[noise]\nGet joining us from air force so glad you're with us as the Dave Ramsey shop Jackie's with us in Columbia South Carolina Jackie how are you\nHow far they thank you for taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nI Want to know if I course I Know for my son is there to try it\nUh about Seventy thousand\nSeventy okay in what is your son make\nA machine shed got a job about twenty thousand dollars a hour Adam ... lake in about twenty to twenty five hours a week\nHe's working twenty hours a week yeah [noise] okay what's he doing with the rest of his time\nHe he he doesn't want\nTo have a job that will cause liquid this job because he's been trying to get into this job forever because\nWhy would a conflict with his job he's only working twenty hours a week\nRight to call 'em for this job\nTwenty hours a week or the whole week\nTwenty hours a week maybe twenty five ... ... ... ... is the TV station and he he just a good thing when they have a football game and the game the fix for it at the game\nThen what would you be on call for football there's no emergency football\n[laughter] but he's been trying to get into the TV stations we're\nNot got that part but he's working twenty hours a week and his mother is calling me 'cause she came by his dad gum twenty thousand dollar bill I'd like for him to work another forty hours a week on top of the twenties playing football\nSo she can pay is freaking bills so you're not calling me how would that sound that would sound awesome\nI I Try to tell you that when I get out and get them to come through and I think and I guess when I have to say like out\nIn the ... the Thirteen days late at least thirty days late every time you don't work much\nYeah yeah there's a great place to go when you're broke to work\nSo uh what I Would tell him to do is get into financial peace university and get his young budding gear\nAnd start paying that ... I mean if I'm you I'm going to be all up on this kid because he's twenty eight years old and he's a slacker\nAnd his momma is calling me you single after\nHis mom's a single lady out here when you're fifty what got a fifty\nFifty years old and you're having to pay this kid's bills yeah I'm mad at him right now I don't want you to be two and a good loving mom a kind of way I'm not trying to disown him I just want to knock him out on his little head okay well\nYou know and then you you better plan on paying ... doesn't get moving okay right so you know ball and knock it out and then you know shock it up to that and but dude I'm telling you ah we're going to have some discussions is he married\nHe lived through the girlfriend\nOkay I'll bet she works forty hours yesterday yeah\nThere you go [noise] alright open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Katherine is with us from Portland Maine Hi Katherine how are you\nDave thank you I don't think he is about my budget I Do the every dollar budget among baby step to great I protect my expenses for the month [laughter]\nProject what I'm going to be paying for debt and then sometimes something happens like last month when my car broke down and I had to have a tone and repaired and it costs almost five hundred dollars [laughter]\nI Know some had in mind off on that we know that one of 'em are often do you have your your baby step one with a thousand dollars right I Do now that would be an emergency that you would use that for\nOkay but that's what I was confused it out because the way I handled it well\nItem to my budget for that item and enemy the amount that I pay toward get for that month so I get it wrong\nThat would be okay you cash flow did\nYou just ... but if you can cash flow it\nThat month that's fine I didn't have to come out of the emergency funds so you are paying more than five hundred dollars extra on that each month yeah good answer you reduced it by five hundred for one month 'cause you got kicked in the kneecap what this thing but usually you're not going to have that month in a month out\nNow there's some things if a if there's a recurring unexpected event it no longer is unexpected\nFor anti and you know you don't have anything budgeted for car repairs well that would not work because most cars are going to need some repairing over a period of six months you know they're going to have\nAnything that she did for car repairs\nYeah I probably would put something in there for that because the ... your budget needs to reflect the real world and the real world is you're gonna spend something on that car in a given six month period of time it might be tires that might be maintenance that might be oil change it might be a five hundred dollar toe you know\nBut you're going to spend something on a car in unless you're driving really nice brand new cars you're going to spend something on the car during that time so your budget should reflect reality in that regard\nSo probably gonna add a little bit of a sudden it to be a lot safety or a hundred bucks or something and let that build up\nAs a sinking fund they call it than the every dollar software or in a ... I don't care where you build it up but somewhere you build it up and you ah have the money in cash than for your car repair as it comes up and that's an example of something that is recovering so it's no longer unexpected\nEmergencies should be unexpected things\nThings that are are often enough that we can expect them aren't emergencies anymore but you did good yeah you did find just cash flow through that emergency you slow down your debt snowball for that month and then you pick that up next month hopefully you won't have another one of those and you you can really\nBuild it up and go from there so good question and you're doing good keep after Tom is with us in San Francisco Hi Tom welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nDo their free shouldn't be doing a great thing I've been an avid fan for three days now\nThank you [laughter] I'm On are elated we've been together a long time you and I [laughter]\n[laughter] so the question to you so my wife and I only have about three hundred okay and and student did another hundred and Fifteen and automobile and a line of credit that type of thing so I was about four Fifteen totally to\nAnd you know we make a pretty good income shoot at about one twenty annually I met one eighty three hundred come on the question for you is I was a move back to school to get my masters the programs only twenty five okay to feel like that would be a very real are why on it\nBut over the last three days are starting to think maybe maybe I shouldn't [laughter] just want to get your take on that\n... masters in what [noise] oh it would be software engineering ... ...\nAnd it would increase your income by more than twenty five K\n[laughter] it would probably be hard to say I'm there would be when he came and raise 'cause of the category of jump into\nAll kinds of you and you can get back into it would make it back in touch over a year then from that point so that's really nice return I think you can put that in the budget and the reason you can put it in the budget as you make so stinking much money\nNow you live in in a very expensive area granted\nIt's crazy expensive to buy\nAnd the budget as you makes us thinking much money now you live in in a very expensive area granted it's crazy and can I ask you want to limit really repaired but but yeah but you guys are really you're really spending money ...\nAnd so I mean how quick can we pay off four hundred well we can pay off four hundred and two years if we do it in two hundred a year that menu be living on a hundred I'm not sure you can do that after taxes in your area so you probably got a three year and get out of debt plan [noise]\nBut yeah like no vacations you don't need to see the inside of a restaurant and don't you scare me by buying anything else\nYou bought enough for a while you need to you need to live like people that make a hundred people that make three hundred and get this debt cleaned up\nIn the process of doing that can you will you twenty grand a\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make\nAs an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full\nOr am I going to go to a community college for two years and then go and those credits all transfer and then go to a regular school I mean for your school for two years to finish up or that kind of a thing\nCommunity college has a lot less expensive and you can get your basics out of the way for the first two years for a four year degree if you want to show the second thing once you've determined what you want to do and how you're going to do it then the second thing you do is\nCollege cost is the number one cause of student loan that they are and what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a huge pickup truck\nBoth or transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of you know the mall and\nAnswer if you if you don't have any money and you're saving up you can't afford a Bentley you can't afford to go to a super expensive college and there's nothing wrong with that by the way I didn't go to a super expensive college so you go to an end state school\nThere in Florida you go to the University of Florida Gainesville or you go to University of central Florida right there in Orlando a wonderful ... near one but wonderful both of them in state tuition not that expensive and uh that's thing one your college selection\nAs at the least expensive college that will help you get the degree that you need to get is what you need to aim at\nWith rare exceptions and you're not going out of state and you're not going super expensive private the second thing is then you start looking for scholarships and you make scholarship hunting your full time job\nOr an after school job that kind of thing and you start applying for and filling out the scholarship forums and riding the essays and you'd\nProbably ask for a thousand scholarships and you'll probably get turned down for nine hundred and fifty of them but if you get fifty one thousand dollar scholarship she just went to school for ... that'd be pretty cool\nNot a bad part time job the third thing is planning on working a lot while you are in school don't borrow money so you don't have to work work\nGet good jobs jobs that pay a lot dog walking cutting grass jobs people don't want to do what they pay a lot to do I'm not talking about minimum wage crap and if you're gonna live on campus go ahead and be an R. A. B. a residential advisor or written us and what they call it what is in RA\nHow it is it is a resident advisor okay so there you know the babysitter in the dorm okay and uh you get free dorm for doing that and sometimes free tuition for doing that and sometimes free tuition free dorm and pay for doing that she'll be in our a if you're going to live on campus\nOr work in the cafeteria get free food do you live on campus if you can get a job working for the university the tuition might be completely free\nAnd that might be different to something to look at it so that's the kind of stuff you look at but figure out where you're going what the steps are to get their figure out the cheapest way to get their figure out scholarships or somebody pays you to get there and then plant and working your butt off and those things will get you through\nThey're figure out the cheapest way to get their figure out scholarships or somebody pays you to get there and then plan on working your butt off and those things will get you through school completely debt free in this day and time and it can be done Alex is with us in Baltimore hey Alex welcome to the day Ramsey show\nAnd Mr Ramsey ... thank you for everything that you do thank you I just wanted to give me a call and aren't you know that one I Am debt free I'm On baby step three or five months say about two months ago are my six months but here's my question and I work full time in a retail establishment\nAnd I have a small\nA job that I find myself on the side\nI'm at that point in the retail establishment where I think it's time for me to say adios and start my focus toward my my own personal business I Want to know should I you can't show would you advise to use my emergency fund\nTo help me through that I was growing pains of being full time with my small ...\nNo it's not an emergency [noise] um\nYou're creating an emergency by leaving the job too soon I don't blame you from one to leave and we wanted to do your own thing I Want you to do that too but once you get how you get your side business making more money you're going to work anymore\nAnd you may have to just take fewer hours at the a retail thing and back your hours down that may mean you move to a different retail job I don't know but today you're not making enough money on the side job or you wouldn't have asked that question\nTrue much money you make it on the side\nA neat nearly um probably pulling down about twenty\nOr is your best month over\nA thousand four thousand one was a\nA pie about seven months ago\nYou know you gotta gotta get there now what are you making on the retail gig\nAh about three months now so yeah I mean you need to have you need to have a steady three thousand a month and I think you can get their real glove listen June up doll in this side gig\nAnd get it we're steady so that you're not taking such a big risk then you wouldn't have when you can live on the free among them three months even do that just your budget to do that and then make your job\nThis is Dave Ramsey and I'm here to help\nAnd Ninety five boys are\nYou guys hear me say all the time that if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else I'm so excited to introduce our brand new book every day millionaires how ordinary people built extraordinary wealth and how you can to\nWritten by number one national best selling author Kris Hogan his book is based on the largest study ever done what ten thousand\nMillionaires and the results will shock you\nYou will learn the real truth about what it takes to become a millionaire\nIt doesn't matter where you came from it matters where you're going today you can pre order everyday millionaires for only twenty dollars and get over fifty dollars and free bonus items\nThe bonus items include the everyday millionaires audio book any book a video lesson for me called it's okay to be wealthy and video a lesson from ... called how to retire inspired pre order every day millionaires Dave Ramsey dot com or call us at triple a twenty two piece\nOptics move crazy amounts of data at even crazier speeds and ... is the one hundred percent fiber optic network with files that connection you'll get the fastest Internet available to download speeds up to nine hundred and forty ...

help out and I and I feel like I've lost myself and I have no idea where to even start to find my interests are my strength\nYeah well I I understand that you feel that way but that is an absolute wiser you have to acknowledge the fact that that's just a lack of confidence there is some self doubt it's creeping because you've been at home for a while\nAnd here's another reality reality is that right now to Katie in America we have more jobs that are available than there are people who are unemployed it is a fantastic job market even first day at home moms meaning you want to stay home but work from home\nAnd so what you have to first do is get very very clear you're in that first age and that is the stage of discovery\nThat's what we're taking a shower come on come on Tripoli eight to five five two to five edge AAA the two five five two to five and we're going to go to Patricia who's on the line in Tampa, Florida how can we all\nThink that they can I call jerks absolutely so\nYou haven't read a book than you could know eleven has um I'd love to open fire yoga studio that function guys out wellness center so off or not to say oh God the financial coaching and other things to cook for physical mental and emotional health\nBut I think about selling my house and dying and he'll play you know where I live up there and it will be the wellness center like concern that that is that\nUm well what there is some sort of liability\nWell or go ahead you\nKnow like if someone wants to get hurt a lot I Know that could apply for the and they go out there if I were to fill that will go after the fitness but I Lived in the same building with that there but I don't know I'm Wondering if that would be an issue well\nYou've got a couple of things going on here but you're going to want to own a a spend a little bit how each of them first of all um that's probably going to be state specific so you definitely need to look at the laws and your state in any type of regulations\nI'm you're gonna have liabilities regardless whether it's a stand alone studio or it's where you live so you're you're going to have liability if someone gets hurt and you need to know what those are and to protect yourself with insurance um professional insurance products based insurance if you have a product that type of things do you want to look into that\nBut I Do just want to challenge you and one thing for ... I Love your idea I Love the idea of a wellness center I Love the idea that you're helping people but here's a traditionally encourage people to do\nBecause you don't currently have a yoga studio and you don't have the idea of validated\nI Want to challenge you to start a little bit smaller in a little sooner\nSo I'll give you an example where is there a wellness center community center yoga studio ... studio somewhere where you could start your business sublease third base in their off hours builds your brand builder demand you have no risk no overhead no upfront cost\nAnd you're able to validate your idea until the business justify you getting your own space be that a duplex that you live above or your own standard on space I'll give you an example there are a lot of churches\nThat will operate when they're getting started out of like elementary schools the elementary school right next door household they don't have school on Sundays so they rented out to a church that use it on Sunday and it's just great deal to win when it's additional revenue for the ...\nHaving to afford a whole building seven days a week when they can't justify it and I've seen a lot of businesses do that so I don't think your idea is a bad idea I Would just down to just start smaller in sooner on a lower risk level lower cost level and validate your idea and build those relationships build your brand in your demand\nGet that going and then when you're ready to have your own studio it's the next logical step it doesn't feel like a terrifyingly so yes I Want to look into laws and regulations for liability but also when you think about your space before you make that big commitment\nPatricia are you a lot of\nPhone are you working full time right now\nRight and that was the question I work full time and I think I'm going to Iran and on I was planning on going back to share that way um I said I'll be I'll be making more money but it'll help wake up funding like business as well\nYeah I well I ... you can I just wanted to know that fact because this this that piece of information please beautifully knew what you're saying\nShe's going to have to do this on the side anyway she's not in a position to open up anything I don't think you were trying to go round open it um I I just want to see maybe do a little bit of yoga for some people maybe two or three mumps running you see if you can get a small group didn't pay you\nBecause it's everything you just said but it allows you to tiptoe into it or the nurse practitioner thing that's going to school to get that going to make more money I Love that too is going to lower the cash flow have more cash piled on when it's time to to operate so I mean ... you nailed it there I I just think ... you know don't rush into\nThe well and the other thing I Want to call out for anyone listening right now that has a service based business and like a yoga studio you have a tendency to think that the studio is the business it's not if you that's a way you can go anywhere you can go to people's houses you can go to the park outside their calming and paying for you so don't feel like you have to have a location\nBefore you can start your business because you are the business so you can start tomorrow Patrice ... out of your living room if you want to learn down the street and by the way you should [laughter] go ahead totally yeah yeah don't wait for the studio studio is not the memory you are the business point people don't care I Know what I mean ... enjoy it they're coming for you they're not accounting for the building\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight to five five two to five ... Coleman crispy rice sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour taking your calls about your business your business idea or a career career change career question let's go to bill is on the line and Detroit Michigan bill how can we'll\nHead of the crust on her to get a few good luck on how can we'll hope I've been on the chief field for about Twenty years and to the point that really hasn't been I haven't progressive far like clear as\nI originally hoped and wished I had\nA long story short is I'm back in January wife and I went through a pie view and as we're about to a baby steps Ron based up to right now\nGoing through some of our stuff planning to get a grabs sales go on a we came in to some old home movies have a fish from stuff that she had gotten from a bad um when he had died um and\nDo all the things we found you know we had a lot of old age millimeters old VHS of stuff and it's like okay we have a lot of stuff [noise]\nUm I started to ... and I really found a passion for that that I haven't had an idea for quite a while and I'm thinking okay this sounds like something I could turn into a great business doing going forward\nI'm looking at this point bill and\nBill let me interrupt what is the bit to get right to what is the business with the military or what is the business\nI'm convinced\nLike you know later VHS wide films all that uh could digital content and properly preserve them\nOkay and so what's your question for us then\nI'm boom bought a question I have is just um how to get started um I definitely want to get started and I just want to make sure I'm stepping throw it properly and I'm\nMore tell you what Bill question bill ... he's ready to go she can because we only have a little bit of time here I Want to be able to get to your your solution\nWe want to make sure we might help yeah here's the thing about the great news desk\nOr when you were entering a space where there's already people doing what you want to do it means the ideas prevent so you're not doing something that's never been done before there are actually businesses have similar type services what you didn't know is yes you're solving a problem and if you're solving a problem it's a viable business idea\nYou just have to find the people that have that problem that had the eight millimeters they want to preserve them and you're going to learn how who that person is you're going to go after them and build a business for them so you're going to price them you're going to create marketing language that speak to them right where they are the best part about this bill it you know the idea is valid because it's been done before what you're going to do\nIs you're going to build your business and you're going to get better and you're going to serve your customers and they're gonna want to come to you because you make a unique space for yourself in that market a bill I Know my book is for women but I'm going to send it to you men read it all the time to business principles are the same and it gives you plan to take that idea to market to help it helps more will send that to you\nKnow try to great plans will follow it and and here's this thing a ... a lot of bills out there he said something that's interesting he finds these old things and you realize away I hate to have this\nAnd and you were giving him the steps the book is going to walk you through it but I wanted to say when they try it just tested almost all of that last call here's why some passion should be hobby\nIt changes things when you turn it into a business is that what you made a great point other people are doing this he just got to find people that are willing to pay him to do it\nAnd keep paying him into others have you need this does they tell you about bill he's got to start really small but start right away stop thinking about it stopped getting Miami just you know in the water just doing triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five coming up more of your questions about career starting a business [noise]\nDon't go anywhere just as\nHeard me talk about our deep for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity theft last year yes sixteen million\nTwenty six percent of them have to borrow money from family or friends twenty two percent of them lost even more money by taking time off work and nine hundred thousand victims took out payday loans\nQuick quick question Katie that contract jobs you're doing in addition to the full time is our jobs are those things you're running independently already or do they go through the main company is paying your salary\nSo they're different companies OK I'm here yeah two of them are kind of actually my own projects I work on out here in Minnesota the other one is there a company I used to work four years ago that you contract work for perfect they don't have that salary yeah\nThe the reason I'm asking is because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part to validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can I run this whole thing without having a boss that kind of back me\nAnd you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited in Haiti because you're just going to do more of what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken said\nYou've got this light at the end of the tunnel when you're going to start to increase your family household income in other ways to your husband\nBut in the meantime if you want to spend the next two to three months building up the demand to clients the relationship even just taking people to coffee starting together interest of other independent projects you could run on your own that could run through this new architecture firm that you're going to run as an independent person\nYou're building it up and of course it will be crazy for a season because you're getting more and more demand but then\nWhen you decide to leave your full time job it's the next logical step where the business can support you the income is they are of course that's only going to help and your husband has income so you're all ready I Would say\nTwenty to thirty percent down the path of doing this you're not starting from scratch or not like I have full time job and I want to do this totally different thing how do I start up\nYou're already doing it you already have clients you're working with I just want you to do more of that and then the next few months as you build that up that will start to ramp up as her husband's income comes in and it looks like first dear you probably should be able to comfortably leisure Labor Day job\nYeah and it comes down to a form of the you gotta work days baby steps days babies to fund the dream so when you put enough money aside plus decide businesses there and then that's how you get to that number where you can step aside and to Christ\nTo jump right it should be a nice move and it just takes a little bit of time and patience\nLays on her way the light at the end of the tunnels an important point can cause so many people still like how can I sustain this well you're not until January when you'd that landed in the telling you know this is the first season and the ... the head down for a season that man had the rewards it's worth it things aren't All right let's go to ray real quick in Orlando, Florida re how can we help\n[noise] hey how you doing guys I'm OK though I've been in the field for the past Eighteen years and ah I Love the the of the past six years I've been doing the security um

[noise]\nUh\nA the job I have I make like twenty two three year uh me and my wife have nine thousand three hundred and forty two dollars in debt\nMhm uh what do you do some of their care professional you're a what\nA direct care so I take care of people who are a developmentally disabled and work on behavioral stuff with them\nAnd you make twenty two thousand dollars a year ... okay\nSo uh\nBasically I have an opportunity to and what are you located from where I Am in Montana back to Boston which is where I'm from\n... and the single job would be a double my income mhm\n[noise] now interviewing so I Would not be bringing my family with me at first I had the opportunity to stay right of free with my father and work\nMhm why would why would your family or with you\nUm affordability I Can't afford to move them I mean we're down even have a foundation to who\nAre ... and all their stuff start paying off like that I mean right now I'm dealing with like negative cash flow ...\nDoes your wife work outside the home\n[noise] uh no shame care a target for is you have four kids okay yeah all\nAnd do you own a home you know we were at ... ...\nAnd uh so basically you loan your furniture into a U Haul and pull it across the country and be in Boston and get an apartment right\n[noise] um well I'm a long haul yes but short term I Would try a plane ticket wow load your wife up and go\nI I wouldn't have the money to put them in an apartment mhm okay\nSo uh where you're going to be making twice as much though so how quickly would you be moving them\n[noise] ah well she's pregnant with our fifth show the thought process would be in the summer probably August after birth\nNo\nI'm not doing the I'm not leaving my pregnant wife and four kids halfway around the dad gum world and go live with your dad not a chance I'm holding her up and moving dude as your what can you can have your family help you a little bit of minimal cost much to get moved maybe the employer would give the new employer will give you an advance to get you moved into your new apartment\nUm there's a possibility with that\nYeah you need a load up your family and get out of there\nBut you know not being with your pregnant wife while she's carrying what your fifth child you're in Boston and she's in Montana dude that is not okay [laughter]\nI mean you're not in the military you're not you're not required to be separated like that you're just making bad choices now you need you need to scrape together a few dollars and go deliver some pizzas or something and ah for a month and and pile up you know thousand Fifteen hundred bucks and get you a U Haul and get your button gear\nAnd enroll loan over to a Boston and take that job\nOr moving with your dad for a month with the whole dead gum crew over there if you can something like that I mean you need to find a different way but this idea you're going to lay bringing your\nWhole family and while your wife is ... no no no that's not going to work out for you that's going to end the poor\nThanks for calling in men is one of those bands in Colorado Springs a ban how are you\nYeah you do better than I deserve what's up\nThere I Am self employed I'm a real estate agent and um we've got the thousand dollars for your baby steps wide and art but they were were\nKind of a crossroads on how to how to go out go about going on with the next babysat I'm of the opinion which isn't in your plan that you know because I'm self employed and money isn't\nAlways there I Need to have oh you know two two months or so of income to fall back on in ... to be able to make the budget\nThat does your wife work like she does not she's a stay at home mother and so you're not making any money in the real estate business while I'm making a hundred thousand a hundred and ten thousand a year somewhere in there they are not having you know ... months\nNot any zero month or during the winter in Colorado there's um some months they're slower than others where you know making the making the budget would be tight tighter than we were at\nUm ... no I don't I don't I never expand baby step on emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly volatile and I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like it is you might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really\nYou really need to stop and think about what you just said but anyway if you're going to go to zero in December because nobody's buying a house in Colorado Springs in December you don't want to have zero money I'll go along with that part but I don't think that's what's really happening you're making eight thousand dollars a month average\nSo I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month whatever so\nSet some aside but we're not going to call in an emergency fund and we're not going to add to the thousand dollar account we call it a hill in the valley account the Helmand valley is the volatility of your income\nThe hill is when they come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to set a couple of brand over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts one is for emergencies and one is for you if you run out of money because you don't make any money in a month\nBut dude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow and analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run out of money\nI mean you couldn't go make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if you told me he made forty thousand dollars in real estate business I can imagine you have in some zero much but you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money\nA year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back in track your revenues in charge of revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nIn giving in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are then okay send some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is\nAnd uh but no we're not changing the emergency fun we might have a hill and valley account if you truly have a volatile into Mark's with us in Seattle hey mark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThanks Dave hey it's a great honor to talk with you I had a great impact on change my life five years ago um do you think you are currently I I I got a critic question I'm In baby steps eggs are the only thing right now I'm paying off my um do you get a net worth of a half million dollars um [noise]\nWhat happened was this five years ago I I left a small company\nTurtle when I hear you talk about your company that the company I was working for had a very similar culture was making an average salary for what I did I went to a competitor\nA much more you're making a making eighty thousand dollars a year what do you make now I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year on your question is what\nI make my question is I really miss that small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really\nReally interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost my passion for my work and um you know I show up to work every day I get great reviews um\nI'd probably go back but I Want some equity or I Want some indication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually worse than the marketplace\nThis idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less\nIs not necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going with\nSo maybe that particular company cafe but if you could probably find somebody with a decent culture\nAnd pay you what your worst\nThat you know statistically when it comes to life insurance and protecting your family that women are more likely to be uninsured or under insured than men this doesn't make any sense women make up half the workforce contributes mightily to family incomes\nAnd in many cases are the breadwinners and take care of their families twenty four hours a day this is one of the most overlooked areas when it comes to financial planning maybe it's a relic of the past but a loss of income or the need to replace family care\nAnd so and it's very simple it's just because I Need to pick up the phone and talk to a human being that actually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller knows that kind of thing but but in you know that's what you should want you should be able to walk in and talked to a human and not be treated like a number\nAnd you know so I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America it's beyond me\nThey treat you like crap and they over charge you for most of the services and this day in time there online offerings of their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated\nThey're not that good they're not good at anything\nSo I just don't get it so that that's why we endorse\nCredit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank and I'm just a a huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and it's what I did\nEverything I endorse on this show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation and that kind of a thing I don't have anything is inconsistent like I'm too big or too good to do that I I'm not I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell you to get but\nYou know ... you know in most of these cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York, Pennsylvania Hi Ted how're you\nDoing better than I deserve how're you doing just the same how can I help\nAll right well thank you and your staff writer you're doing it's a blessing how did you um how it'll be needing a lakeside saving operation about ten to Fifteen Years if I don't get hit by a bus\nAnd I want to know if I uh probably should continue funding and age I say with my employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks a year or should I just put that extra money into a Roth IRA her four one K.\nWas it just a couple of hundred bucks a year the company I have another she who you can put you can hold their matching a couple of hundred bucks a year yeah ... okay so\nThe the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you've got to have in ten years what is it\nFinally deliver ooh I got ... yes see so you know fortunately the ... you can't live without\nYeah I've heard that you know [laughter] oh [laughter] okay hobby I'd say it's a it's a slow a slow progression then\nYeah it is they they estimate that you know Seventeen years out so okay I got to figure to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to yeah retire early you know if I can\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're gonna want is a mix you you you got to have the cash in your age essay or somewhere else in and investments to cover what's going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking to health insurance is going to cover a large portion of this correct\nYeah that if I don't retire um that I'll be on um either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nYeah I think I'd be on cobra or I'd I wouldn't retire because this is ... this is a multi hundred thousand dollar event isn't it\nProbably a half\nNow and so I'm thinking we're going to term retirement around this a little bit um or and or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going\nBut the cover only last what two years or something [noise]\nUm I don't know if you can keep that in definitely so I think that's number one I Want to make sure you got health insurance to cover the vast majority of this I don't want to\nTime that poorly ah but then how much have you got coming out of pocket a over ten years you could put five thousand dollars a year into that I just say or whatever your big deductible is what you're deductible\n[noise] um [noise] ...\nYeah you or whatever that adoptable is on the age of say a year\nOh well they say that health insurance uh amount of fun you\nKnow the ... say their health savings account that is attached to a health and a chess a health insurance policy that has a high ... policy\nIt it depends uh depends on the ... to their six to nine to five thousand\nBucks what I'm Talking about you can put up to that amount per year into that savings account\nThat would be six thousand half the other side fully fund that yes and I don't touch it until I you know there\nYes here's why so when you're when you need the money out of pocket to cover the whatever comes out of pocket on on the liver surgery a and you\nKeep your health insurance in place then you've got this big juicy health savings account sitting there in and use mutual funds in it and I let it grow over the next ten years be as big as a ... there's no downside of that whatever you don't need\nFor the liver transplant or liver trans whatever the processors they're whatever you don't need you can pull out and just pay taxes on the no penalty\nAnd so um you're going to want to build that up and you just not going to say it becomes over what you don't use you can use for retirement\nAverage sixty five so I I Would love that up knowing that you got this coming down the road\nThe money this is the daytime\nFour years one of the most asked questions I get is day one are you going to do a live
