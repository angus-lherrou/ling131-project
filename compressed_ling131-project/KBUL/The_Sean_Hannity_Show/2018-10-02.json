buy anything on sale\nThat's just how and I and I don't see that changing ever ...\nIf you want it to I mean you you don't have any payments\nNow and then my DNA I'd I go straight to the ... well\nThat share and she always tells me how much money she saved me which means that costs me something but yeah [laughter] but nowadays we can afford it it's not a big deal if you live like no one

of it\nI'm ... and the programs that she was looking at\nA as a radiology attack which would take her about two years to get done and that's what made us our ... year\nA lab technician more take about a year to get done with our current the stuff that would transfer and she'd be making thirty eight thousand after that or an HR specialists or take her about three years of a shot that kind of the last\nYou know choice of hers to get done so well you know we're not we're not that much that I just didn't know where we should focus on first\nWell the first thing is I hear a wide variety of jobs

check\nGuy something ... yeah\nEither your income figures wrong or um are you taking out a four O. one K.\n[noise] yes I've restarted named my four oh one K. which is a hundred dollars a week so that's four hundred a month\nSo about a year ago I switched positions with a new company and I had the opportunity to switch over my four oh one K. about six months after my transition I still have not done not up until this point when I got a statement from\nUm my current and Lester\nAfter the other day with my standing on and so now I'm at that point um my husband and I am baby step too and I'm not sure whether I shutter all over the four oh one K. what she eats about revoking up and to almost thirds\nWith ... percent tax on a pre tax match um I'm not sure if I should roll it over or cash it out it's just shy of Ninety five hundred dollars and I don't know if I should put that towards baby steps to or\nJust roll it over and leave it until we get in a point of our baby steps to start investing again\n... retirement unless it's to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure because you're going to get hit with your tax rate plus a ten percent penalty just probably by third of it would go to the government and that's borrow money or thirty three percent interest playoff pitcher bad idea\nSo Ryan's that so that that that's what I Would do is I Would rural led to an IRA and just get with your smart Russia or pro or whoever you use for your investment advice and knew a direct transfer roll over anytime you leave a company I always take my money with me\nIn the form of doing a roll over to an IRA in a way of got control of it what it's invested in it it's it's convenient for me to get my hands on and if you don't have somebody to help you with that you clicked smart buster Dave Ramsey dot com you fill in your stuff it'll drop down the list of people in your area\nThat we recommend called smart buster pros and they'll help you out\nAnd he's with us in Columbus, Georgia Hi Anthony how are you how good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOkay um I Am contemplating going to a new job and my current I'm a nurse in that sense and um my current hostile offer to ensure held a life insurance policy\nThat I think it's about five hundred thousand um my new employer their life insurance policy that they offer is only one hundred thousand and I can't get it um otherwise I have some a lot I mean does orders and I just I get denied or I'd have an outrageously expensive\nPolicy and I just\nI'm trying to think outside the box that I'm not stuck in a job that I'm unhappy because of this one issue you know I don't know\nYou're going to be making more at the other position\nIt'll be the same okay I'm going to be\nBetter I only got ten minutes instead of an hour [laughter]\nI Wonder if the new place the new hospital or whoever has enough flexibility that they had some insurance programs to their group plan to allow you to buy more\nAsked about that and they said man I spoke with said that it's at ... ... that's the case mhm aspect with 'em I invest and he um he said he got the fire from it as well and he's about to manage find account\nNo that's not my principles [laughter] like I never heard of it not well I'm not gonna start buying bonds to offset the fact that you don't have insurance so it's not you know that's what he's doing and that no thank you um\nI mean you you need to build up a big pile of money he called wealth and then you don't have to worry about life insurance and that's the general principle that you move towards a mountain\nPanther house off at least I don't have any that um\nAnd so you know as a matter and the more wealth you have the less and less we need to worry about replacing your income for the good of your family mhm\nRight if you're having a oils that your family is fine and you have no debt and your family's fine without your income than we don't worry about the subject anymore because you become self insured your family's funny because the point is is the family major income to live right on to the extent they don't need that\nTo the extent you don't need life insurance now have you actually shopped or are you making an assumption that you can't get insurance\nI got denied about seven years ago and I tried\nCalling ... calls end or insurance and the market has changed dramatically\nBut I got another diagnosis back in March that when I Lived a life insurance and this diagnosis that um they basically said you'd get denied but I haven't tried Zander\nYeah try them I mean there's no it doesn't cost anything ask mhm let's talk about it and found out that I don't I think you may be right I mean if you know you probably found some valid research and probably not sure of all you know so the only question is just you know if your family only got a hundred grand instead of getting five hundred grand how old are you\nThirty eight and and\nUh the auto immune that you've got I mean how are you know you're a health care professional uh does do you have a real threat here of losing your life\nYou can't there's different degrees of it and mine mild but I um when they hit record it kind of\nDumb down by the actual fact you die and I am Lee is left without you what's the probability of that\nI don't really know I'm In I'm In good health so I mean it could get worse but you know I mean that's how old are you thirty eight\nOkay so I mean in the next ten years a typical thirty eight year old would have very low probability short of an accident of passing away and yours is slightly greater resolve and it's not like to have a terminal cancer diagnosis right right okay so I'm not going to worry about it I'm gonna take the job I Want\nAnd then use your fabulous income which you have to build wealth and to become debt free in the family but I mean if you're sitting there with a million dollars in mutual funds and your four one K. and mutual funds and everything's paid for house and everything and you passed away I think your husband can struggle through\nYeah I think you know and that's what I mean by self insured by becoming wealthy\nAnd they shot about three hundred thousand in retirement you and your house is paying for and you get a hundred thousand and insurance so you know he is he going to be OK yeah you'll be OK yeah plus I'm guessing he works right hey we're here now so I mean he's going to be okay so I'm taking the job because\nAnd just double check your assumptions OK okay thank you thank you Michael is with us from Charlotte Hi Michael how are you\nGood thanks thanks for taking my call sure what's up so\nOverall I'm trying to figure out whether or not to continue to build up my underfunded emergency trunk or to pay off my car so I can give

after we met and we got on the we got on the plan separately we've we've never gone through those dumb decisions\nUm we've never had to deal with those stupid purchases or we've never had to look at something that we've done as a couple and said that was dumb now we've got to fight back out of it you know\nYou're going to let all the way while you were single yeah absolutely [laughter]\nGood for

I don't know if that's even ... they're not\nOr nothing like it was not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion purposes okay if you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy it for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that great a by\nI just being okay by it's not like you're getting the right great deals are where you just went wow that's the best deal ever ride yeah this is I'm not sure if\nI'm like to even get kicked out 'cause someone gated or should I leave or should I should I go back ran over well\nWhere no one on the long term whether you want to own um well\nMy wife she we kinda do want to own because we got a daughter she's four and my wife she that school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now\nMhm have you got every angle area it's like I say my wife great grandma's house has she been here her whole life so she likes it it's like about two and a half three acres mhm\nAnd um it's kind of in a country well part of Atlanta\nGotcha okay and how old are you to\nUh my wife she turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days so we both twenty now\nMhm and you got a a one child you said and how much do you have\nA we don't have any debt okay and what's your household income I make about every year but I'm trying to get in school but I had to kind of work with the answer to that was how much I Know ...\nUm I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars might and your wife doesn't work [noise]\nOkay that's pretty that's on your budget\nIs is very tight on your budget\nAnd we just found out about you not too long ago one of my friends from church he recommended me start listening to you so now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff out to eat and we're already kind of you know trying to start it off a little better and you\nDo it good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is the uh the relatives that are involved that would be the errors or this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren\nThat would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court you'd have to get a lawyer and go to probe a court in probate court would have to rule that the house could be sold hand would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done\nOkay I don't think you need that expense right now\nThe two or three thousand bucks to get all that done okay I don't think you need that expense right now\nYeah though with all the move the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages are paid I doubt you got to get thrown out\nYeah 'cause that's what I was thinking should I feel kind of want to actually start even going into real estate because I Do construction that's what I Do know I kind of this house is kind of it's not ... it's kind of vetoes since the last few years she now here and like other relatives staying there kind of beating it up so I I mean I don't know if like\nMaybe work more maybe you know what I'm saying they Lincoln slip in and get another house so am I Lived there unless you become the owner of it yeah and and that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to you'd had I see in a statement learning anything they did hurry up and now like lions game where should I tell you what I Would\nDo if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from the south someday when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it\nYou're probably not gonna ever bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about\nOkay so ah what I Would do is pay that rent or pay that payment is rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't frets about becoming the owner today\nIt's inexpensive rent in the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say a to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah it's going to be in what's going to be a really strenuous process with the courts to become the owner of this because we don't even know who the errors are\nYeah well I don't I Know a couple of the day is this is not that many of 'em or that\nThey actually even know about it like I said we we may here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried that the stand your pain oil I just keep paying it\nIn because that's not that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYet but I'm I'm just worried like can't nobody command me out 'cause it's not in my name\nYeah they can come and take you out the people that own it can there are the heirs but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nAnd they're they're they're far away they're like in another state and\nYeah but they're ... they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than a vote on it\nIf it was valuable now there'll be some sharks in the water circling right but it's not got any ... because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it 'cause some day you're just gonna walk off and leave it\nYeah because they cause I've already done paying eight and scrape the before they need a little some something you know to make my life because\nLike whatever money whatever money you spend and make her happy is money is gone when you leave because there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing to probate court\nAnd get to be transferred to your name and you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that and um\nAnd you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent\nTo a place you kind of like living\nThere's not a bad gig on two and a half acres so I'm sitting there in front of you for now uh\nNow hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any one harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and some day you're just\nGoing to move on quite worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner then get ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months of pain in the bud court actions and you probably can work this through if you can gather up all the people you need to sign on it and that's what you're facing\nSo it's an interesting situation but um my guess is it's not worth any more than his old on it my guess is ill as probably fairly close on this if we thought his worth two hundred thousand bucks is a relative thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks a Ninety thousand was old and they were going to get a hundred thousand their pocket when is old\nOh sharks would already been circling\nThey'd have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get the courts Lou it when you die without a will and you have to go in and the judge has to\nYou know authorized the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs are just like it would in a will but it's just a lot bigger mess and do you can't\nGet clean title to this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become the owner of it any other way than doing it properly and getting clean title 'cause you won't be able to do it if you don't get clean titled so that's how you do it if you decided to do it later but for today I Would treat it as cheap rent it's a rental house\nHow much money would you spend on a rental house\nThat you're going to move off and you don't hold nothing [noise]\nNot any that's what you would do hope that helps ma'am thanks for calling him this is the Dave Ramsey shower\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare
