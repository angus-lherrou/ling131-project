or I didn't drink or this title would be as appropriate as it is often low Seventy two hours book man we are in a fight right now for the future of the republic\nIt is a fight for the future of the republic the one thing I Love about you and I've come to know you very well lose that your mate\nAnd evil in our time evil abroad that need to defend and keep America strong and you understand the political aspects of it as well because if you elect their own people and when you got to have policies of appeasement again in that renders us more vulnerable\nJust look at the last eight years what do we have we had a commander in chief who started his presidency with an apology tour\nAnd then he blamed all the bad things in the world on America what resulted the rise of ISIS Russia invading its neighbor Chinese Chinese re militarized Asia at the end of the Obama administration just one metric take take politics out of it for a second\nWe had sixty five million refugees in the world that's more than we had at the end of World War two when you don't have American leadership the world is a dangerous place now that's over thanks to Donald Trump now we have a commander in chief who believes\nThat even exist read his ... speech listen to what he says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing so that what he said\nAt the un is absolutely absolutely so that's why I wrote why we fight but but you're absolutely correct we have domestic issues here even exist not just outside of our borders look what they did to that godly man Brett Kavanaugh in the last fourteen days a man who\nHad the probably the cleanest most spotless record in an American public life goes from being\nA stand up standing federal judge ... to amass rapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next thirty days are so important showing\nIt means ah everything and then look everything's riding on this I don't know if you would have asked me three weeks ago I Would have leaned in on the side that history would would win out because the party that wins the White House\nUsually ends up losing seats in a midterm election that totally not happened three times only only picked up seats three times in the last hundred years the last was after two thousand and one of the attack and die on number eleven September eleventh um but there's so much at stake here\nAnd that is what ... literally jumps off the page as I'm reading through your book that we better defeat America's enemies and we better do without apologies the tactic orca we don't get to do that if we're not in power right\nWe we have to take very seriously this concept but the left so the left has been taken over by the radicals\nThinking about the fact that JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist strong on national security he wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have we have the crazies we have the will cost you a court tests as we have the Maxine Waters in control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply\nThe ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool\nWell guess who used our philosophy in the past that philosophy drives to the labor camps drives to the ... drives to death camps whether you are right wing extremist whether you're a fascist or whether you're a communist that's the philosophy and we've got to stop that shall we have to stay true to the principles of the republic you\nTalk it in a book about the a will to winter and and again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can't have any more and you talk about the will to when you talk about will\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized it is and we pulled out you know in Iraq and Afghanistan\nWe pull out waving it dates of our withdrawal and we lost nearly six thousand kids in the end so many others come back without their arms and legs in their in their faces his faith you're fighting for their country\nNearly six thousand kids in the end so many others comeback without their arms and legs in their in their faces this figured fighting for their country we cannot commit American troops ever again\nUnless we're willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you have to win these wars or else don't start to be involved in them\nSo so my book is about two things is about all the threats we face as a country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China\nBut the second part is much more important this is the one who hitting on it do we have the will to defeat our enemies because Vietnam is a great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with wooden sticks and rusty rifles defeat us\nHow's that possible because we lost the war at home because we allowed the left to undermine a will to win\nAnd and one of the most important things is the individual real to win\nIn addition to the ... of the threats I have full vignettes of American heroes I go back to the Bobby was two hundred years ago I talk about a Korean hero adjusted pulled her I talk about a man who spent six and a half years as a naval aviator even the Hanoi Hilton but the last story\nIs a very very important for what we are seeing right now and it's wicked chambers\nMost kids have no idea who would occur chambers is\nThis is a man who was Kevin old\nBefore Kavanaugh was born in Nineteen forty eight the first live televised Senate hearing was a man who would occur chambers who have been a communist agent of the Soviets who went on record saying hey I'm no longer communist but I Need America to know where the communist up\nIn the government including algae his he was a guy who was working for the Soviets what happened to this man who stood up for the truth\nThey accused him of everything cheating on his wife ... of the death of being responsible for the death of his brother none of it was true but what did he do he had the will to fight he stood up for the truth justice justice Kevin ... social and he's a he's a he's a little bit about his a scary thing\nThe Democrats have done this before don't be surprised at what they did to Capitol they've done it seven eight years ago\nI they have done it every election in my lifetime they play the race card the Gen rye or you know they divide America old versus young rich versus poor black versus white this is the

I with chairman Goodlatte in the room and and two or three other staffers we all agreed that what we would do is move expeditiously to have him come into a transcribe interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in\nA than we would subpoena him and compel him to do that and I can tell you that ah it's it's more skew sues on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired\nOf so we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and could\nLiterally force him to come and testify under oath an answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme a plan that you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe but now James Baker all saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states\nIn the hopes that it would provide materials that they could invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it and said sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm and that\nAnd they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... the guy who was in effect running Justice Department\nShould not be joking with support it's about recording the commander in chief of the United states\nThat ... that even if it's a joke that is not something you do it particularly at the time that this was happening remembers not this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on a night the president fired Jim Comey on seventeenth Rod Rosenstein named Bob Mueller the special counsel\nIs one of the huge already ... happen in between there\nRemember Lisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was little menial leaks strategy\nSo that when they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of ... reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was the page and struck we're talking about and it seems we got our answer now\nWhere you're writing I think not only are they looking better arid of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this you know we're we've got actually a memos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there\nAre a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet they knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media could not be substantiated\nI I Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead and I'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein red defies application many side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony is chilling the amount\nOf documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well didn't they\nFailed to read the more they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here I'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed out that the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warrants\nThat that they were literally committing fraud on the Pfizer court they never substantiated they'd never verified they never corroborated any of the steel ... of this is Christopher ... deals\nYou know dot CA and as a result was used as the bulk of information to attain the warrants and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they they that's correct that not even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given to Bruce or but here's the other problem\nIs is even Bruce or knew that some of the things that he was writing there or not accurate and and yet somehow they get put in a three oh two and they get used as a justification\nTo actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sickening it truly is sick me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow under oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously taping the president of the United states for the purposes\nOf of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte to do he indicated that he would do that so now is the time obviously to get that done and make sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there to answer these important questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between midnight and may seventeenth\nOf twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a ... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we got to subpoena we've got to bring him in so we asked the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions under oath will take a quick break come back we'll continue also more coverage of hurricane Michael pounding the
