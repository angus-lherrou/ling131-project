and it's going to pay you know one to two percent right now\nI'm you know and when you do long term investments and then you pull them out short term as you said you can get the market could move down

that we could actually lose some only take some risk where some of that that's an okay thing to do um\nBut you know basically if you know you're going to need the money in the actual principals very important to you I you know there's not a ... intermediate investment that I'm comfortable with that I use a so I'm pretty much either putting it in a savings account or I'm investing it\nAnd sometimes I'm investing it knowing that I may or may only be in their year and it could be down in a year and but I'm going to take that risk because that's money I can say that I have a little bit of um margin with meaning I can afford to lose a little bit of money\nAnd if that's the case then then it's okay but that that's what we're faced with the ... is in Minneapolis ... how are you\nHey Dave

couldn't do stupid stuff you know I have figured out the less stupid stuff I have a better life I have you know it's fairly simple isn't it you kind of get back what you put out\nYou report you show if you plant corn corn grows if you plant stupid you grow broken desperate you know you're gonna get a crop of something in your life what's your crop going to look like right\nFor instance proverbs ... as a slack hand causes poverty\nBut the handle the diligent makes rich translation lazy will make you poor and you work and you'll have money\nIt's not hard translation as it ... causes poverty but the handle the diligent makes rich interesting\nDiligent was diligence diligence as excellence\nOvertime\nContinued action was not one moment of excellence but continued excellence an ordinary things when you do ordinary things with a level of excellence that's called diligence and by the way that makes one rich\nInteresting isn't it the hand of the diligent which the hand hand of the Belgium makes one rich\nSo here's one of the things I figured out I read this study years ago and now the observed it in all the millionaires and we meet with and talk with and and it showed up again in this millionaire study that Chris Hogan and the team just did for the everyday millionaire project you know we interviewed ten thousand millionaires among the things we found there and one of the things we found in this study before that that I read years ago was\nPeople who have wealth and keep wealth and build wealth have a long term planning window\nJoining us American lives in San Francisco Don welcome for him to show\nHim how are you better than I deserve what's up so\nI'm forty five and I'm looking to retire at fifty five I'm I have a pension and I'll be getting like Seventy five percent of my pay\nCheck in four one K. and stuff like that but um [noise] I've been recently started listening to you and I've already paid out some of my dad but I don't what's left is only about thirty four hundred\nBut I'm sure I'll be on the path and Ninety Days after that my question is I've been looking into refinancing in my house because I have an F ha and so I have PM I\nAnd I when I Do the math like the six thousand dollars and closing costs versus a hundred and eighty seven month ends up being in three years plus my interest rate is going to go up so I'm not sure if that's the smart thing to do\nOkay if you're gonna stay in the home longer than three years that's the only way you're going to end up getting gravy on that biscuit right\nYeah for sure so um that's how you analyze it um that's that's kinda borderline that's the tipping point is much longer than three years I probably on your break even analysis I probably would not\nBut if you're you know Ninety percent sure you're going to be there longer than three years you're going to pass the break even point start making money even at a higher interest rate is what you're telling me right\nI'm In a well I'll get out of having to pay the hundred and eighty seven\nYeah but where your interest rates go up and offset that\nHe well he acts semi three point seven five now and everything I'm getting quoted about like\nFor you know so you're not going to make any money so is it better just saying I hate to\nSound like you're going to force and you're probably gonna be four seven five on a Fifteen year right now uh today and so that's like a one percent spread 'em and so what is your a loan them out\n[noise] this one is a hundred and sixty six thousand\nOkay and so one in three years I've already paid off ten thousand now\nAbout one percent on a hundred and sixty six thousand increase is sixteen hundred dollars a year\nOkay and you're only saving Eighteen hundred or a hundred and eighty dollars a month which is about two thousand dollars a year so no I wouldn't do this if that's the only if that's the numbers yeah I'm OK air bicycle breaking even to refinance and I wouldn't do that I pay the loan off\nAnd one other question I just joined ... and in my area everybody's already in session but some of them have only done one class\nJumping I still didn't go in yeah jumping you'll be okay All right yeah the first classes on savings and you're already head of the game on that you're you're in Michigan and you can go back and watch it on with your own line because you've got a one year membership and you can watch and listen to everything on line for a year\nOkay so yeah you go and watch the blessing one and then when you go in Iraq with whoever zone listen to your right in sync okay yeah no troubles are\nYou doing great way to go dawn you killed a ghetto Christine is with us in Boise idaho I Christina how're you\nDoing well thank you Dave I'm so we have a great situation for our family but I'm not quite sure how to proceed we I'm told her home in California and walked away with a lot of equity and had steak moved to Boise\nHow much but we um okay well that's how much equity about two hundred and forty thousand boom boom love it\nYeah and um so we're here it gets renting while we kind of figure out you know if we want to build or by [laughter] um but I'm not quite sure because we already have our our savings we have our retirement we have all that\n[laughter] you out of debt that we get go yeah we don't have any debt good um but do we just go and maybe take cash for a house yeah what we want or how we ... we wanted we want where we you know we want something that's gonna cost us more than what we have oh\nGod will put a small mortgage on it and paid off real flash\nOkay you've only the only thing I mean well I mean what's your household income or about a hundred and fifty\nOkay and what what would you be talking about building or buying what price range\nOh price range between four and six\nOkay and you have to forty and the bank mhm okay so if we should for forty as an example Utah but two hundred thousand dollar mortgage right not right ... company that all five years\nTrailer dabbling yep yeah I mean just knock it out how old are you I'm I'm forty five and my husband's fifty six\nYou have any money in savings or investments to this not in a retirement I don't\nKnow if there's all kinds of it [laughter]\nAll right well my role is almost never take out a mortgage that is on more than a Fifteen year mortgage and the payments more than a fourth of your take home pay you're not even going to approach that the right way and then you'll be close to that and so if you take out a two hundred two hundred fifty thousand or more\nYou're going to really fine house in Boise idaho for half a million dollars that's a long ... wonderful property and about what\nWe're hoping more Korea property than the big house\nIt's a whole different world though obviously from where you came from rights\nAnd so um I mean you're bang for buck is huge in Boise compared to you know a big City California so um yeah you you're going to make a huge progress here and you know you just about whatever if you take a small mortgage or out in a small relative to your situation in other words\nI'm not going to yell at you know I don't borrow money so ... we'd be buying a two hundred fifty thousand dollar house and then we'd be saving money and we'd move up later and that's how we would do it because I mean we don't borrow money for any reason ever\nBut if it's the only thing I don't yell at you for borrowing on on the show man in your case though just have the different mindset that the mortgage is just more like a car loan\nAnd we're just going to knock it out real fast I mean like other people's ... to Carla like five years or something you know let's just put on there and\nAnd we're just going to knock it out real fast I mean like other people's rate a car loan like five years or something you know let's just put on there and\nHow fast can we knock this thing in the head and let us get after it and that's how I Want to think about it so really good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Sarah is in California Hi Sarah welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] and I was wondering if I should tell my car worrying about eight to ... ... pay off my about forty thousand dollars worth of debt and start my emergency fund like card paid off\n... what is your household income\nAbout thirty thousand a year\nYou should not have an Eighteen does ... what you have too much tied up and things going down in value when you're out when your car or things with motors wheels of any kind added up equals more than half your annual income how did you end up with an Eighteen dollar paid for car making thirty grand\nAnd I was married and we refinanced our house and they included the car in the mortgage\nAnd then he got and and then we\nGot a divorce and we sold the house and the car we paid off\nGot it okay and I got a car and\nSo what is your um what is your income prospects meaning you're thirty now where will you be in a year where were you being three years\nRan around thirty thirty tail so you don't see looking at you know she just doubling then no okay why\nI haven't got school yet okay and I'm a single mother fighter and yeah you you need the money more than you need that car don't you yeah yeah\nI in the cars going down their value quick show yeah Charlotte pay off your debt but your emergency for unemployed you can get you an inexpensive car that you pay cash for probably in the five thousand dollar range\nOkay maybe seven or something like that there's something reliable and you can get lots of car for five to seven thousand dollars right now\nIn your debt free and you got a good emergency fund and then put you in a much better position but as a rule of thumb cars are the largest thing that we all by the goes down in value anything on wheels or motors for that matter if it's got wheeler motor\nIt it's going down about you and when you have all of that stuff out of the gather\nYou don't want too much of your life financially too much of the math on the wrong way\nAnd you get when you have more than half your annual income tied up and things going down in value then that makes it real tough to prosper stay in your case you're going to change your income by going to school and so you know change later\nBut for right now I'm with you yeah I was shell that cost this is the ... [noise]\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend the quick Churchill checkup then just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage can tell you if\nIt takes away most of that spread when you when you you know when you factor interests 'cause we're there is risk when you have mortgage now it's not a lot of risk 'cause you've got the money in the bank today to pay it off but er an investment to pay it off but there is risk\nAnd so uh you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of foreclosures occur on home with a mortgage there is rich\nAnd so I'm getting rid of that\nWhen I found this it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula\nBecause when you don't have a mortgage you start making different decisions with your career you start making different purchase decisions you start having different levels of enjoyment with your money\nYour relationship with your spouse talks to have a different depths because there's a a level of security in your overall life that there wasn't before and those things are really hard to put on paper so what I have figured out is I'm going to live a hundred percent that free\nAnd I'm going to invest like crazy the rest of the money that I have in cash that comes in\nAnd I've ended up with a ton of money doing that because I don't have any risk\nAnd I'm just investing real money not borrowed money so all of that to say if I woke up in your shoes I pay off your mortgage today\nAnd if ... if this discussion good sour on you and you think they rammed she's crazy a year from now just gets you into the mortgage\nNo I I I completely agree I mean I for one thing that space just if it's a lot of money I go you know I just go back and get paid off but my mind sort of just wrestle back and forth\nYou're the your gut is not intellectually wrong your mind is your minds using an incomplete primitive formula got it that's what I'm pointing out that makes sense completely yeah after\nYou got there thanks for the call open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five she your heart sure he's not really you got to shrink heart your heart's where you measure risk\nMarch telling me about my house my hands telling me occupied memorial day's ... moody\nWith your heads missions from stop its mission risk\nAnd um it's kind of a fun thing to I was doing this for the clash of MBAs speaking to them and a cause MBAs or all talk you know masters in business they're all taught strategic thought and they're all taught to borrow money\nAnd uh I got a finance degree I'll stop to borrow money my broke finance professor used to teach us to borrow money and show 'em you know it it's broke finance professor at like a shop teacher with missing fingers right people so think about this rise by ... ... you just can't think that way and you have a different way of looking at things show\nUm but as you can really do a very\nSophisticated mathematical application of this it would just take a lot of time too much time running the radio to walk through the whole thing but\nWhat happens is is think about this how many of you if you had zero debt and you looked over in your four one K. and there's three hundred thousand dollars and you had forty thousand bucks in the bank for emergency fund would make different career decisions\nWay too many readers said yes meaning I Would leave this jerk but I work for and I would go do dot dot dot\nUnless I go in business for yourself necessarily might just have a different career you might go on a completely different direction that thing you've always wanted to do why are you waiting\nYou know and here's the weird thing is that saying you've always wanted to do is probably where you make the most money you've ever made in your life if you're wise about how you do it this idea that if you're a liberal passion you make half the money no you make twice the money\nYou make more money when us up and you're good at 'cause you work harder at your creative you think about all the time you can't keep yourself from it because you love it\nYou don't think I Love what I Do I Can't keep myself from sitting at my laptop writing a blog article I Can't keep myself from doing it I Can't keep myself from coming down there and doing this radio show when I'm In town\nWas ... and I'm really good at it as a consequence because once I get paid a lot of money on a shame middling I'm a capitalist pig baby I love this I'm here baby that's how I don't want that for you see\nThat's what set you up to me how many of you if you didn't have any payments would tell your boss who's a jerk chicken\nTake this job and shut it I mean we would do that yeah there you go that's a man and I'm not\nTrying to quit your job today I'm saying there are benefits to being debt free that are beyond
