be here\nThe phone numbers triple eight eight to five five two to five were opening up a couple of lines for that right now Heather is in the lobby of Ramsey solutions from Spokane, Washington with a question\nHi Heather Hi Dan how are you better than I deserve what's up and I just finished baby step three and now I'm working on baby steps three ... saving for a house got your emergency fund good for me yeah and I wanted to know how long is too long in baby step three being the flashing lives on today to step foot\nWas not a magic answer the concept or the or the critical thinking skills for the answer is simply this\nIf you stay there so long that you don't save for retirement you screwed up your retirement Mm right yeah or if you don't stay there long enough then you don't have a good solid down payment and you'll end up with other problems on the mortgage so it's the it's the pull between those two things\nAnd with most people that means you know three years four years something like that um but if you're if you're a fifty nine it might not be that long or you're not fifty nine now how old are you I'm twenty eight on friday okay cool and so I mean if you stayed out for four years and never started any retirement until thirty to\nWhat you had a really juicy down payment on a house and got to have a you know how to plan to pay it off in a few years because of that\nYou're not you're you're still going to retire multi millionaire you know if you do that at it but if you stayed out for Twenty years been called that baby steps ... what I'm that's see that's kinda how you think through it from a critical thinking skills standpoint so how long were you thinking of\nLike just started in June and I'm hoping to have it done in two years\nOkay and so the thirty years' old your your game own on retirement taking on a Fifteen year mortgage by forty five the mortgage is paid for if not sooner and uh you will have saved thirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't work\nIs going to make you a millionaire multimillionaire usually I'm doing this so you're in a safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than they Ramsey says never go more than three years that's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other or because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go that's all it is I thanks for stopping by thanks dance\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five five to to find Julian is in New York City how Julian how are you know\nI ... it can you hear me okay\nI can how can I help\nThank you very much for taking my call so I'm In a a bit of a unique position I'm I'm twenty four next year I'm going to medical school and uh I was I'm very very lucky and very appreciative uh I'm not going to have any pets after graduating medical school but at the game the residency included\nI if I decide to specialize um and uh\nWould you get a fellow that up or what um\nUh yeah I'm not certain is that what I Want to do yet I no no no I'm I'm asking how you did that\nOh oh um yeah so so if they get from my father and my grandparents\nUm while I Am very very very appreciative yeah\nGood now yeah you should be that's amazing wonderful so\nUm yeah so when when I was Twenty one uh I was given a essentially control is funny 'cause it's under my name I'm but I'm Sorry I Apologize I'm Joe I'm\nA yeah I was I was given control this money and uh I've been given a very good financial advice my father who's helping me a manage it but\nUm because it's under my name and he he's actually in the rain stopped me or I Would like it a second opinion as to what to do\nManage it but um because it's under my name and he he's essentially asking the rain stopped me or I Would like it a second opinion as to what to do with this money I can give it a little bit of money for a living expenses um and I said that about five thousand dollars from\nSome small side jobs at hospitals but I Want to know how to capitalize on this and a half that myself up as best as I can for after medical school\nWell the the thing that would be most concerned about is that the money is available and enough to get you through medical school\nUm it it definitely is um about one third of it is invested very securely and two thirds of it I have in savings or maybe two thirds we were discussing putting into at AT T bill on three months we knew of basis until I needed to take them out that the pay my tuition and then I Would just reinvent the rest\nUm well I probably would not do that and the only reason is is that the bills basically or bonds and a bond interest rates are yields ah go into the bond values rather go down as interest rates go up and we are in an increasing in the interest rate environment\nSo if you put a hundred thousand dollars in T. bills that could turn into Ninety pretty quick\nOr as interest rates increase so that's not a very safe investment in the environment that we're in right now um but if you wanted to have some portion of the money invested I probably would go to something like gross income type funds but I'm okay if there's enough there to do simple division and it doesn't have to really earn anything\nIf you want to keep it all very very safe that would be okay with me because the most important thing is for you to be able to graduate with zero debt\nAnd if you screw around with his money in some way and it loses value and you're not able to do that then the whole you know is like a ... we were concentrating on the wrong thing\nAnd a Julian is the right thing to concentrate on Julian ... debt free graduation is the most important part of this math equation not what this money is paying\nA it'd be nice to be a little bit sophisticated about it but if you get caught up in some kind of a sophisticated process and you end up losing money trying to trying to just get a little bit more on this lump sum a you've defeated you're on purpose to short yourself in the foot so to speak so um\nThat's the process you're looking at I'm going to keep it pretty safe uh if you want to go toward something that's fine but I wouldn't use bonds for anything right now a possible play Kimberly is in Pensacola Hi Kimberley how real\nThat even though I'm great thank you so much for taking my call sure I I just wanted to thank you for all you do um they think temporary Walmart ... it's been seven years and it's not than I had paid off that I'm following their plans to go for that\nDay is I'm not for an hour at all concerned about our parents hunting you could get that found that advice on how they could got them I'm not parents live in North Carolina and they are within a flooded area of hard problem area\nAnd um every time they're ... um they they experience I'm finding it on their on their property at her home as well as my dad is now\nAnd we were just minor and what you can end as far as things that what um they have now that they do have um some savings and my mom has a ticket for one\nMhm too often does this property blood for well\nI think for one mhm too often does this property blood\nFor well and none of 'em it flooded and it got like forty inch and a house and I think about ten feet in his shop\nAnd then two years ago um it got in my dad shop I think about three years or so and it all night at like about it from getting in the house again\nAnd I'm ... there's only been two major flood but um they're in their sixties and it it's very emotional for them at any town farm ...\nThroughout this past down we actually packed that or I didn't I was able to help them out of eighth I packed up all their belongings and let them put them away and you know because they were afraid that is\nActually one of them out to his living there has become more painful than not living there\nBut those are the fear of rising water even even the fear is not founded we once in Twenty years is not that bad but bottom line is is that it's developed a phobia for them\nAnd they're not have been living there are none of us on living there why wouldn't they move\nI don't care I mean the actual threat a flood\nStatistically with what you've given me I wouldn't be that concerned about but if they're absolutely panicking Everytime the weather person comes also draining\nIn this town of Lewes 'cause it's not fun to live there\nSo you know it's more of an emotional decision but that's an okay decision wrong with that is my liver more moving\n\nYou've heard me talk about our deep for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim\nAnd um I Know this is a a a world class one half of one percent athlete\nUm what they are twenty two shifts there and the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills are developed they are the size of a key uh yeah [laughter] it doesn't mean that their life skills have developed at the same level and you know so\nIt it's it's kind of weird I told somebody during one of these ... like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um because he still\nIs football skills are are the best on the planet you I'm In his physical acumen his physical uh IQ the things you can do this body in mid error or it's just circus like it's amazing what those guys can do\nIt but what happens is when you watch that skill level especially if you're just watching on TV\nYou think of that guy as you know a forty year old who's a mature developed\nA ... as you know strong marriage has all these other things and these guys are college kids are now is they were in college last week yeah you know there's twenty minutes ago and I'm even a player that's been in the league three years yeah they're still young and they're still I'm twenty five years old or either\nAnd so it's uh it's interesting in the same thing happens with music people when they get a success level earlier anything where your spotlight and you get a success level\nAnd your skill this world class in that thing does not mean you have everything else together yeah yeah and that is true with the you know teenagers in general is one of the things we do this entrepreneur to boxing is they can start to develop some of those skills you know running a business\nYeah they and that's absolutely right you know you say this all the time when in America knows he knows you for saying this but the NFL stands for not for a long\nAnd these football players young football players know that like hey I Need to develop something now because in probably in three years I Would not be in this league mhm um and the most money these kids were make will be within their first three to five years at a league if they make it past and\nAnd so I I I told them like ... you have to get focused but when we look at these twenty two year oh this is why I'm so passionate about that Fifteen you wrote about that Thirteen year old getting you know the peanuts in order to ... get into graduate survival guide a book and also taking our financial foundations curriculum is out of a classroom\nBecause all of that teaches what these old they're professionals do not know mhm if they can get at Thirteen like these middle school kids day four out here now taking our middle school curriculum you know they are um a head of the game like they were teaching me some stuff earlier today I'm like wow like what in the world\nAnd so just to see these young kids are getting it taken our curriculum learning learning how to budget learning how what is it\nLike what in the world and so just to see these young kids are getting it taking our curriculum learning learning how to budget learning how what is a difference between a credit card in a debit card and these kids like me and I'm not financing anything like that just gets me excited\nGas is dolled in in a life skill yes life skills stuff and you need life skills whether you're Seventeen or fifty seven yeah you know and this this money thing\nYou know the basic stuff of being out of debt being on a budget having your emergency from the stuff we talk about her every day on the air it it really does work for teenagers and the interesting thing is they're not um\nYou know that they're not like rusted into place right you know they're they're pretty they're pretty\nUh uh elastic in their spirits in that they can receive this stuff sometimes more than some of us are a little older and we get a little stiffer on our spirit and we don't receive is quite as well they're like okay let's go let's do that right\nRight and they're not like all docked in and go now to argue with you about stupidity right there it's a it's easier to get through most of the time you don't have big argument like they have to have a credit card yet during loan you don't\nHave to have a car payment they don't hear all that from the fourteen year old when you're able to sit and talk to them they're just ready to go what is it we need to do to win\nYesterday and Dave you and I was talking about this as smart conference me when Hogan I was reading an article they're saying that this younger generation teams and millennials are not entrepreneur and I'm like man that's that's a bunch of baloney they're more ... than any ... any generated wrote that stupid [laughter]\nAnd so I get excited because I'm seeing this younger generation they are making stupid mistakes because no one never taught them once they learned\nThey tend to not make that same mistake in the areas of finances but they have to be taught at first\nSo that's what I Love about what we're doing is we're giving them life skills do business skills through the teen entrepreneur to a bus kit we're helping them understand how to deal with their finances and how to make the right decisions earlier on with our middle school curriculum with the graduate survival guide\nAnd when I see these young people come up to me saying man I cannot do and then thank you so much for teaching me earlier on because we make learning about money Dave in our organization where young people coolest tech letter on you know and so

I'm I'm healthcare management now on line\nTravis was in Jacksonville, Florida I'd rather rent them\nHey Dave how you doing I'm saying to my home sure\nOpposite occurred uh settle\nThe debate for my wife and I have a whole\nBunch of future um we have about Seventy five thousand dollar the debt collectors we um we own our home outright uh we have a vehicle that is being chased Seventy five thousand probably make a decent money and we have an Iran\nThat had about two hundred and ... and it sort of the question I'm Wondering what's decent money\nOr she makes about one twenty and I make about eighty okay\nSo the question that I read I robot that we have is um her mother and father passed away last year and uh she was not an inheritance that inherent and she has to take a certain amount of distribution every year for tax purposes my idea for the inheritance money I'm is to\nTake one lump sum\nPayout of our debt and then ... pay ourselves back off for that to an IRA I'm so that we don't have to worry about continue sleep paying the uh interest game if you will or a worry about that is that she um you know she is going to be some of that rocket poor and act for our retirement\nUm my recorded at it this year forty I'm thirty eight we still have a good amount of time to be putting into our um different finding out so I guess my my question is should we go ahead and take the distributions help all of our debt so that when a longer paying the\nUm you know the the interest rates or should we go editors pay that that down as we are\nA bit and it will be there for you to an ... year well\nWe've been using for almost Thirty years a decision making paradigm a decision making structure that is based on the idea of what is the fastest way to well what is the shortest distance but wells\nAnd I'm In the process what little in other words what gives us the greatest returns and what gives gives us the least risk what what has a level of wisdom to it um and it's not just one sided it's not all investing mind that it's not all\nThat minded is not anything it's just a process of financial planning process that process has now been proven obviously doing it for twenty five years and many many people become millionaires in multi millionaires gradually not get rich quick using that process\nUm then the question becomes ... do you guys were you agree\nYes and if you're just so that the way I Would answer the question obviously may being me is I'm gonna tell you use that process and that won't answer your question what to do with the money [noise]\nBut um but you've got a first decide do you want to do that or not I mean that's that's that's the core disagreement here what the process is based on the process is called the baby steps and what it's based on is a couple of things number one you're most powerful wealth building tool is your income\nAnd freeing up your income and not having that not only lowers risk\nNot only increases the peace and the quality the relationship in the household but it also increases mathematically\nFreeze up all of your income just to make money with instead of giving it to banks and on and the second part of the things are driving the process is is that personal finance is eighty percent behavior it's only twenty percent have knowledge stuff we're talking about smell really rocket science here\nThere's not a lot to the math it's it's about fourth or fifth grade math is really all it is\nSo having said that we say baby step one side of a thousand dollars you guys are obviously done that\nToo is to be dead free everything but your house you've not done that three is to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses I didn't hear that you've done that and then force you don't have that for start putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement so how much is in your emergency fund\nCurrently we have about twenty five or so in our savings account\nIf the inheritance was not on the table what we would teach you to do is take that down to twenty four through the uh or take twenty four of the twenty five and throw it at the vet and then clean up this debt very very quickly it is absurd for you to have Seventy five thousand dollars in debt with a two hundred dollars on household income it was shooting right up on your\nLife or a couple of months ago and I'm a went on a on a life in a nice way to earn an eye on him right probably the majority of\nOkay it's absurd that you make two hundred thousand dollars a year and you know twenty five dollars and that ...\n... ... you know you got to make enough money to have done this the right way you chose not to do with the right way so it's up to you guys but if you're going to do what we teach you know you would use this inheritance immediately to become debt free so that\nYou take all those famous as you don't have any more and you use those to build wealth with you have a paid for home\nCorrect we we heard it or not\nOkay All right and how much is in the inheritance in cash\nI I'm not quite a hundred to go somewhere north of ... Seventy five a\nHundred and Seventy five thousand dollars correct\nOkay and why she taking distributions instead of just taking it\nOn ... ... what her financial around her told her that she had to get a good a disturbing to I'm a cover her at a covert each year here today at heart over at the most part because the way to collect the money out of it out\nYeah it's a bunch of crap um the uh\nBecause anytime you start making decisions based on taxes instead of based on economics you make bad decisions so I don't know what this money's invested in but I Want to get control of this money and get it invested\n... what would I Do I catch the whole thing out pay some taxes and I'm In a different financial advisor and uh I Would pay off all the debt and I'm going to invest the rest of it\nOr in something that I can see controlling know what it is in good mutual funds or in some paid for real estate or something like that I honestly don't think that's what you all are going to do\nBut that's what I Would do\nUm because\nCatch and there's a lot of opinions flying around here\nAnd you guys have got to get inside this and to as a couple of decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do is to them telling you what today and it's a different different situation so I think she inherited the financial advisor to\nI don't think he picked him and um and that's really a bad medicine\nAs well Ninety percent of the time are you guys need to pick them or you need to re pick him and hiring again and this time he worked for you\nBut I think he's still works for grandpa even grandpa was dead and and that's the way this stuff works usually bad bad medicine Travis what I Would do just catch the whole thing out pay off all my dad's and invest the money\nWas watch less that's what I Would do and I would take your wonderful two hundred thousand dollar income and become multi millionaires with it and that's what we've shown people how to do for almost three decades now hold on I'll send you guys are a couple a copy of\nThe book the total money make over it'll walk you through not only what to do but why to do it and then you can decide intentionally whether you're going to\nUse our system or someone else's doesn't\nMatter to me [noise] Oscar's whether it's in Chicago hey Oscar welcome

TALK cast and I'm just randomly doing everything that you're thinking through the week up who do but I Know I have a partnership\nUniversity clocks I Will probably tickets on line so I can do to an

does that count totally out of my name that we just want to remove the temptation of using if you've got a right way\nOr absolutely absolutely and to be close the accounts completely not just cut them up and that'll keep them from reporting activity on your credit bureau report and it'll keep someone from accidentally fraudulently you using them or are you from using them\nYeah I definitely would close the accounts as soon as I cut up\nThe cards no doubt about it and good to talk to you Oscar monitor heavy as a new listener hold on I'll send you a copy of the book the total money make over and that'll get you started and give you the\nFramework from all these different pieces of information that are flying around your right now [noise]\nThis is that Iran [noise]\n\n\nHey on Christie right

use the promo code Ramsey to get the best possible deal\nComes from Laurie in Iowa I was interested in opening a five twenty nine plan for my daughter she has autism so I may open an ... account instead would depending on the ... and\nMy biggest concern is that I don't know what happens to the money and five twenty nine plan if she doesn't go to college can you tell me what happens to money not used for education\nOr it will be if you don't transfer it to a sibling um it'll be heavily taxed in ... it'll be taxed and heavily penalized\nSo um\nKnow the five twenty nine is not a good plan a for a child that you're not sure what's going to happen as far as their education is going to be and we've got a special needs situation like this I Would usually able to count 'em and or I Would just use mutual fund\nJust blurted mutual fund and let it grow and then you can just take care of the child with that money you're just you're marking it for them for their future or they may do a trade school\nBe able to do a full for your academic run 'em they may do a lot of things I don't know how the severity of this I don't know exactly what you're facing but are you simply going to save money it's that simple invest money in your name and you're controlling it and then you can decide to help your child however you want to [noise]\nThe only advantage of the table or the five twenty nine is just the tax advantage\nStill just an investment in a good mutual fund\nLike watching as ... as it grows is going to be taxed that's the only thing so it's a it's an advantage if you have a real high probability of them doing our education\nBut again where you've got a a a special needs situation most of the time I'm going to say just save it in a regular count shaving in a mutual fund if you want to use the cable that's fine that's what it's designed for do all kinds of stuff with that but it's a good plan but\nI probably would just keep it were and get my hands on it and I'm I'm not a big deal either way the the thing the reason we push of ... those two things uh ... in a traditional such a situation\nIt teaches you to brainwash your kid to go to college which is not a bad thing at all\nAnd the other thing is it allows that money to grow tax free and so it's a ... that's a wonderful benefit but is that ... is that the only possible way you can care for your child no\nInterest in a more traditional situation it's the best way the most um you know the least taxes on the thing which is generally what we want to do\nI'm relating to grow but in this situation I I'm not the tax benefit is not worth the pension you in the corner and actually hitting you harder later I'm making you wish you just pay the taxes\nAnd and that's the way to work out open phones at triple eight

charge much on the growth until you cash it in\nAnd so I start to a person is in the five hundred fund an index fund and use that to grow for the next five ten years or so until you buy a house\nAs long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nIn that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar things got in that sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment\nAnd um even if I don't know five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and uh 'cause I can afford for it to go down if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robby is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick crafting a so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a nurse and that that I Am wondering if I should go back to school again next year\nI'm so my question is if they work for me to go to a call now I'm thirty two years old and my wife is\nUh twenty nine we make a combined income right now after a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand\nA year or so if I go to school it's going to cost me ... years that's not working\nOn that tuition of around Ninety thousand dollars mhm a side uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful uh together that would be close to a three hundred thousand mhm\nSo uh but it's a what do you make a year now uh right now around Seventy thousand\nOkay so you're saying this is going to cost ... three hundred grand three years or three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket yeah okay can you cash flow than any out of pocket and can you live on her income or you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school um but I don't think I can catch anything right now because I and I also don't have a house or at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house\nA or putting at least that putting a down payment for a house next year before I start school\nSo that then you need to wait until you can pay for school I Would have never\nIn Thirty years are going to show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school okay you got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter of when you do it and what you put first what you put second you might plenty of money to come up with not agreeing yeah plenty of money\nDon't have to have the whole money up front you just got to see\nEx lowered [noise] um I can see it pretty easily ... to go through the glass again\nOr go to guy anyway in ... it's a three year program so thirty grand a year\nA thirty grand a year yeah\nAnd and and she makes what\nShe makes a hundred and fifty thousand\nYou can't catch ... already granted I'm a hundred and fifty\nA law not when I'm not in school\nNow if you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in ... thirty thousand over a hundred and fifty to go to school year for three years\nI I'm Sorry fifty thousand it's a it's a it's going to be around a sixty thousand a year I thought you said it was Ninety thousand [noise] ah sorry I got that wrong it's it's a sixty thousand a year\nSeems high yeah it is that is a ... it's an expensive program you know go to a less expensive program\nOkay but cash flow it whenever you're going to pay for it\nFigure out a way to pay for it if I usually go you don't necessarily have an old style stacked up ahead of time but you got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you go get student loans because here's the thing everyone starts that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans just aren't that program has on student loans whether\nThey finish or not and then you've got what's known as a freaking mess\nAnd so I'm not suggesting you're dumber you can't pass the test or something like that my life happens do in the last thing you want the only time debt works is of everything works\nOr doesn't that that doesn't work\nAnd so we tell you to stay away from it thanks for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Joshua ... is in Dallas texas Hi Joshua how are you\nI'm good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nSo basically I Am stuck in between whether I should file for bankruptcy or just go ahead and start paying\n'em all my debt off um goalball basically all my debts except my car are in collection so that's why that's the only reason I'm basically contemplating um bankruptcy\nWhy are they only go actions\nUm they're like oh medical bills um one is it is a car that guy I'm ... I lost my job\nAnd that I think I think like a phone bill and then there too mhm\nOkay so how much is the repo bill\n[noise] um [noise] that one's actually only like a couple of grand ... it's what I have on there\nIs a be nine nine thousand four hundred and forty five dollars from an old apartment mhm how long ago was a three and a half years ago\nOkay and how ... how much how much money and when your medical data began\nI Would say about two thousand\nAnd what you're on the debt if you go\nTo the rest of it is is mixed in there with like ... or ... I think that phone bill and oh it's a payday Lowe is well you know\nSo your your total that's less than twenty thousand dollars\nRight and then I have um my car which is a twelfth out mhm okay and what do you make a year I'm\nA little bit old for forty five I make a thousand a week I'm a independent contractor\nMhm and you're single or married you're married owner and\nI'm twenty eight on Saturday\nThe happy birthday does she work outside the home\nI'm no she stays at home and take care of her daughter\nOkay yeah mhm well\nLet me tell you what I'm hearing okay and I think I'm hearing maybe I'm wrong I'm a ... cat used to say that data\nOf something else that's going on I'm right\nAnd it sounds like you guys are I've never told your money what to do you've never had any savings for emergencies so every time an emergency comes up you get thrown out of an apartment in a suit your car gets ... and you end up with a mess\nIf they're\nSo we've got to get you on a plan where you are telling your money what to do or you're going to be back here if I have to want him at all this debt go away which is what bankruptcy might do maybe I'm if it did that make you have a zero dead all of a sudden except your car\nIf you don't change their habits that causes this mess in the first was you'll be back right where you are someday do you agree\nYes there you know so we really need to get under that does bankruptcy doesn't solve that uh you got to solve that in the mirror you and your wife learning how to handle money I don't think you're bankrupt I think you're scared disorganized don't know what to do and I've done nothing so far\nI think you can probably shuttle that'll apartment that for three or four grand if you're saved it up and offer them a lump sum settlement uh I've\nI've actually call them a multiple times where are you know they were the first video that I Will look it up with how to get that collectors you know under you\nIt does and doesn't change my answer to whether it's nine thousand or three thousand you're still not bankrupt\nIt's still about you getting control\nAnd when you do that then you're going to see your way through the bankruptcy is not of that problem but have you from the sky\nAnd I'll help you out I'm a singer found me the total money make over both read them take an extra job shall everything inside some of this mess cleaned up I'll show you how to\nUs today Ramsey show [noise]\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners checkout one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program\nThat functions like a membership club think of it like Costco you join for a small yearly fee and you say big every time you use it on talking discounts on all procedures from routine cleaning to root canals in fact two of my team members are saved over a thousand dollars with the one dental plan\nIn your story to go on and be millionaires now and be outrageously generous as you go alone\nI think you\nYou wouldn't believe the percentage of millionaires in the study that we just did a a word in the military for Fifteen or Twenty years at the twenty year mark and other second career sometimes sometimes they were career military all the way through and um but they use sometimes a twenty year\nMilitary retirement and then the second career on top of that had a poll to them into serious wells so you guys are in a great position very very cool stuff\nAll right Chris in the San Diego California sixty three thousand dollars played all been twenty two months making fifty fifty nine counted down let's hear a debt free screamer\nOne two three we have\nTrisha is in Huntsville Tricia how are you I'm good thanks how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nCalling about my mom um I'm not really sure how to handle her situation she had taken ... three times over the past the air and she had to file for bankruptcy and now she doesn't know how to manage your money\n... ... she doesn't know how to learn that she just won't do it\nExactly and so now that I have to have surgery on her ... and she's coming to me because she and a half hour SNL a has she's going to have to bail out kind of her paycheck and she's telling me that\nShe can't maintain that she had to have like she's going today it mhm\nWhat's the matter only I had a ... what's the surgery on the wrist\nHad I not or something that's very painful and he says you're gonna have to have a roommate you know one of those have been there and probably for about a year so\nOkay All right well I think this is her wake up call\nOkay think it's time for her to stay at work long enough to build up enough pay pay in a savings account to be able to survive the time the shoes off while she's on the mentally I pay me wondering what if you weren't they weren't there to buy the stronger drink\n\nThey wouldn't be able to drink right if you weren't there I like to buy her her drinks she wouldn't be getting drunk\nRight\nWouldn't be able to drink right\nIf you weren't there and buy to buy her her drinks she wouldn't be getting drunk\nRight when you finance from his behavior you ensure it\nIs going to continue\nOkay does that make sense\nI don't want her to die or something I'm not trying to purchase things cancers and it's going to cause or hand or something but it sounds like this woman lives from one crisis to another than there are also\nCreated [laughter] you know I Am\nAnd I thought I was reading that in the mail but I wasn't sure so I mean I understand and I'm not trying to be lacking compassion I Want to be compassionate but continuing to assist her in this behavior line that has been destructive to her is not compassionate\nOkay a country like\nMan I tell you what I don't know I mean you got to sit down and figure out how you're going to do this in layers but maybe you should have maybe you assist her partially in return for her engaging in behaviors that she knows she's supposed to be doing\nOK but so far she has refused all help that has to do with her ... up yeah I was a little kid my dad used to say straighten up and fly right you ever heard that\nI don't even know what that means I don't even know what that means I just knew we'd better straighten up I never did flies I don't know what he meant but I didn't fly right you know but you know what I'm Talking about straighten up have\nYou know ... and I and I did I mean 'cause I have a little looked as if we didn't do what he said so you know but I'm the ... show the in this case we can't do that kind of stuff but but I I got I just think that's what needs to happen here for her own good you're aggravated whether\n... because of her because you love her and you don't want to see her in pain and she refuses to do the things she calls the pain to go away\n... okay\nAnd you're more concerned about her behavior than she is\nSo I ... I think I just sit down and tell her all that say you know I Love you because let me tell you when you do all that she's going to get pissed off injuries\nAnd here she feels entitled to your money\nBack and I feel that's weird\nAnd required cells that are found very violation and looked around and show\nHow she is titled or your money so shameless way\nHere to take care of your mom\nCigarette hanging out you're living iron lung in the closet I mean come on\nThis is the Ramsey shift\nDrink lots of money this is Dave Ramsey show on there's Ninety five Seventy\nI get asked all the time about what people need to do to improve\nTheir families money situation to the most overlooked things are term life insurance and disability insurance both plans make sure that you have income to pay bills\nAnd take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen for term life you need to carry tend to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most families stay away from cash value or return a premium plans\nThere just a rip off disability insurance is just as critical how are you going to pay your bills or if you're unable to work disability is the leading cause of bankruptcies foreclosures that's why I send you to Zander insurance\nThey've been helping my listeners find the right plans\nAt the lowest cost for almost Twenty years called eight hundred three five six Seventeen Ninety or visit ... dot com and compare online at ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Billings", "day": "17"}
