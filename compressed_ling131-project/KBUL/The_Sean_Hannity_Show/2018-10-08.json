into millionaires Leo original book started everybody talking about those back in the early Nineteen nineties when I wrote my first book\nThe financial piece came out a book called the millionaire next door but Dr Tom Stanley changed the way everyone thought about millionaires I got to know Doug Stanley a little bit a while he was living and I've gotten to know his daughter since then and I'm big fans of each of theirs and we're big fans of course of anyone who's in this millionaire space doing anything\nAnd as you guys know Chris Hogan as a million or a book coming out in January but Sarah for law is with us a Tom Standage daughter and a this was the first time we've ever talked on the air we've talked off the air and she has a new book coming out of being blown with some of her dad's original research so stay Sarah how are ya\nI'm good how are you thanks for having me on well\nI'm honored the new book is called the next millionaire next door in during the strategies for building wealth and it it's out this week right\nThat's right yeah it's um it was a labor of love without my father but without and live LA excited about it\nYou know if you guys didn't know her her dad passed in a car wreck or four years ago wasn't now yes he thousand Fifteen that's right yeah they say that\nI'm thinking I remembered that about there and um we had to have him on several times over the years as we discuss this whole subject to millionaires and\nAll of the some of the mythology litters around millionaires so uh you used some of the research from your dad's in Europe are professional researcher to like he was and uh and and they put this together tell me about the background on that part of it what if this or did you do and more of it was combined with what he had done\nYet I think that the trade had we had worked together really on the in this whole survey for the buck on you know really started back and the thousand trial thinking about the ... anniversary of the millionaire next door like that it came out in the nineties\nAnd and work together on kind of what books should include and got to the point when we were just about to send out in the survey um she our sample of of African Americans and he was killed by by a drunk driver\nUm and so really he wasn't able to the the data that came back and compare it to what was there and Nineteen Ninety six and Andy On 'em so that's kind of where I took out a chicken that project than and kept going with\nSarah is an industrial psychologist and president of data points without a research and\nTechnology company that studies wealth accumulation and builds tools to help and you guys have to check this out its\nUm data points dot com has all the stuff on her research as well which you can get the new book the next millionaire next door in during strategies for building wealth at any major bookstore so the new data that you guys got\nAs you put this back together on the anniversary and then you've added to it since with your continued research\nWhat were the ... was there anything that just shocked to win the findings where you should go out and see that one coming\nOut you know we worked a lot at um some of the mistakes though in that kind of behaviors that ... million or make related thing and I think what what I mean like\nYeah just like any of that they're trying to do the right thing on millionaires make mistakes along the way to an ... a lot of that sort of behavior and then at the at the role that they make related going back to that was surprising\nAnd then I think I think the idea was that a lot of other things in terms of the kinds of Iran or the amount that they're spending on things like a furniture and clothing and things like that that some of the things that are surprising that were sort of similar time\nYeah I was speaking in a church a couple of days ago and I told them one of the a key points that I've seen over twenty five years of doing this one of the things you have to do if you want to build wealth is you have to be careful who you hang around with because you become who you\nSo that I've seen over twenty five years of doing this one of the things you have to do if you want to build wealth is you have to be careful who you hang around with because you become who you're playing around with and she on the back of your book and understanding how those around you influence your financial by ... what did you find on that\nYeah absolutely I think that again you see it's very clear from the work that we've done both with populations\nAnd and the every every day folks like I like that they are um that that that social in different that not caring about what other than driving and buying and wearing is a really key factor in building well you know it's related to network regardless of how old you are how much you make\n'em and I think you know now with technology it's really hard to ignore what other people are doing the actual media and so forth but it continues to be there are just not caring about what other people is unreal that it is one of the wave itself well\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because one of the benefits going broke like I did in my twenties where his violently was on yellow ... at that point I just reached all I wanted to do survive\nAnd thrive and reach a point I just don't care what people think I still don't care what people think and I think there was a big contributor to me\nPersonally you'll be able to to build wealth again after going bankrupt but I see it with other people as when you don't care what other people think about what you drive where you live what closure where whether you've been on vacation you're not trying to keep up with other people's Facebook version of themselves then you've got the ability to win\nAbsolutely and I think like just like he said I think that that on Facebook version of what is a lot different right than what's really going on in our lives too so that something to keep in mind but we definitely see that and that research\nShe'll gaining knowledge and composer to invest in grow well that is a great word come closer to grow ... what do you mean by that\n[noise] that you know study that related to making decisions on that comes to our investments that it really you know you could apply to any kind of major financial decision that you're making a few he kind of calm yourself before making the decision so I Know the example we get sometimes there's\nGoing to rain but not a great time to go out and look for in a car because you're not a skier and an emotional state where you are so excited about the new income level that you have all of a sudden your decision making is a little off so he can stay home and come as\nA matter what the financial bar then you'd have a better chance of making the right one\nAnd I often hear ah we've got a ... personalities as a career show on you're choosing a career and there's all this I'm a stuff about following your passion out there but you guys have you found yet again in this new set of data the idea that ate a lifestyle related freedom\nDoes not equate to less income or less wells that actually which to greater engagement greater will the new\n[noise] yeah you know I think that's right I think that you know understanding that looking at your passion or your your interests let's say for your career happy ground in some kind of reality um and and I think that that's something that\nYou know a lot of people don't want to hear but it is true and so um if you had a passion for the arts and that's really where you want your career to go um have you have to take that with the reality is that means is certain things are going to have to be set aside\nFor that kind of again it's a lesson that a lot of I don't want to hear but um we have to have been here since ... you\nKnow there's a price to be paid to build wealth and it's worth the price and nobody does it accidentally they'll do it with a plan\nI absolutely yeah that that's one of the things that we keep thing over and over again and again we're talking about millionaires or does that are on their way to becoming a millionaire but\nAnd looking at your goals and monitoring what's going on in your life and not try keeping your had an aunt um relate it do they have returned it it ran out of it while\nWe're talking with Dr Sarah Stanley afoul of I'm I'm I'm permission pronouncing your last name out offsite correctly\nAt all I thought well I'll I'll yeah I'd say\nLike I told me about one on there and a strong mess it up there I'm so sorry for law and a daughter of Dr Tom Stanley a comic work called the millionaire next door a lot of you've read it if you hadn't you should and you need to read Sarah's new book that she did combined with her dad's\nResearch project that they were working on together when he passed away the new book is called the next millionaire next door it is now out and you need to read it\nNow you know we've got a book out called a course called everyday millionaire and let me start if you want to be a millionaire there's not one book you read all of them and you learn from everyone over there is no competition\nThat's why we answer on we've been friends with them for years we'd love that she's got a book out come in the same year that we do and we want love helping her we want you to go by this book right now it's called the next millionaire next door Sarah thank you for being with us today thank God I had I mean [noise] this is

shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim\nOf the sixteen million victims of identity the last year yes sixteen million twenty six percent of them have to borrow money

I think it's going to make you look in mountain [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah so I\nMoved up and all that stuff I used to take the bus they do to be a long day then used to be very tiring for one thing I paid off my lawn I went ahead and go to a lady extend the butter and it was kind of how you live under the impression that you know it was okay to ... so that kind of a thing\nOr a good thing and coming up to eighty and the ... about thirty thousand others\nAnd one paid by the guy that I started listening to your show and ever since I've been doing better than me feeling relieved really bad about that because you know one of things you say that you should never get into that and that's exactly what I did yeah how can\nI help you today sure\nYeah so my question and I have a couple of questions one new thing I should have the ...\nWhat's your household income Seventy five to do it and you make thirty are you oh thirty I'm sure your thirty oh yeah oh yeah where you are quick you're going to pay it off\nI mean if I really put my thumb on like that and maybe a year maybe in a house\nYeah my mum or like a year yeah you're single right yeah\nThank you for joining us a little machine is with us in Los Angeles times Jay how are you\nAre you better than I deserve what's\nOkay I'm just getting by just come back right after they shut up [laughter] so um I graduated high school a few years ago and I had to go to community college in community college I'm at work I went to a\nWork [laughter] um I did about like thirty hours a week off to go to Kate in college and it wasn't an issue and now I transferred to a university I mean my first semester right now [laughter] I'm In classes are just a you know a little bit harder\nSo my question was do you think I should quit my job and focus more on school for the last two years or do you think I should just I'm just trying to get harder and a ... both\nUh-huh what are you studying accounting\nOkay I've got a finance degree and I worked forty to sixty hours a week while I went through school and for years\nAt the at the university level so I'm a it's doable um you are you know you are doing a lot of studying and not a lot of partying for sure um the um how are you paying for school\nUm I go to I get grants and also um ... with the money for\nOkay so you're you're not going into debt no level of okay so if you quit work how would you pay for school\nI had a money saved up from a working for the past year I don't mind my think ankle probably like call of mhm we left me a year year and a half [noise] no I think\nI keep working okay if\nIt ... the last year if it costs you half a point on your grade point average um\nYeah I heard about it like cheap yeah yeah\nGraduated with a tuna and seven\nI missed it as a magnet by I'm just making about three one has a point I'm Still piss Thirty years later but [laughter] but you know what I have never had a single caller asked my GPA before they asked my advice [laughter] and I actually I've never gone on a job interview where they asked my GPA in my entire life\nEver in if you're willing to go to work for one of the top accounting firms in the entire world they might ask your GPA and you might actually be in competition or GPA might actually matter\nOn your very first job but after that it won't um\nAnd it has a whole lot more to do with did you learn how to do accounting than what your GPA is and will you work hard while you're at work and that kinda stuff and so what are you doing for work right now\nUh I work at a bank mhm okay good\nOkay a poke around in the accounting field and see if you can get on with one of them making about the same kind of money one of them I'd actually a for your degree\nYet but I'm thinking too\nYeah wouldn't hurt anything to ask around and see if we can make a job James and make about the same money and get free tuition or something that'd be very cool on top of it but I'm I'm you know you're not working a hundred hours a week you were going thirty hours a week twenty hours a week you can do this\nIt's very doable uh most people work when they're in school it's not that unusual really by the way uh when I when I Do and I was in\nA I was just in San Francisco this week and we're doing event we sit right Chris Hogan as the audience or three thousand people there how many of your work when you were in college I mean it's like Ninety percent of the audience raise their hand now maybe the people that didn't work when they're in college and listen to my show I don't know but\nIt appears that most people work when they're in college that's what it looks like and so um I I think if I'm you I'm going to continue that route good question thank you for joining us a ... is with us in Houston Hi Lucia how are you\nI Am doing well thank you for asking um I don't know if I get tacos here and my husband and I were I mean babysat ... getting out of that and now we\nAre and what you call they they've got three in the labor for the down payment on our ... finance channel that we're looking right now at about a Fifteen Percent about them I frequent down um\nOur household income before\nUm sunny back when he was about one class size um after about missing by phone app one thirty two so I'm trying to make sure that I don't know about like how much how I found that we are understanding the um\n[noise] I I I think he recommended and afford to have your take home pay exactly uh okay I think and so I wanted to make sure that like right now where I prayed with a million market calculators and right now we're kind of a funny one from Jerry I'm ... I'm a\nI'm an comes up like a reasonable comfortable amount of anger at it I think number yesterday feeling a little bit\nYou know it was a big now that it's a lot better than you're paying now but if that's what that's a fourth of your take home pay or less and your debt free with your emergency fund and blows you have the math spread to prosper if you continue to budget and stay on track but again that's not what you should do that's the most\nYou should do so you can do less if you want to 'em or you can put on a shorter term if you want to\nAnd you know I'm about less house at Twenty one hundred and paid off in ten years there's nothing wrong with ... five years I don't care I mean you can do a lot of stuff but the most I Would ever tell you to do and I I don't even do that 'cause I don't borrow\nAt all for anything ever is a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payment is no more than a fourth of your take home pay\nAlice Hi Luke welcome to the day Ramsey show [noise] I'd have area better than I deserve what's up [noise] so\nUm my wife and I have a written to you for many years actually I my dad got me actually when I was a young kid and I'm David Lee I did not take your bike and I have student loans and um [noise] we are considering taking a cash out refinance our house\nTo a knockout the high interest you know ... and ... are paying the debt off on the house because it that much lower interest rate [noise]\nAnd how much they want to get your mind in London now she um read it forty eight thousand strength and what's your household income\n[noise] actually Twain takeover forty to sixty so I own my own business so last year we did sixty five this year we're looking at probably doing I'm probably going to bring culture to forty two\nOkay I I don't know what you've been listening to on the show but in a twenty six years I've never told someone to refinance actually take Arabs pay off their debt ever except to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure and you're facing neither\n... and so on now I I've never told anybody to do that okay and the reason is very simple you make enough money to pay this debt off on a couple of years calm you got to work like a maniac and you're gonna have to have no life\nBut then you're going to be debt free accept your house and then you can work on paying off your house I'm from there and of course start working on your retirement and the other baby steps that we won't be groups but you can't borrow your way out of debt and on and if you pay this off within two years the interest rate on this becomes mathematically irrelevant\nBecause you can also fast there's locker keeping it for Thirty years it's a two year thing and and really is not forty eight thousand for two years more like twenty thousand for two years because halfway through you're going to be halfway through\nAnd and so yeah you guys need to get on a budget really really tight budget very careful where Donald in\nTouch your lifestyle nothing do everything you can wear your business to increase your income because you need to clean up a student loan debt I agree with you on that part but no I don't I don't tell people to borrow to get out of that you can't borrow your way out of work to get big your way out of a whole\nDigging out of a whole is a an oxymoron excitement that we all make which I'm digging a hole you're not digging out of hope you dig out the bottom of a hole gets deeper\nShe can't dig out of all you have to fill in the whole I get to climb out a whole maybe but you don't dig out of a home unless you dig into China and work so no\nYou can't you can't you can't borrow your way out of that\nThat's the same exact situation so you got to stop that you have to break that cycle\nLittle on the sand and say well not borrowing money\nEver ever\n...

I never sometimes when I just felt like we didn't have any money and that's the mindset I had to get myself was okay we don't have money for this but you know it's there\nAnd we wanted it but in you know when I'm On a budget\nBut once I set about whether control me I don't\nKnow very very good okay so we know uncle was a cheerleader when your brother was a cheerleader and you had the community that you've got plugged into Richard leaders who else would your biggest cheerleader\nI mean we're really close to our family and my family through\nAll of them are very supportive of us we we both come from five brothers are\nNot five ...\nFive kids from each family so two brothers and sisters so we have we come from a big family but um they were all supportive of us really in our friends and as well so\nAre cool so what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is now that you've done it\nI think the key thing David is being on the same page ... in our communication is key and you know we went to the money and marriage last week and we were listen to a lot of the other couples mhm and none of them have gone through the financial peace but I had gone through a lot of seminars ...\nAnd I think if they had gone through a seminar or the financial peace university they would really get on the same page and it would just really explode once I get through that and and follow the ... the steps yeah\nAnd just you know riding down our goals is really important for us to do and once we had that you know we're very goal driven\nAnd especially being in sales jumped you got to be ... you know we have that target and we wanted to hit it and so just staying focused and dedicated and discipline I'm really really helped us you know\n... well on you guys from Bert proud of you\nVery well on your show a couple a lesson Rajoy the marriage money thing or it's but virtually stand up comedy because they're both a book about a ... yeah they really are funny and they're both funny on the green room to by the way that I mean it's the same thing so wow well done well done we've got a copy of a ... book for you which are inspired\nAnd what that would be the next chapter in your story that you're now millionaires and you're well on your way and then of course a outrageously generous as you go along very very well done I'm proud of your\nCar Ronnie and by the guy used to\nPut it all been Seventeen months mugging one to on the one thirty one year old British going three two one\nThem as a bottom Libya throughout their lives is good [noise]\nAll I needed was strategy all needed was a strategy on the ... we got to get on the same page we got to get on the same page communication and the budget\nHere it over and over and over again don't ship\nShoal tonight to turn off TV [noise] would you go to bed\nYou of course in the ...\nSeoul tonight to turn off the TV would get to bed\nAnd credit cards in the scissors and have a ... to me and you and your spouse that down open up the every dollar happen through your first budget [noise]\nBecause you work too hard to be broke [noise]\nThey work too hard but they broke your deserve better [noise] most time you went and got your somebody\nLoses that I ...\nDid you know statistically when it comes to life insurance in protecting your family that women are more likely to be uninsured or under insured than men this doesn't make any sense women make up half the workforce contributes mightily to family incomes\nAnd in many cases are the breadwinners and take care of their families twenty four hours a day this is one of the most overlooked areas when it comes to financial planning maybe it's a relic of the past but a loss of income or the need to replace family care\nIs equally important for women as it is for men single moms working moms stay at home moms all need term life insurance\nRates are actually lower for women which is why I send your designed or insurance they shop the top term life companies to find the lowest rates available you can compare rates on line at ... dot com or call eight hundred three five six\nForty two eighty two this is something every family has to deal with that ... dot com or eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two\nOptics move crazy amounts of data and even crazier speeds and ... and is the one hundred percent fiber optic network\nWith files that connection you'll get the fastest Internet available to download speeds up to nine hundred and forty ...

that\nYou have your emergency fund this was the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some of the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals but I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals then you're not enjoying your life\nYou live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby

Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThey have a pet thank you for taking my call first time caller sure I'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training and I finally received like commercial helicopter state ticket\nUm however I unfortunately I Need a the by eighty hours or more training I had discovered a the industry is highly regulated by insurance\nAnd in order to become a share of NATO out two hundred hours and I'm trying to figure out how to pay for the eighty hours and be ready to work the upcoming season I'm as a commercial up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a co pilot the hours\n[noise] no I unfortunately uh the are the jobs are there any ... is the single pilot\nNow that that moment you just said the wrong thing you should do the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida and you know we're talking about what's wrong well\nI I didn't tell you another thing or two days I I work at a firefighter so that's my primary um income choice this is kind of like a secondary thing that I kind of went off in bed and that's a\nThat's why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as a ... ... jobs that I can I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than ... ah no I Believe it or not firefighter a definitely make are\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or a career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nYes yeah so that's what I Want to do [noise] okay um\nAnd you show it forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work an irregular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited value\nYeah it's not that ...\nThere's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this is like it's like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I just I feel I'm too far into it to just\nWell I'm not suggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except to slow down and go I'm just gonna take me a little time does I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do the hours\nRight
