wondering\nIf you could give me some advice on how it would affect me if I were to return Elise car dealership\nOr at this point I just keep the vehicle or none of the above\nReading your car back that you owe money on our son to lease on that's effectively\nA voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb\nBecause they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it\nAnd are there and on a repossession lot and then they're going to sue you for the difference if you don't pay them the difference immediately\nAnd you don't have the different she goes you're broke so I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that [noise] um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car free ... company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the title of your lease payments blush residual value at the end it should be less because you're these leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off on the line when it doesn't include all the interest from\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time show the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that what a Swiss bank by the car off they can get the title in your hand then you compare that\nTo KB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sale what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole ... probably not far off of what you're going to find\n... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole the jury and the amount that you are upside down in the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank\nAnd you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car for as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will show at four in the report lot so the bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the differences greater\nAnd you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession\nAnd so you cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are show 'em they ribs utility to borrow money no diver and she's telling you to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the debt by doing that\nAnd so you borrow and cover the amount that

they Ramsey does not ever invest real clear on the lesson you heard me yeah when you are never tell you under any circumstances to huge life insurance and investment vehicle\nOne hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo when you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhy would so you knew or knew financial advisor that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial advisor you\nHave a life insurance salesman\nOkay they're showing you in church\nSo what we were thinking we should do is switched to four hundred thousand just the term H. and then the money we were 'cause it was like three hundred dollars a month which are a lot yeah um and just go ahead and open up our rah rah are IRA and start getting money into that\nAnd that it would mutual funds okay it's exactly what you learn in class wasn't yeah so you already knew what she said yeah he just language tells me one of those things are you this guy's a lawyer or he's or ignored\nRight [laughter]\nHe's a family friend who's in the um actually one of our friends did apparently gave them our number because they use and for it as well\nYeah yeah okay so I don't know which is I mean I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nRight and the last thing it on our term policy um on your class he said you know Twenty years Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy was until we were eighty with him [laughter]\n\nOkay why don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much is guys over charge you for everything he sold you\nKnow car and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\nHey that sounds like well Oregon that damn I'm In the end of that quake\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically [noise] um the people who sell\nInvestment based or\nWhole life or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me and so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nCrap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return\nRegardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die with cash value permanent\nPortfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay\nOnly the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a better rate of return and when you die they keep it all this is a bad savings account it's bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap and that's what Dave Ramsey is always at four twenty five years here on the air upset it for twenty five years is liable and myself\nI have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind ever\nNow I did get a horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Britain they it was a guy\nMy wife knew from college\nCame around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him I had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me\nAnd but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy\nAnything other than\nFifteen to twenty year term life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker that shop several companies the best way to buy insurance if any connoisseur a broker the shops several companies\nAnd get you the best possible deal or that your car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deals and that's why we've endorsed for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from lander and I don't own Zander insurance on around any of it that show that while this always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason they done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that\nYet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance out by the way a broker you know you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with ... with the help they usually indoors local providers for your ... what we call PNC property in casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance\nYou can shop most people saved three to eight hundred dollars a year\nOn their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive\nAgent in the business captive agent can sell for one company like a state for major\nForeign nationwide in Asia\nOr Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent was it nationwide that's nationwide and go\nBut um and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that\nBut you're paying for those guys\nWhen you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys were cheap I'll just tell you\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nIs one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for the new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this when was the last time you checked on your financial plant you heard me or do you even have one\nI listened with a financial plan and pleasure more likely to reach your investment goals\nAnd the best place to start is by sitting down and talking with an

you know from Indianapolis, Indiana hey ruin welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThey they think micro sure I have a stepdaughter she's holding the fifth grade she go to school but she struggled all it was focused attention which early on got off hurdles and really do\nWant to start a business for her that her and her brother ray selling a channel that she made but I also want to do it\nTo your phone is breaking up can you speak directly into it you can you hear me better now yeah sure\nOkay so um my ten year old\nOr ... we heard we heard our got up to that point I started working on a Darwinian like I'm sure she's making Ken but she's making ... exactly okay\nI Want a percentage of the trial should go with our children\nSo why why should I as a not for profit company or shaken up the regular L O\nNone of the above I showed up as a sole proprietorship you're over complicating a candle business ... year old\nOkay to shut up as a sole proprietorship you're probably not even gonna make any money if you make a little bit it'll be fine pay some taxes on it and if you want to fund a Roth IRA for her or something the point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business to the point is not the business the point is and what the kid is learning\nThey're learning work they're learning interface with\nCustomers and how to treat people ah they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality they're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit to capitalism is not evil ... that these are the lessons are what is important\nTo understand the accurate or if she makes some money that's just a bonus right but what ... what are you\nWhat you've identified as you've identified the way this kid is wired\nAnd a lot of us that are entrepreneurial are are a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much you'll pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know since I'm sure you know but I ... if you start may start to make a hundred thousand dollars a year or something you may want to\nDo and they all see but if you if you're making under a hundred grand where the profit\nOn it and that's not you know unless you just hit some bizarre without thing or something like home depot wants to buy or out or something I don't know but you know what you're trying to do is teach her the lessons of how to set up operate a business\nWhen they're getting ready to have a kid go off to college is weaker you shop\nAnd understand\nWhat college costs because\nIt is one of the most bizarre\nThings to learn the [noise]\nThe distance between the less expensive schools and the most expensive schools I mean we're talking eight thousand eighty\nThousand a year spread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of college is the same cost it's just not\nAnd it's the number one mistake people make when they don't have a lot of money and the kid is going off to school it draws people in the student loan debt 'cause they simply go to school we can't afford\nAnd as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars\nIn student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education\nThat puts a curriculum and the high schools and in the colleges across America we are now and forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stuff of staying out of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nAnd what happens from time to time is the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come a long shot in the community a business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've had about four million students go through it one of the coolest things has happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it and paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby\nThat's how that happens the college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good\nNow Tyler Moore is with me on the line hand tile is from the University of Wyoming usually associate vice provost of enrollment Kyle why are they go oh man thank you for doing that is\nWell it's a it's a pleasure to visit with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here and the state of Wyoming to be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical applicable\nBeing for students to be able to apply that college search and uh and and be a real fatty consumer of higher education\nYeah cause you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lowest resident tuition at any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the rooms are like so like your cheaper than my University of Tennessee or your cheaper than the University of dot dot dot that's correct\nWow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was\nBehind this I immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I meant we'll get him to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our our campaign is called the world\nThe motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys\nWe're we're not talking about guys in cowboy hat that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enter spirit we're talking about a curiosity independence vote in this\nEffort Sudafed adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and look for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know it's not\nA capital isn't what you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right that's correct\nYour football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right\nAnd so as as good I play on words but you you guys got though that you got to the table first with this way to go man I Love it it's a great motto\nOr does it says so much in unjust are so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you gotta sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have\n... as a coming up soon the the high school curriculum cause the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool guile thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we're we are we are state that is very practical were state that very\nMuch um applicable in terms of being smart with our money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the Ramsey education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're\nYou know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this and they're going in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that\nAnd the win is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college because sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line\nI talked to a lot of ... around the country I'm my own chancellor and vice chancellor of the ... Tennessee and it's a constant thing and then ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university\nAnd it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nSir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state that you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition of a doctoral ranting institution we're near the very lowest for non residents to come to ... so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south\nWe can be a solution that provide students and incredible opportunity for education\nAnd we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are\nHelping a student be successful not just students success and part of that is not racking up\nHelping a student be successful not just students success and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nI meant so how many students on your campus\nWe have we have a little over or twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that are called themself cowboy you\nKnow that's a good size school that's not too big and not too small that's what that's a that's just right those are ... just right very cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again rather thank you for coming on whether\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nAnd I love it I Love the motto and I think the world does need more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a little picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but\nA bottom line is lesser mascot and so\nNow that's a that's very cool stuff I Love it and want a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high school now if you're a business or a university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the state\nSome states have more on the schools and others can you imagine you know but um\nYou know maybe you just want to do it to be to the hospital used to go to um I went over spoke to them in the building where I used to go to high school the other day it's now a middle school\nSo I had all the forty really bright and shiny little eighth graders looking at me that's the hardest speaking you'll ever have all this child
