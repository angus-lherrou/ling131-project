you're skiing and the paid off mortgage Liam double your\nWas a choice\nAnd I am Dave Ramsey your host thank you for joining us America was the lead you our ears open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five triple\nEight eight to five five two to five Peter starts off this hour in Gainesville, Florida Hi Peter how are you\nI'm doing all out there how are you better than I deserve what's up\nGood thank you have that I got a follow up on all the millionaire if that were just call and then um but I just want to let you know I Am an avid listener and I can't believe I'm finding myself in this situation a little background a while back I was entering my apartment complex and found the gate shutting out my vehicle and cracked my relationship\nI tried to collect from the complex for the damages caused to my vehicle and from there was contacted by them requesting seven hundred and Seventy five dollars to pay for the gate that quote by my vehicle\nUm come back and forth conversation I was ultimately refusing to pay them just because there's no indication or that it was going to close et cetera et cetera I thought everything was clear after I stopped sharing from them and this past week I got a call from a collection agency I'm just wondering if you have food by\nHer attorney what's that hire an attorney\nFor seven hundred and Seventy five dollars for the damages yep okay what about do you think that small claims court could be an option yup\nBut I I'm ... listen I think if you hire an attorney for a couple of hundred dollars and they write them a letter or you might shut this whole thing down I don't know that you'll have to go to small claims court\nAnd so and I make I mean conversation with the a collection agency crack this has nothing to do with you\nHave to go to small claims court\nOkay and I'm a conversation with the a collection agency cracked it had it with the ... like I'm like you\nKnow yesterday they still on that and they're the ones that hard to collections agency I Would say like I was Sunday apartment complex\nOkay Phil I entered college as well just come back on the part that goes on the you think my my next that it'd be the cockpit attorney and be in contact with the um with the apartment complex and no way could I could write a check that they had a collection agency\nBut if you think that the gate closed improperly and you weren't doing anything wrong and the stupid thing broke your car they need to fix your car and not charge you for the gate right right\nThat's what you're telling me and if that's the case um you know an an a letter from an attorney may solve the whole thing uh but they're not scared of you obviously\nA show we need to get someone that gets their attention\nBecause basically you're getting run down I ... a corporate ladder here uh this is probably a corporate owned or ... owned apartment complexes being quote unquote professionally managed\nAnd so you're not dealing with a mom and pop you just got stuck in the vortex here and the only way to jog that out is shock somebody and so yeah I mean that you're going to write a check 'em you might as well decide which one you want to ride you want to write a check for a gate that broke that when your fault or do you want to write a check for justice\nEuro from eight to five five\nYou know money Washington today comes from blind spots um

was a gimmick or something I should keep paying dental insurance is one of the most easy insurance has to figure out that they're charging you more than you are getting\nUm we've had dental insurance proposed to us as a a a employee benefits several times and it's really simple when you add up what you pay for it in a year you'd never spend that much on dentistry\nIt just doesn't work out it's one of those things you should self insure through now we do have an advertiser that is with us that is a a dental discount company and that is worth it\nBecause that helps you get discounts on your dental repairs or dental work and so forth and um you know you can check them out as well you can find them on our website one dental is what it's called one dental\nAnd er James just helped me 'cause I was looking at him my brain wasn't was firing and I couldn't remember are great people to have gotten to know the\nOne dental but it's a discount program for dental services now that is worth it and we do that but we've had dental insurance attempt advertiser many times and we just simply don't let them Christine is with us in Hartford, Connecticut Hi Christine how are you\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh my goodness longtime listener and just so excited never called before\nSo um my husband and I our debt free including our house white again yes well thank you for your teaching we followed them off um and we are actually we're everyday millionaires I'm a teacher he didn't like tradition\nAnd um so we we been investing in a way that you recommend and you don't get out of curiosity we finally decided to meet with an email we went online and found one that you your site recommend\nA main power over investing\nYes okay yeah yeah or if I'm not factor ... thank you okay um and we met with him and he went very ah you know had a lot of information for us\nAnd then you know the the structure is like a ... percent [laughter] I guess and\nSo when my husband and I didn't know is simply been investing in a way that you teach since we've been you know we both are blessed to have ...\nWe have you know we're only in our fifties and we ... we could retire and five years you don't have to [laughter] but we we couldn't be comfortable um what what is it still makes sense to hire\nUm a financial person for a year at you know whatever I think it's like five thousand dollars a year because they go on a five point five percent of what you're\nActually they're lucky they're proposing a ... a manager to count for you correct\nYeah a lot of the industry has gone to the managed to count approach and on and so the question is what do you get for your money that's what you're going to ... and a anytime you're investing in when I'm investing by the way my personal money's invested with one of our smart enough to approach okay [noise]\nUm and so the\nThere's two ways to do investing in mutual funds upfront sees a that as you do the investment they charge a fee and then there's very low almost no annual after that or they managed to count worry it's a percentage\nThat nobody you getting that while they're helping you select the funds and putting you in the funds that are out performing the market overall um you know I Hope over a long period of time over average you know funds that outperform the S. and P.\nAnd of course you've got someone to meet with uncover anytime there's a question about anything I'm a if there's a change in the market and you're worried about it or up or down um anything along those lines and there's tons of studies that say that\nYou will come out ahead doing those two things one is getting good advice and picking the proper funds and to a you know just not jumping off the ledge every time somebody comes on the news and freaks out you're probably not already not doing that one\nBut we like it I mean I can do every day you know kind of see how you've kind of got\nThat Dali and you're not going to jump off the roller coaster and get hurt you know so who are out that that part of stuff so you know the thing is just asked them to show you okay why are you worse what is your charging\nAnd you know because you're charging me a fee argue worth that are in in most cases you'll find it is\nIt that way then you're trying to make more than the cost of the fee\nIn extra returns and certainly in services in terms of um you know education is available to you and\nUm you know there's a thousand mutual funds to go through I don't keep up with eight thousand mutual funds I have a day job you know and so a a a life you know I don't want to do that but those guys that's all they do all day long this comb through those funds\nIt's their whole world they eat live and breathe that stuff and it's I also don't work on my own car\nOr I could probably fix my car cheaper than the mechanic fixes it but it would take me longer\nOr there'd be several trial and error is along the way I might break something in the process and so it's worth it to me to get somebody to hook the computer up to the car that actually has the computer hooks up to the guards instead of me being a redneck laying on the trying to figure this out\nAnd it's kind of like you know investments I don't know why those either um I don't even do my own taxes are and I'm pretty good at this stuff it's what I Do um uh money guy and got a natural for math and all that kind of stuff but I don't why when\nIt gets into the the the you know the dirty details so to speak so that's why I think you're going to find the investment is worth that the managers account is worth it but I it's fair to ask them to show you\nOkay you the typical guy does this or you've been doing this over here but if you had been with us during that same period of time here's what we would have had you and here's what the ... and and you know it would've made you want and a half percent more what it costs to half a percent so you'd an editor for one that kind of a thing um it's a fair question to say hey prove your worth\nAnd uh I don't think any smart Mr pro that we have would\nI'm telling you that that they can't do that um that they all obviously all believe that they can\nAnd then just ask them to show you the question Alex is with us in Charlotte North Carolina Hi Alex welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nAnd I are you doing today better than I deserve Sarah what's up\nA good question um I did better course Gary Coleman but about my career uh I'm currently in by but that too and I'm a welder I worked out of town and I'm Mike around a hundred and forty thousand a year mhm and um\nI've got opportunity to go work at home on the pay is about a third of what I make working out of town and I'm now a curious if you thought it was crazy to hike I'd be all about that I'm I'm not married yet I'm getting married next month\nYeah OK at home um where are you where are you working out of town\nA member going on now with the world with them on um [noise] you know my own their own market right now I'm On\nAnything other than a flower mhm\nMhm okay well\nI think the answer for me would always be see none of the above ... ... I like the ad that coming off the road I don't like the idea of a two thirds pay cut so I got to figure out how can I don't either how can I come off the road and make more money\nOr do I gotta do to make more money off the road or connect to some kind of a mix and say I'm going to be gone two weekends a month and a and go do just ... there's some OT out on the road that way and pick up some serious change as until\nBut is there is there a pass a career paths\nAt home or whether it's owning your own shop or a you know [noise] I don't know run running a different kind of a ... a different way of doing this rather than just saying a J. O. V.\nVersus a road jobs is there another way to do this and that's that's what I'm going to be touched the rocks I'm going to be turning over and looking for is to how to do that and um you know where I Want to be one I'm forty will be on the road [noise] you don't want to be on the road already you told me that\nGetting married I don't blame you I think it's a good idea will be home with a new wife that good question I think you could figure it out but it's a tough one this is the day Ramsey show\n[noise] and why\nIn the world would you trust some random guy in a Q ... when getting your mortgage to really think he cares about your longer money ... doesn't\nThose companies care about getting you and do whatever home loan program they're pushing that week when it comes to ordering a

sell the truck if you can't cover the difference okay and\nThen in young I Would be willing to go down I mean two three thousand dollars below what you owe it sounds like it's a one thousand dollars blows the blue book on it but you need to get this truck sold it's killing you\nYeah I mean I wouldn't go tonight I wouldn't go ten thousand in the hole on it but I I Would drop down there a few thousand bucks in a heartbeat just to get rid of your stinking payments a thousand a month in it\nAnd fix eighty six eighty okay close enough [laughter] wow\nYeah so I mean you you you made the right decision to get rid of it it it's an out of control purchase while over the top and out of control and\nYou know you're just going to have cell the truck for what you can get for it uh and if you can get forty five four fine if you get forty four for five to forty three four it fine or you know three four thousand bucks you know a little small payments a whole lot more than I have an almost fifty thousand bucks out on a truck\nA you're reducing your debt substantially by doing that\nAnd I was what you're paying a month you beat you pay off that you know a couple of thousand dollar loss\nGuys we've been talking a lot about the millionaire one set the way you think if you're a millionaire around here\nOne thing we found for sure is millionaires think long term they don't think thank God it's friday oh God it's Monday\nThey're looking out for word\nAnd they're thinking and there's two things that millionaires\nDo they play all sense when they play defense\nAll fans is they do the right things to build the wealth they do the investing to build the wealth\nYou know investing in your mutual funds near four one K. investing and paid for real estate they do these kinds of things that defense is avoiding stupid stuff that cause you to lose everything all the progress you made\nAnd so that stuff like the right kinds of insurance the will all that kind of stuff and so having a good solid financial plan is both all fence and defense and that is one thing we find one of the data points we find with all these millionaires they really good at defense\nAnd um it sounds tedious ... it can be but we've got a thing to help you with free it's called the five minute coverage checkup\nSo you get your phone out and you text the word check up to thirty three Seventy nine\nOr go to Dave Ramsey dot com slash checkup\nBut ... the word check up to thirty three Seventy nine or Dave Ramsey dot com slash checkup completely free and they don't really help you I mean it'll help you get that millionaire mindset going and that's what you've got to do Andrea is with us in Pasadena, California Hi Andrea welcome to the Ramsey show\nHiking thank you for having me on that um I Am so happy that I'm like my husband and I and I might have\nTo send it to me now you're totally again we didn't let me ask you about three months already okay I'm just trying to see what our next step that we have about\nA thousand dollars in credit card that we have about fourteen thousand in savings and we have no he said I feel like they're really holding\nBut we're just not sure what else we can do it I mean it could come and get rid of them as they're I'm not really sure what it all\nRight well you can we can do some math and determine if you want to just ride them out or if you want to sell the car now if you want to sell the car here's what you would do and you need to get this information gathered up you need to call the police company and ask what the early buyout is meaning if I wrote you a check\nThe day to get my title what would it be that should be less than the total of your remaining lease payments plus the residual value the buyout at the end okay and I'm sure you get\nEat less than the total of your remaining lease payments plus the residual value the buyout at the end okay and um so you get that number that's like the early pay off without the interest on a car payment okay\nIt's the same thing the early buyout number that's what you're looking for and then you compare that to the value of the car have you done that on any of these cars\nYeah we have on both of our vehicle\nOh wow okay so we've got the actual numbers always talk about vehicle number one then what's the early buyout\nEarly buyout is the least of the dollar\nOkay and and what the value on that car\nThe value of that car I Believe he looked at it it's like twenty five\nAnd ... and that's just Kelley Blue book private sale\nYeah yeah Manhattan undecided thirty ... that's how much it's I'm ...\nI'm Sorry thirty two or twenty\nI made a mistake it that the early badly thirty three ... and the Kelley Blue book member is thirty kill\nOh great okay so you can only lose a thousand dollars by selling that car you'd only write a check for a thousand dollars it'd be sold it for thirty two but you had to give the least company thirty three to get the title you're a thousand and the whole right right right now your lease payment is how much\nMy [laughter] at least eight minutes five hundred and forty two dollars and live and how many\nHow many famous do you have remaining we have about Eighteen came in okay\nAll right I'm just putting that in here that's nine thousand five hundred Seventy six dollars\nMhm mhm so if you sell it today you lose a thousand if you keep it you lose ten thousand yeah no brainer salad okay okay you see how the analysis now let's look at the second one then right what's the value of the second one\nSo the value of the second vehicle is twenty five\nOkay in the early buyout on it\nThat early buyout on it I ... about his early five twenty five okay I haven't done the Kelley Blue book them out but I'm sure it ... I think actually I'm at the ... eleven pound then for that one where really in the hall\nOkay and what is the lease payment on it\nBut at least payment is two hundred and thirty dollars a month or right and how many of those are remaining fourteen my payment\nK. so that um let's see here two thirty in or fourteen is thirty two hundred dollars if you keep the car till the end of the leaves and hand them the case right\nYet as to thirty times fourteen okay and that one is somewhere around fourteen thousand in the whole today\nOkay so you get to drive this car for free until the end of this lease on that one you keep it because I'd rather lose thirty two hundred and fourteen thousand and I drive the car\nOkay you see what I'm doing yes comparing a total of your payments\nAgainst the amount you're in the whole\nSo that one that one I Would probably keep it for your husband's numbers are correct on their value I suspect there and I suspect you're going to keep it anyway because I don't think he's going to be that far off I mean we've got a fourteen thousand dollar deficit right now if he if he's eleven value is right but even if he's half\nWrong it's still a seven thousand dollar deficit versus three thousand to keep it\nSo that one we keep\nOkay and you pay it out now it's is it overall miles\nNow that one way I'm dry mile\nOK and the the wear and tear you're going to keep it up so you're not going to have to write a check when you turn it in fourteen months from now\nNow they're both in that well that one's in great condition\nOkay good good yeah that one or you see how I did that analysis\nYes yeah that really clear that out track we were really struggling with\nAnd that one and you know what I Would do is move on past a baby step to\nOnce you've gotten rid of the the big car the more expensive one and once you got rid of all your other debts except this but if you still have this one with the two thirty payments were just written a car all the way through the end here and you might as well keep the car you get no advantage to turning it in our early\nRight right you're going to write the three thousand\nTwo hundred and twenty dollars worth of two hundred and thirty dollar payments no matter what you do so you might as well drive the dad gummed car you know and um if you want to put thirty two hundred dollars aside extra in your emergency fund just to make sure you got that plus your emergency for uncovered the call yourself in baby steps to in three then that's fine\nBut that's how you do the analysis on whether to keep a leash or not and um most of the time unless you're close to ... unless you're close to the end of the lease you're going to be selling the car and that's what happened with the more expensive one there it's killing you\nNow that one was beach to bite you show good question thank you for joining us ... ... if you've never heard the saying it's kind of a country saying you're getting ...\nWhich means it it's it's like a a a sheep getting its for removed that's where it comes from your getting ripped off as well ... that's why I call them car fleet says because if we take the value of the original\nMarket value of that car\nThat thirty three thousand dollar car on the expensive one there for those folks and I put that five forty two into a calculator and then I put the in value into a financial calculator with residual value at the end in other words the residual values what you can buy the car for at the end of the lease\nYour your games up number at the end of the leash you put those numbers you know the calculator you come back out what the effect of interest rate is\nIn most of the time it's around fourteen percent\nThey call it cost to Capitol\nAnd they don't have to disclose the interest rate da PR to you you know if you get a car loan you get this there's truth in lending sheet the Federal Trade commission makes makes them show you the a PR the annual percentage wretched you're being charged but when you're leasing it's technically not that\nAnd so you 'cause you're renting a car [noise]\nAnd so they are not required federally to disclose the cost of capital or the interest rate [noise] but you can figure it out with a calculator and it'll make you view [noise]\nI mean it's ridiculous that's why we called leasing is the most expensive way to operate car the car lease is a disaster\nIt's a disaster as a financial issue [laughter]\nYou can just do the math you can understand what I'm saying\nThis is that Iran\nA common theme around airs teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make\nAs an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruited ... have\nA meal and having such and having kids that are so young too to know that we can do whatever we want and we're not we're not tied down on you know\nWe don't care how are you ready to forty or you know pirates of the world is Thirty years\nMark\nGr state yeah and I don't\nYou know we had some hard times we did not happening was not easy you know wasn't it wasn't a just a cake walk the whole time but but we are we worked hard and I think it brought us together for sure we um we always had a goal that was\nThat was right in front of us and that that was one thing we didn't fight about I mean like any other company we fight about stuff for sure what that one we were I Know that wouldn't be one of the most important ones we were not there on the same page\nLove it yeah that's one of my biggest thing even with a telling people when we when we're hosting are leading a few classes biggest thing is guys get on the same page has we never fight about money\nMhm awesome really cool so do they listen when you tell me [laughter]\nI think we definitely had some resistance definitely you know it's um all all the stuff you talk about why would you if you can get zero percent interest why would you not do it it's free money ... no I don't get it\n[laughter] there's a differential what is the key to getting out of that you've done at your coaches your blood classes you've done everything\nI think the key is vision I think you have to see where you're going I think uh if I have any criticism of myself as that I'm probably too long term oriented\nAnd I think that has been I Believe your strengths actually are your weaknesses and focus on so long term sometimes forget the little short term\nHe's very very determined and on\nGot it on the journey and I was so excited about that look like I get to read it
