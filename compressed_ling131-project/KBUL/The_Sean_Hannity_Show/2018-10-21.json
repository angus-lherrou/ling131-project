law enforcement military grade force on force system\nAnd it hurts like the Dickens when you get shot with it they say well that's the pain penalty teach you not to do that again well yes it will cause it leaves wealth and sometimes um draw blood at the breakfast ... told that\nYou don't want to do that again and so you pay a lot of attention you try to do better the next time\nWe're rolling

... years had gone Smith ... doing the finishing on him yep\nExactly right I mean yeah colds a goal match national Matt\nIt's just a thing of beauty and it's fabulous I can I assume that you're probably going to be holding on to that one\nA day with my cold dead fingers [laughter] that's the only way you got something is going to happen here that one I gather that\nThat's very cool and I appreciate the story about how you move from the Nineteen forty five we each kind of find a comfort place there they could John appreciate that good stuff let's say yes we have room a Alex is on line three out of Texas hey Alex you're on gun talk\nTo her a about two years ago I bought a nine millimeter glock Seventeen mhm and the salesman sold mail box of a solid boy okay and\nUh [noise] uh oh\nAbout a year later I was a show in the boat to bust 'em and he said I should uh bought solid for\nUh the should've bar hollow ... or ... or ... points [noise]\nGo right through and say and keyboard and go and go through the next thing that they had ... going okay what's your favorite and what what what town\nTell me what the concern is because I'm trying to figure out what are you concerned about am I going through\n[noise] well uh I live in a what they call a townhouse it's really a duplex a barter for self defense hair and in a home and uh\nUh [noise]\nThe concern is that it would uh go through the walls\nOr if if a if a shot dead ... to go through him in the wall index\nOkay alright ... let me get you up to speed here because this is going to be pretty easy we've done a lot of testing shooting a handgun boats through multiple sheet rock walls [noise]\nFirst of all it's a full metal jacket solid point and what was really a poor choice for self defense or doesn't stop people well\nUh but you do need handle like that because she should be shooting five hundred thousand rounds of year at an absolute bare minimum you should be putting a thousand rounds of year through your self defense gun just so that you are really super familiar with\nHaving said that ... works much better or ... or expanding handled any type works better stopping people but and here comes the big butt\nAll hand gun am all will go through multiple walls\nThat is the simple truth of it all hand gun ammo will go through multiple walls sheet rock\nThe only thing Alex that I Know of that won't cause all rifle Emma will\nSlugs will ... I mean all hang on and when we tested would go through three walls up two pieces of sheet rock separated by insulation so we're going through one wall into a room to another well into a room and then out the next call wall\nThe only thing we have found that won't do that is a shotgun using bird shocked\nAnd they shot good using bird shot his amazingly effective at inside most room distances when you're inside less than ten yards bird shot is stunningly lethal and effective\nAnd yet ah the small shot seven half eat chaat will not go through a whole bunch of walls and when it does just doesn't have much energy so I don't know if that helps you is that that is that going to help you at all Alex\nOkay and you\nKnow I mean obviously you talk about a shotgun and I would say twenty gauges perfectly fine adequate for self defence staff inside and use regular bird shot because you know the ... if you know shotguns at all if you're ten feet\nFor less than something like that you're shooting a water shocked that sooner or maybe two inches across at most it's essentially functioning like a slug it takes people part\nA and yet when it hits the sheet rock all that little small shots going to spread out and if it goes through the wall at all it might pepper somebody on the other side but chances are it's not even going to do that if I were in your situation that would be my choice for self defense load look I appreciate the call\nIf people get upset about it and they worry about it and go okay well [noise]\nThe idea that\nSomebody would sell you full metal jacket Anna and made the cells I don't know maybe the cells and didn't know that was intended to be self defense Emma I don't know but look\nThis is up to you\nYou're the one who has to decide what's appropriate for what you're doing you have to figure out okay this is a self defense load is this the best thing and I'm I'm Sorry I don't want to denigrate people who work in gun stores but the sad reality is there are\nA lot of people who don't know what they're talking about who work behind the counter to gun stores and that is especially true\nWhen you get to some places where people buy em all like Wal Marts\nOr big box stores are places where you may be buying Hamel right next to the state department\nAnd the guy who is waiting on you in the gun section was working in the paint department last week but she heard 'cause somebody told him that this would be the right thing and now he's telling you because he's an expert because he's been working behind the gun counter for a week\n[noise]\nYour own research go look on our website gun talk dot com go look at our videos where we actually test this stuff you know it's like well how do you know that true well I Know it should because they've tested\nI shot a lot of ammo\nThrough a lot of walls to find out what goes through what does it twenty two years ago to a couple of walls um every hand gun I think every hand got above a caliber twenty two goes to all three walls certainly al rifles do a you know it doesn't this is interesting\nAnd it's weird all rifles except two to three\nWeirdly enough and they are Fifteen is not go through all those walls and it doesn't matter if you use the help or not\nI Know that there's counter intuitive 'cause you think well that's got to pinch right the wherever they use the full metal jacket two to three no it actually does it the boats jittery turn sideways you might go through to alls but we could I don't think we ever got one to go through a third wall she didn't have a two to three\nUh three awaits hunting rifles of course not a problem they'll go through all of those but that was interesting that the air Fifteen\nPeople so I don't I Would never use that for ... well actually you might want to if you were particularly what I Would do I would use ... bullets those very fast expanding bullets that essentially disintegrate on impact that would be affected at stopping attacker\nAnd they won't go through multiple walls and the recoil is low and it's easier to hit what you're aiming at with a rifle let's see oh yeah and you would have a lot of animal available should you need it because sometimes these home invasions involved\nOne thing I Would offer this is an Oscar some crazy to some people keep a pair of electronic ... next to your bed at night that we would get a call from the night you can put on your ear mobs you could turn them on\nThe apple pie sound you could hear what's going on with the other rooms here unfortunately you had to actually shoot inside of your house you maybe don't lose your here where you lose your here shooting and they are inside your house is going to death and so just just proved to solve this when we come back we'll talk about a\nFigure of our veterans center program that you may want to get involved with it's a good move towards that I've worked with for a while I'm number eight six six top gun I'm Tom Russia

to use to hold on and that takes care of the drop due to you and it basically is my question that's a long lead up to do you use do you carry it laser range fighter\nDo you ... basically here's my question that's a long lead up to do you use do you carry it laser range fighter later rained spiders are not new we've had him or I don't know Fifteen Years Twenty years maybe I mean I go way back when what was the\n... range master that crazy split image arranged by and uh we used to use Thirty years ago we tried to put the two images together um\nAnd we use those were decent but nothing like a laser range binder and then the ... first laser range ones were insanely expensive and big and heavy of course with ... and the micro technology are now you could have won ways\n... for ... for a good laser range binder kinda crazy so I guess the question is one do you carry you have a laser range find it for hunting\nAnd the real question here nor there really weren't always have you had an occasion to use it\nAnd if so how did you use it how far did you you\nLook at the deer elk wherever it was and were you able to make the shocked did you actually use the information from the laser range minor this is real world is is using the technology we have today ... out in the field actually hunting with it so just curious if you've used a laser range finder or if you carry one I Would

couple of those out we were talking about the ...\nI mean I guess the biggest news uh they're not brand new but I mean the one that just keeps keeps on ticking right now is the the three sixty five you know we're just we're we're we are actually\nRamping up by the thousands of units or making but we just we still can't keep up with the ... the demand and as you know at the end he asked you to be

forward\nA horrible hundred American veterans field this thing is how how old is now it's going to be getting close to seven to ten years I Would think\nWell actually where we just celebrated our tenth anniversary last year were in our limits here of operation wow we just completed San Antonio yesterday for our eleventh Daniel family day in San Antonio\nSo why do people like the thirty second elemental elevator pitch of what it is\nYeah uh honored American veterans of field ... the acronym that a lot of people know or has been we started out by taking four guys on the hunt a back in two thousand seven where there was no organization but those of us involved kind of said you know what we think there's something really special here there were six uh outdoor companies involved and uh\nWe just said let's do something on a larger scale we took 'em for more guys hunting and decided to form an organization ended or what we call a family day down in San Antonio at the national shooting complex down there and uh\nThat's migrated over to San Antonio police department training facility and then we do range days family days there we do um and at rock castle in Kentucky we do with him at the old Blackwater facility now called academy in North Carolina as well as the number of smaller events a shooting range\nIt's all over the country and about eight thousand five hundred [noise] disabled veterans later hum we've we've got an organization that we hope is making a difference in the lives of our our winter warriors and disabled vets\nAnd the other thing is that a lot of these have been you'll have some of the very top shooters or from your mix Michelle a level of of shooters who\nShow up to help on the issue with him uh you know it's just amazing and what I keep hearing his people and veterans you say you know\nI was afraid I Would never be able to shoot again I was afraid I Would never be able to go hunting again and this is just fabulous I can do this thing that I Love and that's the only one is about isn't it\nYeah it's it's that and and this the social aspect we have these family day just seeing the camaraderie that generated\nA with the folks that attend is is pretty amazing and I think that's why the Jerry ... and ... and\n... yesterday Daniel Horner was in San Antonio so we just signed a sick which is which was nice and uh yeah I mean a a a Cayman perform yesterday and and yeah it's a ... a performance or or or an exhibition with three disabled shooters or from our learn to shoot again program so\nYeah it's just been an absolutely

about forty minutes I've been to that one which is very ... of course it is a ... like it's not as big as the ... museum\nBut they really have a lot in there and they have some miniatures is I remember\nWhat was interesting to me was learning I mean I knew\nThe John Brennan was genius I just didn't know how do they get the guy was\nIf you were into Salt Lake Erie is absolutely worth the trip to go up to Ogden to see this museum it's not huge but it's very impressive\nUh it's interesting that after all these years some of his guns are still being used in military and of course people are still using obviously the Nineteen eleven\nSome would say one of his greatest pieces by that would certainly be my argument is that the nine eleven pistol ... forty five if you prefer is certainly one of his best\nAchievements of all time high law firm anyway just fun to shoot [laughter] by the way our number here eight six six talk down or just nominate Tom talk gun Alice with us out of Spokane, Washington on line three hello al sounds like a you hadn't it's been hot\nHello Mr Gresham or if they're taking my call it um I have a question calling up on last week's show you mentioned during a talk on home invasion that are you at spoken with someone and there was a cheap for free thing if you could put on or near your door\nThat little but prevent a a an airing a or a misguided a swat a no not great I'm\nOne of those deals it maybe it would who knows but it's it's just it's an option this was told to me by\nA former law enforcement\nSwat guy who evidently you run into this somewhere\nIt's I'm not trying to so let me just say right up front I have not tried this tape it sounds as though it would work that when I Believe him\nIt was simply this is weird is it sounds it now of course this as soon as you're not ... not glass because if it is then they'll break the glass and walk in through the whole [noise] um but if your front door or whatever it is is solid enough to keep you from walking through it\nYou take your Milwaukee drill\nAnd you drill a hole in your floor\nRight behind the door and then you dropping long latest screwdriver into the whole that's it\nThat's a great idea that that's just a good idea in general\nYou just you know as you think we think in in you want it so that the handle of the screwdrivers pretty much up against the door\nAnd he said you can't open the door now I don't know that that's true it's just one of those reports I've heard\nBut if you had like a home invasion folks trying to kick in your door a said you know the base they'll have to take the hinges off and break it from that side and open it from that side to get in so that well I don't know if that's true but it sure sounds as though it would work\nUh so I I pass along for whatever it's worth I mean that I have no knowledge of it no experience with it and it's offered with absolutely no guarantee you're warns that okay\nWell I appreciate that I'll give it a try and if anyone tries to kick in my door I'll\nGet your call there and what about you know [laughter] yeah let me know how it worked out for you to the gym I appreciate that [noise] All right let's see or let's go to line one Rick's with us out of pelican Rapids Minnesota we're talking about museums here and the other we've run across hey Ricky got one for us\nOut or firearms out in the western Nebraska and Maine\nIt's maybe hundreds of examples even black powder long guns primarily\nNow do you know what town in San\n... Shamsi age yeah C. H. A. B. R. O. N.\n[laughter] I've not heard of that now does it also incorporates a nice makes about for instance the Lewis and Clark expedition\nYeah there'll be some um and that sweater originally brought me there or have an interest in some of that kind of history right uh so we I found out about it and then we made our way it's a little bit off the beaten track but it's well worth a trip over there in fact my wife\nEven said I Would come back here and she has absolutely no interest in firearms but she was interested in the rest of the museum\nJust in this is ... I'm ... I'm looking it up now for people it's called the museum of for a train and she adds in Nebraska and on the Internet is for trade dot org for trade dot org ... that's cool um how long that taking I mean is like a big museum to take all day or is this like a half a day visit\nI Would say a happy day would cover it uh it's a it's a former trading post actually but it's just packed\nFull of very interesting material and they've got a lot of historical artifacts and great library you could just go there just for the library alone if you had an interest in that sort of thing\nNow are you in ... and they are black powder guns you were saying\nWell it's a [laughter] I've got black powder and I've got a more modern ... I've got a few a military repose I'm I like all of them I guess\nAnd there lies the problem right [laughter] I understand\nI get it if you can't narrow it down then you mean it means you have to have something from every different category\nYeah I got started doing some black out at work when one of my sons became interested in it was a way for us to spend time together and then I knew a few but my my most recent uh acquisition is actually a sake Pete three sixty five\nAnd I just love that little things so that more than one place\nYou are they okay so you're one of the lucky ones you you were able to get one because you know that they're in crazy to me and ... trying to find them everywhere now\nYeah I bought nine I actually read about it all getting close to a year ago that they were going to be introduced that SHOT Show in a but\nI started working on getting one last January and I was fortunate picked up\nA mid February I picked up one of the early ones ... and\nThe day when I went to get it they actually told me you know they have some a few problems with the early one or all of the new ones now are going to come with X ray sites and so forth so I ended up picking up you know the current run I guess you\nCould do\nI Am tickled I Am tickled with it it is it's an absolutely wonderful little side or\nYou know it's it's another in the\nList of options that we yeah which is great I mean I Love my three three sixty five I also times will carry a Nineteen eleven I also at times will carry um Springfield ...\nD E M three point eight and I honestly\nSometimes they'll see the honestly can't tell you why sometimes now the LCD I'll carry sometimes because I really need to go ...\nYour pocket in a holster a recluse host or which just looks like nothing you can't even tell you're wearing holster um but you know you got to have more than one you can't just have one because we have different situations right [laughter]\nExactly and that's and I think so I and I enjoyed that I Do anyway says my wife asked me if I'm done you know there's plenty more money more I could do so\nIt it's like that old potato chip commercial you know it says ah you know you keep buying and we'll keep making them go and you can't just one in this case we can't buy just one gun\nRight but if you get a chance and museum is worth trip to go see it\nWhile I appreciate that that's not not when I had heard of I got to look up which chadron Nebraska where that is what road is on how I Would find it but I Will do that and if if I just wanted to look up things for the call I really appreciate if I was going to look it up\nIt's for trade dot O. R. G. Wang three will's with us out in Spokane, Washington a we'll talk about the this initiative sixteen thirty nine which is a\nMonster horrendous thing that the voters in Washington Oregon they're going to face on the ballots how's it going there man\nOn the ballot out and get some support and\nI thought I Would\nJust sit here and and also to urge everyone that we're talking in our area\nWhich is Spokane area\nTook place and vote on sixteen thirty nine [noise] um it's it's very important time how much time I think about if you're coming to the store if this passes and you want to buy a to point you know\nWhy all the first ad scares how much of that as well and I would say that customer snatch\nGotta after twenty five dollars to that\nMan look we're we're and we are proud that we are out of time on this but yes if you're in Washington state anywhere in Washington state vote no on initiative sixteen thirty nine if you know anybody wants the state telling the vote no\nIf you're in Washington state tell all your neighbors to all your friends it's not a gun safety measures they're feeling it as a gun safety measures it's not it's a gun control gun then measure\nNo on sixteen thirty nine we'll be right back with more guns on\n... drawn in Tommy raising the standard of living doesn't matter and Rush Limbaugh increasing the number of people work raising wages bonuses being

today and discovered the smarter way to get unlimited metro buy T Mobile\nYeah it it is an interesting thing when people are saying well you know we need to read sure guns and said we're so are you do understand that you cannot require felons people who were prohibited from owning a gun to register their guns as your work\nSo that really the only people you want to require to register guns are law abiding people that tend to something and then they go well no that's not right and they were just telling you ... versus us Nineteen sixty eight\nIt says that itself from criminal nation to require someone who can own a gun to register a gun\nSo you can't require that so the bottom line on it is that gun registration laws apply all new to the lower body and then their heads go just spinning around like Linda Blair and The Exorcist\nYeah in a way to handle the people who say well I don't believe that just look at him you don't have the time to look it up just say do you know a lawyer or a cop and if they say yes I asked them\nAnd whenever you know a lot a lot of them\nWill not know about but it's really easy if you put in Haines versus us in any search engine on the Web\n... up and there it is and I think it is my second point or go for it uh\nI've been watching a lot of the uh debates on CSPAN you know from around the country there on our side is representing itself very very well and they're unabashedly saying\nNo I don't think this this is a little skiing you have a work and yes I Am a proud a supporter and a member of the n._r._a. mhm which is great but the funny thing is\nIs if you go on conservative TV or\nIt's really the way and taxes and money and you know the economy and immigration but then when things get real dicey oh yeah they wrap their arm around if like Carrie did and said we're your friends we\nRealize what you're saying I I agree I I just caught up you're sure what you're saying is that the conservative politicians are not there are only go to the ... okay what do you say\nIn the debates I've been watching on CSPAN guns are brought up regularly and the Republicans say you're a scheme won't work we need to do this and Oh yes I'm with the n._r._a. like a survey of TV and radio media act like the second amendment is even there\nIf there's not understand even Fox is not conservative\nFox almost ... boxes the middle seat on the on his way out on the left but there is no less a writes a media there's no right TV and a lot of the folks on Fox pretty far left and even the ones that are kind of sooner or not\nThey don't know anything about the secretary there knew anything about guns mean weren't Brian kill me give me a break the guy doesn't zip a these are basically a closet gun better so I have a\nWhole lot of good things to say about

Anthony Scaramucci we'll check in with us James O'Keefe his latest undercover video\nAlso is it possible Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren loses the Massachusetts Senate race as she really wants to just run for president will get into all of that the latest polls candidate tonight at nine we've got an unbelievable show tell you about that in a few minutes when we come back more of the best of the Sean Hannity show said too [noise]\n\nIf you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness if possible you could have a trio fair relation one of the leading causes of syrup might out before it's too late with cardio mobile the FDA clear to personal EKG device ingest Ninety nine dollars to order with a cardio dot com K.\nR.

A. dot com do cardio mobile pets in your pocket and so you can take an e Katie anytime anywhere right when you deal is done in\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible Jeff that uh the people of Massachusetts can wake up how you doing\nTo shine great to be a way they think hey this is the state where I'm and you know Scott Brown won when he ran again or of\nA ... state that was the model for the on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when I tell you something to Boston determines association has never endorsed a Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist ... she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House some twenty twenty\nI'm male focused on Massachusetts whatsoever\nOn this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nBecause you're a one percent or but she also herself deducted fifty thousand dollars worth of closed in one year to lower her own taxes That's Elizabeth Warren\nFifty thousand dollars in old clothes that's like the Clintons\nDeducting their use the underwear as a U.S that's all true they did it as a tax deduction by the way I don't think anybody wants their old underwear and they put a value to it\nYou know I've always said the Jeff that basically liberals are generous only with other people's money that we had the latest numbers from twenty sixteen come out and the bottom fifty percent\nOf taxpayers in this country don't pay three percent of the bill just three we have redistribution\nTen percent pays forty percent of the bill you know I mean so I mean I don't know what else the tax cuts the fact that they want their crumbs back they want to impeach Trump they want endless investigation they want to keep Obamacare disaster they want to eliminate eyes open borders I mean that's the whole thing and hate Trump that's it\nShe wants to get rid of ice in fact it was a Cambridge a warrant supporter of about a month ago there was arrested for putting a five hundred dollar bounty on ice officers I mean you know her rhetoric actually is dangerous in when Republicans wanting to fix health care make it actually affordable about a year ago a she was the one that said the\nRepublicans want blood money from the American people do this right after a congressman ... had been shot by that Bernie Sanders supporters so you know she really doesn't seem to be able to temper her rhetoric whatsoever and I think if you saw on Monday after the backlash of putting it all out\nAround the country including Democrats like David Axelrod even was critical\nOr she went on a twenty six I Believe tweet a rant about Donald Trump I mean she's just obsessed with Donald Trump and has no focus at whatsoever on Massachusetts and what's important here whereas a you know I've been a legislator here for eight years I've actually\nPut two billion dollars in tax cuts back in people's pockets and they know it and we've been campaigning pretty strongly I think that again you're going to be pleasantly surprised in November sex with what happens\nIs that I Hope so are you may not notice about my background but I live five years from Rhode Island ah in Warren Rhode Island not far from the ... borders with Massachusetts and you know I spent a lot of time this is by the way when it was the greatest NBA time in history with magic\nVersus Larry Bird and and parish McHale and DJ and Danny Ainge I mean it was probably one of the best teams in one of the best rivalries ever and sports\nI'm ... annual hall been up I've been to Boston to lots of beautiful city but I Will tell you that you know if the people of Massachusetts don't see through this I don't know what to tell them\nWhat looked Steve grow in the former quarterback probably around the time you were there is not endorse my race Curt Schilling endorsed had but most importantly\nUnderway rarely home already he needs to indoors you [laughter] and we need to get that had his locker Tom\nBrady is the most hated man except for the New England he's the most hated man in football number one because he's a phenomenal football player and they just don't like the fact that he wins that much and they don't like the fact that they as you know a pretty wide who used to be a model they just hate him for it\nRight [laughter] well look at you know ... a lot has changed since you've been here\nUnemployment is now at the lowest we've seen in New England in Massachusetts since Nineteen sixty nine that's that's where the whole country but Massachusetts is even lower it said three point five percent right now warring wants to repeal the tax cuts of two thousand Seventeen that have given our state\nMore money as far as new jobs wage increases our states collected over one point two billion dollars in unanticipated revenue because of that she called the crumbs just like a Nancy Pelosi and that she if she had her way would undo that and raise your taxes I think she said fifty percent would be the baseline and she's not sure she had Ninety percent might be too much when she was on\nAh MSNBC a few weeks ago Ninety percent maybe too much but at least fifty percent and then of course she wants to make it fully government run health care which as we know has a thirty two point six trillion dollar\nPrice tag attached to it and of course that puts a bureaucrat between you and your doctor or if you like government run health care that you love having a you know to wait for a hip replacement like Canadian Stewart dialysis like uh people\nAre so many Canadians come to the United states when they need heart surgery because they get better care that they're willing to pay for here that's why\nRight government has to ration health care if they take it over and by the way there is no incentive to drive down costs ones government becomes the guaranteed pay or just like student loans you know it was a bit sworn complains about the cost of college course she\nCharged three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to teach one course at Harvard uh but you know the fact is when government becomes the hair of the loans or whether it's a student defaults or not doesn't matter those colleges get their money and so they drive the cost of the year after year after year when government gets involved and takes the free market out of it the competitiveness then\nThat's when costs become completely out of control for us the average Americans\nWell I Wish you the best in this race and I hope our friends of Massachusetts in Boston and everywhere in between Lola pay attention to\nYou know the big lie of Elizabeth Warren and understand what a real true ambitions are here over her to become president you got to reelect er and Jeff deal is offering a better economic vision and better security for the people of Massachusetts and I wish you well in eraser\nThanks Sean if people want to get involved it's not too late deal for Senate dot com da da da da da da da da da\nDe Paulo election day just promised me won't turn out to be Ben Sasse of you win okay not at all\nNine four one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program right let's uh let's say Hi to loyal in San Diego or Coco radio what's up a loyal or how are you glad you called\nDo Sean huge fan of yours is Trump's order a thank you what's going on\nHey I gotta I gotta kind of an idea that might help us out on the uh the mid term or do you think about getting a Trump to address to the nation's televised address that way the fake news can't block anything showing all of his accomplishment on TV\nI Love I Love the idea I'll tell you what would happen is the media will uncover\nThe median now they're trying to blackout all of the Trump literally put a ban on all the Trump or rallies that are going on and by the way they do it to their own detriment because people want to watch them now I mean boxers run run a number of them we can't you know run every single one\nUh but uh I I Will tell you that that's pretty popular TV for a lot of people and there's a lot of fun and I think you know the fact that he's talking about positive results and that we're better off than we were two years ago it's a pretty good message why would the media want that when they're in the pockets of people that the slant solidly Democrats solidly socialist left\nAbsolutely totally agree with you I think I think that would I take him doing that would be would bring people out of the woodwork so now 'cause people people would watch it if you do to address to the nation just an idea\nWow I think it's a good one I like it and maybe should just do it on cable because you know everyone forgets out this was the most surprised remember Linda when we're battling in that weirdo pervert late night host what's his name Jimmy Kimmel\nAnd I've heard of Howard Stern talking about it I Know that he's friends with Jimmy Kimmel and\nWhy is he battling Hannity Hannity's on cable you know Jimmy is on a network ... vanity probably wants to be on a network that I've always known stern is a genius when it comes to media I ... I don't care that he's friends with Jimmy Kimmel one bit and I don't care that he's defending his friend at all but the fact is is that those days are big\nRatings on on these networks over it's done\nAny big news night when there is news that's covered by the big three networks we are show Hannity beats all of them you know the premier of whatever that big show is that we beat that night\nI'm a you know I don't even know these shows anymore I don't even watch these stupid shows it was a reality show that I think it was law and order oh yeah right now\nAnd the point is that his ... his ratings are less than half of what I get every night lessening Antarctica winning though I'm not sick of winning at all and I'm very thankful to the audience that that they keep me I'm a working fulltime basis but I'm I'm doing my best because I Want this country to succeed more I just feel it no more I Want to win so bad\nNumber one I Want to shock the world again\nThere were two I Want the success that continue I'm that person I'm the forgotten man and woman that's my whole life I didn't grow up with any silver spoon in my mouth I worked since I was twelve eight years old delivering papers twelve years old washing dishes I you know all the people now that are getting jobs and new careers and\nWe gave the numbers out yesterday we have the the highest number of ... jobs ever in history and compared to the unemployment rate we have a million more jobs available than we do have people that are on unemployment it is a fantastic opportunity for people to\nYou know change jobs change careers get more money get better benefits have a greater career trajectory and their life", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Billings", "day": "21"}
