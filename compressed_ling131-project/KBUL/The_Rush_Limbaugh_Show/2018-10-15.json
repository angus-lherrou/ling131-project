college like Mohammed he's the one that was responsible for the death of Danny Pearl the wall street reporter he slit his throat in front of a camera\nI don't know what type of man it takes to cut the throat of somebody in front of you like that but I can tell you this is an individual probably than you were rich rear end up having waterboarding his base he never believe for a second year we're going to kill\nAnd of course in the eyes of the left we want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be westerners\nSocialists they think still\nFunctioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we shouldn't be forthcoming\nAnd tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say\nWhat you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises that I don't know how big of a scoring points that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on it it will review says he's going to do something he's going to\nDo or die trying we don't have a wall yet but not for lack of trying and we don't have the full repeal of Obamacare yet but not for lack of trying\nNow the Democrats are often running here on a couple of 'em read burst issues I don't know if you've noticed it or not but all of\nSudden Trump wants to once again take away\nThe orange from people with pre existing conditions where did this come from\nOut of thin air it came out of thin air there's no way Trump wants to do this there's no Republican the ones that says the reason the Republicans ... going for a full repeal of Obamacare is pre existing conditions\nWhich you get down to brass tacks preexisting conditions being coverage is not even insurance there's no way you can get insurance if your house catches fire and then go buy insurance nobody's gonna sell you insurance wants to houses on fire or after it's been robbed\nSo we're not even talking about insurance but we are\nAs far as the general public is concerned so I don't know where all of a sudden Donald Trump and every Republican candidate for the house and the Senate wants to take away health insurance or preexisting conditions\nWhen did this happen no Republicans out there saying that\nIt's sort of like when Joe ... a ... a George Stephanopoulos was interviewing um ah well questioning Mitt Romney in a debate\nAnd he asked and you think that states should be able to ban contraception Romney look the rest of what\nNobody is talking about that stuff and I I don't care for that he's talking about one on one you think should states I'm a right to ban contraception Ravi looks around I guess what\nWe're not talking about ... George I don't think anybody I don't think anybody wouldn't even think of this I don't know why are you asking me I just want an answer quit stalling you states will eventually Romney answered it\nAnd it didn't matter what the answer was it allowed the media Romney discusses states banning contraception [laughter] that's all it took and the Republican war on women\nWas reborn and that's what this pre existing condition garbage let me see what the real issue with\nThe real issue that is raising its head out there that the Democrats don't want to talk about is immigration illegal immigration that remains\nThe issue that color lessons\n... Republican voters\nNo matter what other issues they have that is the issue it has been poll driven and tested\nIn terms of being a very helpful to Republicans and of course the Democrats don't want to talk about it after ... they're trying to gin up all this stuff about pre existing conditions Leslie stall here is trying to do the same thing by suggesting that\nTrump is hostile to our good friends in Europe it just sounds so hostile why would you want to sound so hostile it's like when she was talking to Jose Jose writer why would you give them in short that's the stuff they give cancer patients so mean that's not who we are so you're so hostile and Trump's uh what is hostile\nThe way they treat us is what's hostile we're not hostile she says yeah but you can't deal with it without he says we have been the stupid country for so many years\nAnd then she finally she willing to get rid of the western alliance no I like NATO NATO's fine but you know what we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO you know what else they said ms interview\nSecretary of defense Mattis came up Trump's that I Know more about NATO the Madison does [noise] [laughter] [noise] I don't work man is as far as the deep state is concerned is NATO any\nArmy general wouldn't be NATO So Trump just [noise] as Vanity Fair magazine says and it's a surprising admission\nSixty minutes was out

of media blitz seeing on the part of it administrators shouldn't it's already seen its head and get plenty of free promotion during rallies broadcast on cable news\nAnyway they go on to crash Leslie stall and trash CBS for letting Trump\nWalk all over them to just continue to dominate\nWith relentless rhetoric CBS let Trump get away with the same kind of persona and the same kind of stuff that he says\nAs he says\nAt his rallies they say Leslie stall interview with Trump was an undeniable get he'd been scarce on mainstream media since around that time he appeared on tape what Lester Holt at NBC and indicated he'd\nFired call me in part due to the Russia investigation but the interview seemed governed by two motives both of which played in the hands of a media savvy president\nWho's reviews of the play by typical rules of engagement has been at the center of his rise\nYou know you people in the meeting a sale you want he's been the most media accessible president you've ever had this guy will stop and talk to your wherever your gathered if he's on the way somewhere and sees you he stops in talks to you and he tells you exactly what he thinks\nIt's not his fault if you can't keep up with him it's not his fault if you can't play your usual journalist games and dominate him and get away with re characterizing what he says looks like or thinks\nVanity Fair assisted living is

telling you that you feed into me much differently on the subject\nI disagree but I don't want to have that fight with your hey I'd like to fight with all the time I'm president and you are not in the

he was not being given even a modicum amount of respect similar\nTo what other presidents have got if he's right about that these people despise him may still despise him and they're always going to simply because they can't get rid of him\nThey've thrown everything that they know\nThat Donald Trump they have tried every maneuver every strip the jury every tactic they have tried everything that has always work getting rid of Republicans\nAnd then you start talking to some continent than some people really get confused you jumping from from India or over to sub Saharan Africa is below the

not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this because they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything ... distract\nFrom the mid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow a away\nAnd so there are some people who are on the left are claiming that she selfish and trying to haul good what is a lot of light being shined on politics right now because of the because the elections I I think a lot of it is rooted in they have Trump either as many of them do\nAnd they live and breathe to expose Trump for whatever they think he has to the point that people have Anthony I'm Glad you waited a Scott very much thanks so much John in Tacoma, Washington your next I'm Glad you waited too high\nOh thank you and make it through those from under the shadow of mount Rainier sir\nI appreciate um thank you\nWrote them and just wanted to uh talk about the the movie ... now I heard you on your Thursday or friday show last week you were you were speaking about that movie so I decided to go check it out\nThat would be friday and it was me yes yes yes\nI got a moment after work I raced over to the theater I I I watched it over there but um [noise] I wanted to I I I just want to portray how ... and it was is that we're very very powerful movie and to illustrate that I just want to share the experience of what happened after the movie\nI'm normally when you go to a movie theater you watch a movie and then that the credit start rolling in the music\nYep and filing out of the theater and they're talking to each other and stuff but this did not happen at the end of the movie guys now after the after the movie was over the the credits began to roll and the music played and and after after a while all all the credit is finished and the music stopped and everybody was still seated\nThey're smoking I Need to ask you this because there's one thing about this I'm I'm I made a calculation when I was talking about those on friday to not mentioned something about this movie because I I did not want to frighten people or deter them from going to see it\nGo we've got what but but what I'm not asking you to identify that but what if anything surprise you that you didn't know or just just surprised you period even if you think you didn't know what about the movie what did you learn you didn't know\n[noise] [noise] well I I didn't know about who Mr guys now was um I I was not familiar with the case or anything like that um but that wasn't that wasn't really the the the powerful peace about it but I guess the\nThe\nWhat what made it what made everybody if they were all feeling like me and all sitting down and not moving after the movie was over [noise] was it was it was about an abortion doctor yes but let's say this was a movie about a murder trial\nAnd but during the murder trial the um there there were two there were there were two things that were portrayed in one was just the bar verity of what happens in those clinics but even more than that\nWhat was that the white level what was the ... when that happened in the clinics\nOh the bar verity of what happens in an abortion clinic when\nNo no and God's nails in God's nails clinic what happened what was the\nOh that uh that he was he was allowing babies to be born and then after they were born then he would kill\nExactly that is the vast majority this is why he's called the biggest serial killer in American history God's now killed most of the babies after they were born alive\nAnd he did it by snooping there spinal cords was scissors now I didn't save is on friday\nI didn't say this on friday about gods now about what he did because I didn't want to frighten people away\nIt's not\nAs you I had to struggle to get this out of you so it's not something that jumps out at you when you watch the way he's right it is about primarily a trial\nI made the point of saying that Nick Searcy who's the director lets the story tell itself there aren't any exaggerating computer generated graphics there there's not a lot of\nA special effect a\nReal or computer generated in order to shock because of the story tells itself the numbers\nOf children born alive killed by this man\nIs stunning and shocking then you realize that the mainstream media never even covered the trial much less money had done they've always done their best to suppress it it was nearly impossible to get this movie made precisely because of what it revealed\nHollywood doesn't want this movie made the actors in this movie were risking their future careers by taking roles people like Nick Searcy who um a is a ... and across the board actor he can take the lead they can take a supporting role he can take a [noise]\nWhatever you want he chose to direct this movie and all of these people in one way\nSomething major by tackling ... and doing it they couldn't find funding people that run the Gulf funding pages would not allow any kind of public funding for the production costs a Facebook Twitter I don't know specifically which one that they wouldn't allow any\nWith Facebook would not allow any kind of a a promotion reference or fundraising for this at all is actually kind of a lot of let's say amazing or miraculous buddy if it was it was a a lot of hard work at a lot of time\nTo get this movie made but\nAnd it was a real challenge for them but how how difficult\nIs it to focus on the fact that this abortion missed did his murderous work outside the home he did his share of of uh of abortions in the ... but\nThe numbers of born alive that this man murdered it's just stunning everybody thinks late term abortion is bad and by the way this kind of abortion\nAnd it's called an abortion if you if it's got a term I'm having a mental block and with the term of this is but in Illinois and so forth when when the procedure came up with a bill was sponsored to stop this I think it was but rock Obama who refused to support it\nThe left will not support any limits whatsoever on whatever is called\nAn abortion and\nThe the the the the the thing that left just tried to do in countering this movie is to say well\nWell if you want more God's know then you go and overturn roe versus Wade they tried to say guys now was doing what he was doing\nBecause women had no other choice they couldn't go anywhere and again that's a flat out lie by the way ... clinic if you will none of the none of the year was sterilized people that were getting\nSick and and infected with it just it was a pig stops in Philadelphia\nBut I did lose focus on that on purpose because I didn't want the ... because you don't\nSee it that's my point they don't graphically\nTried to make their point they focus on a murder trial but good going out there John I'm sure he was he was getting sweating I'm nervous out there what does Russia want to hear what it would have been ain't got as not that I wanted to hear anything but that is what I think most people will learn that they didn't know if they go\nTo endure the mainstream American media just gold rush ... be men\nWere they were listening to Rush Limbaugh
