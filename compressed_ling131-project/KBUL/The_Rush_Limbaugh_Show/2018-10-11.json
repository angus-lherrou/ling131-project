give us a date range you know I'm not asking your age and it's very Cincinnati [laughter] well\nWe were we were young adults in the nineties file I'm In my mid forties\nOkay All right fine so your ... your next step up from number one\nYes and my entire adult working life has been in an economy in decline and not only have you with it's been a real pleasure you've I've listened to you for many years but\nOnly have you which has been a real pleasure you've I've listened to you for many years\nBut Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have been in the public eye and in particular in in my generation my whole life\nShe you know I remember Hillary as first lady and working on health care and and to see this attack from the last um concerning Donald Trump and his finances and as someone who is the in my country get poorer we\nDon't have any money that people who do have any I'm ready to play the where did you get your money from game especially concerning our Senate and Congress I I

the and and companies were leaving leaving leaving leaving not coming back\nAnd the like you say and I could not agree with you more the law has nothing to run on but for my generation to generation who won't have Social Security is gonna bomb out we're broke were ten trillion dollars and that's when I hear a leftist talking about\nUh all of these things that they want to pay for you know Medicare for all it's a it's a lovely idea but we don't have any\nMoney right there isn't any\nChristina you're making a really important point that I don't want to gloss over I Want to return back\nTo the city of primary\nPoint you made that you are in your mid forties I'm for the first time in your life your living through a growing\nPositive economy that prior to now your entire life has been lived in a either a flat line or a shrinking economy yes\nHard and you know let's not forget something for most of that time in the last\nEight years prior to Trump people like you were also told that this was as good as it going to get that you had to work and acknowledge that there was a new normal now\nAnd that America's great days of the past may not have been totally legitimate and ended this this was more than like the way it's going to be now so you were also told not only where you want to flat line economy you were told don't have any lofty expectations here right\n... exactly how how let's jump forward to this growing autonomy my next question are you actually there's no wrong answer here it's not a trick\nAre you actually aware of the growing economy because you're living it and experiencing it are only are you aware of it because you see economic numbers reported that say it's good\nI I'm In a small economy in Asheville North Carolina that is its own separate\nEconomy so I'm aware of it via\nInformation but I can I can feel it I can sense that I can I'm I Know that is true that is that if I mean it's hard to build your life\nIf you if you're coming if you're coming from nothing and don't have anything and you're trying to build\nTo build your life\nIf you if you're coming if you're coming from nothing and don't have anything and you're trying to build a life and and\nI literally feel like the finances in America there's been a stranglehold on it as a depletion of it\nI mean I'm old enough to remember sitting around the table and my parents say you have to finish your dinner there's children starving in China when I was growing up everyone knew that China was a core poor poor poor place\nAnd he has done in a span and just the you know Twenty years it's boomed am I happy for the for the people of China absolutely we don't want to see anyone in the world struggling and and and not have what they need to survive but on the other side of it\nIt's because of poor management and not in our government that has really all of this money out of our country and and people here are suffering and you've talked about the opioid epidemic they can and and all of these you know these the fruit the fruits of having no work\nWhich he used to be just standard knowledge you knew that if there was a population of people that didn't have work they were going to have other problems\nExactly right but the point is you're you're you're living economy you're you're not just saying and thinking it's good because people are telling you you're actually experiencing it\nWell I Am experiencing it and I feel blessed and I feel grateful to the president because you know people want to act like oh well he was just given money well lots of people win money on lottery and it's gone a year later\nOh hates real skill whoa that's a whole nother you're absolutely right that is a whole\nOther subject watery lottery winners of what becomes of um\n[noise] you're absolutely right I'm just I'm Glad to hear you say you're living it you're experiencing it when it's real did you that it's not just the results of me or people like me telling you that things are good that matters\nJust one thing my mom also told me Christine they eat everything on my plate because there were people starving\nIn China but I wasn't smart enough I was a smart alec and I turned I tried to use logic\nOn every example of parental discipline I could\nSo when my mom said that to me after a number of times and I got tired of hearing I said mom you're telling me that if I eat everything on my plate a bunch of people in China arguably rubbing their stomachs and say boy it feels good to be full\nAnd she called me a smart alec and told me the stops asking her but she
