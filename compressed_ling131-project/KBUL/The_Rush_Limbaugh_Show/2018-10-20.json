business for so long that if they come off of them even a bit that causes a crisis of confidence among the Democrat voting base they can't do that but folks I'm telling you I'm I'm maybe I'm even asking for your input here\nVery briefly again starting in two thousand ten rock Obama being done the destruction of the Democratic party as an electoral apparatus made last\nTwelve hundred seats between two thousand ten and two thousand sixteen they continue to lose seats in the two thousand sixteen race which Trump one which they thought was a walk landslide win for them\nThe last elections that approach what's coming up where the two thousand fourteen midterms Obama won\nWell even when he was on the ballot or the the um the midterms in in that year\nWe're not the grand sweep for Obama that they were ... they were said to be Obama presided over the systematic loss of seats by the Democratic party in two thousand sixteen comes along and Trump wins the presidency\nAnd the Democrats have the least amount of electoral power in Washington since the Nineteen twenties\nAnd from that we're supposed to believe that Donald Trump alone\nHas provided the energy and the imposition of ... and the Democrats the comeback\nShow up and re take everything they lost well the problem with that is\nThe Democrats lost because Republicans won the Republican voters showed up in droves in every one of those men terms and the presidential race two thousand twelve in two thousand twelve presidential race Democrats continue to lose seats even though Obama won his reelection nobody else the Democratic party\nThat much worse bragging about\nOf the Republicans came alive first it was\nStanding to energize but then it was Lois Lerner the IRS at all the other scandals that came along when

except they didn't have the guts to vote against them because of the racial component development twelve so now we're supposed to believe\nThat that trend that sees the Democrats holding the fewest number of electoral seats they remember half since two thousand to the Nineteen twenties\nHas suddenly overwhelmingly changed simply because there's so much hatred for Donald Trump\nAnd a hatred for who Trump visits hatred for his tweets it's hatred for his personality it's hatred for his manners or lack there of hatred for the way he behaved it's hatred for each hairstyle it's hatred because

forecast like this I mean pretty unusual to predict the likelihood of a split is unusual were also I always says what are in the eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighty twenty zone\nIn both places that makes me nervous and remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means that like there's a forty percent chance that one of those two predictions will be wrong so you know not quite fifty fifty but we caught up in Utah supports forty percent or graders almost to toss that you'll have one of these forecasts\nAnd I might just for you let me translate this\nThis guy is nervous as he can be he's sweating bullets there's a fifty fifty chance that he's wrong he's letting he's never seen a split like this he's talking about Democrats winning the house Republicans winning the Senate he's never seen anything like that he and I don't know how to do this\nAnd we consider it a toss up if it's forty percent one way or the other but I guess he's kind of I guess he hasn't go slightest idea what's going to happen this election and he's very nervous over the fact that he can't figure out he can analyze he doesn't have the slightest idea what's\nGoing to happen here now he didn't want to come out and say it that way\nYou need to have the talent and the expertise to experience that I have to translate these clowns when they start

forecast like that's pretty unusual\n... a lot of things wrong usual this time aren't they need to be unusual since two thousand sixteen hasn't it\nTo predict this likelihood of a split as unusual we um you know I always say uh when we're in the eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighty twenties on in both places that makes me nervous\nMeaning eighty twenty Republicans keep the Senate eighty twenty Democrats when the house\nAnd makes me nervous eighty twenty that's as close to a lot of it makes me nervous\nWe're now in the eighty twenties on on both sides of this remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate really\nThere's no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means that like there's a forty percent chance that one of those two

[noise]\nUncertainty over a blue wave NBC News fine Democrat and GOP voter registrations at the same level as past election cycles\nA but but but but but but but but but\nThe Democrats had Michelle my bell out there during all do a whole big voter registration drive out there\nThe Democrats have been registering voters in prison they've been registering voters with a DMV they've been registering voters at the at the at the at the medical marijuana places they've been registering voters everywhere how in the world is it possible that democratic voter registration levels at the same as past cycles\nThe Democrats have been telling us that there's so much energy\nThere is so much excitement there so much motivation there's so much just ... nothing can hold them back and yet and yet the generic ballot once again is showing that\nThis massive Democrat blue wave is not as big as once thought now NBC is is is very very worried they're worried that something\nThat's not a blue wave may be shaping up here that's what this headline is certainly over a blue wave NBC News lines Democrat and GOP voter registration at the same level\nAs past cycles comparing registration activity for twenty fourteen to twenty sixteen with activity from twenty sixteen ... current helps put these numbers in that context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen include\nI complete picture of registration in front of those years\nWhereas twenty Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time what that's all you need I mean if you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to be registered with time to vote so it's that seems like a little hope will we don't have a pool database of numbers for two thousand they say well you've got enough to know\nSo how can this be helping voter registration if Democrats are supposed to be smoking us\nIn voter registration because there's so much more interest there so much hatred for Trump there's so many people that want to fix that mistake than a column from the Washington Post\nBy Megan McCarthy dull trying to help the Democrats are she believes are morally superior and smarter than Republicans headline will the blue wave collapse before it reaches the shore what may give them a card all in this op ed in the Washington Post is doing is trying to help Democrats\nIs saying that the Kavanaugh hearings backfired on the Democrats because it alienated man and now she's warning the Democrats\nI Can't see this happening but what if there is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein or whoever\nAnd somebody\nLike Trump says well okay All right if you want to see it go ahead and they release it\nAnd there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks in one of the week they're sixteen never Trump anti Trump paid mongers on Mueller's team if they had the garden yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nIf mother doesn't have any of that than there is no way they want this released before the midterms that's why\nThey're linking ... or has it ready they're going to try to take advantage of what they can make people think the report says I remember they have two years no more than that not two and a half years it's Danny reporting that Trump and Russia colluded so\nIn their minds they're probably thinking a sizable number of American voters believe\nThe Trump Russia collusion happens so Mueller's report is Randy is to be released soon that create the impression that it's only a matter of time now before Trump is tied to the Russians were collusion and use that way to impact\nVoting in turn out prior to the mid term Scott I'm just going to tell ya if this report doesn't advance this narrative that Trump cheated in ... election they're not going to want this up before the midterms you man gyms are let down that would\nYou don't know how many\nOf your base common ordinary everyday democratic voters literally believe that Trump won this election by cheating with Russia you'd be done and that the number of your fellow Democrats citizens in New York\nAnd Los Angeles and San Francisco in Chicago who believe it like gospel despite all realm of commonsense despite every\nBit of knowledge we have that there is no evidence for just like how many of them believe ball the Ford\nTheir politics requires that they believe\nIt's mandates they believe that if they are told before the midterms that the mall or report doesn't have this evidence and will not leave the President Trump being indicted on that basis what does that do to turn out\n\nNow don't misunderstand I think Mueller's report whatever it is released is going to really be targeted at\nTrump as an incompetent as a boob who are in getting injured the United states electoral system with his hires and with some of the people on the staff like Carter Page I think they're going to fire both barrels at Trump as any incompetent\nWho nearly brought the world to nuclear Armageddon\nBecause of his incompetence and stupidity but I
