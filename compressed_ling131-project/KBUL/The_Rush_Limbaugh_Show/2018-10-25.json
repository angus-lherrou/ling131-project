with us and sorry it's great to have you back with us here Oh thank\nYou very much I'm with my husband and I were talking last night and we came up with some really good common sense points to make that kind of illustrate why we think these packages weren't actually males um it he's their commonsense questions and the first one\nTo me is how likely is it that someone could mail multiple packages to multiple places all over the country\nAnd have them show up miraculously at the same time and across the valley yeah and if I say I possibly the exact same time that that's not that's not common sense I mean I can see how that could\nWork there were just sick of the deniro package didn't arrive until late yesterday or maybe this morning the or George Soros package arrived the\nDay before truth CNN got their little Clinton was so forth\nI there was a ... the whole group of us in that they have like four or five of them shows up all of that same thought well how do you know it was a priority mail\nIt couldn't have been I mean if you looked at the packages anyway obviously that first caller mentioned what I was going to one of the Congress adults can make the fact that there wasn't enough postage on at the post office he even accept it um the other thing is these these were these were oversized packages\nSo you're obviously not taking ... and paying for them you know having them weight and paid in profits properly\nUm your you have to stick the post office box right off the boxes don't even have enough room to slip an oversized into\nThat doesn't make any sense to me and and I know some of these showed up at distribution centers that makes sense I I I get I get that but some of them actually did show up at the residents so you're going to think that\nOkay what what are you suggesting that what are you suggesting here but\nThat everybody was scratching their heads and wondering what was so remarkable about it a Steve I appreciate ... as I say I'll take it out but I have a chance to Jerry in Springfield, Massachusetts your next hello sir\nHi rush hour radio I'm good good\nGood I just wanted to go up on your point about America are giving more than any other nation I think what you were talking about was the government itself but individual also give more than any other nation and the point is is that\nI have the choice when I get to charity I give it to I don't have the right how my neighbor who they should give it to and that's actually what the government's doing very telling on who they're going to basically what they got from our tax dollars they don't give us a choice\nAnd that's my point\nIt's a good point too it's a classic illustration his reacting to the soundbites we play the John Case there was a ringing his hands in guilt over the fact of caravans coming and it's just for the grace of God that we're not in it\nAnd it because we're not in it but could be in it except by the grace of God we've got to stop building walls 'cause God doesn't want that and we've got to realize that that were just playing lucky it's kinda like written Richard Gephardt out winners of lights lottery\nYou know we were just minding our own business one day and then we got conceived in a woman in America and we've got more into America and and man that's that's so much luck that that we shouldn't feel weren't anything special or so and the fact that we weren't conceived in warms down in Nicaragua in Guatemala means that\nWe all we really ... when we gotta\nWe gotta learn to walk in the shoes of others and that's the wrong way to look at it with nobody has any trouble imagining\nWhat it's like to be poor that's why so many people strive not to be governor it isn't hard to imagine we don't have a lot of people in fact uh most people in this country go up and down in terms of annual income\nOr people that are in a lot of money in lose it all there are people that are in an average amount of money all their lives\nAnd you will income or people that are in a lot of money and lose it all there are people that are in an average amount of money all their lives and that's it but basically people in this country no poverty\nIf they've never if they've never been in it they certainly don't want to be they know enough to know not to be and that's the great thing about America if you don't want to be there are ways to avoid being in poverty poverty in this country by the way it was a relative thing\nCompared to poverty around the world United States poverty is not really poverty I got in trouble Everytime I point that out but it happens to be true\nA statistic lay financially however you want to look at it but but the way to look at these disparities is not to simply say oh oh that could be me and then the run around and feeling guilty about it\nAh\nThe way to deal with this is not to run around constantly imagining well you know if there's one\nAccident and I could have been in that era man and then having that impact the way you\nDeal with it that doesn't help anybody it's not a ... but it does make you look like you have lots of compassion in lots of care but that's a great thing about liberalism it never solves anything\n[noise] liberalism as a\nGutless choice because she had never have to solve anything all you have to do is talk about how much you care\nAnd all you have to do is tell people how much pain you are seeing and how it makes you so uncomfortable to someone fear look at the suffering and the starvation its citizens\nAnd you are automatically credited as a person with great compassion you haven't solved anything all you've done to say that you recognize and you're telling everybody else they've got to do something about it\nAnd that's liberalism solutions are\nWhere the answer is and solutions to these problems are exactly why they have been happening in the United states the past two years\nSolutions\nBy the way before we go to the break I just want
