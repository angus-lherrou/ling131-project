yesterday here is stepping up\nAcross social media hate speech in anti Semitism are rampant and on the rise all against the backdrop of the ugliest political climate in modern times at the center and unapologetically incendiary president on travelling by traditional norms of civility\nTraditional norms of civility they do not a Trump is a reactionary he's reacting to the white they treat him\nYeah there may be\nBlamed to go around on both sides here but for the media just totally claim they've got nothing to do with this is absurd now here's Matthew doubt this guy formally and George W.\nBush Republican now he's gone off to the dark side on ABC\nI Would put specific responsibility on the president that he has an obligation to try to read us up much of this tribalism and I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years is helpful Methodist\nOh yes he says oh Trump's fault all of this is Trump spoiled\nAnd the media wants to be exempted from any impact ... they say damn I don't want to think they influence opinion and shape the outcome of elections but they don't want to be held any kind of responsible for what people do\nThe same time that seems in Congress to me here when they when they get called out\nOn this they deny it this is a montage Tom ... search who a former national security adviser and Stephanopoulos and Mary Jordan of the Washington\nPost I Want them to be calm but I don't think that the American viewers are looking at President Trump is murder\nI don't want to add up against a lot of the reason I was a murder\nYou know here's what I said ... every day I think yeah he is responsible\nFor fomenting using rhetoric that causes people to feel like that is normal life\nAnd I had a lady walk up to me and say did your parents pay you to be here and I said no I Want to be here because I'm I Want to help my country get better and tell people who to vote for and I'm just try to make California which is not good the better\nThese were adults gonna ask you that question\nYes sir they were um it was she might have been in her forties fifties maybe she asked oh so your parents are paying you to be here I sound\nLike it was kind of rude I mean here you are your do you look sixteen or do you look a little older than that\nWell I'm Fifteen I I don't know I mean I look like a teenager\nOkay so there aren't buying as soon as a teenager there and they still feel the need to insult you mildly a mirror world but I'm sure there was no you couldn't possibly have a mind of your own if you were doing what you were doing\nYes and I'm sure she wanted to say you're brainwashed but she probably didn't have the guts to go see that\nWell I'm curious about something I'm very flattered a vibe to no end flattered here that that you would want to be something super and exceptional having listen to this program why journalism\n[noise] ah well I like journalism and I want is a way maybe one day have my own organization for military families who have had servicemen killed in action but a journalism because [noise]\nI just I Want to get my voice out there and change because I don't like the way I mean Trump is making America great you know I Believe that\nBut what about if someone gets in office after him and then I go in there Twenty years later it's maybe going to be a huge mess because of the way America's millennials are going like my sister\nAnd I just want to be one of those who gets up there and says\nI'm done with this I Want to change it for\nGood for you um there are a lot of people a lot of parents who have kids your age and younger who are really scared about the future but concrete it's always been the case I my whole life I have heard people say throughout my life but they don't want to have kids who would dare\nThat's ... I remember hearing that when I was Fifteen myself so it's nothing really really knew that I'm sensing today when people say there is a people who have kids not so much donors thinking about it people who have kids are really really worried about their futures because of the way the left\nHas become more radical and more anti the general concepts of America it's scaring people what kind the country or their kids\nGoing to grow into I mean there's always going to be an American but what's it going to be are they going to be free\nAre they gonna have to conform to some of this extreme wacko left them in order to not be hassled build up their lives there's some genuine fear about is if you want to tackle that more power to you and journalism needs people like you in it\nWell and I don't think that's like what you're saying I don't want my kids are my younger sister to grow up in America where\nThere's just a bunch of people that don't even belong in this country hurting and citizens going around trying to do that stuff too I don't want to grow up in a country where you can't even have a gun to protect yourself or to last for a country where veterans are behind illegals\nI mean I just I that's the one that makes me so angry as the\nWhy do you think that's happening why do you think so much attention as being lavish son of\nThe people you referred to as illegals coming here who are not citizens but yet\nBeing uh granted access to so many things given so much why do you think is happening [noise]\nAh well there's a lot of reasons for one thing Obama made at all just come our way and you know um but I think just because they think they see what we're going to go there and nobody's gonna stop us you know well maybe the military is going to stop this\nTitle no I understand why there ... why do you think there is so much a tolerance for it why do you think so many people are wanting them here and and and want to do nothing to stop them from from getting him why do you think there's so much tolerance for the illegal fallout aspect of this\nI don't know a lot of people who are voting they don't know anything about why\nI don't know where to stop why would they ah I don't know why the people are wanting to give away their money to them five I think that they're saying oh well poor people you know their country's war stricken\nWell you know America has to help their people to they can't just give away money to these illegals coming in and they're like well that they may bring jobs here\nHow are they bringing jobs here when they're going to go work at I mean they're going to go work in agriculture agriculture or something 'cause I Know there's a lot of illegals I live in California and there's a lot around where I live but\nI don't know the answer is that they worked cheap number one for the people that want the river cheap labor cheap labor is the answer the other side of it\nAre you you're talking about\nThe people that don't want to give them the money the people who are behind these policies are damn well making sure that you and others are going to give your money they're not going to be giving bears but the\nAnswer the answer to the question is\nBecause the left wants\nPower and power to them is more and more people in capable of self reliance\nMore and more people in capable of helping themselves and the best most concentrated group of people fit that bill are a bunch of poor you'll educated or uneducated people don't even speak the language flooding the sun\nThey're human beings we're a compassionate country they have to be fed they have to be taken care of the Democrats want the credit for doing all that they want to get these people registered to vote as quickly as they can they looking at him purely and simply as voters it's not about compassion and it's not about giving them a good life\nIt's not about any of the things that they want you to think it is it strictly about creating let me put it this way\nRight away the Democratic party and do not doubt me on this I knew when you do do research or journalism career you will find that this is the case the Democratic party needs a permanent underclass\nOf uneducated or poorly educated people who are not capable of economic sulfur live\nBecause they can't speak the language\nBecause they don't have any education those are prime democratic voters\nThose are the exact kinds of people to Democrats want to build a majority around because they will be for ever grateful I eat dependence on Democrats and will constantly be voting for Democrats no matter what else happens that's\nThat's the reason behind it nobody will ever own up to it nobody will ever admit it\nBut what they are really is just on a documented Democrats it's not that they're undocumented citizens or aliens undocumented Democrats that's their status right now\nAnd the objective is to get them documented to get them registered and to take care of them give them health care make their track here make their trip pure worth it\nBy giving them exactly what they're coming for no some of them are going to be able to take care of themselves some are going to get here and I'm going to run and rings around people some in any group of people that large are going to have a wide disparity in some of them are going to be quite confident\nBut those are going to be the self starters and those are not that people Democrats are interested in I just really hideous I guess I just I guess really hideous ... Democrats what people need people\nWho are incapable of self reliance and that's not helping those people at all that is not compassionate Democrats want you to think that's all\nThey are and they are none of it it's the exact about they're using these people and hoping that they never amount to much\nHey don't have much faith in them any way but they are great voters great dependent voters in their lives so that's what this is about look I'm I'm Glad you called rarely you are exceptionally well spoken your home schooling is working and you're I I Hope that you hope you do get into journalism journalism needs people that are interested in the truth\nI also want to thank you for the book the route on I've read and I have right on man ... passing down in my little sister so I left the bucks [laughter]\nHow many sisters do you have total I have three oh so you have one younger and one older for no two oh no I have\nOne younger than me one or two younger than me and I want older than me the older one she's twenty seven she's a coat off like ...\nI got ya so I'm trying to convert her man said give me a long\nTime trying keep trying you can have fun doing that actually I got to go 'cause I'm way along but keep trucks in the meantime I Want to give her comp subscription to the website those letters so don't hang up here right away so we can get everything was going\nRush Limbaugh appointees loosely I'm lucky I network\nRush Limbaugh\nRussia question how long has in the medium she's been telling us it's only a question of time and something happened\nIs that'll make Donald Trump self destructing it never happens instead we keep watching his predicting self destruct Trump's upholding melt down now practically every day over the fact that Trump business\nThey melt down over the fact that they can make\nTrump no Rush Limbaugh China and knew one PM on news Tom next week five\nFrom the bio safe environment studio this is Gigi well am Nineteen Seventy ...
