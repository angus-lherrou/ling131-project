that Trump would end up being another Hitler that Paul Krugman or New York times said would cause an economic collapse from which the country would never recover\nStill covering this this is the Washington Post still claiming Trump is planning to take away all of your civil rights\nNow that that's somewhat of a important point there because it's it's not just that\nThe Republicans are doing better than Democrats in the states is is that early voting almost always favors Democrats the usual pattern for all this stuff is that for Democrats are drawn up in the early ...\nBecause of early voting and the Republicans have to then make up for a vat on election day itself but that's not what we're seeing here and they gave us was NBC News\nSo the question here ... hard to apply this to

it like for example if they if they get it in their heads everybody hates Trump\nAnd that hatred for Trump has brought in and magnified over two years ... therefore there's going to be this massive\nTurnout among Democrats can't wait to vote energized when they get that in their hands and they believe it and then the exact opposite happens and they don't know what to do about it and they get non plus and a little concerned about which is where they are now\nAnd I've shared with you yesterday there's a there's a ... a lot of stories [noise] uh about\nBut that it simply doesn't look
