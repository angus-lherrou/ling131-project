in the marketplace so us sellers and buyers to get a good feel of a vote what's happening in in one of our great sources for that is miles Lincoln opportunity banking miles is with us\nUm miles let's talk a bit about interest rates and get you to pull your crystal ball out a let's first look at the past I think you were on the show with me last June or have interest rates gone up since then\nSteadily steadily okay we have seen a\nSpike even actually this week\nReally saw spike and writes about an eight percent ... I think we're probably closer to the mid ... when we were you know you ever take yeah when we were when I was on last in ah we're we're pushing were bumping up close to that ... percent mark on this is on a thirty year fixed conventional oh\nOkay now what drives that what's caused those rates go up in your opinion\nYou know the sub getting too deep but mortgage rates are all tied to\nSo those rates go up in your opinion you know the without getting too deep but mortgage rates are all tied to the ten year mortgage backed securities bonds okay that's it's a direct correlation so when it's a supply and demand on that particular product so\nThe more people that are buying bonds they demand and interest rates go down okay ... when when I say people I mean you know large hedge fund companies Martin movers I guess you could call him\nPension company pension funds that kind of thing but when the when the bond market specifically the mortgage back secured bond market when you start to see a sell off the interest rates are going up being in the easy way to think about that is if the economy's doing well\nStock market's doing well\nWell you don't want a big percentage of your money to be in the bond market you want it to be in you know maybe a little riskier\nBig ass or a little risk your assets equities that can create money ... you know those big market movers are selling bonds because the market's doing so well right and then it creates interest rates to go up and that's why we see in general\nWhen we're in a recession\nAll those people are fleeing the bonds to protect their money in rates are good during a recession meaning low in their typically higher when the economy is moving and right now every economic indicator week after week after week that comes out it's been positive positive positive and so right the rates go up with it\nAnd and you know I guess it's a give and take the rates go up but then on the other side are a lot of us are are making a little more money than we have job markets are getting better and that so [noise]\nUm and and we have seen the stock market hit new hives almost on a weekly basis so so that's going to drive those things but all in all really our interest rates aren't that bad\nNo you know it depends on uh I guess what generation [laughter] well yeah because uh\nYou know there are folks out there that remember there are of interest rate was Eighteen percent ... and they got a special deal at Thirteen and they thought that was said it made you know made the deal\nI was gonna say all guys like me I remember when they they crawled up over twenty percent and so yeah if you could find something around Fifteen to twelve percent you are just happy as a clam and and uh thank goodness we haven't seen that long long time and that's\nKind of you know the ... the generation of folks that are buying homes now I mean for the better part of well Eighteen years we haven't been above seven and a half percent not a thirty year fixed mortgage an Eighteen years and so\nThat's hard for people to fathom went in interest rates at five percent even though historically like you know yeah that's cheap money yeah so it really shouldn't deter folks from purchasing because that's a heck of an interest rates do you don't get an interest rate like that on credit card you don't get any rates like that on long term\nWhere so in in it obviously has not slow the market down and market is still very strong as we were talking about [noise]\nUm so that brings me to the next topic I wanted to discuss with you and that is because I I think across Montana ... most of us are doing a little better if we haven't got a better job to job board in is a little more secure in that and I think what that's caused a lot of folks who say you know\nMaybe it is time for us to move up get a little nicer house and so what we've seen and we get emails from our listeners all the time we love to hear from you just simply you just go to a ... you can just email us at Montana real estate today all one word\nAnd ask us any question where more than happy to but a lot of people wanted to get from the banking in the lending side a perspective of how\nDo we handle and we've got this house here that we're living in and we were looking for a new home we find that one that we go oh this is the perfect home we this is this is our dream home [laughter]\nBut we know okay I Can't I Can't buy that 'til I sell my house 'cause I Can't afford to payments but with this really strong market I'm worried if I wait for my house to sell that house might not be available anymore\nIs there a way to solve that equation is kind of like the chicken and egg theory [laughter] you know which can we do first a as a lender can you help us in any way with that or is it or just stuck so we got to get that house sold first we really\nOnly have two options okay the one option is a contingency ... so you make the offer on the new home\nBut the contingency as you have to sell your your current home before you can close\nIn a really hot market like we've seen the last year and a half two years ... most sellers are reluctant to take a contingency offer because they know there's somebody that may knock on the door tomorrow want to buy this place right so we really have not seen very many contingency offers be accepted for that reason\nI think given the current market that's hands seems to be shifting a little ... meaning more inventory on there so more competition for sellers\nI could see the contingency offers maybe coming back a little bit more okay in the near future because I think like say with more him and tore there's more competition to sell your home and so if you're willing to take that contingency offer and hope that person can sell their home in a short period of time\nThat might give you a leg up versus somebody that's not willing to do and when we see the market soften those contingency offers some become a little bit more prevalent\nThe other option is I'm doing a bridge loan you've heard a bridge loan or or it's kind of really a line of credit mhm you really have that you know you need to have a pretty good equity position in your current home ... and then what we would do is we would leverage that home\nAnd take a little bit of equity out of it up front mhm to give you the cash for the down payment on the second home so you could purchase that other home before your home self okay opposite if side is you're able to secure that new home without you're selling\nBut the downside is like you were saying earlier you do have to be able to qualify for all those payments right and if you can't qualify for the new mortgage payment the existing mortgage payment plus year bridge loan and that's not an option that you can do but none is really the only option we have\nSo one thing for you folks just to break it down a little so you know let's say you've lived in your home a long time and you know very little on it now\nAh your payments of always stayed the same but the actual full amount that you owe is is gone down quite a bit [noise] so what you're saying miles as we borrow against that equity that we've built up\nSo let's say we have a two hundred thousand dollar home but we only oh fifty thousand we might be able to borrow fifty or so\nFor that down or or maybe more and then go ahead and tie that at our home up and then make sure our realtor gets going strong but we got to have that income that just in case we can make both payments that's grill yeah now that\nA key there is is you really just have to have that income that will support all the payments and you know we've seen of we've seen that happen in a fair amount of people you know exercise kind of that bridge loan slash line of credit because\nOr you know if you can like you say it's pretty rare because usually they'd been pre qualified somewhere too so yeah we hope that they have but if you have and\nIt's definitely a an opportunity for a a cellar to say you know yeah we're using this bank and it'll be seamless if you use them as well and um but often times like you say that they've done their homework and their agent has kind of ... them they've been pre approved somewhere I hired a look\nAnd yeah you would hope so but anyway just another idea if if you want to do it so that's how that process works and and I think we've answered that question for up I Believe it was a\nA Lucy in Helena and I think excuse me if I forget her name but I think it was bobbing bailing said both emailed me and asked about that so hopefully we ask you a question about doing those multiple transactions now another topic I wanted to get into miles is\nI said with this market the way it's been in and the economy this way it's been some of us are doing a little better now and one of the dreams I think as a parent a lot of us have is\nIf we can make our kids life a little easier than we had it we we always try to do that and of course one of the big dreams that I'm sure a lot of you parents out there that have kids your kids if they're getting to that age has one of their big dreams his owner\nOne of the big dreams that I'm sure a lot of you parents out there that have kids your kids if they're getting to that age has one of their big dreams to own a home with their own and uh I Know as parents a lot of times the if we can help our kids do that we want to\nSo I thought maybe we can spend a little time miles on\nMay be helping some ideas of how we as a parent could help our kids\nUm\nYou know buy a home or what are some ideas or options that you would give to parents as far as how how can we help or child buyout\nWell first and foremost before they're ever to the point where they want to look at buying a home is counseling him on credit mhm in establishing some credit\nYou know maybe they need to get a student loan and their name or they need a car loan or credit card that\nThey pay off just to establish credit that kind of makes it a little easier when it comes to the time a time in their life where they're ready to buy ... but you know as\nIn Missoula especially and I know a lot of markets in the state we're going statewide so there's a lot of markets that are this way\nUm rent is high yeah and often times it's not the payment on rent that's the hurdle is setting that down payment and that's what we see more often than not is\nBoy we can pay the Fifteen hundred dollars a month for rent we've been doing it for years but we sure we just can't save the money for the down payment ... um there are a few\nLow down products or no down not not a whole not a whole lot but there are a few but when it comes to the the down payment that's where we see\nWe see the parent more often gifting the child or their children a down payment funds ... um to get them to the point where they can uh\nYou know purchased that home and how payment that they can that they can make every month\nAnd and I I agree I think I I Know I just went through it was one of my kids and and I was able to um help them they were over in Bozeman in fact uh Richie ... one of our our um local experts a realtor there in Bozeman does a great job\nOr he helped uh my daughter by I'm a home and and I help you with that down\nUm because she was the same way boy we've been renting forever I rent is in Bozeman who super high\nOr so we can handle the payment is just that down uh so what are some options we can do there and I'm going to hold you for a minute because we are going to take a quick break but when we come back I Want you to talk about\nMaybe some ways of the parents coming up without down money you know hopefully you just got it in savings and you can do it but there are some other options that miles and miles talk to you about\nTo help our kids and then we'll talk about maybe some tips on on uh how you handle that going down the road because you're going to have some liability specially get into coast signing and that and so are your parents\n... coming up next we're going to show you how to help your kids and kids\nYou listen now you can tell your parents how to how they can help you be a good Christmas coming up\nMaybe a so we've got that and a whole bunch more coming up on Montana real estate today as we talked to miles linked with opportunity bank healthy get sent in extreme we'll be right back\nWhere we go next well we found some more folks of mine has mental you really need to know right here I logged into real estate

real estate today\nWe are back here on Montana real estate today and miles lake has been with us was opportunity back in ... been a huge help and given us all kinds of great advice and talking about how the market is Matt\nAnd when we left off\nOr we were talking miles about helping our kids buy a home\nAnd I'm coming up with some ideas of how to help them and uh as you brought up usually the way most parents will help is is by helping to down because as you said rents are so high here in Montana [noise]\nMost of the kids are used for making those monthly payments they just don't have the down what are some ideas of how a parent could come up with down a blood say we don't quite have maybe they need fifty to a hundred thousand to put down probably closer to fifty and we don't have quite fifty and our savings\nWhat are some ways we could come up with that that could help our kids\nYou know I'm obviously like you said ideally have the money sitting there so not a hit to you in any way 'cause you have the savings\nOr some of the ways I have seen a I have seen some parents take a little bit maybe out of a retirement account that they're not going to need for retirement okay yeah I was lines they may take a\nA small amount or maybe they're of retirement age ... and they can take some retirement funds without having any penalties and tax penalty generally want to talk to your count on that stuff but potentially there's some retirement accounts out there that are\nThat you could access some funds without having those penalties that's one option ... also if you have a bit of equity in your home\nJust like we were talking about earlier with bridge loan but um if you have some equity in your home potentially you could take a small\nLoan out on the line of credit or small loan out are using the home for security\nAnd uh and you can usually get a pretty favorable rate that way and using that to as collateral and uh\nThe home for security and uh and you can usually get a pretty favorable rate that way since ... using that to as collateral and um maybe bridge that gap with some type of equity out of the home\nYeah and using my daughter is an example because fresh in my mind over in Bozeman in her and her husband and they just had a a new baby and so they needed more space but\nI mean they were paying a lot in or rent so when we started looking at the whole market I did like you I'm an older guy now so I had some ... some retirement money saved up\nAnd so I said okay I can put that towards the home but now we're we're stretching that are over thirty year term\nAnd a ... I set it up like a lease purchase and those payments are covering the cost of the home the mortgage payments plus a little extra to pay me back\nAnd the latest News New you in a week right here on this radio station for more info unique to no one month to into real estate today [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nI mean an arms deal between the U.S in Saudi Arabia under scrutiny I'm Pam who's now Fox News\nPresident Trump is promising severe punishment if it turns out that Saudi Arabia is responsible for the disappearance of a Washington Post columnist but the president appears to be stopping short of pulling the plug on an arms deal with the kingdom\nIf they don't buy it from us they're going to buy from Russia or they're going to buy it from China or they're going to buy it from other countries\nThe president in an interview with CBS sixty minutes cause showcase was last seen on October second entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey officials there say he was killed\nSo far Saudi Arabia has maintained a hard line on this issue deny deny deny but without providing any substantial eating evidence but yesterday they took the opportunity to do President Trump's reasoning about the global economy Saudi state TV reporting quote\nThey can get a lot for is if it's targeted with any action it will respond with a greater action\nThat Sachs has generally been Turner homes and businesses blown to pieces that's the story in Mexico Beach Florida town sustained a direct hit from hurricane Michael\nThe big thing is that when people continue to say that I wanted to make sure everybody to learn from those when when somebody says there's going to be nine foot ten foot fourteen for the storm surge it's deadly\nGovernor Rick Scott as surveying damage their Fox the silk heating also in Mexico beach\nSearch and rescue operations will continue again today every structure has been looked at once but they want to go through every one two or three times just to make sure there are no survivors trapped under the wreckage injure but still alive and also they are looking through far they've come from any fatality\nNineteen dance in four states has been confirmed Brexit talks could be moving forward speculation of a breakthrough sparked by a surprise trip to Brussels\nBy Britain's chief negotiator dance is Fox News [noise]\n[noise] what it is and stars and he didn't like Henry engineering fighting the heart of the nation now more than ever we nice houses\nWe read ... the new place and you want to know the fosters favorites you already love\nAre going to be fairly piece fail no season is more like a nation to\n[noise] [noise] what was on Fox News journal animating western for me is always going to happen\nIf you're on pushing him again\nYou're not you're punishes they're going to rely on you\nOne of the advantages of having been in this business so long as you're able to the to\nWhat is real what is of course\nWants to drop the government was\nResponsible for so many journals real news real honest opinion\nMass immigration march is said to be underway hundreds upon door ends including children could be on their way to our southern border\nSome reports indicate there could be more than one in South and Hondurans right now adding to the U.S Mexico border in search of a better life the group of migrants began growing in numbers on friday and went around with hundreds\nA hundred runs right now adding to the U.S Mexico border in search of a better life\nA group of migrants began growing in numbers on friday when around one hundred sixty Hondurans organized an effort\nTo make the jury to the United states they agree to live together to make the travel north much safer according to a recent study by the center for Immigration Studies the main reason they want to leave poor economic the second most started cause was to play the violin set on ...\n... ... last night during a political rally President Trump praised the work of immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\nIllegal alien criminal runners drug dealers surging killers\nWe're liberating just down that's what we're doing\nAs the caravan gets closer the Trump Administration is reportedly not considering the forced separations of families who tried to cross the border\nHe's a good guy we get along very well but he sort of a Democrat that is what President Trump is saying that defense secretary Jim Mattis when asked during an interview with CBS is sixty minutes whether the secretary will step down the president said Mattis has not told him that\nFor a second straight week then I'll take the top spot at the box office earning more than thirty five million dollars\nYou will only hurt bad people [noise]\n\nIn second place a star is born landing in third that Neil Armstrong film first man storing Ryan Gosling that earned about sixteen\nMillion I'm Pam ...

here's a story or to give it to release a Adam Marilyn Marilyn police district heights Maryland\nTo Maryland police officers were shot while serving a drug related search warrants at the wrong apartment that's\nShort version of this is the police get a tip from an informant more we have heard this time and time again it's kind of stuff that'll make you stay up at night worrying\nSomebody gives them the wrong address or they go to the wrong address whatever and the police are kicking in that or they're bashing and the door\nThe guy inside is not the one they're looking for he just a good guy he's a good guy oh yeah and he has a gun is what does he do he shoots the people who were breaking in his door natural logical sense of all legal\nIssues to police officers\nNormally what has happened in the past is a police officer in the shooting him and killing them they end up killing the good guy who was trying to defend himself\nAnd his family in this case the police went as soon as this guy realized it was a place to put down his gun put his hands up news how holler and do what you mean don't you my daughter and\nUm which I got from the white guy [laughter] uh I mean physically it keeps the door from being opened I'm going to survive by going to get us and solve whether I Want to share that are not ah but I'm\nSo glad that you had that conversation with them and then it's one of those do you have to say well look officer if if you're at home and somebody kicks in your door\nWhat are you going to be doing\nWell that's where the mayor came in uh the mayor did see it on my perspective on that heat it totally agree they said you know what I understand your perspective he said I Would have done the same thing\nYou know and the other thing is I Know\nThere's a bit of a line set up we train we've got the guns and we've got the body armor and all that and when you turn and say well look you need to understand I train and I have a semi automatic rifle and I don't\nKnow what you guys are or wearing and I certainly would never wish harm to any law enforcement forcing officer at all\nOkay but I understand there probably what you're carrying his word on carry with you guys have is what I have [noise]\nSo we will we just need to kill the same page on this I'm not trying to hurt anybody that's the point is the conversation Denison to point you're making them as well let's figure something out here so nobody gets hurt\nBecause that's the goal is we don't want anybody to get hurt students is\nLuckily we did a time we we did exactly that uh we sat down for a two hour talk and we aren't it out there is something that\nLike for example now their database now has accurate cell phone numbers for myself and my wife focus on the event that anything like that happens they can say hey we better call before we decide to break in to that particular\nAd retrograde idea and you know the other thing is innocent another subject for another day is the whole concept of swatting\nWhich has become a real issue where somebody can spoof it called nine one one that looks like it's coming from your house and they're saying hey I'll just give up my wife I'm going to kill anybody who comes in I'm holding these kids hostage and also the swat teams comes in and then find out that\nYou're sitting there watching TV you know watching reruns of all of the family or something when they break in the door I mean swatting real deal then is thank you so much I Want to go down the line three McGill is with us from Carson City Nevada and the girls got a different perspective on this one I think it's going to help us out hello sir welcoming to gun talk\nIn charge more to say if we look at this from a protector point of view gained a law enforcement here for people or if they have a strict gun they have a reason to approach the middle ... it's such a manner\nThat's appropriate for what ever it is that they can do to get the job done any clear by now if you're registered and logically it makes sense\nYeah you're going to be hostile or not because there's a couple of search going to have read it if it has to be a reason why I got to do with the first place\nWell what what if they have their own house\nWell they had the house is communication\nThat is that when the first place\nWell what what what if they have their own house\nOr if they had the wrong house is communication is so weak link shallow between what moment something much filed traditional night reached the person who authorized\nWhile I understand that but my point is that something happened there kicking in the door now\nRight\nIn the whole idea of a registered there's no such thing as registered going to get over that nobody there is no requirement to register a gun in this country\nPerfect so I agree with you that now that I could find wishing All right\nAnd like yeah let me run down the and the only one ... Andy in ah Texas a procedure called ... and I gather you are an attorney\n[noise] yes I Am okay\nGo ahead I'm no I I appreciate the topic in my life quite as I think in terms of\nA policy that police you know my my considered it to minimize the that that sense in which today a failed a need to to bust into a house like this with a SWAT Team they need to make sure that they've done due diligence before they go in and they need to carefully consider whether\nA stakeout might be more appropriate people at some point will need to leave their house to get milk or get gas or go to work and another scenario is one of the individuals outside as much safer a scenario that it would be to break into it and how\nThey can identify the individual that way in many cases you know just simply serving a warrant for you know pass through traffic tickets are tell you to appear obviously there there's a level of importance there needs to be an imminent threat\nThat verifiable that for the police should set or one of the group in three ways and if you're\nPointing out that direction where the criminals are are starting to say hey here's a good way to get people to just lay down there again right there there needs to be uniform\nAnd consistent action to deter that kind of behavior and only one that police you know I think it needs to be a nationwide effort at this if it's a sham that you're talking about the criminal the catchy onto it is becoming very common [noise]\nYeah and it's in and look if you want to really get a police officer angry you get somebody who's in person or the police officer man that took them off about as much as anything I Know with good reason\nBut it is now it's become what they've done is they've put everybody in danger they put the homeowners in danger they put the police in danger with this whole impersonation deal and you know all you gotta do and it's just when you get a chance to get on your car through a little search you'll find different a number of these cases the boom and the other thing that's happened is home invasions\nA lot of times now have gone from one person just six people doing home invasions and it's one of the reasons that I think you can call one of the reasons I said\nPeople need to rethink\nTheir home defense guts this also of course we're talking about you know\nHow'd you know what's going on out there well you know what could go back to what our great sponsors the blink cameras\nYou could turn on your camera out there look at it with your phone's if somebody's town on the door he go oh yeah that's a bunch of police officers out there that's the real deal there's like six ... cars out there okay or no that doesn't look right now you may not have time to do all that because this stuff\nTypically happens
