Honduran Mike written ... turned around today a day after reaching that make you go watch them on the border\nAccording to a report what's The Simpsons poster poster\nIt's an eight story the or support thousand migrants fled their lives of poverty and violence and the Central American country with the hope to make if they were black who picked us nothing about this is organic you look Trump's right to ask who's paying for this who is buying the food\nWho is buying the water and distributing and who is paying for the gasoline for the vehicles being used where are these people are taking care of heightened Jenny requirements\nFor those will be a real into where they poop but\nWe've seen him got any port a potties trailing along in the care of all of this stuff has to be accounted for you're gonna bring four thousand people\nAnd it it\nThat's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the ... the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected [noise] and it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans that Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well we'll see if this story\nOn the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a palm pale left Saudi Arabia after having met when king Solomon and Mohammed men saw him on the crown prince even flew to Mexico\nAnd they have to know the Trump is not going to put up with this and I think that was the message ... talk so I got one\nReport from a peanut the caravan has turned around now if that's true whoever is paying for it this is going to have to keep paying for those people to go wherever they go next are they going to go back to Honduras by going to go back to Guatemala are they going to go to a hole in places in weight\nTo try to do the caravan all over are they going to try to sneak them in in

Russian my coming in loud and clear you are sir here you're just fine\nThanks it's a sixty dollar Samsung so you know whatever but uh yeah you know we\nAll have our obstacles to bear in life and your your overcoming us pretty well I hear you pretty well\nThey keep uh you know I'm a Trump voted for Trump madman Trump voter and America First and most historic sense and I'm an American patriot so take that in contact with my question here\nHow can the United states the allies with countries and you mentioned this in the first part of your monologue we're allies with the Saudi Arabia and Israel how can we be allies with Saudi Arabia when the Pentagon papers released and twenty six team showed that they funded nine eleven\nAlso Israel is attacked us in the past like a used his liberty with all of unfair can you clear that are forming\nWell on the Saudi side yeah the ... the Israeli spy on us to everybody spies on everybody you know Jonathan Pollard it was an Israeli spider got caught and the Israelis wanted him back on harmed and we said screw you you know where your benefactor spy on us and they said yes we do\nAnd we're going to continue the spike is we can't trust anybody where Israel\nAnd uh particularly when Democrats are in the White House and that's a factor now when it comes\nThe question here is really good\nI remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned that if it was either all night teen or white Ninety percent eighty percent of the Nineteen hijackers were Saudi\nI remember I was talking to William F Buckley junior about number thing not just this and I brought that up and I remember him getting frustrated with me about it he said what is it ever doing anything I was\nI don't understand the Saudi Government supposedly is an ally\nAnd yet these hijackers come from Saudi Arabia or you are you saying the Saudi royal family is behind\nThis I said how can we say that they're not that is when I began\nTo try to learn about the relationship to the Saudi up the Saudi royal family to Islam\nAnd that's what I started asking experts are at at one of the people I talked to was Andy McCarthy again because he has tried as a United States attorney assist the United states attorney southern district of Manhattan he was the lead prosecutor on the blind shake case\nAnd it was ending who said that he thought the blind check was just acting out to being a radical inventor of various aspects of Islam\nAs part of his technique to mobilize and create even more membership and his group and then he he started reading the things that the blind shake believes and he found out\nNone of this is made up this this this call for terrorism dealing with infidels it's right there in the car on if you read it right this\nIs exactly what what is in the book and he was stunned when he told me was so when you then realized that the Saudi royal family is\nIn charge of world wide Islam because the holy sites or their mecca and a Medina Medina I found that it is absolutely true that the Saudi royal family\nIs essentially the the shield and the emphasis behind white Islam well in Saudi Arabia\nThe branch of Islam that is I for just to make it easier here and being understood terrorist Islamic comes from ... from those you heard me say this yesterday beg your indulgence wow how'd the Islam\nIs aware of the really radical clerics and the moms are who are welcoming anybody they can into their mosques and just literally converting them into\nSuicide bombers terrorists and what have you under the auspices of Islam and the Saudi royal family stood by and let it all happened whether they were instrumental in advocating you don't know but Saudi funded charities all over the world promoted\nWhile hobby is and that's what I went back to Mr Buckley aside I don't I don't see how the Saudi royal family the Saudi Government can be separated from these Nineteen hijackers\nWell that's why it's interesting to tell the story of the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont Mohammed bin\nI it's interesting to tell the story of the crown prince Mohammed bin solve Mont\nMohammed bin ... wants to if we didn't believe him [noise] he wants to reform the Saudi Arabian peninsula the whole country and its relationship to Islam\nAll because of money economics primarily he doesn't like the fact that Saudi Arabia is solely dependent on the sale of oil for all of its wealth he wants to branch out\nHe wants other people investing other industries individuals' investing in Saudi Arabia for things unrelated dollars are Petro dollars oil\nSo he sought out the interest in Hollywood Silicon Valley than the typical places in other countries as well\nAnd part and parcel of his reform is\nThe\nI don't know what word abandonment or and me are distancing from or how does it\n\nAccording to have been some on Saudi Arabia cannot modernize and cannot achieve his reform goals if ... is still\n\nThe branch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family\nWell\nThis brings us to ... again and the Muslim Brotherhood they don't want any of these reforms they don't want any western influences in any Islamic country much less Saudi Arabia where mecca Medina aren't they do not want ... watered down they do not\nThey want the Arab Spring they don't want secularism anywhere and Mohammed bin ... represents a bit of that that's fascinating that he's been brought to a screeching halt on these reforms\nWith the ... this has brought to a screeching and now there's a story today that the royal family they they have a council you might I often wondered well who determines but these kings have countless sons they've got Fifteen different wives they've got kids with every one of their wives\nSo a Saudi king could have twenty sons how does he determine which one's the crown prince how does your determine which one's going to be as air it's not just first in line they had a council they have an inter family council a royal family council that\nDetermines the when the age of the crown prince the heirs and in what order\nThen sell them on Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of the current king Solomon\nHe was chosen largely because of his reform ideas but now a story out today says if the widow if it's true or not the royal family is having a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad bin saw him on as clown friends\nNow many people think that this was up to the king the king determines what your his sons is going to be the next king but it's not the case so all of these plans for modernization if they were true I have to throw that I was a cabin up all these plans for reform\n\nHave been brought to a screeching halt by the murder of Dr Marcus show in Turkey which is also very unhappy with Saudi

remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump is a phony is not who he says he is\nAnd they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHow

and we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for it\nYet not serious money and certainly not serious construction there for his theory was that the
