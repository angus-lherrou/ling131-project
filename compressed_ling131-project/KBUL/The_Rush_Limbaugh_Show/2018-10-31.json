all around the country tried to heal and it was a turning point in his presidency he was a battle when he went to Oklahoma City that turns his presence around the very positive direction\nThis is how history revision has works there David Ronald Reagan's saying Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma City in Nineteen Ninety five inhaled he didn't go after the\nTerrorists\nHe didn't sort of make a you know beat the drums to go out and stop the terrorists\nWill\nLet's go back and listen to what Gergen thanks was Bill Clinton's finest moment April twenty fourth Nineteen Ninety five in Minneapolis\nHere so many loud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up and upset with each other\nThey spread hey they leave the impression that\nBy their very words that violence is acceptable you oughta see I'm sure you are now saying the reports are some things that are regularly says over the airwaves in America today it is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech\nRight now who couldn't even talking about this Nineteen Ninety five but there is no Fox News the block with her as a result of the airwaves uh this is where he attempted to blame me everybody you know what at the time and it was even applauded by some not everybody\nBut the White House felt some have had the issue of corrections say no we were talking about the Michigan Militia short wave radio network vessel we meant by angry voices on the right\nThe Michigan Militia was a media creation I mean there might have been some guys hiking around in the woods with some guns were on camera gear and the media had video of it but the Michigan Militia was a non factor in any of this and you get right up but there's Clinton's zeroing in on it when his attempt to blame me bombed out somebody said\nClinton you didn't do that no he was trying to heal he didn't go after anybody he didn't go after the terrorist he didn't sort of beat the drums in store for us all of them he tried\nTo heal it was a turning this is again history revision is an extraordinary one more by this is worth blitzed and judge Jeffrey Reuben last night on a Wolf Blitzer show on CNN\nI was the White House correspondent proceeding in Nineteen Ninety five are in the after\nClinton was president he went to Oklahoma City was he delivered a beautiful speech who was very very warmly received there were no protesters going on for you remember those days\nAnd how about you know President Obama who unfortunately had all these mass shootings on his watch in South Carolina in Connecticut and you know he led the grieving and all those places frankly wouldn't even occur to me that there would have been protests\nSee so now there were no protest for Obama there is no protests when Clinton went out but there's all kinds of protests when Trump goes out meaning what\nThat Trump's guilty But Trump's at fault but the protestors are right why weren't there any protests back in those days old take a look at who the victims were number one but what why we're there no protests\n\nPrecisely me cause no left very rarely protest its own people they protest for no reason at all other than a simple excuse\nFor it but it also was a different time we're talking about it over twenty five years ago twenty two twenty three

women instead of about killing his nomination by any means which there'll be getting updates on the story wouldn't really I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul raped by Kevin ...\nIs the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is justice not being sought any longer\nAnd they answered the question is it was never about the women\nBecause none of the women had any evidence it was about one thing only and that was killing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh even if it meant destroying his family and his career his future and his life\nAnd they failed so now it's on to whatever is next and I guess it's we need a ban on white guys from Don Lemon\nThe real murderers

entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly\nThe immigrants who were allowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nYou had to learn about American history you have to promise that you're going to do your best to learn the English language if it was restricted because it was predicated and based on the fact that we weren't in charge of who was going to live here\nThe world was not in title it was entirely different vantage it back then but even then\nI read books I remember conversations with my grandfather who lived to be a hundred and four he was born in Eighteen nineties\nHis life\nSpanned pre electricity to going to the moon in his life he saw all of that he grew up on a farm and the goal plow fields before school every day\nCome home after school work the farm and so forth and like all the stories everything they didn't sell is what they got to eat um he was one of the first in is why they're going to be first to ah to go to college became a lawyer\nBut he\nCame from the horse and buggy days and no electricity too\nA slide landing on the motives thought all\nAnd I remember I was I was home in Missouri I guess Nineteen Ninety two years after program again so they Nineteen Ninety\nAnd he's around Ninety these these uh ... close to a hundred years old and he's asked me so what what are the big thing is [noise] it was hard of hearing but it's not just couldn't here to radio easily so one of the big thing is being discussed on your program so the immigration we called and pop\nPop you would not believe it I mean I I I'm dealing with people who are just so anti immigration wouldn't run this was this was folks this was all them back in Nineteen Ninety it wasn't just strictly southern border immigration and he said you know\nI remember those debates all the way back in the early Nineteen hundreds back in the days Ellis Island you immigration has been\nA\nPolarizing subject to this country for as long as we have been doing it and he started telling me stories of the\nUh efforts to image shown new arrivals from western in Eastern Europe and he was\nTelling me that there were so many people didn't want any of those people from Eastern Europe Western Europe average people as his point was the arguments haven't changed the issue has been something that is Constance\nBut the one thing that has changed he was talking about even back in Nineteen Ninety when we were talking about he was talking about legal immigration\nHe was saying back in the early Nineteen hundreds away they've you know the controversy then was about legal immigration and even with legal immigration where people opposed to opening up Ellis Island then preventing masses of humanity to come in\nAnd for reasons similar to what our stuff today\nThe differentiating thing today is that legal immigration is seldom even discussed and we have both political parties in predominantly one of them\nNow advocating from last night as advocating for illegal immigration and then using opponents of illegal immigration as examples of racism and bigotry\nSo forth so while the issue has always been around and it's always been a controversial thing\nImmigration and how we manage it\nThe idea that illegal aliens should be automatically granted citizenship or amnesty upon their arrival\nThat is what's new to this debate and that is what the uh the Democrats in the American left today are are advocating and they're doing ... on the premise that America is responsible for the economic plight of these people that we\nAs a superpower have taken an unfair portion of the world's resources we've gone around the world and taking what we want\nAnd we have not compensated people privately we've tried to impose our way of life and so in liberalism economics is a zero sum game if the American people are wealthy than somebody has to be poor out there and so therefore the American people are guilty\nOf something\nThere was an unequal distribution of wealth elapsed as in all of these countries in Central America South America so poor compared to us and it's not a coincidence got to be our fault somehow so it's only fair that these people are fleeing a rotten economy is in war torn strife\nThat the United states allow them in as a means of apology\nPassion\nAnd the real purpose behind it is to transform America and to kind of nation that was never intended are founded debate\nAnd that's the difference of the legal and illegal immigration to the subject has been around that's been controversial for as long as it has been happening but the idea that illegal lovers have a legal claim on whatever they want in this country that's\nThat is what's new and the education they make so
