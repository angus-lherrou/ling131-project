Montana real estate today\nWe are back here on Montana real estate today and we're talking about fixing up your home remodeling\nMaybe you just bought a new home and are you thinking hey it's time to personalize it a little bit or maybe you were getting ready to sell your home and you you're looking for some ideas to maybe\nGive us a little extra push in fact we're gonna talk specifically about that would they prosper he's with peers flooring and design you've seen those stores for many many years all across the state of Montana and he's going to give us some great ideas before we go back today though I also wanted to remind you if you haven't found your next home yet\nStay too because Casey and again the property center are going to talk about some new listings that they found there out on the market around the states stay tuned for that now Dave I'm when we left off before the break we were talking about you know the the different types of flooring and trends and all that\nLet's talk about prices you know I'm of course we all love to be able to just spend whatever we want in our home but of course most all of us are\nHave a budget I'm Talking about price ranges if if we're wanting to do that it may be discussed the different price ranges and wouldn't carpet things like\nThat here ... in there is a huge variety of price ranges out their Dale and and uh you know if we take a look at carpet as an example um\nNinety nine cents a square foot and go on up from there to do whatever you want to spend depending on what you want and the key thing that we need to do and is is when you come on in our stores\nSit down with one of our our project manager specialist and they'll go over\nWhat your needs analysis says no because as you get into some of these products that especially with carpet there's different types of fiber the carpet can be made out of and a lot of that's going to dictate the price and it's going to dictate the performance and\nAnd how well their carpet ... last for you know when you get into carpet you can get into a nylon carpet polyester smarts than all of sudden wool\nAnd those are all going to be different price points and each one of those has some advantages to it but they also have some restrictions to him as far as how well they're going to perform ... but we're very well competitively priced we can start off in Ninety nine cents than we do a lot of that for the property management people in a rental people\nWhere they know it may not last more than two or three years so they don't want to invest a lot into a sure but when you get into your own home that you're trying to make into your your beautiful home\nThat's where our sales professional kind of help you through and find the best product or your needs some work where it's going to work\nYou look at some of the hardware areas\nUm you can get it to some hardwood for three dollars a square foot that's not that well but but what happens a lot with that Dale is just what they call shorts\n... and and the boards that you're going to get an editor about six eight inches long because what they do is they are making those boards are cutting off the bat ports parts of the bar all okay and I ended up with a lot of short boards but at ... point\nWhere people are single piece I can get into a hardwood for about three bucks a square foot\nDon't realize that they got a lot of short boards and and and and and maybe that's the look you want but you need to be aware of what's available our\nOr nay fit a little better for a a different type of room or something exactly okay so we got from three dollars a square foot ... I mean I imagine it goes way up from you can go on from there to it every and\nAnd and when we talk about hard woods you know you'd mentioned you even have vinyl that looks like hard woods but there's you know there's the solid wood on into like the engineered woods and things like that talk a little bit about those different yeah in in\nIn in engineering and solid what people need to understand their boats through there still a true what is it that the engineered is not an imitation what ... uh that the engineered would\nIs is basically several ... of of ah accord going in different directions for stabilization and then the finished up on top advantage with the engineered where this ability is in in a solid hardwood at three quarter inch hardwood is going to react to changes in temperature and humidity is going to shrink and it's going to expand\nAnd with the engineered would they're much more stable\nAnd the other advantage with an engineered what is we can do different types of installation with at a solid would we have to nail down\nSo we have to typically beyond a plywood South Florida where we can nail that down into an engineered would weaken floated in we can glue it down and we can also nail it down so the advantage with the engineered where it is sometimes when people are on a concrete slab or below grade in a basement\nAnd they want to put a true hardwood down we can go with the engineered hard with ... and those are available and a lot of the different species that we see that followed the un so if you're looking for an old hickory or walnut\nA maple those words are available in engineered and solid both so the engineer just really kind of covered a niche where the solid would maybe not work because of the ... that you have\n'em or maybe you're concerned about expansion contraction humidity levels in the home that's where the engineered word would work for you to\nI I went with engineered would in my condo and um the reason I did that is when the condo building was built it\nI I went with engineered would in my condo and um the reason I did that is when the condo building was built it they really kind of designed it for all the condos having carpet in that and so just as you're saying it wasn't really set up to be able to nail down and and that was\nA we had to do what's called a floating floor and that engineered wood was the perfect product looks beautiful so they do a ... you know a lot of things you just mentioned there Dave you you're talking about service you know where for example neat I I didn't know anything about flooring and\nSo you you go to a store like yours and you can get that kind of service now\nI Know the trend for some people as well you got to go to the great big box store [noise] uh you know the home depots are lows because you get that great price [noise]\nUm it's no secret people have heard me talk about it quite often the show I'm not a big fan of those because most of us don't\nKnow how what\nWe need and you're not going to get that kind of service [noise] tell us about the differences are that pierce is compared to say the big box stores\nWell they'll I think you hit it on the head of it is perfectly when you sit service and that's what we're all about it appears foreign throughout the state of Montana we're there to serve issue\nBefore during and after the sale and all we do is we sell flooring and cabinets and we got people that specialize in each of those areas\nSo when you come in it's not a guy that you worked in the paint department yesterday in and the more department the day before and today's enough worrying section ... we're continual education going on for all of our sales associates so they're up to speed knowing what product will work well no part of the installation process that goes with that\nAnd and so were there it had to get the right product that's going to work the best for your application and quite often we have people coming in and saying hey I'm looking for this type of product\nAnd as we talk to him during the needs analysis and what what's your needs and\nLifestyle and everything else sometimes that's not the right product for your home and re will be brutally honest and tell you that you know you have a great Dane and and you're looking for big loopy carpet that's not the red carpet for you but you know bookstores all they're going to do is say yes ma'am yesterday\nHere it is take your money in and out the door you go ...\nYeah I think those box stores really are more suited for people you know like a contractor or somebody like that that has all this knowledge but you know I I I say there's a lot to to our listeners but it's so important I mean you ... your home is probably the biggest investment you're ever going to make\nAnd now when you want to customize it and and make it yours [noise] that's not the time to be cutting corners it\nIt it's not and and the other thing too is when you come into our peers locations and you talked to one of our professional sales associates\nAnd and we come out and do that in home measurement for you were the ones coming out to the home to look at it for you to help you to find that dream that you're looking for ... unlike the bookstores typically they're going to send out an installer who has no vested interest in that project is going to turn out\n... and and we're there to give the ideas design ideas and options\nThat to look at to make that your dream home\nMhm yeah I I I just can't stress enough that it's just\nIt's so important folks to get the right advice because you know this isn't something that you can just go oh well let's turn that out and do it a different way where we're getting into some money is fires peers goes pricing compared to box stores but how do you guys fit in there\nI think we're extremely competitively priced on that bill in ... when you start looking add value versus cost ... and and and maybe they're a little bit cheaper on the front side but by the time\nUh eight by fourteen and we can take those carpets then we can actually make a custom area rug for ya\nOh you're talking we can look at any of the different carpet you have it you can make that into a\nRough week and make no no ... we find it in and that way that's just the way of adding your your signature to that living or you know he's or for color a pattern or\nWell died and I think that's a neat idea day because that could be you know you've just bought a house say and you you are going to have a lot of extra money but I Would like to personalize little that might be kind of a need option to at least get started with something personal without having to spend a huge amount exactly okay\nOh I Love that I'm less ... bathrooms now um any new ideas or thoughts for customize in our bathrooms a bit\nYou know going back again with the the key thing we want to make sure we do in the bathroom is two cents in this water resistant and waterproof you never know when that still can overflow or the kids get in and out of the top\nSo we wanted to get something in there that's going to be water resistant waterproof again a lot of different options that we have with that at that vital town that we grew out um you know kind of a neat thing we can do now we can do borders without so maybe on a colonel or around\nLighter color on the inside maybe do it on a diamond pattern on the inside known to give a that that little bit of a unique type\nOf luck with the vinyl tile Dave I'm by the way we're talking today prosper with peers flooring I'm with the vinyl tile ...\nIs there a big difference in cost between regular ceramic tile and the vinyl tile\n... there is a pretty good savings on that daily okay big part of the same as part of it's\nGoing to be on the material standpoint um that that the vinyl tiles at times will be less than the ceramic tile but the big savings on it is going to be from the installation side of it that the installation is going to be less for you on the ... would be on the ceramic tile\nSo you're really getting this beautiful tile look and like you say customize it even to put borders and that but now you've got a a a more durable surface and you're at a lower cost\nAt a lower cost and the other ... of these vital titles and these vital playing says wait a lot of 'em are installed they're glued down in an airport down with a special that he's called pressure sensitive and the beauty with that deal is somehow if one of those tiles does get damaged\nIt's very easy for us to get out there we do it through our service departments that all the stores at no cost will come out there will heat up that title will pull it off the floor you always want to have a few titles leftover Asher insulation we can go ahead and replace that tower regret it and within an hour you got your floor repairs and we're out the door\nA nice 'cause when you're talking regular ceramic tile which I don't want to knock it I mean it is beautiful but you break one of those and you can end up having to replace a lot a lot of all of that ... yeah good point there are less talk bedrooms here on our bedroom says is kind of interesting how we've\nWe've changed over the years are used to be a slept in the bedroom that was it now bedrooms are almost can be almost like a secondary family room in some cases we watch a lot of TV and their kids are studying playing video games any new thoughts ideas for remodeling bedroom\nYou know we're at right now bedroom a carpet is still the number one is that yeah that you see on the news is competing and winning that the advances that they've made a carpet of over the last several years\nIs is they're getting to the carpet sooner lot softer they almost feel like silk and yes some of them are called silk\nCarpet and and nothing feels better when you get out of bed in the morning and you put your bare feet on a nice soft carpet and and and and it's warm for you so we're\nStill seeing in in the bedroom situations carpet\nIs still the number one choice but we're seeing people go and more with a softer type of carpets feels better when they get out of bed\nI looked at some in in in your peers store in Missoula\nAnd it it almost felt like a teddy bear I mean it\nWas just so soft and nights now does that go\nHigher up in price or they they do start off at a little bit higher price and you can get into those for\nYou know the the two fifty to three dollar price range and on up and a lot of it just depends on how that can help you want the carpet and holler juries short and then you can get into those soft yarns for up to fifty to three dollars on a\nOkay well we're going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going

that many Democrats today have been targeted by bombs\nCNN was sent a bomb bill and Hillary Clinton were sent a bomb but rock Hussein Obama was sent a bomber George Soros was sent a bomb yesterday Eric Holder has been since a bomb and\nDebbie ... shows the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee was also set debate recipient of a bomb or two of the bombs that were sent had her address as the return address made the looked like she\nHad sent the the bombs are we here at the E R B network are very concerned and as I stayed at the beginning of our program we condemn\nThe use of bombs in politics we\nDo not condemn the use of bombs in war such as declared hostilities but\nWe declare and clearly condemn the use of bombs in\nAmerican politics or any other domestic circumstance but clearly America has become a very dangerous place for\nDemocrats what can we do to protect our Democrats what can we do to help ensure the safety of our democratic friends and it seems to me\nThe best way to ensure their safety is to get them removed as often as possible from public life\nAnd the most available\nWay to offer this assistance the most immediate opportunity we have to offer this assistance will occur in just under two weeks the mid term elections with Democrats under siege Democrats under assault like this\nIt would only be\nResponsible and compassionate to vote them out of office and to remove them from the public sphere in which they exist and are for some reason being targeted here\nWho is it a story and who has studied American politics and

have instincts and I I ... process information like everybody else and I'm just telling you I I don't know how things are going to end up but I Do know that none of this is the way the Democrats in

big trouble um\nNBC Wall Street Journal poll Politico these kinds of places are pulling back from it I don't think there ever was going to be a blue wave this is my point I think we've been lied to\nWe've had a media soap opera a narrative that has been part of the effort to defeat Trump at Republicans for the last year starting with the generic ballot last December so uh it it ... regardless however the Democrats are telling a story themselves however they're lying or whatever it isn't\nIt isn't unfolding as they expected they expected to be able to make a blue wave happen just by predicting it just by talking about it just by reporting stories made the looked like it was happening QuickTime out we will continue your phone calls on the other side\nSays we humans are showing

this cycle present some unusual risks\nFor pollsters out in the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all this down for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep\nThe Democrats to massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months drive buys assuring\nEverybody every day Democrats are going to crush it\nYeah it's gotta be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans\nNow polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge\nAnd guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen Hillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up\nOr at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys gonna miss late change the story written before the bombs could it happen again it probably won't don't worry about Bloomberg submitted\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border vi intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the Swedes here is really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats to allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously a set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose [noise]\nThere's a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here you Democrats have got to stop opposing Trump just to oppose Trump's\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and paid for this if that if that's true\nThen Venezuela also means Iran and the ...\nSponsored and paid for this if that if that's true then Venezuela also means Iran and the ... folks\nA lot of people on our side them jumped St George Soros there may be\nBut if it Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying is Venezuela if it's Venezuela it's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates didn't let those people in for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not where the American people are right now\nThe only commonsense fickle thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore ... saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security this doesn't help us a mob of seven thousand ten thousand people starving to gauge demanding to be let in that doesn't help us\nWhatever now do you say oh this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickled kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\n[noise] my point is [laughter] [noise] none of this is panning out the way it was planned no blue wave\nI ... don't misunderstand I don't know what's gonna I'm not saying that the Democrats may not\nWin the house but I I don't think that going to [noise]\nI I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it because I never fall for the left wing media conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary groupthink narrative of the moment whatever it is\nBut it's more than that there was nothing happening in America right now than argues electing Democrats not in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in mass there's no reason\nTo vote Democrat they're even giving people reasons to vote for the all they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump because Trump's what he's aboard he treats his ah is the bad guy his whatever whatever is\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying Kevin on his family sending rice in what looked like rice in the Susan Collins all these monsters nothing the Democrats are doing\nThat's the kind of thing you do to build a movement in a decent society and I still believe that we have one\nI Believe are decent society is under siege everyday are decent society standard and good old normalcy is under assault everyday led by pop culture and leftist in Hollywood\nIn Silicon valley and the drive by media where under assault every day but they have not overturned it yet they have not gotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal there's just nothing out there to me\nThat would have people excited about voting for Democrats because the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republicans\nAh I just I don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the charts you're not in less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you\nCouple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you flip the scenario what sense does it make for a conservative Republican the gum up the works here

I've taught people to do that and I said oh wow there yes\n[laughter] yes look at a target and let the scope intercept your vision just bring it up to keep staring at the target don't try to look at the scope ... that's when it gets hard to find something out of the exactly yeah but yeah to your point if you have a variable scope keeping on low power pretty much all the time until you absolutely need the higher\nPower exactly as always always always carry in the field on low power right so you can find a dark you know he's crank it up if you have to write you got to find a\nTarget for if you have it on to power and that big bucks jumps up ten feet from your starts running off just waved to if you're going to let it get dizzy ... or something yeah that's right ... thanks for the show I appreciate that\nAnd it also works very well on running targets which I perhaps deal more often than I should but the uh what was your week shooting background you can kind of enjoy that and and so you try to target with your eyes you're looking right at it as it's going and you bring the rifle up almost year\nAlmost to your shoulder and you keep looking at target and you bring to bring the rifle your shoulder there it is both\nProbably more than one coyote has met his demise that went with us at the trigger perhaps if you have a few times so we did not shooting forty five Seventy loud and groomer because why you said we didn't have enough earplugs to go out\nOf airplanes go around it as part of it is very loud\nVery loud but we did shoot my not very loud\nGotten oh my goodness what a beauty\nThat and that's fun to have this is a fully an interplay suppressed Ruger ten twenty two and we're using ... sonic ... in it and\nIt's only allowed if you're the one shooting it because you're right next to the boat is it snaps back and forth that's the loudest sound it makes ... ... ... ... if you're standing or ten feet away\nYou're just not hearing much of it you're actually hearing the bullet hit out there yeah more so than your new thing that the rifle absolutely it just a beautiful little right everybody wanted to shoot [laughter] ... well no because you're not really that familiar with firearms and I'm afraid\n[laughter] ... well no because you're not really that familiar with firearms [laughter] I'm afraid [laughter] no\nGuy was so much fun I um I think once you start shooting suppressed guns you kind of think why would I Do anything else how it gets addictive yeah and\nWhat a great way to start people out\nFor sure because it did take some of the intimidation of the of the noise and of course that rival is no recall either way but to a ... so many people are more intimidated by the sound and they would like to admit\nRight no absolutely you ever thought about how many people you talked to shoot\nOh gosh time it has to be in the thousands I put on a huge clinics and for years and years and years and years and now it's it's more individual or or families and stuff and I taught a lot of ah\nChildren of friends of mine and uh it's it's ... am at the point in my life where I have more joy out of seeing them shoot than ah than myself and uh and of course my grandchildren [laughter]\nYes that's that's fine okay so we talked about is an awful lot is every time we talk about teaching people to shoot one of the first subjects that pops up because I dominance it's one of the first things you do in\n... the first thing I Do because I've I've primarily teach shotgun and if you are shooting a shotgun\nAnd your shoulder it on your non dominant I side just forget it it ain't gonna work and everybody's got ideas you put a patch over that you're blends of that ... of your glasses and all of that and you can actually train somebody to be\nSomewhat more proficient that way why not just switch over to the proper side and say oh no I'm right handed well you're left eye dominant and with a shotgun your eye is the backside\nOf the roost site yes that's right and to fight it is used to fight it for your entire life exactly never ... you know so yes it is going to feel awkward when things I've said is look I understand that it feels awkward to put a gun to your left shoulder but if you're writing it down\nSo get a BB gun get a plastic going to get something passed up there have it in your house and shoulder to a hundred times a day and just bring it up put your shoulder as soon as I can feel awkward and after a week won't feel awkward\nYes yes absolutely and I recently I was a teaching the young lady she was sixteen years old\nAnd a daughter of a good friend of mine and she wanted to get a shotgun shooting in and he had taken a rifle shooting\nAnd hunting for years and she was pretty good rifle shot that she's looking through a scope with their non dominant I got you choose the right hand as soon as she's right handed down and left I don't know a pick that up in the first two seconds right and she said I Can't I Can't sweat says no and that's what all of them\nI guess the lessons over I said why don't we just tried as you called her blog she shot about uh uh well I won't elongate this story but a a liver out in the field just shooting off but there are\nAnd shout about twenty shots and it was getting frustrated\nAnd then her dad but target on this or a crooked or something went wrong I don't know and in what way off to the side and she just swung over and just smoke the target [laughter] she stopped a man who she just one of them are exactly the uh that she turned out to be an excellent shooter she went from\nA he asked me to teach her because she couldn't hit anything with a shotgun he didn't realize what the problem rice and turned out to be a wonderful shooter and she said to me\nI'll perhaps a month later after she got into some competitive leading shooting\nAnd turned out to me a wonderful shooter and she said to me oh perhaps a month later after she got into some competitive leading shooting she came to me it was literally with tears in her eyes said thank you so much I I Would have never been able to do this right and and she was became very competitive\nWow oh oh I Know one of the things that you said in a when you teach ... is the same young woman says and you were going to get a lot of the vice when you're covering the different ... young young girls you taught to shoot\nAnd it just for those you know and when you get there people are going to be trying to help you out oh you need to shoot it this way are you shooting behind you're not leaving I was always you're not leaving your if you should pull the trigger before the ... were surrounded still so you're not leaving [laughter]\nIsn't that the truth [laughter]\nSo I talk for a justice that were about a minute about the concept of lead is feet or speed is ... well\n... ... this came about it so much in skate shooting where the old timers and say this station as a two foot late this was a three foot lead that was a four foot laid well that's\nBS I'm Sorry but uh it it's how fast you're moving the barrel and there are people like waiting may is who you're going to stand behind and watch him shoot skate is probably the world's greatest ever ... and it looks like he's shooting behind the target\nLike he's part of the trigger while they're still behind the target yeah but the bills are moving that bad arrow is\nMoving so fast that he is building the late in and he knows how to do it and and so the only time that works is with a sustained league which means you have to know exactly where the darkness at all times which you can do that and ski but then you ... you get off that field and ... year in a sporting class field you can hit the ground\nAnd for hunting forget about it absolutely you know so it it's ... it's barrel speed\nSo when somebody says well that's about a two foot lead just take that and throw it away because of your mind if you're just like not to thank you very much appreciate that and then flush it out of your brain exactly the just the speed barrels be built and the other thing that happens if you're sick and barrel speed it makes a really hard to stop your barrel yes\nBecause when you stop you barrels that's a hundred percent guaranteed you were going to every time\nAnd that is the number one if I had to pick one thing that people do as a mistake shooting a shotgun on flying targets uh-huh as I stopped again they get to their their rifle shooter so they want that target to hold still\n... so if I see some of these are compared to ... exaggerate their follow through ... and and that is that a way of making sure you keep swimming a\nBarrel through while a part of it is I don't teach that but no but I you know what do you do need to follow through but yes absolutely positively and and uh\nAnd if some people are very accomplished at that and they've got that system down for their particular style I don't teach a surge at the ... right uh some some people do right some people do teach that\nAll right the other thing is a good wink shooting instructor commit all the difference do it and you're just you'd be amazed\nAt how much how am I getting was it could change your whole your whole shooting last ... change to like just like you so much food or probably pull you back you a little bit later in the show that work for all right we're open lines if you'd like to call the eight six six talk\nWhen we come back when we talk about gun fighting and\n\nAgain a reminder New York times Rush Limbaugh Elizabeth Warren is only possibly one one thousand twenty fourth and point zero nine percent Indians and the the average European American is zero point one the eight percent I don't want to and she is less than half\nAs much Native American is your average European American\nWe do tend to hand him on the news talk Ninety five point five\nAnd I wasn't prepared to be a caregiver to moms\nWithout fail a that that\nThat Wednesday morning lecture on mindset is probably the most important the lecture you get a gun site because it teaches you that color code in those seven friends called the personal the ants and makes you alert and aware so again instead of walking down the street like so many people are with their head in there I found\nI wasn't I wasn't going to say anything other than what their head and their iPhones are\nCompletely unaware of what's going on around them and that criminal is out there waiting sitting there thinking that's got to be an easy target when they come out of gun site they're headed up their alert or looking around and that criminal if that thing else thanks you know\nAll white there'll be an easy one for\nOur people see this bad guy or recognize something that is that that uh six cents that women's intuition that air stand on the back of your neck and recognize that I think I Need to go across the street or I'll I'll Wait and go out in the parking lot lighter and and that saves that confrontation and that is perch\nYou know you get at least two big benefits out of paying attention one you could spot what's going on in time to avoid it or to escape from the situation the other is if you can avoid it\nHaving a heads up and have a head start on going ahead and get yourself into a fighting position whatever that entails whether it's you know guns shelter whatever it is\nThe three seconds can make all the difference as we've seen or time and time again and videos now body cam video ... a law enforcement officers\nAnd I think that you cannot like to get to talk about this I got to take a quick break come back we'll talk about what people don't understand about gun starting and attacks and maybe first step would be how fast\nThings happened we're talking with Ken Campbell from gun site academy out in Arizona G.

about the background noise but I Know you find it hard to believe that I'm Joe and day out of the cleanup I ended up\nAbout some of those people in the world of course you know they're they're American ... wearing a gotcha so is there anything in particular that you're looking for\nBargains are way [laughter]\nI ... and your people say well I don't really know what I'm looking for but I'm going to go look at things and that's something that may just speak to me\nSocial event to you know you run into people that you know ... and that's always enjoyable\nExcellent I mentioned before we went to the break the idea that the one of the things I think people don't fully appreciate\nAnd it may be one of the big differences between law enforcement folks and people who are not law enforcement is how quickly a situation you go from everything's fine to wholly you know it it it just it happened so quickly doesn't it\nIt does and I can speak to that and my my dark hair days at thirty five years a law enforcement or in the training aspect of it here or or simply look to what what what's been known as the cooler drill ah\nAh for many years um if you don't see what's happening to you or you aren't aware that something might be happening you're behind a power curve and trying to catch up and get ahead of that bad guy get inside ... your your chances of being successful in in that by a lot of at it it is very very low\nUm colonel Cooper ... has been speaking about that for years and his color code white yellow orange red so that if you're in condition of why that that's me and my lazy boy at home with a glass of sweet tea or on on the table and and I've got a golden doodle sitting there next to me ... rubbing their head that condition white\nBut a minute I crossed my threshold I go into condition yellow so I'm alert and aware of what's going on around me because when ... when it happens to me it it's got to be very quick and I've got to be ahead of that our curb so I can get the get uh\nCaught up in and get past that the actions that bad guy or a reaction is always slower than an actor\nHere it's interesting you said when and not yes it happens and I remember and I don't remember if I heard of the gun sign of some of the place but I always liked it they said look\nWhen you put your gun on in the morning before you leave the house you don't say you know today may be the day you start off you say today is today I Am going to need that and that\nActually cuts down your reaction time because you started the reaction before you've left the house\nAbsolutely it around that is in the chamber right now is the one that will save my life\nAnd have and I've got to go out with that aspect and and and it's not an exhausting thing it's not like we're we're walking down the aisles of who you know whatever our favorite or\nA retailer is or what you know ... ready to go but I'm alert I'm aware I got my head up it's honestly level I Want to see what's going on around me I Want to pay particular attention to what's behind me because miscreants right from the rear but I I like that I'm like that fighter pilot or that that that\nA bomber pilot I got my radar going I Want to know what's around me all over the place and and again I got to go back to that that six cents that women's intuition if something doesn't feel right in my prior career we called that clue\nAnd you got to be it you got to trust that and when something doesn't feel right pay even more attention to see what that is until you got a reason to stand down or you've got a reason for that to relax um or you for\nThe ... gone away because you moved out of that environment you've got you've got to address that feeling\nI put it in another way I tell people is a hope will get you killed and so what do you mean as you walk down the street you see are sure hope those guys aren't as bad I Hope they're coming over here I sure hope they don't mean to hurt me oh I'm going across the street they cross the street kinda sure hope that you know at a certain point and I would say early on\nYou have to just say okay that as you say that doesn't feel right now I'm going to start taking action immediately and a lot of times the actually take is simply to remove yourself from the situation\nAnd it never becomes an attack or a life threatening situation at all but ... it's because you had the rain or run it\nAbsolutely and\n... an attack or a life threatening situation at all but ... it's because you had the right around it\nAbsolutely ... and ... when this miscreants sees that you've seen them and you're giving them some attention and yeah and I've got to think they're going to thank you know there's another one white\n... yeah they're they're they're wait for the uh the easier praise that comes along\nSkin or for the the five day or two fifty class at gun site I Know you guys running a whole bunch of them now it's one that can take you and I want to tell people you don't have to be gunfire go there you can be you could actually have never fired a gun and start with that class can injure\nAbsolutely you can come with a brand new gun in a box or or rent one from us and I'm not saying that\nTo make some rental income I'm saying that is if you don't know what kind of goes back to you if you can rent one from us by the end of the week you'll be an informed consumer and that way you can go on a daily oh and you can find the gun you're looking for and get that back price as an informed consumer", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh
