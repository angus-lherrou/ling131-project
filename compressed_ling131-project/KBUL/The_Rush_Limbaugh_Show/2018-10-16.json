tour in range\nThe phone determines everything that watch those when they are separated when the watches out of range of the phone that's when you have to know how the watch can independently connect the networks and I just got through telling you how difficult it is\nWhen there's no way out to eat an apple has not activated LTV service for watches in Turkey yet\nSo it would have had to have been wife I went ahead of in the white find that work at a concert and it would have had to have a password entered on that\nWatch I'm saying the odds of this I don't think\nMost people with a watch nowhere to go into the password nor how to do it you can't dictate that you have to you have to use the rebel app and use your finger to draw individually every character that's in the password\nAnd if you try to make AT T\nAnd it comes out as a plus sign that you have to know to back it up as you did it wrong it's not an easy thing to do [noise] and I just I don't [noise] I I'm a long way of

then I'm further more I'd be shocked if the Saudis didn't stop on that watching destroy it\nIf\nThey saw that he was wearing it so I don't think there's going to be video or audio I'm Sorry or whatever happened to Jamal can show me a Casey in sand point Idaho welcome great to have you here Hi\nHey thanks rash you walk up\nI was the one that touch on why I think there might be a red wave instead of ... and that's because for years and years we've been told that we find in the media and establishment and whoever else that we needed to go with mark and a moderate candidates like John McCain and Mitt Romney\nYeah yeah exactly right look we're that got us yeah in two thousand so national if I Will\nIn two thousand six throughout a guy named Donald Trump come down an escalator and we were fed the same talking points of light couldn't win and with our backs against the law on election night we all showed up to the polls for the the greater good of thanks and recruit the media and everybody else wrong and I believe that that gave the conservatives\nA confidence and I think that they're going to show up and a greater force because we've been told that it has got to be the wave of Morgan proven wrong country thousands of a case\nThat's what a lot of people are hoping that there is a sophistication sophistication level among two thousand sixteen voters that tells them how necessary it is to go out and vote in whatever way but we'll continue to support Trump because that's really what this is about\n...\nMaybe I'm going to do this starts tomorrow Thursday I don't know which yet but I it it's it's it's about time to go through the west and the Republicans have this list but when they made their own of what to expect if the Democrats win the house and it is brutal and I don't have any doubt\nThat everything on the Republican list is true\nThey're going to every committee in the house is going to be used to investigate something Trump has done or some body image administration it is going to be unlike anything we've ever seen every day of the Trump Administration is going to be investigated and subpoenaed\nThat's all the Congress is going to be doing is investigating and indicting that's all they're going to be doing that's all that's going to happen\nThe Senate Republicans hold it so legislation is going to get ... there's going to be total gridlock nothing's going to get done none of Trump's judges will get past his lips\nAfter he nominates them\nSo yeah it's going to require a lot of voters to understand this but you said conservatives the Trump coalition is not\nJust conservatives there are a lot of Democrats who voted for Trump there are a lot of independents that voted for Trump there are a lot of moderates that voted for Trump there he got he got people from every demographic spread\nAnd some of the Trump people were not ardent Trump supporters they were frustrated didn't like anybody at all and fought they would go for the biggest change they could\nBut not every Trump voter was a make America great again advocate so how many of those are still happy\nWith their votes how many of those realize that for what they voted for to continue Trump has to remain free of investigation I mean look what the deep states when able to do when they don't even run the show\nThe deep state the executive branch which Trump runs look what they've been doing just imagine the Democrats' controlling every house committee agriculture intelligence foreign affairs foreign this foreign whatever a judiciary\nThey're not going to stop a drug they're going to try to get capping off thrown off the Supreme Court they're going to bring back balls the board that whole thing\nAnd I I haven't even remembered ten percent of what they're going to do that's where I'm going to make the list but it's a it's\nEasily predictable it's a no brainer but I'm I'm I'm here to tell you that the objective is going to be\nThe force Trump out of Washington DC as soon as they can they don't want to wait for reelection campaign and funny funny they don't want that they are they going to do every thing they can\nTo make sure that the Trump
