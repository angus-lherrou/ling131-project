you Russia to honor to talk to you thank you so much I have a comment and then something personal share okay I've listened and watch\nWhat I can uh at the hearing I Can't help but think what ... ... a woman what would they have come up with that\n[noise] a Trump almost did her name is Amy Coney Barrett and she will be next\nA [noise] theoretically it was a toss up and it was decided to go to Kevin are because they thought it would be easier with capital with this record or that the Democrats will be loaded for bear against a woman because this is Amy Coney Barrett when she\nDid her confirmation hearings for her current position on the court Dianne Feinstein said to her the dog ... is thick with you isn't it meaning\nBut rape victims in sexual abuse victims um it depends on on on the victims some of them have vivid recall of every detail like this and some some uh some don't but I heard they range a and descriptions of the house Senate placement of people there who all deny it\nUh and the timing of all if you put this whole package together\nIt just [laughter]\nAnd the reason for it to keep a conservative off the Supreme Court I just don't think any of this a spontaneous happenstance [laughter] [noise] I don't think Feinstein just received\nA letter she didn't know it was coming just don't believe it can't prove it just don't believe it I don't believe he's minding our own business one day at a letter from a constituent who said I don't want to be known I don't want to be named and I don't want this taken any further\n[noise] well that that it just it just it doesn't make any sense unless\nYou put it in the proper context of what the express purpose of this is which I happen to believe is forcing Kavanaugh to resign to withdraw or for Trump to withdraw from I think it was beginning to unravel because Trump and Kevin all have hung in and buy unravel I mean be exposed\nFor the phone is that much of it is any weight Suzie I'm Glad you called thank you thank you very much Miami, Florida next Robert your up great to have you\n[noise] hey Russia that it was from a lifelong will soon and I've been listening to you for Thirty years [noise] um I just want to thank you for everything you do for the country and especially your\nLeukemia and lymphoma a song that you do once a year which the fantastic it I mean a lot to me [laughter] thank you sir [laughter] my question is what's what do you think is going on with the mother pro because it ... if you\nDon't well now there's an interesting question what's going on with the mother probably has the latest I heard the caller probe they the story actually has a sentence in it the\nSpecial counsel's office and Robert Mueller to third us choir most in\nMost most honest man in the ... what it is shedding prosecutors\nShedding process now when your cat or dog sheds it means losing hair a mother is losing prosecutors meaning they're they're they're the jobs on those not in their ... their ... their moving away and they're going off to other things there's less and less for his team of Trump haters\nTo what to do I'll just repeat what I said at the very opening of the program I don't think this tax story would have run today\nIf Mahler we're still hot on the trail and had something\nAnd if the Ford story weren't beginning to unravel the New York times story wouldn't ... when I saw on drudge this massive New York times during my first reaction is remember folks I Am a student of the media and the left\nNothing happens by accident the times didn't just fit\nStudents of the media and the left\nAnd nothing happens by accident the times didn't just finished the story by deadline last night there by making it able to be published have been holding it\nThey've been working on it for a year and they've been coordinating with the Showtime network they've been producing a documentary for the past year documenting how the times found it how they reported it how they print it out I wrote it\nThe fact that this thing was released and published last night for today\nFirst reaction I had was a cabinet thing must really be unraveling 'cause it's time now to turn attention to Trump\nFrom a new angle\nAnd it's not really new its taxes the latest news correct me on this Mr ... if you've seen somebody more recent but the last story I saw on this is that Mahler [laughter] [noise]\nI don't know what to believe in it if that Muller is showing various people Roger Stone emails texts and asking them what they know about it\nWe're down now to Roger Stone\nIn an investigation that started with everybody thinking Trump cheated with\nRussia and Muller was the guy that was going to find it and when we got Trump's tax returns we were going to see\nThat it's important\nThat enabled Trump to hold onto his money and get more of it Trump's wealth is directly tied to illicit activity with Russia while there isn't any Russian anything in the New York times story\nSo [noise] um [noise]\nWe're getting down to the nitty gritty I'd ... you know ethics\nSay that a special counsel should not right and release a report within this close proximity to an election [noise] ah because of the impact that it would have and\nThey of course are ah unbiased and the only objective in the Justice Department and they're not about affecting the outcome of elections I which is all they've been trying to do it for\nTwo years [noise] I wouldn't be surprised if they released a report you know a couple of days before the election which excoriated Trump for irresponsibility excoriated for a bad attitude excoriated for having really really shady friends and all that but does it accused him of anything\nIf it's not supposed to happen before the election that's when it probably will happen\nIs the way these people operate but maybe it won't outside of that\nI'm like everybody else I don't know what Mueller has I don't know what he's going to repeal I don't know what he's going to report 'em\n... zero not at all I Know is that the drive by media of decided to try to make something else a bigger story today than the Kavanaugh story [laughter]
