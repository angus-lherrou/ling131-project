Jennifer Rubin it's amazing that transformation this woman has made the Washington Post hired her as a conservative blogger\nDuring the Obama years during the Obama years for the most part she came across as a conservative bloc and then when Trump gets elected she became I think what she's always been just a diet and the cast in the wool liberal\nAnd now she has a the still the conservative columnist or blogger at the post but she's not conservative and MSNBC reversed or that way but that's not the point I couldn't tell the story without mentioning her name\nShe says that GOP senators are behaving as if it's their time of the month\nNow\nThat to me he goes a little deeper than what it just sounds like here on the surface\n\nImagine a conservative saying on MSNBC the female Democrat senators were being so emotional almost hysterical behaving as if it's their time in the months does anybody think that\nWould fly there is no way\nA male commentator anywhere can say that about women senators are women witnesses or any of us sort but here's Jennifer Ruben and by using this this this analogy\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition that elected Trump needed\nSomething outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms in other words in her study of things just continuing to vote for a Party Republicans to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there\nDon't know why I Would think it would be but she says it's not\nKavanaugh however has provided the capitalist because of how Trump voters ... percent specifically the conservative populists coalition perceive the way he is being treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nThat the Trump conservative populace coalition is tired and worn out\nThe way they and things they believe in are treated by Democrats the media and Hollywood and her point is that\nThe targets of range have somewhat diminished until cabin all came along and re awaken these people and fired them back up\nSo she says this is what I see in a nutshell what happened to Kavanaugh has served as a reminder Anna highlights\nTo the people that voted for Trump why he's successful that it's all about being strong it help remind voters why they supported him\nAnd the other Republican president would have walked away from cabinet by now energy would have been lost but it's not energy is high [noise] now that's again that Salinas Ito and her analysis of the electorate today\nHeading into the two thousand sixteen thousand Eighteen midterms now where I Will she knows what she's talking about I find it strange that people who I think the people who voted for Trump are deeply involved with things\nNow maybe there are some exceptions and you have some people will vote for Trump to just set up with Republicans and Democrats and sound Trump interesting but for the most part I Am of the opinion that Trump voters did so for a very very very specific reasons related to Trump's agenda which he\nHounded every day\nMultiple times a day Donald Trump told everybody what he was going to do trade deals the wall immigration rebuild a military bring back the economy\nI Would think people have voted for Trump knew that that's what\nTrade deals the wall immigration rebuild the military bring back the economy\nI Would think people have voted for Trump knew that that's what he's going to do and I would also think that people who voted for Trump would realize that he needs more than two years to do it\nBut is her insistent know that kind of stuff it evaporates and wanes you know people's lives do on the news changes but at this\nCamp on a circus has re ignited the coalition that electing Trump\nAnd this is to the detriment of the Democrats or don't see this happening\n\nShe says the Senate could indeed say a red wave the house she's not so sure of\nIowa I found it interesting analysis and I I'm One of his
