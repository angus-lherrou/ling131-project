today with the Sandra Smith on Fox question what can you tell us what you're seeing the way the president's responding to this what are your thoughts as this mob makes its way of the border\nThe president made no bones about it and uh actually he can take his lead from the Democrats a Democrat name Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite presidents but and I think sixteen ... gangs came across\nThe border and New Mexico and killed a bunch of people\nAnd not only did he put Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's aren't going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this\nBasically is an invasion and it needs to stop and Louis continued to close the more you gotta stop bogus asylum claims and\nBasically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from\nAnd also we need to\nRemember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not made and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so water Malala El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim and Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps the they do I talk to the lawyer he'll talk about Japanese talkative Jeff I won't even know who is who you're talking about Jeff Sessions with Jeff Sessions of big money is that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great points\nThey already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find

advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this\nFrankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage that the American people realize their mistake electing Trump but the Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason\nThe two thousands actually in midterms the American people were all of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't believe it but we got media narratives that a gigantic ball\nLet's take say made and put Democrats back in power I don't believe it but we got media narratives that a gigantic blue way of what's gonna happen and we had that\nMedia narrative go on from December last year all the way through\nSeptember of this year and then and then the generic ballot started type thing and then it began to look\nMaybe it won't be as big a blue\nWave and Republicans look like they might actually gain seats in the Senate and\nOh no now the president's approval numbers is higher than it's ever been CNN's\nOn poll forty four percent Rasmussen has trumpet fifty one there is nothing happening that\nSuggests say blue wave is happening I frankly don't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth\nI eat election day people have to start revealing in these mad and kept for addictions projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can for the sake of their business\nThere in the polling business they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all of that's the case who would hire them\nSo now we're told well there's been a shift a little man it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways that Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republicans can hold the house\nForeign ways they could lose the house well a month ago there was no way the Republicans were going to hold out\nNow all of a sudden we're starting to see it as a blue wave may not I don't think you'd ever did I don't think he ever did exist I think it made up\nManufactured you don't get the poll result you want depending on when you take the pole and who you decide\nTo put in your sample there is no way\nThere is simply no way that a political party openly promoting this invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide when\nThe American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more illegal immigration\nThe American people in a majority no matter how you slice it are not asking for a political party\nTo stop paying attention to the border and let everybody who wants him in the American people are not there at the American people never been there the Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\n\nGoing through your own poll wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border let anybody wants to come in and I can guarantee you less than ten percent of the people are going to say yes and yet\nThey can look at a drive by news media every day and you would get the impression is a lot of Americans that a lot of people to support this idea of\nThese are so poor people there Thursday in Hungary way to make sure we have so much they have so little\nWe know what the that's not a\nPosition it's going to win elections if it were we would have had amnesty back in two thousand two\n\nIf that was the position of a majority American people Donald Trump ... never gotten the Republican nomination\nIf the people of this country wanted mobs of seven thousand or a thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked to be granted asylum truck when I never got the nomination he certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think we'd go stop\nYou know what Trump was wrong\nHe certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think we'd go up\nYou know what Trump was wrong\nWe don't need a wall this proves we just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they want and let them yet and we should feed them we should house than they have nothing to report are coming from ... countries let them that's not a majority opinion of the United states\nThe media is going to try to make people think that way I look like they're mean spirited cold hearted heartless and all this but it's not the case\nThat is not an accurate description of the American people\nSo I I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in trouble because he wants to build a wall that he's in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the border\nAnd yet the media reliably very subtly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote unquote caravan\nTrying to find a way to make
