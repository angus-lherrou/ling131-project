she is seen falling asleep at the court says there's nothing wrong with that as a\nA N K given was there the Harvard law school dean who way back when hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard Elena Kagan who now says I don't think he should be on the court I I'm not sure that this is going to do the court any good [noise]\nUm Justice Thomas was there a whole bunch of people Anthony Kennedy who is a Kevin O's replacing and here is the president of the United states will start to hear an audio soundbites seven he has apologized shouldn't be Kavanaugh on behalf of the nation\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who step forward just serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation [noise] not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nJust calling them out this Trump is right this is not done what normally when you get to the ceremony will swearing in\nYour follow the script and all of that is in the past it's not to be referenced again the fight is over everybody acknowledges that the result is the result we're moving forward except that's not the way it is anymore the Democrats are not stopping the fights not over to them\nThe Democrats are openly promising to impeach capital other openly promising to continue investigate Kevin on\nThey are openly talking about packing the court if they win the house of representatives should not a fire the or the power capital has asked the fifth so called conservative justice on the court they're not pulling back at all this is one of the world over\nAnd so Trump is calling them out and I told you folks this is crucial we don't I Can't think of any former president would ever do anything like this in defense of his nominee in defense of his principles I Can't think of one who would do it\nAnd it's just as important with the Trump do this as it was important when Trump at a rally explained to the American people what the American media has not told them when he resigned at the essence of her testimony\nThat it wasn't a drive by something he was mocking laughter malls before he wasn't mocking he was simply informing the American people what the media was holding from them that she couldn't tell anybody where it happened she couldn't tell them when it happened she wasn't sure where the house was\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required if you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do\nIf you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up\nWith this then that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nThe rest of it the history onyx the child like wailing immaturity is the result of the liberals socialist mindset on people young people immature children that don't get their way already suffering psychological disorders of one way one kind or another\nVideo and video of these kids\nOn Saturday afternoon literally calling at the door is that the Supreme Court they get in\nTo try to stop the real swearing in they were literally clawing at the doors\nThere wasn't any humanity and miss this wasn't just raw hatred and fear\nCoupled with massive site disorders all of it promoted not denounced\nAll of it promoted and encouraged by the powers that be and the media and the Democrat Party and the ... of the left\nI've been saying what a decent people do in response to these people are worried\nErnie and the ... of the left\nAs I've been saying what a decent people do in response to the different people or we're we're not going to become them\n\nThey may have as an objective the real one nation and total human destruction of their opponents that's us\nDo not doubt me on this that may sound a little extreme to those of you that are here on the periphery but do not doubt me that is their objective total destruction and ruin nation\nWell how do we find that these people are not going to try to ruin their political opponents going to try to beat them but we're not going to become who they are we don't have an image to become who they are so given that how are they stopped it's a serious question\nIf they are willing to do anything including ... facto career and life political murder\nJust stop things they don't want to stop people that they don't want how do you how do you oppose them how to beat that back\nThen you do it with decency to do it with politeness do you do it with ... I'm\nSorry I'm going to cut it sorry never Trump or is bought the right manners and ... and so forth isn't going to cut it some people might say Russia ... the church is rock solid the churches where enduring about [noise]\nUh not anymore the churches are like every other institutions sucking up\nThe people they hold power everybody needs money churches need money all kinds of people need money and if the people are going to give you money demand that you be a certain way and be open to certain things and you're going to do it this is happy to take a look at your papa\nAnd what's even happening to the Catholic Church in places serious serious problem when talking about the preservation of what I call our way of life underneath the umbrella of decency\nSo we're very lucky we have somebody willing to push back against it from the highest\nLevels of power in the country Donald Trump fear loosely pushes back on it are caused amount identifies them\nThey're not used to this they don't know how to react to it media is the greatest illustration of that not knowing how to react to being called out for what you really are\nI mean their bodies accused the media being biased over the years but nobody accuses them of fake making it up\nParticipating in the open and want to ruin nation of people nobody ever accuses them of that and I'm not I mean we may hear but its highest levels that governs never happened before there's Donald Trump doing it and from the East Room of the White House here is more Trump last night\nThis really triggered him when he declared Kavanaugh innocent\nWhat happened to the cabinet or a family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process [noise] our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\nAnd with that I must say that use are\nUnder historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank\nMargaret analyze\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness encourage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens\nYou know what that is I'm Sorry never Trump per se but that's just pure class\nTo take the time to look at those two little girls and tell them that their father is a great man in the midst of all of this the president of the United states taking time out to tell those two\nYoung daughters of breath and actually Kavanaugh that your father is a great man every father wants to hear about every father loves having his children told\nThat he was a great man few ever are afforded that opportunity\nBut Trump did it last night then proclaiming Kevin O's innocence I mean that is akin\nTo taking all of poison the arrows at every Democrat launched it Kevin all the past two weeks and firing them back at once right down the throats of every Democrat Senator on the Judiciary Committee and every member of the media tried to ruin the capital\nTo openly proclaiming him innocent\n\nHe can't do that that wasn't a corner law he doesn't know but they had him guilty didn't say he was guilty simply on the basis of the allegation\n\nI Want to say one more time I don't believe anything that we went through the past two weeks starting with the realization that Christine ... boarded written a letter to die and find ... I don't think any of it was spontaneous\nAnd I don't think any of it was happenstance I think every bit of it was an orchestrated campaign just like every other October surprise in politics is\nI think the Democrats were in on it I don't know whether ... privacy was violated I don't know if she was in on it or is she was also a sewage\nBut somebody suggested she write that letter Monica McLean her buddy who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara who hates Trump the yesterday and why the United states attorney as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump Russia collusion\n\nI don't think they ever expected it to get as far as it did they thought Trump would pull back withdraw the nomination or the Kavanaugh would pull out\nAnd they would never get as far as soon as it got very it was\nClearly\nIllustrated she had no evidence no collaboration no nothing in their strategizing of this events I never thought I Would go that far\nOne of the reasons is there used to Republican presidents caving nominee gets in big trouble pull of nominations residents don't want the grief starts reflect\nPoorly on them they go to the nomination look [noise] it won't work nominate we can't sustain this you got to pull out nominees Assad damn it's my one sorry nominee I'm pulling my support nominee\nPresident get together for the good of the country blah blah blah blah nominee pulls out didn't happen here Trump refused to pull out withdraw ghetto capital that's where the gum up the works anyway I got to take a lot of brief time out just getting warmed up here\nOne when there's the novelty of all time Rush Limbaugh how many I\nWe're listening to Rush Limbaugh on this month\nFive point five when when you put a safe in your home what would you put in it what are your most\nDon't need five point five\nWhen when you put a safe in your home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one brand to say if you should trust to put it in your home and that's right oh saves\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America one of the main issue it takes skills sweat and talent to produce the most beautiful and secure or safe in the world and that's what rhino saves are beautiful creations that help keep your possessions secured part art\nPart furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nAnd the Democrats are not held accountable the same way Republicans are we have to\nLive the systems of justice\nLimbaugh we do have turned a handle on the news talk Ninety five point five from the bio safe environment studio this is ... you will am Nineteen Seventy ...

I'll get right\nTo the point I have one comment one question and comment is\nIt's going around this talking point that ah you know since his cabinet victory that the the president is teaching Republicans how to fight I actually think he's teaching the Democrats what it's like to lose and I don't think anybody's pick it up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd and the question I had was what do you think would happen\nIt 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media if instead of a blue wave if there was a red wave I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival uh and safety\nBecause I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like he's preparing for the Republicans to\nHold the Senate maybe even expanded their whole there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house in numbers we haven't seen and who knows how like since Nineteen Ninety four\nAnd I've been wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ... a\nMedia and and and polling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen that got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump is forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by trust shows them just even now after the Capitol hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\nThe Republican the I've got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it all but the Republican governor of California is is closer than is running if Gavin Newsom than anybody would ever have believed possible\nIf the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think Washington may be on the inhabitable for a while I I think we haven't\nKnow officer you know\nOur government money is separating the two parents that are born or I don't see them\nAnd the cops we fought ever say oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch this so well that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informed smarter\nWhat that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn in people with Avon so load block cab idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democratic Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nTrump in fact wrote an executive order to end it which was\nBeaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional lift the statute in America today says families will be separated\nManaged to protect the kids the reason for the reason for the separation is the parents are shoveled off in the holding cells while their cases are adjudicated\nSo I'm watching this stupid show and I see a guy who any under normal season will be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted into a queen size zero because he is rounding up kids that Trump is separating from their parents and saving them\nSo I went to the DVR and I cancelled law and order\nAnd you're SUV I get rid of that had been out there long enough twenty some odd years anyway so and they're all dropping\nLike this in it\nSo you really you think that\nTwo hundred nine Republican House seats up for grabs be cause people all over this country are fed up with Trump and the Republicans separating family [noise] [noise]\n\nWell\nUh\nBut that wasn't explained to hundred night services it's really a lot of Republican retirements what yeah committee chairman are retiring because their term limited\nForty three members are entire summer committed German and the reason they're quitting is because they don't want to go back to being average ordinary members when you're a committee chairman you got perks you got attention get t._v. time\nYou know you matter but when your term limited out of your chairmanship when you quit and you're part of your time there and the big bucks in the private sector\nYou know there are some Republican retirements that there are two hundred nine of them\nBut my my only point is for there to be this kind of blue wave forty four forty seven of retirements does not explain it not what the Democrats think they've got two hundred nine seats leaning in their favor\n\nOr you don't think it's policy ... ... people if this is all true there has to be something or a series of things\nThat the American public is just fit to be tied over and want to take it all out of Republicans as again the media to Democrats will tell you it's Trump the people's country hate Trump they're embarrassed of Trump but that's what they think\nThe evidence that the country hates Trump just isn't there in any even the even if you look at the leftist opinion polls at forty one percent approval that's not in the twenties where\nGeorge W.
