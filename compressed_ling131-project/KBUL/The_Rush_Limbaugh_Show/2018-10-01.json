security on a geometrical primary page and first three pages of grave host ... billion dollars\nAnd I are happy to be some kind of ethical issue what you can just accuse somebody without any kind of corporate evidence and then go public with that and raise you know that that amount of money as it is a very very properly thought it was a lot of fear factor there for people to make a call ... race\nYou are a lot of money by if you're crowding out\nAnd look this is a toughie uh in in a strict capitals sense she has identified a market and that is there are arranged lunatics who want her to be right\nTo hope she's telling the truth they want her to continue to speak and tell it's true they want her lawyers to continue to strategize and screw Kavanaugh they're happy\nTo pay for it it's just how they can be involved in politics beyond voting there are more than happy to pay it doesn't matter to them that she can afford her lawyers are self it doesn't matter to them that her lawyers are working pro bono because this is a political case\nSo she's identified a market there are people that want to support her with money so she starts in the Gulf on me page I actually think\nSomebody sent me a note today that uh go ... go off on me is now new money laundering\nIt's essentially money laundering operation for the Democrats much like the unions were a because there's a lot of this money going to go\nA lot of this money is going to go to these two lawyers who are then going to be where they are already involved and Democrat Party politics so it's just it's a it's a new form of

pages to raise money for their legal bills and other expenses\nAnd if you can convince the American people to support you\nWell I mean there's there's a I don't think there's anything immediate there can be done to stop it and I don't think that you can draw any conclusions about\nHer from it um in terms of whether she's being truthful or not or if you wanted to draw conclusions that the Gulf ... pages I'm I'm a way to get Democrats soccer's I eat voters\nTo pay for this other that doesn't cost people already have a lot of money anything then you could try to make that point\nThat the Democrats are using these poor people but I don't think you're going to be able to find a way to stop this too widely you Jeffrey in Sarasota, Florida Hi great to have you here saw what's up\nRussia just wanted to make a suggestion or an idea it's kind of a fantasy I don't think it would ever work but\nYou know the left is always behave like bullies and they'll do anything and they've never had real pushback from our representatives on the right in Washington so you know when you have no ethics and your dirty tactics I often they have benefits for you coupled with the fact that\nYou know you never have to suffer the consequences yourself like a bully there's no reason to stop when your tactics work there's no reason to stop [laughter]\nYou know fully as ever stopped until they get punched in the mouth that exactly maybe maybe it's time that you know we don't want to become them maybe let's say for a year I'd become them let's let's show them anything destructive they can do to other human beings it cannot\nRams set it it was great it was impassioned\nAnd that was the end of it\nIt was never to be heard again out of the mouth of any Republican and saw grams impassioned allegation of the Democrats was followed by agreement\nWith Jeff flakes\nTo me that the FBI be allowed to do one way but it has to get their fight and all of fine senator Graham's point and he even went along with with like\nYou can't do these things as one offs if you're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country what's really going on here you have to do it every day and you're going to have to do it multiple times a day it's going to have to become the central focus of your strategy on a day to day basis\nBut it never does we've had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republicans done a one off like that and it's been great and we have celebrated it and we shared it with your way to go and it ties\nExcept for here on TALK radio or maybe on Fox News but it dies\n\nWell Lindsey Graham didn't have to become them to do what he did he just had to be honest and he was\nLindsey Graham didn't have to\nWorry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people and by the way did you notice not one of them on the Democrats I cared aware about what Graham said none of even got mad at it\nNot a single one of them even wanted to refute if they didn't care when they get a rise out of them was winning Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter\nSo she turned around and asked her staff did you guys know they said they didn't Lincoln Mr German we didn't Lincoln I just asked my staff they said they did was\nOh what about an investigation huh well Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're going to investigate some of these other things that needs to be followed up on\nTheir needs to be followed through but I for one I Know investigations are innocent but I'm getting tired of because all they are for the way\n\nHow hard is it the stand up and say Brett Kavanaugh is credible enters the Nile\nHow why is that is so hard she didn't have any evidence that she made a credible witness how well she was really suffering and in may so\n\nNone of that stabbed Bush's credibility an attitude doesn't give us credibility\nCredibility Democrats are always in pain and suffering over something\nNow want to go back to my production\nMy original prediction was that if the Republicans\nDo not vote on this if they don't\nVote out capital that committee him he doesn't get voted on he's if he's not confirmed Republicans are going to have held a pay\nBecause voters are going to be fit to be tied being led down again\nThen the Democrats kept pulling stunts and it became\nConventional wisdom this keeps up Republican voters are going to get some kicked off Republican women and mothers are going to get so mad because they've got sons and they hate seeing what's happening in the capital they don't want to imagine that happening their own ... they're going to show up in droves well I Want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something\n\nIf Brett Kavanaugh just think about this is a hypothetical I'm not predicting if Brett Kavanaugh is not sworn in early next week\n\nIf you can hypothetically envisions a day\nWhere Kavanaugh is not confirmed not sworn in\nAre you going to be ... are you going to\nBe so mad that you can't wait to vote are you going to be so mad that you feel betrayed because if that happens like that moment right cabinet is not sworn in meaning he has not confirmed it in the Senate\n\nYou think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say you see what happened to Kevin all wearing the majority that we couldn't get confirmed you need to come out and vote for us how does that work\n\nThat's going to be pretty difficult asking Republicans that come out and vote to keep the majority\nWhen Kavanaugh was not sworn in its everybody thinks that what voters are going to remember in November is this the unfairness that Kavanaugh the dirty tricks that Democrats are playing\nBut stop and think Kavanaugh is not sworn in\nAnd the Republicans think wow we're set up now man they're so mad out there\nWere guaranteed to get their votes weren't gonna there's gonna be a Republican away because of what happened to Canada and then a Republican start campaigning and they start asking people to vote for them based on what happened to Kevin Oh you mean that he is not there you mean you didn't get sworn in Europe that majority\nWe know it's very small majority but you're the majority and he's not sworn in and you want us to how does this work folks\n\nMy point is it's very easy to sit here and say in the midst of all the Democrats trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side are going to be some ticked off into the soul man they're gonna show up and vote like they've never voted before\nBut if that's going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in\n\nRepublicans have been asking for the majority for a long time\n\nThey keep working and voting mostly because of Trump voters do they keep showing up because of Trump Trump alone will be able to make the case Trump alone will be able to turn a cabinet to defeat and the turnout but the Republicans in this\nVote for us Kavanaugh was defeated vote for us so it doesn't happen to the next nominee is that really effective I just don't I don't\nI hear too many people talking about it seems like every time you want a big turnout when you have to do something so that people get fired up I've been hearing this since I've been doing this show back in Nineteen Ninety two people call here instead of rush Clinton needs to win\nThen people will see how bad the Democrats really are people see how stokes they really are you kidding we lose and then tell ourselves we're going to win and we're still doing it here with Kevin also Kevin on doesn't make it this is going to really fire people up why do we have to do was to fire up\nThe base that doesn't make any sense to me it ought to be the other way around\nThis is another trick I think it gets played on Republicans your base is going to be really fired up you have an odd doesn't make wait a minute the Republicans are the majority how the hell\nIs is is that advocacy for reelection or election that the guy doesn't make it\nWell rush voters are going to be so mad yeah yeah what\nThe guy got railroad railroaded and our guys couldn't stop it and when we're supposed to say well okay man we're really loaded now that's going to really caused the turn up to ... I'm Sorry about that I don't think it works that way\n\nWhat people in in the hypothetical I just gave you what's gonna happen is that voters are going to be out there saying\nEven what we voted Republican Democrat still run the town\n\nAnd it doesn't equal show up keep all like that where you got to be the other way I\nGot to win this we have got to be the Democrats not lose to them\nAnd by the way I've had a lot of emails from a lot of uh people who think their expert political analysts and they all well not all but I mean a whole bunch of them have this theory that the way they get the base all fired up we want to let them destroy\nA great life for great patriot a great American his whole career his future maybe his family in order to win the midterms how does that work\n\nYour football team loses\n\nMake you want to become a season ticket holder\n\nOr is it one day when that you want on the bandwagon and you want to be on the team\n\nWhy do we have to keep losing the fire up our base you're talking about a trap she asked me the media's behind that the Democrats Washington establishment I got to take a break be back\nAfter this seems like at least we need more than ever rush a Mickey I we were\nWe were listening to Rush Limbaugh on this\nFive point five veterans active duty military military spouses if you are in search of new home financing I Want to tell you about American finance sings the a home loan it offers you exclusive access to some of the industry's most competitive mortgage rates and\nFrom the bio safe environment studio this is TV well am nine Seventy building they see a Jew Jeff I'm more translator teacher three six maybe Billie news talk ... five point five\n[noise]\nPresident calls it historic how many ...
