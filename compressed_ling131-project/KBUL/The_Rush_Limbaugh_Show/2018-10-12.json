prove he was murdered in\nThe side that the president of the United states has talked about this is a very serious thing but says look we have an outstanding deals with the Saudis that we cannot derailed just because of this this is outraged the media even though Trump\nWas initially very hard on Saudi Arabia claiming if this happened and if it was proven this is very very bad we're not going to look the other way well here's the development of evidence was that this was one of the things I shoot myself I should figuratively for not having predicted this yesterday when I told you the story

have to do something real fast because we're losing fossil geared up to start conserving and possum feels it's a good thing anyway because they caused climate change and so forth and I asked myself why wouldn't Gulf Stream I happen to know the c._e._o. at the time\nI said why are you guys doing this if you how you're going to power this Jeff how are you there if there isn't going to be any

true well\nWe routinely study the fuel markets ... you're right Mr ... there was no way that we were designing for just manufacture a brand new jet\nIf there isn't going to be ample supply is a feel
