we've had about ... wherever bomb sent to a\nOh yes a bomb was sent to Iraq was saying oh we're also being told now that a bomb was sent Debbie ... mouth shorts\nAnd that a up the bombing at the center seeing him was addressed to John Brennan who does that work there John Brennan is a analysts commentator over at MSNBC and they're probably saying what about us\nToday [noise]\nSo how how are we how are we to see this um the drive by mania would love for everybody to see this in a vacuum\nAs though there aren't any events that couldn't possibly be related to this and couldn't be anything out there that could explain\nThis except of course\nPresident Trump we've already had there's this this this really deranged guy that worked for Hillary Clinton named ... brain is already out there claiming that Trump did this at Trump's inspiring this the Trump is behind this uh James Woods noted Hollywood blacklisted actor has said that in the obvious to him\nThat this is a political stunt for the leading up to the to the mid terms I have been scouring my first role\nMemory and I can't come up with a\nI Can't come up with any or even a significant number of instances in the past of Republican bomb threats Republican threats of violence\nAnd I just it it may have been some but they're so few and they're so sporadic but let's let's put\nThis in some kind of context or let's try and by the way let me joined the chorus of everybody from from the turtle Mitch McConnell Paul Ryan to virtually everybody we here at the E R B network condemn sending anybody a bomb you know when I first became aware of this I was when I went to Sacramento\nThere's some people now that think the Republicans might end up uh fifty seven fifty eight seats in the Senate it's all a toss up I mean nobody really knows right now but the point is the conventional wisdom is not settled on what the Democrats always thought it would have been telling us it would be and that is Republican massive landslide defeat\nThat doesn't look to be in the cards if you're a Democrat operative\n[noise] and the mob tactics haven't worked\nAnd in fact if you're a reasonable Democrat operative and you're looking at this objectively you might make including this mob action\nCould be hurting it could be really firing up Republican turnout as in the post Kavanaugh period there is a cabinet effect and it's going one way pro Republican documented\nOr what if these mobs when did Republicans minding their own business in restaurants and in airports what if these mobs attacking people aren't doing anything to anybody\nAnd sending supposedly rice and\nTwo Republican senators who was in college if you're a Republican or a rat or a Democrat operative you might start to include\nThis is going the exact opposite way we intended ah these mobs or not inspiring even more hatred of Trump these moms are not causing even more hatred of Republicans in fact is looking like it's\nCreating more support for Republican so what would be the best way if you are a democratic operative and your panicking right now because this is it if you don't if you don't get the house now\nYou got two more years of Trump and expanded Republican Senate Republicans keep the house Trump's breezes to re election and twenty ... this is it just like we think it's it for us\n\nBut they have thrown everything they haven't given Trump's they've thrown have they've had the FBI they have had that deep stateside what's cool and they have thrown every trick media accolades doing they're\nTough lifting for them and none of it none of it none of it has worked so what would you do Democrat operating the best way to turn all of that around\n[noise] how about a day like this\nHow about a day like this where you create a scenario where it looks like the moms are on both sides it looks like the Republicans have a mob to or at least ... some Republican out there sending bombs to the scent good\nAnd media people former Democratic presidents and and and and the harmless people at CNN wouldn't get served your purpose severe ...\nLike the Republicans are a bunch in St Louis ticks and helps the mobsters on their side as well\n\nVery same people the media says Republicans hate the most isn't this interesting George Soros Hillary the Obamas CNN\nI mean surely surely that will convince the great on washed out there that there are dangerous angry mobs on both sides it's not just Democrats who have angry mobs I guess the Republicans to what you may be I think that day like this could help neutralize\nThe

say last week you know there's two weeks to the next time let's see what happens and here we go I mean I'm not saying couldn't happen at somebody didn't\nAnd put them stick bonds being put out for it yesterday that night and I don't even know if they found any evidence that some of the who they actually plan for this but I really don't trust the people at all and it just so look you anything in power back in ... so it just it's just I think a lot to be honest\nI only I Am so I I'm I'm I'm happy to hear you say that with events like this happen I always wonder what the\nAh reaction is going to be from people who are actively engaged in in these events each and every day and informed about them and the reaction gives me a gives me great solace and comfort because your reaction is pure commonsense if somebody really wanted to hurt somebody with a bomb there's ways to do it this is not how you do at this these bombs having gone off these are pipe bombs\nSome of them are large some of them are small we don't yet know what was in the ... with shrapnel what it was a tax was it nails was it a block shock when we don't we don't know any of this yet none of these bombs would have been capable of taking out a building they were not big enough to be\nBombs into structural damage if they went off they could have killed some people are given their size so but none of them did go off and they were discovered a mostly and distribution centers by the by the post office and I'll tell you what\nIf this is real Tania if this is real\nWhoever did this is going to be named by the end of the week and we're going to know who it is\nI agree they didn't know if it's really at\nThis point I ... I'm so just trucking people I wouldn't put it past and they pay somebody off I rarely do distressing and the Democrats um anyway we have a lot of like and they it's the right to see what else they put out there next\nWell exactly exactly this is why I was telling people back in June and July of polls here really no matter a hill of beans I think however the polls now do\nNot so much in accurately without any doubt predicting a winter but the polls today can be highly influential\nAnd decisions and action taken by political people now I just I I Love Tonya thank you very much for uh for calling a ... and again for mentioning Bob Ford it really is one of the finest dies anybody could ever meet [noise]\nUh I look at the psychology of people and I'm not a trained psychologist but I Am fairly\nExperienced here at analyzing predicting understanding\nThe left and I know their mind set on many things one of their mindset on power is but it's there's that that they are entitled to it and whatever it is denied them by way of elections they\nReally really resented and they resent the people who made it happened which are the voters\nSo today's American Left as angry as it can be at people who voted for Trump the hatred for Trump is actually directed at hatred for people who elected him and compounding hatred when those people will not abandon them the left is making every\nEvery effort it can to distance Trump voters from Trump they've tried everything they know how to use to damage Trump to force him out of office in the forest Kavanaugh out of the nomination to try to convince Trump voters they made a mistake none of it's worked the degree of frustration they are feeling\nIs something you and I cannot relate to\nWe can try but the degree of frustration they're feeling at having lost that election and two thousand sixteen when they thought it was a landslide victory and subsequently\nThey should they are feeling at having lost that election in two thousand sixteen when they thought it was a landslide victory and subsequently everything they've had the most powerful influential people in their movement all coordinated working together to destroy Donald Trump\nAnd it's been like ... you know spit balls at a at a at a battleship they haven't Denton Trump and I cannot tell you\nHow frustrated they are it is easy for them to take out Republicans whenever they want they are able to do it and if not take them out damage them tremendously\nBut they haven't been able to even score on Trump salt they began this movement of promoting\nIn the media that there was going to be a blue wave they created this movement based on the fact they ... they created a whole cloth something that did not exist a national attitude of hatred for Donald Trump\nThey simply took their own attitude and they transferred it to a majority of Americans for all intents and purposes and they began reporting the news that way everybody hates Trump\nThat now that they've seen trumping action they hate him to despise him they regret voting for him they wish they could get their vote back that became a narrative that's been the narrative for two years that narrative is what led them to hyping this blue wave\nThat it was the only commonsense view and a half now that now that people have seen trumpet action they've seen is bad manners they've seen whatever is about in the left have now everybody's seen it now they regret it now they can't wait to get rid of Trump every special election every Democrat was going to win it because why every body haven Trump everybody hated themselves from voting for him\n[noise] well it isn't coming to pass the blue\nWave they said the existed maybe never has the blue wave based on people who hate Trump now they've seen him in action can't wait to vote against them now we're learning much of that was made up much of that with soap operas scripted media narrative\nNow we're getting down to the nitty gritty now or two weeks away from the election and there isn't a blue wave of Republicans look like they're going to gain seats in the Senate even in Democrat Paul's and the blue wave in the house it's working if even if he and now with Republican turnout\nDwarfing Democrat turn out in early voting early voting is where the Democrats get to run their fraud scheme slugs early voting is rather illegals votes and the debt vote and all these other things it's purposely set up and the Republicans\nWhy it appears there are more sophisticated than Democrats ever considered the Republicans are not letting the Democrats get away with what they usually get away with\nThe Republicans are showing up in drugs they're out performing at political rallies Trump won twenty thousand people Fifteen thousand people another twenty five thousand people outside of Iraq Obama can't even draw one thousand Joe Biden Hillary Clinton can't draw flies there is ab jet\nPanic\nSetting and now you got this

could be missing a Republican syringe\nHere's why certainly looks like Democrats will do well in the midterms but this cycle present some unusual risks for pollsters not ... the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all\nThis down for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave there was no doubt about it\nIt was going to sweep the Democrats doing massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump and that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys assuring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's got to be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge\nAnd guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton a lead Trump but fell sharply\nIn the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up\nOr at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys can miss late change the story written before the bombs could it happen again it\nProbably won't don't worry about it Bloomberg's but it it could it could it could go either direction Democrats just don't win maybe they could lose make it go even ... what what is this decision all of a sudden\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border vi intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the Swedes here is really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans they use this caravan which is so obviously of set up as a wedge issue\nIt is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again the painted as a week and then lose [noise]\nThere's a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here you Democrats have got to stop opposing Trump just to oppose Trump\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and paid for it is if that if that's true\nThen Venezuela also means Iran and the ... folks\nA lot of people on our side of jumped say George Soros yeah maybe\nBut if it Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying as Venezuela if it's Venezuela\nThat's also Iran and the ... regardless we had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates in let those people in for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not one of the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it\nThey are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore ... he is saying come on you guys\nIn the ... he just doesn't help us a modest seven thousand ten thousand\nPeople starving engaged demanding to be let in\nThat doesn't help us what happened\nTo you and say oh this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickle kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\nMy point is [laughter] [noise] none of this is panning out the way it was planned no blue wave\nI ... don't misunderstand I don't know what's gonna I'm not saying that the Democrats may not win the house but\nI I don't think that going to [noise] I I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it because I never fall for the left wing media conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary group think narrative of the moment whenever it is\nBut it's more than that there's nothing happening in America right now that argue is electing Democrats\nNot in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in math\nThere is no reason to vote Democrat even giving people reasons to vote for the ball they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump because Trump's what he's aboard he tweets he's a bad guy here's whatever whatever is\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying Kevin on his family sending rice in what looked like rice and the Susan Collins all these moms there's nothing that Democrats are doing\nThat's the kind of thing you do to build a movement in a decent society and I still believe that we have one\nI Believe are decent society is under siege every day are decent society standard and good old normalcy is under assault every day led by pop culture leftists in Hollywood\nIn Silicon valley and the drive by media where under assault every day but they have not overturned that yet they have not gotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal\nThere's just nothing out there to me\nThat would have people excited about voting for Democrats because the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republicans\nUh I just I don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the church or not\nIn less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you flip the scenario

generally dismissed the significance of attacks since the emails between Gillum and Korea I'll tell you that isn't a minute one democratic consultant acknowledged that anyone on the fence about Gillum

O'Rourke in Tempe grew and I can go on\nAnd it may be that will do some comparisons here as the election nears\nBut it's um it's just it's it's the difference between your striking and it's these kind of racism you you look at how close the Democrats are making some of these and in others the Republicans are pulling away\nBut it is striking how far gone and how lost the Democratic party has taken the people to support them\nI mean it's a hodgepodge of people that have given up\nAnd become the victims and blame everybody else including the country for what ever is going wrong in their lives and
