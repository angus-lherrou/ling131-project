I just keep hearing that the suburban women have completely left for Republican Party and that was an exact opposite of what I witnessed slash side of the political\nWell I can imagine you were surprised if you have you been buying into the idea that the women have Republicans because of abortion and Trump being a massage in is that all that then you show up at a Trump rally and it's it's at least fifty percent women I can imagine it'd be a little boondoggle by that\nIt was I I don't know is is that any feedback from any other the Trump rallies that you get feedback from but\nWhat about what about housing but you said mothers and daughters were the husbands there 'cause you detect that men were husbands or are they a fight the guy that I\nWas sitting next to brought us daughter he took took a lot of school all dates which brings taught her\nI was just amazed that the ... I don't think that there's any massage any whatsoever of the Republican base I think that\nOf course there isn't this idea that this Republican war on women is a completely manufactured ally\nYou know Mitt Romney being asked in a debate by Stephanopoulos do you think states ought to have the right to ban contraception wide who is talking about doing that George I don't care do you think so and Romney stumbled around and stumbled her and finally made the mistake of answering the question Romney's says Exxon contraception Republican war on women\nHigh rise very very cool to talk to you thank you um so\nI was just wondering I was concerned and money to get your thoughts you mentioned that's a little bit yesterday but with this my role as it is and with Hillary claiming that they're partying neatness civility right now I'm\nI guess get worried with the moms and they left and the activists\nAnd them threatening or if they begin to help people\nUm it just had me worried about provoking violence um you know to the point where we don't do anything pressure on fire but come stickers and our yard on our cars because we truly are the silent majority we're not out there\nShowing it I mean I've been to rally but um it just hasn't really scared and worried to still living my day each day\nIt's totally understandable you you mean you need your your your support for Trump is not a wavering but you don't\nYou don't feel safe\nPublicly demonstrating that are showing it was basically right\nCorrect couldn't I don't blame you a bit\nThe only guy who worry me is if you said you were thinking about dropping support for Trump just to make oh no\n[laughter] no no no I just it it worries me when I'm\nWatching a lot of people are worried about this I'll tell you I think ... I think there are a lot of people like you who just don't want to call attention to themselves 'cause this is an insane group of people and they're showing a willingness\nTo a salt and a timid data intact anybody and you're right to think that violence is just around the corner and who wants to bring that on so your point is that there are a lot of people like you who are going to vote but white Trump would want them to vote for him I ... for Republicans coming up in this election that nobody maybe counting\nYes um you know nobody's got signed in science and a yard sale everybody I talked to is a hundred percent mad guy Donald Trump and nobody talks about it and it's almost like you know we went for about it like ... are are you okay with Trump\nOh yes it's out in the old in the old Soviet Union people would go to the bathrooms in their house to whisper to each other what they really thought because they were afraid that the state that the regime was listening to him and so you're\nBasically this driving describing the same thing the differences that in in twenty sixty and there were Trump yard signs everywhere you went in states across this country they're not there now without Trump isn't on the ballot\nLeader so you you might not be all that many Trump signs to be put in charge but but your point is the outward support for Donald Trump is is being suppressed by people to not call attention themselves Frank\nConcerned about violence is Sharon let me grab somebody's number nine listen to this ... this is Rand Paul it was on Fox and friends today\nAnd usually Earhart or\nYou have a big fear about this rhetoric your fear is that somebody is going to get killed someone almost did I was there at the ball\nField when Stevens police almost died from a very very angry violent man who is inside and really via rhetoric on the left and this hasn't been reported enough\nWhen he came onto the field with a semi automatic weapon firing probably close to two hundred shots at us shooting five people in almost ... seems yelling [noise] this is for health care he also had a list of conservative legislators Republicans in his pocket\nBut he was willing to kill so what happens when Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence there is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down and I think the other side needs to really calling the rhetoric down\nPretty much what you're saying you're afraid of violence being visited on you and here's Rand Paul fearing that an assassination is going to say what the Democrats are not going to call their people back the Democrats are not going to ask them to calm down I think some Democrats themselves are afraid of these people\nBut privately I think the Democrats are encouraging this privately I think the Democratic party wants America to think\nThat this in unhinged behavior is pretty natural pretty normal that it is representative of of a majority of American people like Democrats want that perception out there they want the anger and the un has behavior\nJustified on the basis of the trumpet so unacceptable Trump is so bad so dangerous so sick so whatever\nBut there's a lot of reasons they're not going to tamp down there's a lot of reasons they're not going to distance themselves from it and there's a lot of reasons why they're not going to ask these people to back off a little it'd be more responsible\nThey don't think it would help them\nThey think this kind of unhinged I'm Sorry for not having a better word but I don't know better when\nI many times can you call 'em insane or not right or\nMentally disease or what have you but regardless what you call them the Democrats think there's value in these people doing what they were doing in the Senate office building and confronting people in elevators and basically frightening the\nWhatever it takes what ever it takes to get done what they need to get done so don't don't think that they're going to get a dose sensibility\nOr responsibility and ask for it to be dialed the back part of it I think is that some of the Democrats themselves are afraid of unleashing misbehavior on themselves\nWhen it's not going to be said Russia ... we're\nYou're listening to Rush Limbaugh
