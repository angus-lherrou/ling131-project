things and when we left off Becky we're talking about\nUh how to start this whole process and getting your financial a house in order and thinking about you know what's the right thing we're talking about baking in that so I Want to continue on with this but before we do if folks are as they're listening\nHave questions and that uh what what is the best way to contact you are it's okay if our listeners get a hold of you right oh\nAbsolutely I'd love to talk to them and you can reach me I'll start with a cell phone you can call or text either aside I loved it I Love Taco Bell obviously my

are probably the easiest ways but if you want to read up on a lot of this and\nWe have a lot of it at our website news\nThe number two the word Missoula dot com and there's water sources there that sure we have on that website\nAs well and you don't have to be a interested in just buying a home in Missoula area Becky can help you understand that no matter where you live in Montana said so don't worry about that side of it also folks are we're going to be doing a feature article about Becky on our website Montana real estate radio\nDot com and just click on breaking news um and I don't lead article be up shortly after you are here they're show probably on Monday\nA so you can read more about it and you'll be able to get her contact information to get there so we were we left off a talking about you know going to see your banker and all that water some other things we should be considering before we actually go\nWe left off or talking about you know going to see your banker and all that water some other things we should be considering before we actually go out and start looking for home\nWell in that financial house there were a few more things you just want to kind of having that financial house going forward and\nOne of those and some savings or somebody that you may need for closing costs now some people choose to wrap those closing costs into their long ... and that's OK others want to pay for that outright and so those things that you can end up hanging outside of that are going to be whether it's for your appraisal for the inspection\nUm maybe for a survey loan applications et cetera so you want to look there then the other thing is your emergency fund ... owning a home doesn't mean that all of a sudden when\nThe water heater goes out called landlord unfortunately that is a low you me oh shoot I now have a seven hundred and fifty dollar um hot water here to put in down the road so saving for those things that come up and home ownership that we no longer get a call the landlord\nDefects and so having that set aside and then and\nAlso that helps you in case you do have a little downfall you know something comes up with a job or anything else you have that money to keep the mortgage protected sure and and then your other debt it's just really important to look what other debts you had so mortgage lender again is going to let your debt to income ratio\nSo they're looking at how much income you bringing in and what ... that's or you're committed to home loans student loans et cetera and that's how they come up with the ratio of your debt income non and then lastly as you're doing all that and you're getting ready\nI can say don't go buy a new car\n[laughter] don't take out a new credit card don't charge two thousand dollars to in fact once you decide if\nYou can not charge anything don't change jobs don't pay off a credit card unless the lender tells you to talk to your lender so if you've not that financial\nPicture ready and you've gone to the top two hundred and lenders says your you know your pre approved meaning based on your all these factors you can afford this much house okay should look for an ad in giving you a figure so when we go out and start looking at homes you know\nComfortably this is what we can afford so we look at things we don't go look at something you can tap because there's nothing more frustrating than going out and seen a hung on ten acres and it's four hundred thousand and you fall in love and then we know you can only afford three hundred thousand disappointing and it's like\nLooking at a a big you know let's say you look at a suburban\n... but you need to get the fiesta [laughter] it gets you for me to be it's a great car\nBut it's not what you can afford it the time he got to get what you can afford 'cause then you can really enjoy it and move that\nYeah you know we've we've talked about that on the show and it is so important and we ... we can tell you story after story of those heartbreaks where someone falls in love but because they didn't do just what barricaded outlined here\nAnd didn't get the pre approval they ended up not getting it and then every home you look at it afterwards isn't isn't right here it to it and disappointment so what you're saying is go into the fields armed with exactly what you know you can afford and already have the loan pre approved so now I suppose that helps them ... side of it to\nA very much so into in as you talked in today's market um\nAs a seller they want to know I Want to put together an absolute best offer for you to know that we're going to go in and get the steel and part of that offer saying I have a very qualified buyer you want my by or buying your home and they're great people there you know ... like you did they are gonna make memories like you know we we sell the whole story\nAnd a big part of that story as their financially capable and ... and we already know that\nAnd so then I suppose are our next step would be we need to find somebody like you are a buyer's agent\nAnd so then I suppose are our next step would be we need to find somebody like you are a buyer's agent uh you'll hear that term a lot folks and um [noise] uh\nThat might get a little confusing for some people because they said well wait a minute what why can't I just go out and look on my own and then when I see a home I like are you are I'm already pre approved all just deal with a real true that represents at home though was a not a good idea why do we need a buyer's each and\nWell we have what's called the relationships in real estate and in our relationships we put out what our duty as our do share duties to our clients and in a listing situation he sellers age in our lifting agent let's say\nTheir duties and said you shared responsibilities or to the seller although they're there to make sure that they're getting the best possible price for that sellers home they are there to protect those confidence of that seller that do the very best job for them and it is a conflict of interest rate is\nWithout being in what's called a dual agency which is a whole nother you no explanation that they can't when you walk into your column that you see them at the house and you start asking him questions there ... Sherry duty and their country is with the sellers\nRight there to protect the seller do but not there they don't care about you but they have a duty to\nHire to be honest and forthright sure with things that pertain to the particular transaction but nothing else and so the buyers agent\nWhen I sign on and I make that I'm agreement with a buyer now my fiduciary duty and my responsibilities in my alliances live with the buyer mhm so it's my job to do my very best\nIn all of my all my tools for the buyer and to get them the best possible price and to walk them through the transaction and look for in their best interests so that's part of the reason is really important to have somebody that is there for you at all I care about is you\nSo kind of look at it this way folks if um if you decided you are going to get a divorce you probably wouldn't use your husband or your wife's attorney as well\nUnless you super got along crew gets get someone in your corner and and that's the buyers aged if you if you're out there by so now [noise]\nSelecting that person I'm a as we've talked about it with Diane in the past you know it's always good to sit down in an interview the somebody I mean they are going to be you know since working for you [laughter] can you give us some maybe some things that people should look for in a good buyers agent\nI think I'm a really important when it probably gets overlooked\nIs you really want to have a compatible personality you know the process from by cell being and green to to closing in forty five days to let you take in consideration that you're going to be looking for properties first who knows how long it might be a few weeks it might be a few months\nI've communicate with people for at times well over that period of time and\nYou know you want him really sure that you're comfortable with their personality and there's no point in spending hours with their present in the car in houses\nA place where you are and make them and find out that when you just talk to them they get on your [laughter] and I'm sure there's those and I said there's times when\nPersonalities just don't match and then they'll pay it's not personal\n[noise] well I think each individual market's going to have their\nUm connections but I think a realtor should know does your agent should know how to get your information\nOn the different neighborhoods in their town whether it's done through their chamber of commerce whether it's through a local destination site um and then they should know about those neighborhoods they should be able to tell you a little bit about them and then the schools are how closely under certain amenities\nWhether it's the hospital or the college or grocery stores or maybe you don't want them close to anything yeah a lot of there's a lot of people come to Montana because they don't want to be close to that\nUm how much land you know this neighborhood has\nVery small you know\nFive thousand square foot lots this neighborhood is all done in an acre lot so\nGetting to know that's where that personality thing comes in is getting to know and listen to the client listen to what you're saying about how you live your life and what you want and having put that together so are you\nKnow what is what are the important things do you in that home and then that can help direct you to those neighborhoods that fish do you like confidence or do you not you know I Can't tell you how many times his mind says I'd like a neighborhood where there is no haven't it's\nOK well cabinets are restricted evidence mean that's going to tell you how the property can be utilized whether you can park cars outside your garage or in what are you\nExtra garage et cetera and some people like that and really like a very ... I Want to very restrictive cabinets I don't want any cars parked on you know outside their ... and then somebody else says I don't want anyone telling me what I can or cannot build on my property period\n[noise] so what I'm hearing from you as you want to be really open with your realtor and tell him\nYou know so often we see this in real estate were the virus going I don't want to sound too picky and I don't want to sound like I'm One of those people will know this is going to be a place you're going to live for hopefully a long time so be picky tell them all the things that you really want to have because information is power for you guys right\nIt really is it helps you know it helps us to be able to identify where properties are or maybe identify an area that you hadn't thought of a lot of people get honed in on one area and then it's I Can't tell you how many times they end up selling ends up being in a completely different neighborhood because\nAfter listening what they were tearing it was really somewhere else and I was able to find that by just listening and looking at properties or sending them a lot and having them start die set them and say well I Love this but not this I didn't think I'd want this but actually now I really do because I didn't realize\nThat I Would enjoy that or they need this I'm from a bedroom you know I Want all the bedrooms on the main and then they find a house with the master and the main that all the kids are upstairs among the kids are just in that age around eight to ten we're having an upstairs\nTurned out to be a great thing right um or it may be that you know they discover something with a great daylight basement so having those ten twelve year old in the basements okay 'cause it's not the basement some less grew up in\nThat we didn't like it right and you discovered those things so it really is about\nWhat's really important to your lifestyle how do you live in your home how's your home and become yours and let's find those teachers\nAnd and you have to really let them know that and then when you go out to look at those homes I like to have a checklist because after you see\nFor five ten Fifteen homes yeah they all melt together and you're trying to go gosh ... you start if I could I'd love to play the game of\nDry this house because of the really funny and it may end up having a kitchen from this one in the yard for him down and they all end up a different house they melt together so we create a checklist okay remind you of what you saw during the day\nNow that that some great advice to their now we're going to take another court break and when we come back\nUm I I Want to talk a bit with you about who should actually go out and look at uh the home and he's going to talk about that should

some great great advice\nOr from everything on just getting started to\nWell we're we're at that point in our discussion where we're talking about actually going out and finding the right home and when we left off Becky you were talking about you know how we get information on the right neighborhood and you gave us some great information on that and what our realtor can do to help us\nI'm now let's talk about going out and starting to look at home so let's say our buyers Asians found several of them that that they feel fits us so who should go should be just mom just dead mom and dad or the whole family who should go look at the house\nLiking when you first start it's really important that it's it's the buyers or the decision makers so it's the husband and wife and at first without the kids and the reason behind that is you're going out is usually a marathon right and\nI have to remind myself to stop and let people used to go or eat and they were gone and we're on a schedule and because\nAs we don't enter homes the owners of those homes we give them a timeframe are going to be here and so we're trying to fix that schedule so it's pretty rigorous and to be bringing along young children\nAnd it's a hard time doing it you know and I mean they want to go and when they get there what do they want to do you want to jump on the ... when a plane is linked set oh look at those that other little ones little toys in there\nAnd and it's distracting now you're worried about making sure the kids are okay and you're not looking at what this home but this house and that's what it is when we first luck in your home oh can you see yourself living there and\nAnd when you're distracted it's really hard to make those notes like I said in our church and compare so at the end of the day\nThe kids are really important and I had\nTo leave him and I have children to you and I brought them that once I've narrowed either narrowed it down to the final yeah these are the two more we're pretty sure it's this one\nGladly let's take them back and let them give you that final step up yet and they can claim they're real okay um but otherwise it's very difficult for you to focus and it's a huge decision and it's stressful\nYeah especially if you have little once a year while you've experienced it at the grocery store and this is like the grocery store on steroids so really noticed\nOnce a year while you've experienced the grocery store and this is like the grocery store on steroids so [laughter] are really not a good idea to to take the little ones out or when you're when you haven't narrowed it down so that that's a good point [noise] so\nNow I'm ... we've we've gotten out and we're we're we found some home to more we've we're kind of at that point you brought up or gee I've seen several of them but I really like this one\nHow do you know when you've seen enough when it's time to to narrow it down because that could we could look forever couldn't wish we\nCould fortunately right now like I said he ... he is but it can it can go on and on I think that it really comes down to your guy I think people most of the time it's not a matter of saying oh you

for Elizabeth Warren is all three networks mocked Native American claimed this is the last thing that she expected to happen in the news media cannot carry her water\nHer excuses to flimsy what's really interesting about this is the news media has known all along that this is a bogus claiming they were more than willing to carry it they were more than willing to\nPromote it propagated do\nWhatever they could they knew full well that this thing is bogus and it was nothing more than an attempt in political trick and they gave it their best shot\nBut she's to stoop and the way she handled all this and they couldn't maintain their support for her so it's it's all followed by the wayside and within probably any presidential perspiration that she had\nJust like presidential

okay so why would she do differently she's saying here the Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why is she saying that\nWell because she has the freedom to say that she's not at the moment in the in the hierarchy of the apparatus and it turns out that Latinos are far more supportive of Trump at Republicans and anybody know according to recent polling data\nThat Democrats are done at the number of Latino those that are signing on with Republicans and Trump the reason they're stunned just because they believe that all Latino is should despise anybody who is anti\nIllegal immigration or wants to build a wall the millennial thing I think what that's about as voter turnout and she mentioned severe everybody talks about the millennials and young people and young people that\nIt just it

thing that actually stands for is immigration\nShe is I I'm I guarantee you like many other Democrats are stunned that immigration remains such a big positive winning issue\nFor Trump and the

we also have some news about a a veterans group group is helping veterans get out into the field shooting hunting et cetera and we'll be talking about some new gun speaking of new gun we'd just

be show is different\nHits for sporting goods wholesalers and they're only thirty thirty five companies that are the wholesalers are distributors and those are the ones that work in what is called the two step distribution business now that's kind of inside baseball stuff at all it means is that your local gun store doesn't or directly from the gun maker\nYour store orders from me distributor the middleman if you will why would they do that well dissuade these manufacturers don't have to warehouse everything and and sell directly it's shipped directly to dealers\n[noise] what's new is old again we're told his new again the gun\nAs I Would say rediscovered but all they they just bring back the old stuff that never give up when you think oh yeah okay they're off that they'd ever off of banning anything\nThey just switched to the thing is I think that can get at the moment well turns out for whatever reason and crushed me on this they coordinate their back to ammunition\nWhy would they do that well they said well you know\nWe may not be able to ban guns but without ammunition the guns won't be any good they won't be able to do anything okay\nAnd then they start it's it's interesting how they'll start with a premise like that well if we could just regulate ammunition and of course they've done a lot of states where you have to have a license debate to buy ammunition which is nuts the idea being well we'll get to the the endgame isn't just a second\n\nBut they're what they say is where we need to ban ammunition or we need to regulate ammunition or we need to make it harder to buy him a nation or we need to make sure that you have a background check or we need to make sure that you're Twenty one years old or we need to make sure that you have a license\nBefore you can buy a nation and they're thinking is simple as well once people have guns have guns forever but they shoot up their ammo and they have to replenish it once they replenish yet\nIf they can't than their gun is basically a blunt objects club and it's not really a functioning firearm so why don't we go after the animal\nAnd then I started seeing these things where they said we'll ammo a ammunition to think about it is um it's expendable you know it's a consumable and of course has show are short shelf life which while it oh excuse me do my Scooby Doo thing here what\nShort shelf life\nI think there's and I think they probably know that's not true but I think they're doing that in order to move the needle on the media the media doesn't know when they never asked they never say was that correct\nThey really do swallow with the gun ban lobby gives them without ever asking for clarification or for confirmation or to find out if it's actually true and of course I guess [noise]\nWhat would be short ... short shelf life to me that would be a year or two when in fact the ammunition is good for decades if you store in a cool dry environment of fifty years maybe a hundred years to okay certainly fifty years is not an issue\nI don't consider a half a century is short shelf life\nBut their idea here's where I get to let me explain they always have their this is what we say why we're doing this stuff why but it's never really the truth\nBecause they said well you know we could regulate guns by limiting access to ammunition it's not really what's going on what's really going on what you look at the long game is if we can make it really more difficult\nTo go through the process if we can make it more cumbersome if we can make it more challenging to buy ammunition\nIf we can make it where it's just a royal pain in the rear some people may be a lot of people will simply say you know I don't want to do this anymore I don't want to go get photographed fingerprinted to have a background check to buy a box of twenty to handle\nThat's the bottom line is they want to make it so difficult so corner is so much of a hassle but people will start basically backing out and said you know\nI don't know I'm going to play golf I'm I'm just not going to do this anymore I'm not going to subject myself to the city more of a good person I I'm just not going to do it we're cool they go [laughter] that's great because the fewer and fewer and fewer gun owners there are active gun owners then the smaller and smaller is the political constituency\nFor the second

that then ignore it discarded taken off the list give the animal away to somebody you really don't like or whatever [laughter] ah but it's got to work you know and I don't care how much you say well this is cool ... looks great distance hype this is I've seen the videos\nIt doesn't feeding your gun\nYour guns telling you don't use this ammo it's real simple deal that's when you switch and that's
