that it's not only great that it's Christian and it's\nFilled with people of white privilege so we heartily endorse the Babylon beginning with their their points proves my point about humor and satire for it to be true and funny it must have an element of truth in it\nAnd it does at the Democratic party is very much aware that they cannot and do not implement their beliefs via Congress here is David in Phoenix is we hit back to the phones appreciate your patience sir hello\nI rush is truly an honor to speak with you I Wish you could live forever and be on the airwaves for ever\nFind him through I took her thank you very much\nI'm just a quick question for you um you know I think that the senators knew they weren't going to get the votes\nOf the Democrat senators that is to oppose Kevin are and make make sure he's not on the bench and the Supreme Court so I was wondering [noise] um do you think that\nLet's see there's actually a story with that exact point for me the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is it is a woman making the point that Kevin raw is as good\nAs guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it because\nHe has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe both the Ford that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this you wouldn't miss\nWhat is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there is no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to what happened\nBecause that's what men do the cause man can\nAnd men can because they have the genitalia necessary to do it I don't know if you're an average ordinary decent woman watching this stuff how in the world you want to sign on to that well you don't\nAnd so now these leftist women are enraged when they have discovered that they failed to persuade\nA bunch of average ordinary white women to join their cause anti Kevin law\nSo now these women are sellouts and their ... are sellouts and their rooms are sellouts and they're selling out to the patriarchy and as such they become\nWorthless and even a liability to the point now that here we have a soundbite with two women experts in gender studies saying\nWe need white women it's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask let me remind you in November of two thousand to eleven the Obama presidential campaign\nThomas and so all in the Washington Post might have been in New York Times announced\nThat they were for going the white working class as a voting bloc and instead we're going to put together a winning coalition of a sum total of every\nMinority group they can find they were going to combine all these minority groups and make that the Democrat base\nBecause white working class voters were becoming less and less dependable because they weren't buying Obama an Obamacare and because of that they were becoming racist a traditional Democrat little guy voting bloc they\nExpress no interest this is simply an evolution of that\nSo I'm a white working class was totally go pounds than by the Obama campaign two thousand eleven now in two thousand Eighteen\nOr do we need white women it's an electoral questioned it every candidate needs to ask\nFolks don't as there is now under misunderstand what I'm doing here I'm not doing this simply to express in the credibility of this\nDoing this under the auspices of how in the world can a majority or mainstream of Americans in any way support this party\n\nI realize I'm setting myself up here for what might be a major shocking disappointment the day after the election in November and I'm not making any predictions here I'm just I'm I'm I'm genuinely curious\n\nI just don't see how the actions the words the policy is many attempts to inspire and persuade I just I don't see how any decent normal people fall for this\n\nI realize that Democrats have educated a lot of people in the last two generations I realize a lot of college educated people have come out of these institutions that may have been corrupted and polluted with this crap\nAnd since most people are not what they wish they were most people are not as successful as they ... want to be\n[noise] most people do think about what they don't have rather than what they do\nAnd if that's who you are if that's if that's the personality type that it's not very big step to start blaming
