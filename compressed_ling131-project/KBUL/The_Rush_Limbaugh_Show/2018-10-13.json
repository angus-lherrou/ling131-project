talking point that ah you know since his cabinet victory that the the president is teaching Republicans how to fight\nI actually think he's teaching the Democrats what it's like to lose and I don't think anybody's picking up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd and the question I had was what do you think would happen\nIt because I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats and the media if instead of a blue wave if there was a red I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after local\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival uh and safety\nBecause I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like everybody is preparing for the Republicans to\nHold the Senate maybe even expanded their whole there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house in numbers we haven't seen and who knows how long since Nineteen Ninety four\nAnd I've been wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ... a\nMedia and and and pulling it\nOh that the Republican candidate just as an aside here on the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven\nPoints back the Republican I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it a buck the Republican governor California is closer than is running its Gavin Newsom than anybody would ever have believed possible\nIf the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think\nWashington may be on the inhabitable for a while I I think we haven't seen the meltdown\nAre running around trying to prove this guy's a reprimand of the first order and you\nKnow officer you know\nOur government money is separating the two sides that are born or I don't see them and the cops\nWe fought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch the civil that's it for the show the level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates places in this country\nWhere it ought not be there are people ought to be more educated more informed smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced informed people educated people learn people what\nYeah the idiots\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nTrump in fact wrote an executive order to end it\nWhich was beaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional lift the statute in America today says families will be separated\nAnd it's to protect the kids the reason for the reason for the separation is the parents are shoveled off in the holding cells while their cases are adjudicated\nSo I'm watching this stupid show and I see a guy who\nAny under normal season will be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted into a queen size zero\nBecause he is rounding up kids that Trump is separating from their parents and saving them\nSo I went to the DVR and I cancelled law and order and you're SUV get rid of that had been out there long enough twenty some odd years anyway so and they're all dropping like flies they all feature stuff like this in it\n\nSo you really you think\nThat two hundred nine Republican House seats coming up for grabs be cause people all over this country are fed up with Trump and the Republicans separating family [noise] [noise]\nWell uh\nBut that wasn't explained to hundred night services has a lot of Republican retirements what yeah committee chairman\nAre retiring cause their term limited\nForty three members are entirely some of them are coming in German and the reason they're quitting is because they don't want to go back to being average ordinary members when you're a committee chairman you got perks you got attention get t._v. time\nYou know you matter but when you're turning a limited out of your chairmanship when you quit and you're part of your time there and the big bucks in the private sector\nNow there are some Republican retirements but there are two hundred nine of them\n... my my only point is for there to be this kind of blue wave forty four forty seven of retirements does not explain it not with the Democrats think they've got two hundred nine seats leaning in their favor\n\nOr you don't think it's policy well ... there were people if this is all true there has to be something or a series of things\nThat the American public is just fit to be tied over and want to take it all out of the Republicans as again the media to Democrats will tell you it's Trump the people in this country hate Trump they're embarrassed of Trump but that's what
