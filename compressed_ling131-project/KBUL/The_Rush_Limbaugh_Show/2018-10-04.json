Ramirez they weren't able to corroborate\nTheir sweat Nick they weren't able to corroborate that this is now the seventh FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh\nThe leftist others but they didn't talk to Dr Ford trunk and Kevin ... that's right that's that's not part of the deal they testify under oath what more can the FBI or do you make me happy I really think these people don't change their stories from what they've testified under oath\nBesides that Dr\nForged testimony changed anyway and in terms of the timeline of the reason the FBI didn't talk to forward or Kevin always ... talk that Kavanaugh for how many times over the years\nUm but they testified under oath\nAnd so the the thing is no reason to talk to them and go out and talk to people they claim can corroborate what they're saying they'd be I couldn't find\n[noise] so I'm watching CNN too they've got CNN and Fox on it in here and it was probably ten minutes ten minutes for the program started and I began to um\n\nGet the impression that the Democrats think they've lost because the little CNN reporter only looks little let me he was describing Jeff Flake Jeff Flake said this is very thorough this is this ... this investigation is very very satisfying to me\nAnd the CNN reporter said Jeff Flake today actually sounded like a Republican and that presents a problem Jeff\nFlake it sounded like a Republican they last friday he sounded like a Democrat but today he sounded like a Republican and they went to Susan Collins Susan Collins says hey you know I look at this I'm very satisfied this was a\nUh not just among them but among people on the right in general and now here is the payoff NPR without they pulled it themselves and they found that exactly what I had been saying has come to pass the capital hearings are backfiring big time on the Democrats\nAnd NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll out today found a big swing in public opinion among men following the hearing with at ten point increase in those saying they plan to support or Republican candidate in the upcoming midterm elections right now\nI'm so this this is happening and they only primary change your difference here has been the Kavanaugh hearings and the and the left reaction to it I've even\nSeen stories today among the never Trump or conservatives that this whole thing may actually re unite the conservative\nMovement well we will ah will see about that but clearly there is a reaction is and it's it's it's it's root level simple\nThis is so easily understood it is\nThe worst smear campaign many people have ever seen in their lives many people you know even as Lindsey Graham found on the other day there are a lot of people today that they have no idea that Hillary Clinton\nRan the operation to destroy women who surfaced saying that her husband Bill Clinton had abused them or raped them or mistreated them or what have you\nLindsey Graham talks about what James Carville said when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park I mean he got booed because\nThe millennials in the crowd had no idea that that's who Hillary Clinton was the same token those people have not lived through Robert Bork and many of them are not old enough to remember what happened to Clarence Thomas Anita Hill so this is their first and that means it is the worst smear campaign\nEver that they've seen get anyone be smeared more\nCan anybody be smeared more than Brett Kavanaugh has been smeared we think that it can't get worse but the left will always make it worse Kavanaugh has been smeared\nUnlike anybody since Clarence Thomas\nBut he's been vindicated to he's been vindicated by fact she's been vindicated by evidence he'd been vindicated by witness cooperation seven different FBI investigations he is vindicated by a life well lived

other now why would that be\nWhy well did the Democrats on that committee\n\nActually believe Christine Ford did they really believe what she was saying\nSo I don't know how anybody could\nHonestly folks that went out and I I'm not even being part of what I said as\nShe can't remember where when and why the people she says we're there weren't there and yet these Democrats although for did the Democrats and that can be really think that an FBI investigation of another five or six days\nWas going to somehow produced corroborating evidence that would wipe out the cabinet nominations\nThey really thought that because my my thinking all along has been they've known that there's nothing other than the ... this is all this this man it's all they've got\nIt they really thought that this FBI investigation was going to find something that six previous investigations in countless other interviews and written with questions have been produced\nWell that is shocking to honest to God I Know I Know I'm I'm sometimes naive but I fought\nThis has been a scam from the get go and if they are all in on the scam and at the scammer was delay hence the late release of of of Dr Ford's letter detailing all of this so they walk out of Schumer's office and they're all stone faced\nMaybe they thought that they had flake or maybe they thought they were gonna get Collins Collins inflate of come out and what they have said\nWe all know that the president cannot lead us through this time\nWe know that his disposition only unable to restrain his impulse to divide us\nAs mockery of Dr Ford last night in Mississippi was wrong\nBut it doesn't really surprise anyone who is\nMr ... senator Sasse I have an alternative view and are not going to presume that you're listening but maybe somebody who knows you is I Need you to consider something senator Sasse\nYou and numerous other say that President Trump mock Dr Ford in his rally south haven Mississippi earlier this week and then you suggested that the Trump knows what he's doing despite all the criticism he gets\nThat he is doing this actually is he can't help it\nMr Sassaman gets the other way round I think Trump knows exactly what he's doing I think Trump has a behavioral patterns of strategic ... it's called pacing and really briefly explaining it again in setting up what's to come next\nWhen President Trump originally spoke about Dr Ford what did he say compelling testimony riveting he couldn't turn away from it\nIf she's telling the truth Kavanaugh's God he's got no prayer if Kavanaugh's lied and his death needs to go on Trump's and all of this and everybody so wow this is really unusual for\n... no it's not unusual Trump gets himself on record\nNot every time but in many issues he gets himself on record in the approved Washington establishment way and every time he does it do not some of you panic maybe you don't have any more\nBut when he first started doing this light Paris climate accord yeah yeah there may be something here we're going to look at it they don't always going to vote no doesn't matter you can remember countless\nParis climate accord yes yeah there may be somebody here we're going to look at it they don't always going to have oh no it doesn't matter\nYou can remember countless times where the president's initial statement on an issue of seemed to dubbed tail with what the swamp things but then a few days or are we go by him\nAnd the president's becomes really is and he starts speaking out against it after he's put himself on the record he does this for credibility and he does it it's something called pacing\nAnd it relaxes the opposition\nIn any number of way she's doing the same thing here with Dr Ford he knew right off the bat that she was saying things that nobody could corroborate that nobody can prove that she couldn't prove and what he did on Monday Night was not marker\n\nHe explained it to everybody\nThe truth about her\nEverybody because of what Trump dead at that rally everybody was forced to look and listen to that little riff\nOn Dr forge shaky uncorroborated provable test them on to the drive by us we're never gonna tell the truth about Dr Ford the dry buys were not able to ignore the rally they tried not even Fox televised Trump's rally but\nBecause he said what he said about her he forced the drive biased to cover what he said in the process that Dr buys reported what he said and people like Ben Sasse another started giving me the vapors gave me the favorite who am I got Trump is always uses horrible 'cause this is your main he's not fit\nWhat Donald Trump did recounting\nThe absurd inconsistencies in her testimony Donald Trump calling her out on everything has been play now on all media on all day yesterday\n\nReporters are now asking senators and the press secretary questions about it in the press briefing yesterday\nThe fact is the drive by media did not report the inaccuracies of Dr Ford's testimony the drive by media did not report on on ... none of the corroborate shouldn't being possible\nThey did not tell their audiences that the foreign people foreign place in the room when her incident happened claim they weren't there nobody knew that folks other than you\nBut people don't watch the mainstream media had no idea that Dr Ford couldn't backup what she was saying the people that watch the mainstream media had no idea that the foreign witnesses foreign claims where they're all deny it and don't remember being there and one of them was one of them are good friends\nThe drive by us we're not reporting any of that the drive by it's worth reporting what the Democrats senators I Believe her she is a credible witness as far as the American people who watch only mainstream media is concerned the woman was telling the truth the head back up she had cooperation and capital\nWas guilty so Trump goes out tells the truth about her\nShe doesn't know what she doesn't know when she doesn't know where she doesn't always she got home she gets it on the record the drive by half to report it and for the first time in their lives people who watch mainstream media actually heard it look at it this way think of the millions of people who had never heard\nThe truth about Dr\nChristine's Ford and her full of holes testimony think of a million just never heard it until\nTrump went out and characterize that\nWord and her full of holes testimony think of a million just never heard it until\nTrump went out and characterized it for everybody think of it this way I think of the thousands of voters in Missouri in Arizona\nIn Michigan and Maine and West Virginia and North Dakota Alaska who now know the truth who never would've known the truth had Trump not\n\nDetail that for people in his rally\n\nCollins mansion Heitkamp McCaskill flake Murkowski they knew\nThat there was no corroboration they knew that there couldn't have been any truth to what she was saying by virtue of witnesses this is why Trump did it this is why Trump does what he does if we had an honest mediate millions of people would already know that Dr Ford story doesn't add up\n\nIf the media ever told the truth about this there wouldn't be any protest today are not nearly as large envelope in voluminous\nThe people in these protests thinks she's telling the God's truth they think it's gospel they don't know that her story can't be backed up their media hasn't told him the Democratic senators haven't told them only Trump did it's another reason why they hate it\n\nBut we don't have an honest media and sold millions of people had no idea of all the holes in the Christine balls the foreign story now they do and here's a little cherry on top since Trump did that\nAnd the whole media reported on it and Democrats senators and the like we're asked about it what comes three days later today's f._b._i. report saying no corroboration for what Dr Ford\nSaid so Trump says that\nPeople like Ben Sasse another never Trump has go literally insane but if Trump hadn't set it nobody would know what the Trump did say at millions now do know and here comes the cherry on top of the FBI report we couldn't find any cooperation for her story end of the week Trump was right\nDrive by media wrong Democratic senators wrong Ben Sasse wrong\nAnd Trump doesn't do this accidentally it's not like he's lucky and stumbles into this stuff this is Trump strategy and it's all related to the pacing\nOf how he originally or initially eventually I should say gets to his real thoughts on any issue brief time out now back with more in a\nSense we humans rush rush Limbaugh\n[noise]\nAnd this is the ... stock market report civil wealth management and investment banking lecture I can with senior strategist Jason are

trapped three point eight percent\nThis would rival some of the low numbers that we saw back all the way the Nineteen sixties early night state's economy and this will be another positive\nAnd that rate dropped three point eight percent\nThis would rival some of the low numbers that we saw back all the way the Nineteen sixties night state's economy and this will be another positive sign for the economy will also given the Federal Reserve comfort to continue their gradual rate increase\nOn that note the ten year treasury reached the highest three point to three percent this morning is since backed off in early trading now this is the highest level since two thousand eleven that we've seen on the ten year\nThis rise on the heels of comments from fed chair Powell that he expects the

I mean when I say it's all there it is I mean it's not a substitute for reading the Bible but it's the book of acts it's all there\nSo he uses the book of acts and six New Testament a pistols as the introductory guide here\nTo get people who want to read the Bible butter intimidated by up to actually get started doing it so it's sort of a primer that when you're finished this book and start the Bible you'll have a head start and you'll be more likely to stay with it\nIt\nDetails the suffering and the sorrow the joys and the triumph of the apostles and all of the key figures in Christianity following the death and resurrection and the central Jesus Christ which\nIf the resurrection doesn't happen in Christianity doesn't exist they and and\nThat's one of the toughest things to make people believe how in the world that you can't physically\nPut your arms around that resurrection from the dead\nBut it's a key element of Christianity it's one of the big stumbling blocks that that people have I Can't even imagine that I mean I heard I don't want\nTo mention any names liberal talk show host really ... you really believe that camp you that's why you people are nuts you can't really think that somebody died came back to life that's why that's why people like you're crazy\nWell for Christianity to be what it is that had the habit and my brother David is a devoted to helping people believe that has happened by accepting what's in the Bible but before you can accept what's in the Bible you have to open it\nAnd so this it's it look it it's it's not simply a primer if its own story of has its own telling of the tail but it's designed\nTo be sort of like an introduction to the Bible into Christianity both testament but this focuses on the book of acts because that's where it all is\nNow don't just read the book of acts forget everything else but it's all there in the book at so that's why they chose the book of acts to start this [noise] so and I I again I I thank you for
