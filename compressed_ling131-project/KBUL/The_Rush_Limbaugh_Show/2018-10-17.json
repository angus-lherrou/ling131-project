won't shut up he is doing great damage to the country he's damaging the media because he's a veil of all you ever heard of a\nDrive by is worrying about too much access well actually you know what\nI think I'm helping people look I'm forty\nEight and one in the primaries actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful\nThat people don't even talk about but many of those for the aid is you know where people that had no chance in some cases we look at Florida you look at Donovan in Staten Island he was losing by ten points I endorsed him he won I can give you a long list of names look at Georgia governor many many racist and I will say\nThat we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact that I'm having they would say\nThat in the old days and if he got the support of a president or if you've got the support or somebody it would be nice to have but it meant nothing zero like literally zero\nWell some of the people live indoors to have gone up forty and fifty points just on the endorsement in nowhere in that state does Donald Trump say\nHe doesn't even addressed the house being lost he doesn't even accept that premise a pie\nOffers it as a premise so they say if Republicans lose control the house with a ... do you believe you better response but no\nI think I'm helping people that becomes a headline Trump tells a pie he won't accept blame of GOP loses house\nNow the eight people tell you well that's essentially what he was saying no it isn't essentially you are miss quoting Donald Trump does not looking at himself as a negative at all he's not looking forward and seeing the need for excuses any pay\nHe thinks he's helping people he thinks he is helping secure victory if it's not even in his mind that they're going to lose and if somebody's going to\nBlame him this is why Trump never\nMisses an opportunity to talk to the media it's why he tweets over\nAnd over and over again so now we got

that same level as past election cycles\nA but but but but but but but but but\nThe Democrats have Michelle my bell out there during all do a whole big voter registration drive out there\nThe Democrats have been registering voters in prison they've been registering voters at the DMV they've been registering voters at the at the at the at the medical marijuana places they've been registering voters everywhere how in the world is it possible\nThat democratic voter registration levels at the same as past cycles the Democrats have been telling us that there's so much energy\nThere is so much excitement there are so much motivation there's so much inspiration and nothing can hold them back and yet and yet the generic ballot once again is showing that this massive Democrat blue wave is not as big as once thought\nNow NBC is is is very very\nWorried they're worried that something\nThat's not a blue wave may be shaping up here\nThat's what this headline is that in certain they over a blue wave NBC News minds Democrat and GOP voter registration at the same level\nAs past cycles comparing registration activity for twenty fourteen to twenty sixteen with activity from twenty sixteen ... current helps put these numbers in the context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen include I complete picture of registration in front of those years\nWhereas twenty Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time what\nThat's all you need to get them if you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to

back on you Democrats have got to read camouflage yourselves she's warning with Democrats to hide the identity politics agenda of\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein or whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay hard if you want to see him and they release it\nAnd there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks didn't want to read just sixteen never Trump anti Trump paid mongers on Mueller's team if they had the guns yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nIf Mueller doesn't have any of that there is no way they want this released before the midterms that's why\nThey're linking ... ready they're going to try to take advantage of what they can make people think the report says I remember they have two years no more than that not two and a half years of Danny reporting that Trump and Russia colluded\nSo in their minds they're probably thinking a sizable number of American voters believe the Trump\nCollusion happens so Mueller's report is Randy it's to be released soon that create the impression that it's only a matter of time now before Trump is tied to the Russians were collusion and use that way to impact\nVoting in turn out prior to the mid

the smaller report doesn't\nHave this evidence and will not leave the President Trump being indicted on that basis what does that do to turn out\nNow don't misunderstand I think Mueller's report whatever it is released is going to really be targeted at Trump as an incompetent\nAs a boob who are in danger to the United states electoral system with his hires and with some of the people on the staff like Carter Page I think they're going to fire both barrels at Trump as an incompetent who nearly brought the world to nuclear Armageddon\nBecause of his incompetence stupidity but I don't think there's gonna be any evidence of it\nAnd the fact that there is no evidence is what tells me they don't want this out before the midterms I could be wrong only have to wait and see it won't be long

Want to understand it's like a you know the magnificent seven uh both guys really you know when the guys came up there they didn't they didn't check into who they ... what kind of Christians were Aurora [noise] uh you know if they\nAre not with a a good life they want to somebody did offend them and fight against all the things that we see a which have destroyed the country over the last uh pay to ah ah sixteen years\nWell I don't think that the media is right now focused on separating Trump from his voters I think they they know that's too late I don't think that's what their objective here in the midterms is um\nI think they're very frustrated they haven't been able to do and if they could they would the icing on the ... I think their primary objective\nNow is to flood the zone with anti Trump voters Democrats\nMade up of every disparate coalition a group you can find they are trying to assemble this gigantic Democrat Party and then there's like combination coalition of minority here minority that just constant Adam altogether and get a big majority party and that's that's where they're trying to generate the turnout\nUm\nBecause they know they're not going to distance from from uh from his voters\nSo the the focus I think is\nOn Jennings up a first time participation\nUm and that's why this this enthusiasm thing is so important and the inspiration and stuff and the anger is so that's why I think\nThat they have strategically become the party of anger I think they are using this anger and they are exploiting it to generate turnout\nBased on what they think is the majority of Americans didn't hate ...\nI I think they they do move past the idea that there's a bunch of Trump voters that regret it and can be inspired to show up and vote Democrat as I say if they can make that happen to be icing on the cake\nI think you can see the frustration in them every day you can see the frustration in perusing\nThe news as I Do more and more stories that are starting to raise red flags about the blue wave and there are some big\nBrush them falling for doing this on purpose they're sucking you when they're making you think they are given up they're making you think they're trying to disparage trying to make you think you got it in a bag no they're not going to\nEver pull that off not here not with me\nBut I don't think that's the case either I I don't think that they are when they have that much discipline to be able to have a media wide threw out the entire left wing media universe\nA disciplined approach to runs fake stories about the blue wave not happening I think it's a legit\nI've never I've never believed there was going to be a blue wave\nI never have\nWilling to put that out there and that if if I ended up being wrong Soviet I'm not afraid of being wrong it doesn't happen enough times for me to be worried about it but it is I have never\nDoes not suggest that like I said yesterday where is the evidence that Democrats\nHave been able to put together a winning coalitions and flooded the elections in a way in outside of areas they dominate like New York Los Angeles San Francisco Chicago they had been losing elections they had been losing seats left and right starting in two thousand ten that hasn't reversed\nThey didn't win with the cabinet thing they haven't won with anything trying to get rid of Trump they haven't been able to stop Trump on an even they're stupid travel or order delays using the judge is Trump is succeeding implementing his agenda there's some things he hasn't been able to do yet like the total repeal of Obamacare\nBut they have not been able if you you would think if all of these things were true a lot of people hate Trump regret their votes a wish it had never happened regret that Trump is ... ... the Trump wouldn't be getting anywhere near done what he's getting done there'd be universal opposition to it if\nThe Democrats are right about all this but they're not write about it but I I I\nThe evidence on the ground isn't there that there's a blue wave waiting to happen there is evidence all over the place the Democrats are frosting and fit to be tied over the fact that they're losing\nAnd then you couple that with their their mentality but says winning is their birthright power is their birthright their entitlement but\nElections haven't been going their way me how in the world stopped to think if all of this that they're saying is true Hillary wonder one in the first Trump would have never won in the first place if all this talk of a blue wave right now is true\n\nThey thought they had it in the bag in two thousand sixteen and they were revved an energized too there were there wasn't any talk of Democrats not turning out back then anyway I'm a little long segments going to be short\nAnd all of us well read about it in the paper tomorrow Raj Shah ... be met or if you're listening to Rush Limbaugh\nWhen you put a safe in your home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one random safe you should trust to put in your home and that's rhino saves\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America what amaze you it takes skills sweat and talent to produce the most beautiful and secure or safe in the world and that's what rhino saves are\nBeautiful creation as that help keep your possession secured part art part furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nHow do you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive dealer network on line at rhinos safe dot com veteran own didn't veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our H.
