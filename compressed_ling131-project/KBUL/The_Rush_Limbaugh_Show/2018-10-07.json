get back to learning more about a hose and other properties in Montana Dale more Montana real estate today\nWe are back here on Montana real estate today and for those of you that you know we're talking about selling your home and getting that right in marketing so that it really stands out but for those of you that say well hey day oh wait a minute\nI I Want to buy so I'm trying to find the right property coming up here shortly Casey and the gang of the property center\nAre going to talk to you about some new listings that have just come on the markets to stick around for that for you buyers now for you sellers oh we're talking with red from hopped media a red specializes in photographing using video to really present\nThe home the right way or or whatever real estate that you're trying to sell and we were talking about virtual chores and read you didn't hold back you do not like those and and I got to join you on that one I I I think that's kind of a a fad that's come and gone and my opinion and it it's better to to do is use real video right\nI I think it's real you know that you have that story telling aspect or property ... and that makes a structure message message rather than this ad hoc adventure ... low quality images\nNow one thing I've seen lately that I really do like is these incredible overhead shots and I\nI was looking at him going wow this real true spend a lot to do that must be rented a plane or something they're using drones ship the latest technology talk a bit about that well when is the time we should think about using a drone and and we'll we'll get into a little bit on the expense there too\nUh I've been flying drones now or just about five years I think I'm On my if platform okay I've gone through your rations this technology and cameras that are improved on the ground Mm hum the properties that really require drones\nOkay I've gone through inter rations this technology and cameras that are improved on the craft ... um the properties that really require drones obviously ... ranch they have to yeah ...\nAnything over five acres you absolutely have to ... to show the ... the situation the home or the or the ranch exist and you can show the vistas you can do all these sort of thing but even in residential\nIf you live in a really nice neighborhood you can show that ... you know down the street you can do these kinds of establishing shots of give people to feel the neighborhood where they come\nI really liked that I I think that's an excellent idea because\nA neighborhood is a huge decision maker you know when people go OK I Love the home or where it's located so this can really help show that off right great idea there now do you need a license to fly one of those I mean we've we've heard a lot of controversy lately about\nWell you can't use drones here or there how does that work\nSo it's influx in the drone or regulations have been in flux from the FAA forever right now we're under something called heart one o seven which requires commercial operators ... or anyone developing content with the drone for commercial purpose\nTo have a one apart when I was seven exemption\nOr if a simple test you just you just call your air traffic control tower talk to the F a say where can I go take the test okay at the fast\nIn my opinion is way overboard literally you you're like half a small aircraft pilot at the end of it [laughter] there's a lot of knowledge or you're never going to use again but this go ahead and pass the test ... I'm like I said the record regulations for drone usage of costs would be than in flux\nThere's periods of a lot of enforcement and now we're in a period of hardly any enforcement\nOkay so if someone's going to use is you know follow the rules check it out see what's allowed in your area and and and do the right thank you you don't want to get end up getting yourself into all kinds of trouble [noise] um so let's talk a bit about expanse here I'm\nSo to get someone like yourself such a professional that really knows what they're doing or are we talking a big pile of money here\nIn my case no end here here's my I might think you know are so many people will get a new toy new piece of technology a new technique and they add it to their package they make it this ad on so it's just additional expense ... I've use a drone no differently than I view of the cameras\nOkay piece of equipment it's what I'm using on this site to accomplish this so my standard package it's already baked it\nOh okay so that's for the photography the drone all of that\nNow do you say hey we're not going to do a drone that's fine that's just a piece of equipment I'm not going to use all the prices the same because the work is\nRight so it's no different than pulling out of different camera different tripod or whatever to okay great so [noise] um do you mind giving this kind of an idea of what a a package would cost\nI first standard residential I'm usually right around four hundred us how my standard well that's not bad at all and\nAnd what I what I always say is when I shoot and I do video and I did an area where I say I'll give you forty images I guarantee forty images okay I have never delivered forty images\nIt's always between sixty and one twenty lived a realtor way more than they could possibly using listening but I also loves them to have an editorial process of what they like and don't like ... ah the video I always try to do a video somewhere between a minute and a half and three minute video okay and so that way they have this whole package\nAnd it's so that anyone ... video do you oh wow so I tried not to have this piecemeal or you want this you went to a good one it's confusing to me the client feels like they're trying to get a nickel\nSo I Try not to have this piecemeal or you want this you want that because one it's confusing to me the client feels like they're trying to get nickel and dime a little bit yeah so it's just like here's a standard\nWell and and then they get allows you to go into the site with all your guns loaded so you can kind of use all your expertise to say no this is better for using that and you're not always having to call up and say oh I Need to add on this or that I I Love that now I'm In most cases\nUm when you're selling a home your realtor is going to pay for that correct correct okay and so again folks even though you the real terrorists paying for it you still have the choice to use the person selling it can say you know\nUm I I Know you think your handy Mr ms realtor with your iPhone but\nI really want to stand out and look great so could you hire somebody like ... or something like that so I just remember that for for you folks that aren't real terms that are listening to this [noise] it's okay to sit down with your realtor and talk about\nHow they're going to present your property and let them know that you would like a a more professional approach and for four hundred bucks I mean come on you're selling a home for two fifty three hundred and four hundred thousand dollars that\nToo badly about\nFourteen million yeah or or more yeah you're a place that was fourteen fourteen million well we we haven't sold one of those uh through\nThe show yet but you know we can always hope [laughter] okay so red was we got kind of an idea of of cost and that now what about\nUm licensing can can the realtor\nDo whatever they want with those photos and that later or\nAnd here's where I differ for most all the other photographers okay\nI despise the factors there's there's photographers we take images and give these sequences licensing requirements student realtor where they have a one time usage but they want to use on the billboard to go back to the photographer here for a thousand dollars and yeah\nI view myself as a higher you\nBought a product that product is those images in that video ... when you have you own them or are you the deal with whatever you want to if you put on the billboard all Athens let me know so I can I can take a shot up with my iPhone sure put it on Facebook because they were up on a billboard\nAnd now now see I Love that because in in ... to choosing the right person that's something you definitely want to ask isn't it is okay when you get done taking pictures of my home are my client's home I I I own um right you want to clarify that donor you\nWere in in the great thing too is is that when the ... they can give them just a homeowner yeah a lot of people especially elderly folks would love to remember their home they lived in for thirty forty ... give it to them so they can keep it and they have it for themselves\nOkay great idea there so this is something that doesn't have to be real expensive is something that you can have as a keepsake but more importantly it's something that your going to use to market your home so you stand\nOut so that you get the thing solved I mean after all once we've made that big decision to move 'em now we wanted to get done let's get the things sold so ... what do you feel as\nFar as I'm helping that success rate when when we use a professional like you does it tend to move properties quicker\nIt definitely will shorten that sale cycle and here's the reason why if you use great imagery of new stuff and the crowd and your property was already presented in a great way to a potential buyer well you've already moved him through that funneled to you know a fifty percent or wherever you want it but you've\nThan it is a great way to a potential buyers well you've already moved him through that funneled to you know a fifty percent or wherever you want it but you you already have disqualified buyers were interested in the proper okay it's not a terrible pitcher and your caller on the phone and going and interested maybe show it to me\nOkay so again folks when you're talking to somebody about this or you're you're sitting down with you Ryan and I have always advise you sit down with a realtor and talk about\nHow you're going to market your property and have them lay it all out and that's an important thing how are you going to do the photography Luria using make sure they understand all this technology now we've been talking a lot about photos and video read but really there's way more to this um [noise]\nAnd that that gets into how we describe it I mean we still have to use some of the old fashioned techniques which is we've got to talk about it and I know I've ... sorry realtors but I've made some jokes about how some of these property descriptions get written and that is that something you can help or this to you know I can in\nTerms of when when I can struck the story with images I think it's really good when you write your description to look at those images before you write that scripture because it's so easy for ... come up with the laundry list the feature dump ... ... that's not a compelling story\nYou know you ought to be overly flower you don't have to be Shakespeare but hell a story about the place you know if you put a little bit of structure and that's the ... the same thing with you\nThere are so there's a narrative that people can really latch onto it becomes\n[noise] yeah I think often as real tears were talking to each other and we've got our lingo down well that can end up on the page\nSo and now a potential buyers is looking on the realtors website or on a realtor dot com are so many of these other sites now and they see you know all these abbreviations and like you say that the feature dump\nA lot gets lost doesn't and the reason why I think a lot of those sites like Zillow and all the ... uh they've become transactional so have you with the state as a transaction when truly it's actually a relationship and that's where narrative comes because you're actually establishing a relationship with never meeting the person ... you're giving them a tone and a tenor\nExactly and you know just as um you know we have people here in Montana listening to this show\nA we also because we archive are shows on our website we have people that listen to this program from all over the world and again you don't know who they are so you gotta you gotta sink in those terms and [noise] I I think you've just given us some great advice and against something you really want to discuss with your realtor\nUm the other side of it is in that presentation [noise]\nUm the red talk a bit about how we get it to come across on video or one of the things I see so often is all this great work is done by somebody like yourself and that\nAnd a potential buyers clicks on it and it takes forever to load and then they go all the heck with it and they move on and we just lost a potential sale or there's some tricks there so that when someone clicks on our home it actually pops up right now\nYeah the biggest thing is I see so many people truck you bake it into their own platform so it's XYZ real uttered dot com and they tried to put the video on their own platform because I oh I didn't want to put it on YouTube I don't want to put it on ... uh\nSome of them you are one of the other ... caught it on a hosted solution\nAlert at YouTube which is free ... and I recommend start your own YouTube channel have those videos living on YouTube because it's just another avenue of marketing it's another search results it's it's just another path for people to find that home the other is if you're going to insist on host and you know\nFind a really good service like Amazon a W s\nThough most of video then you're going to have that super fast hosting for that video\nSo that's something you can help our realtor within and explain because to me it's so sad when you you you've done all this great work you've spent some money on it\nAnd that and no one sees it because you know it's it's the I Want it now age folks and we don't want to lose that so again here's something that read can really help you guys with to make sure that you're using the right technology at the right time\nSo that the potential buyers sees it right now we're going to take a quick break here a red and when we come back we're going to talk a bit more about\nHow we can market all this great stuff that you've you've talked about and folks if you haven't do hopped

country that committed what'd you at least make a phone call would you least write a check\nWould you show up at a lot of people are doing it that's interesting part look at the crowd at the Trump rallies that's a commitment to go stand in line for hours to get to those things people there are people energized our goal as gun owners\nHave to keep people energized to keep people committed to get

vote absentee or you know you've got to do what you got to do\nSo there it is yes if they are the wonderful time I'd love to get your reaction I Wonder if people saying and yeah I Know people on Facebook who have been saying horrible things I mean one lady I Know well she said\nShe was horrified at the whole cabinet thing and then she wraps up and just says and anyone who doesn't agree with me I have no use for\n\n\nIs somebody I've had dinner with break bread with ... he doesn't agree with me on judge Kavanaugh I have no use for a lot of friendships have been broken up over this\nIs fascinating what what's your take on as you watched it what were the conversations that were happening him out there I'd love to know eight six six talked gun let's say let's go to line three on TALK to a large in Houston, Texas hey large thank you for your patience you got a new gun here huh\nWell on a newbie clay shooter okay and\nNo I don't have a new gun I've been using a maverick eighty eight but I've had an eye for an overnight under ... shop I found a a Charles daily and twelve in a sari twelve gauge twenty eight inch and wanted to know what pitfalls I should be or no [noise]\nYeah there's a as a very real danger when you shoot a nicer over none of that you're not going to like your other gun that's the real pitfall they're\nNot worried about that one [laughter]\nUh I Would say this does the Charles they have choke tubes\n[noise] I think their fix\nFix jokes you know what the jokes are\n[noise] I Do not\n... or ... where I'm going with this is June ... speaking you will do better with more open jokes if there are ... improve silver modified you're probably a good if they're modified and full you're going to want to have joked tubes put in there are companies that can do that for you\nOr because almost everybody will shoot better and break more target shooting approve cylinder or cylinder or skeet with the widest patterns possible you break targets out to thirty five yards\nA that would be the only thing I Would say is checked the jokes on it if it's modern fool you need to budget for choke too\nHard to have somebody open up those jokes for you but other than that you're going to have a false\nDefinitely a nice over there is a visual you had to kind of ...\nAll right he's six six talk guys get you in here because we got a lot of these talks about their houses just joined us we have all your calls we'll talk about Kevin all your take on that kind of the future of gun rights [noise]\n... drawn in ... raising the standard of living doesn't matter and Rush Limbaugh increasing the number of people at work and raising wages bonuses being granted and none of those things\nI just cited which after additionally band manager [noise] getting out of the day was home doesn't method Rush Limbaugh these tiny and no one for ya unused tone Ninety five point five\nYou know marketing cursed me also one of the things are insist that works in a lot of things that people don't know about their Horton but they're kind of\nHit not secret exactly what they're just not on the radar things like this would be important or in the upcoming election things like the efforts to use the EPA to try to be an entire classifications of ammunition because they contain lead\nShore yeah it's it's not just that the federal level wishing that the state level as well so\nOur folks that are working washed ... issue you're invading with their legislators everyday they're meeting with both the house in the Senate ... meeting with Republican or Democrat then they're they're trying to make sure that they understand what the what the unintended consequences of these bills could be so they start to\nBand lead ammunition traditionally initiate and they say you can't use that for hunting and\nWe really isn't a move to try and clean up the environment because he hasn't been proven that\nThis lead exposure to to the environment has been any significant impact but if they tried to ban that really what it is is back way of suppressing people from exercising their rights we all know that nontraditional and that they should still shot out extent\nNon toxic shot is much more expensive to produce than traditional led ammunition\nSo by raising that price and making it more difficult for people to go by hunting license to get out there and\nThey're also now going to be cutting back on that money that's going toward conservation projects which has been able to bring back the American turkey near the north American American white tailed deer to be able to bring it back from the brink of extinction it's been hunters who the original conservationists and we've been able to do that\nThrough the Pitman Roberson excise tax every time one of these gun owners goes out and buys a new file on the go out and buying ammunition they're paying a tax on that that we put back on ourselves way back in Nineteen thirty seven\nThe contributions to conservation programs you're done that since Ninety seven to the ... billion dollars\nBut we can you have to do and mark while all that is true\nThe bottom line is that the goal of trying to restrict ammunition to drive the prices up\nUsed to drive people out of hunting stripe people out of shootings drive people out of fires ownership dust reducing the political base of people who push for gun rights and by reducing the number of people who care about gun rights\nThey increased their chances of stripping away more and more gun rights it's a long game they know how to play it but that's what is it is at stake here
