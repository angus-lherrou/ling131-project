who's behind this here's lonely governments in Texas He was on today with Sandra Smith on Fox question what can you tell us what you're seeing the way the president's responding to this what are your thoughts as this mob makes its way of the border\nThe president made no bones about it and uh actually he can take his lead from the Democrats a Democrat and I'm Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite presidents but ten Nineteen sixteen after Bon Jovi as gangs came across\nThe border and New Mexico and killed a bunch of people and not only did he put Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's not going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs to stop\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the border you gotta stop bogus asylum claims and basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from\nAnd also we need to\nRemember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not made and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so ... El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim and Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow Louis knows Jeff Sessions he keeps DVD I talked to Louis he'll talk about Jeffrey was talking to Jeff and I don't even know who is who you're talking about\nJeff Sessions with Jeff Sessions of big money is that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great points they already qualified for asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nWe have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning anything\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this and frankly I don't think they have as\nMuch support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been this slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nIs that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage that the American people realize their mistake electing Trump but the Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason the two thousands actually admit germs the American people\nAll of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made\nBut for some reason the two thousands exceeding the germs the American people were all of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't believe it but we got media narratives that a gigantic blue wave was going to happen\nAnd we had that media narrative go on from December last year all the way through September of this year and then and then the generic ballot started tightening and then it began to look\nMaybe it won't be as big a blue\nWave and Republicans\nLook like they might actually gain seats in the Senate and oh no now the president's approval numbers is higher than it ever been CNN zone poet forty four percent\nRafts my son has trumpet fifty one\nThere is nothing happening that suggests say blue wave is happening I frankly don't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth I e election day\nPeople have to start revealing in these Madden cat for addictions projections victims they want to get as close to accurate as they can for the sake of their business\nThere in the polling business they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all that's the case who hire them\nSo now we're told well there's been a shift a little bit and it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways the Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republicans can hold the house foreign ways they could lose the house\nWell a month ago there was no way the Republicans were going to hold outs now all of a sudden\nWe're starting to see it as a blue wave may not I don't think they ever did I don't think you'd ever did exist I think it made up\nManufactured you get to pull result you want depending on when you take the pole and who you decide to put in your sample\nThere is no way there is simply no way that a political party openly promoting\nThis invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide\nWhen the American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more illegal immigration\nThe American people in a majority no matter how you slice it are not asking for a political party\nTo stop paying attention to the border and let everybody who wants to him in the American people are not there the American people never been there the Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\nGoing through your own poll wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border let anybody wants to come in and I can guarantee you less than ten percent of the people are going to say yes and yet\nThey can look at a drive by news media every day and you would get the impression there's a lot of Americans that a lot of people to support this idea\nOf these are so poor people there there's the hungry way to make sure we have so much they have so little we must what the that's not\nA position it's going to win elections if it were we would have had amnesty back in two thousand two\n\nIf that was the position of a majority American people Donald Trump would have never gotten the Republican nomination if the people\nIn this country wanted mobs of seven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked to be granted asylum Trump want to never gotten the nomination he certainly\nSeven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked to be granted asylum truck would have never gotten the nomination he certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think we'd goofed up\nYou know what Trump was wrong we don't need a wall this proves we just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they want and let them in we should feed them wishing house than they have nothing they're poor are coming from ... countries let them that's not a majority opinion of the United states\nThe media is going to try to make people think that way I look like they're mean spirited cold hearted heartless and all this but it's not the case\nThat is not an accurate description of the American people so\nI I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in\nTrouble because he wants to build a wall that he's in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the border\nAnd yet the media reliably very subtly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote unquote caravan\nTrying to find a way to make Trump look like the bad guy here\nAnd that's just not where the American people out one other thing about this [noise]\n[noise] now don't get to the final looming over my head as a second

the use of bombs\nIn politics\nWe do not condemn the use of bombs in war is not just declared hostilities but\nWe declare and clearly condemn the use of bombs\nIn American politics or any other domestic circumstance but clearly America has become a very dangerous place for Democrats what can we do to protect our Democrats\nWhat can we do to help ensure the safety of our democratic friends and it seems to me\nThe best way to ensure their safety is to get them removed as often as possible from public life\nAnd the most available\nWay to offer this assistance the most immediate opportunity we have to offer this assistance will occur in just under two weeks the mid term elections with Democrats under siege Democrats under assault like\nThis it would only be\nResponsible and compassionate to vote them out of office\nAnd remove them from the public sphere in which they exist and are for some reason being targeted here or by people apparently sending them bombs\nBut I just want to share with some of the things I get some of the is by the way it legitimate some of it is obviously tried influenced me a into promoting whatever it is that since I have to be very very careful about so I'm just I'm I'm gonna relate this to you this passionately this guy\nWho is it a story and who has studied American politics and congressional races along the lines of of Michael

falls could be missing a Republican surge\nHere's why certainly looks like Democrats will do well in the midterms but this cycle present some unusual risks\nFor pollsters not ... the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all this down for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and it was no doubt about it it was going to sweep\nThe Democrats doing massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys assuring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it\nYeah it's got to be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans\nNow polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge\nAnd guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys mislaid changes story written before the bombs could it happen again it probably won't don't worry about it ... but it\nDid Clinton in ... that you're going to either direction Democrats still went back and they could lose make it go into ... what what is all those indecision all of a sudden\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the Swedes here is really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously a set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose [noise]\nThere's a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here\nYou Democrats have got to stop posing Trump just to oppose Trump's\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and paid for it is if that if that's true then Venezuela\nThe sources that Venezuela sponsored and paid for it is if that if that's true then Venezuela also means Iran and the ... folks\nNow a lot of people in our side I'm jumped say George Soros yeah maybe but if in Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying as Venezuela if it's Venezuela that's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates didn't let those people in for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not one of the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore ... saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security that's doesn't help us a modest seven thousand ten thousand people starving to gauge demanding to be let in that doesn't help us\nWhat happened to you and say oh this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickle kinda basis and the American people are opposed to it\n[noise] my point is [laughter] none of this is panning out the way it was planned no blue wave I look\nDon't misunderstand I don't know what's gonna I'm not saying that the Democrats minute
