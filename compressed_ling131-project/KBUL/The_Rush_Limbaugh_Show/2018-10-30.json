they weren't two years ago I said okay well\nHope you're right but let me let me give you some facts on the ground forty ... oh yeah we're going to get to the birthright citizenship is it just a second here but I Want to set it up with this 'cause man this is great what Trump is doing on birth row if this is exactly why Trump was elected\nAs my good friend McCarthy and the recording said you've got to have somebody that's willing to break the furniture\nYou have to have somebody willing to turn things upside down if you're actually going to get things done and the left is beside itself today CNBC it's headlined Trump\nTrump's attack on birthright citizenship is just the latest attempt to rile up the GOP based everybody's saying he can't do that that's the fourteenth amendment he can't universally\nWith an executive order reverse the fourteenth amendment we want to discuss how maybe he can he's going to run into activist judges that'll that'll turned him down here but the point is\nThat you need somebody like Donald Trump gets the fourteenth amendment is what grants citizenship to anybody born in America and it was intended it goes back to the Eighteen hundreds it was intended\nTo grant citizenship to slaves and their descendants\nNow how old are you how do you think modern African Americans they would feel if the fourteenth amendment which was used to grant citizenship to this slams and their descendants is now being used a grant citizenship to anybody that gets into the country just for the purposes of giving birth here and\nSo this is something it's long been fought to be untouchable Trump is saying I'd look I think I can fix this with an executive order\nBut all of these events were designed to cause this blue wave weren't designed to create this massive voter intensity and turn out\nBy Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than democratic turnout unheralded that's unprecedented\nRepublicans seldom show up this while in early voting it's hard to explain it away but the conclusion is it there has been no blue wave there's not even been a blue ripple that you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip\nSome blue bubbles are bursting recall the blue bubbles are areas of blue support last time blue congressional districts and major coastal\nCities [noise] [noise] so this guy is off the firm belief that a conservative red wave or Republican a red wave is coming and is on the way [noise]\n[noise] many other people are ... I've I've heard some people that were rush look if I got to be very very careful those forty five Republican retirements that's that's such a toss up I don't know how\nTo factor all of that that's more retirements in a single year than where ever used to having to factor in\nHere and the power of incumbency and those forty five seats has been has been lost I think by the way the\nPolitical professionals are going to be\nHyping the fact that as things stand I this is probably what you're going to hear from a lot of places seem stand now looks like the Democrats might when my house by\nTwo maybe for the and that's going to be designed to get you to not get lazy and over confident\nThat don't don't be dispirited by any of that you hear the evidence that there is no blue wave is the is the\nEvidence of panic that is\nPrevalent throughout the drive by media because their efforts to derail Trump have failed every one of them including the big one\nForcing Trump out of office because he supposedly co loaded with the Russians Robert Mueller was supposed to have delivered to go to\nThe special counsel buying now all was supposed to have core Trump Trump was supposed to be on the way out by now do not doubt me that's what everybody on the left held out in great hope\nFor the special counsel investigation\nBarring an actual report they had been hoping and praying for\nA week that would be\nThat the report does say that Mahler found hard evidence that Trump important she didn't need and\nCourt shows up the hill debate but there aren't even any sexual weeks\nThat's the big one that has blown up do not doubt me on this by now\nMueller was supposed to have delivered the guards that drive by media was supposed to have delivered the leaks\nSo now it's off the plan B and plans see and so forth\nAnd that's why I say that kind of it's obvious panic also argues against the fact that they feel confident\nIn a in a blue wave let's take a brief time out will come back we'll delve into well get started delving into the Trump claimed that he can defy the constitution and and birthright citizenship whether the executive order it would not be defined when the

by the way some of these forty five\nRetiring Republican ... some of them were rhinos I mean I look like they're not they're not total losses there were a lot of never Trump or is it in there and that's one of the reasons they retired I Would be remiss if I didn't mention is there were a lot of them I don't know about the total number forty five and a lot of them quip because they were just\nFed up that Trump\nWon and the Trump was leading the Republican Party and they don't want anything to do with it some of them are committee chairmen and decided they wouldn't go to go back just being regular house bozos because it's such a calm down you know to have been a committee chairman then go back to being just a regular venture or back venture in their place\nAnd this this ... ... in their place many of the Republicans who got the primary nomination was replaced knees never Trump voters who are retiring are Trump\nSupporters\nThey were Trump gifts and so the the total number forty

so goes the argument leaving everybody else out\nAnd it's time to overthrow that and change it and it's a serious movement and it's it's a ... you can trace the educational roots for this back to the Nineteen seventies Nineteen seventies as a [noise] an offshoot of radicalism in the sixties is where\nChanging premise of education for America's kids actually began but I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here in the details of the story\nDonald Trump and let me just give you the New York times version they're headline Trump claims he can defy constitution and the end birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump offered a dramatic if legally dubious promise in a new interviewed a ... a unilaterally and birthright citizenship ratcheting up his hard line immigration rhetoric what a week to go before the critical mid term elections\nTrump's ... how to end the rights of citizenship for children of non citizens and an authorized immigrants born in America\nCame in an interview with ... was released yesterday Trump did not say when he would sign the order and some of his past promises using executive action of gone unfulfilled but whether he follows through on his threat or not the issue and joins a string of actions\nIn his past promises using executive action of gone unfulfilled but whether he follows through on his threat or not the issue and joins a string of actions intend to disrupt the matter\nOf immigration ended the front of voters' minds as they have the polls next week folks as I said throughout the first year of Trump's presidency this is what pushing back looks like\nIt was never going to be clean and it was never going to be quiet\nPushing back against the liberal order of the day was always going to be noisy and it was going to be potentially violent and dangerous\nAfter all these are people who do not accept election results anymore\nAnd you know what that means you into this country together all these years is the honoring about actual results yeah have a heated campaign you're may have political parties and elements that really don't like each other but whoever won the election decided who\nHad a chance at running the country and both sides acknowledge that and it wasn't that long ago ... you can go back to two thousand two when the Democrats lost those mid term elections and a shock\nGeorge W Bush's first midterm elections after winning in two thousand a drive by is on the left working vans that they were going to sweep the house the way they were going to sweep the Senate away with people were fed up with the Florida recount remember all that\nAl Gore got jobs the Democrats got cheated and Democrats for a lot of her about what happened the Republicans won and added seats in an off year election\nWhat the Democrats they accepted it for the most part and they started talking about how well we're gonna have to modify some of what we believe are ordering values basis because in exit polls showed that values\nWere a large factor in why people voted Republican well fast forward it two thousand six than there is no knowledge what the Trump won they do not accept\nThe election results that's what these past two years have been about and are going to remain about they don't accept Trump's election as legitimate because they didn't want it\nWe've gotten to a point where the radical left simply because it doesn't feel good about this is willing to overthrow an election results and the way this happened\nTop levels of the Obama the O. J. we're used to overthrow run a silent cool to try to throw Donald Trump back out of office and reverse those election results it's unprecedented\nPat Buchanan has peace out today that uh reminds people Nineteen sixty eight featured even\nMore violent unrest that we have yet seen this year but we're getting close\nYou can always go back in time and find a period where it was worse than it is at present you can always go back and fight the civil war [noise] but if he is a seminal moment when a political party\nAs its official position refuses to accept election results\nAnd that's where we are and that's why we're where we are they refused to accept it for whatever reason to hate Trump I don't feel good about it they just rip whatever doesn't matter why just the fact that they refused to accept the results\nIs a horribly dangerous thing because what if it keeps up what if the only time there is peace in America is when they win elections\nKnow I I predicted some time ago that they're going to figure this out at some point and the natural conclusion to figuring this out as well let's just eliminate elections\nI predicted some time ago that they're going to figure this out at some point and the natural conclusion to figuring this out as well let's just eliminate elections of elections or what's holding us back let's find a way that will lemonade him\nPeople laugh to combine Ross it's never going to have do not ever say the left isn't capable of anything ever\nSo now he Trump rather than being intimidated by their refusal to accept his election or rather the feelings hurt Trump doubles down triples down every time they hit him he hits back with\nAdditional energy and verve and I'm telling you this promise with an executive order to end birthright citizenship is huge\nAnd it's why he was elected\nWhen things are going terribly wrong and they are in our country right now when things are terribly wrong an out of control\nYou have to have somebody willing to go outside the so called boundaries in Trump's doing it every day and willing to do so because this is what pushing back\nThis is what defiance this is what changing the left his do it looks like it was never going to be pretty it was never going to be why it was never going to be clean\n\nIt requires a strong stomach and strong fortitude and there's I don't think any elected Republican other than Trump even if they had made the promises Trump made I think all of them would have caved by now\nBut Trump hasn't it doubles down All right I'm going to just dominant issue to executive order I'm going to end the birthright citizenship let me read the or the fourteenth amendment Allen begins\nAll persons not the fourteenth amendment goes back to Eighteen ... I think it was ratified by Congress in age and sixty six or ... it was passed by Congress ratified by the state's two years later so agents sixty six it was\nPassed by Congress in ratify but the state's Eighteenth sixty eight and its original intent was to grant citizenship to slaves and their descendants and it was part and parcel of post civil war era of America fixing itself it was a good thing\nUh our constitution was written so that the mistakes at the founding could be corrected the vast majority of people do slavery of the founding was was on tenable but they needed the union in order to fight\nThe revolutionary war they needed the southern states they needed unity to do that so they had to accept slavery but they built in safeguards to wipe it out of habit of age in sixty eight\nThe fourteenth amendment begins this way all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there of our citizens of the U.S\nEnded up the state where in they reside it was clearly intended to be referring to slams and their descendants\nThe parts that birthright citizenship a freaks half to delete art naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction that robe\nAre not naturalized and you are not subject to the U.S jurisdiction if you're here illegally\nYou cannot be you're under some other countries jurisdiction if you're here illegal you cannot possibly be naturalized\nWell the birthright citizenship crowd which ones don't watered down American culture and destroy western civilization conveniently leaves out naturalized in ...\nWhich ones don't watered down American culture and destroy western civilization\nConveniently leaves out naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nSo your born here child absolutely is not a citizen and this is what Trump is saying Trump has finally pushing back against an assumption\nThat has been made because it was the least half of resistance if you will but now it's it's make or break time\n\nAs my friend McCarthy says you need somebody to break the furniture sometimes you're going to remodel\nHouse I got to take a quick time out a little long haired next segments going to be sort of Amish Limbaugh ... only on the email I met were\nIs threatening to them why would that question answers are self talking about the Democrats\nRush Limbaugh reducing am doing the um news tone of voice from the bio safe environment studio this is ...\nNo one knew the tone of voice from the bios even foreign minister this is Dee Dee well am nine Seventy building ... or more drinks later two or three six maybe Billie used talk Ninety five point five\nStirs more debate on immigration how many ...

this we're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen there there there needs to be a pretty big re education of the American population in general on the whole subject\nOf immigration and so Trump and his ... the roots of an executive order is good but there's the you know there's going to be a judge that's going to bring it to a screeching halt everybody knows that\nI mean that'll happen within hours of Trump signing the executive order everybody involved you know is that is going to happen that then begins the process and it probably will end up at the Supreme Court unless Congress does right legislation in dealing with a constitutional amendment\nOr it may take more than just the statutory\nAct and the left and they've got plenty of judges out there are going to be using every damn one of them to try to shut down every effort here\nAnd we end up having a chance to win\nBy shining the light on the left and who they are at what they do by forcing them

believing in sanctuary cities for someone out make 'em defend it\nMake a run for office extorting the virtues of science race to make the left speak make them behave make them stand up and support

forcing everybody just see that the media isn't the media the media is the Democratic party\nAnd all of these things are why the people I talked to who think that there's not going to be a blue wave thinking they think more and more Americans because of Trump are finally seeing liberalism and action\nAs opposed to having been told what liberalism is and who liberals are there now see I get\nAnd

I got a I got you know I'm On Fox News Sunday\nTwice a year during ratings month [noise] and\nChris Wallace is always\nVery polite and exceedingly nice and asks me to make sure that tell you not to get mad at him for interrupting me because he doesn't he would never get a question and after ... the first one\nSo I got a note from a golf buddy who watched this past Sunday man this guy wall as you say he's a good guy but this guy's gone so far left I don't know if I don't know if I couldn't believe what you tell me about him anymore\nSo I said well what happens well it clearly wasn't this\nOn Fox News Sunday Chris Wallace contrast in front page headlines from the Washington Post the day after Steve ... was shot in Alexandria, Virginia by Bernie Sanders supporters with the Washington Post headlines following the capture\nOf the mail bomb mastermind\nAnd Trump's support her ... rock and not surprisingly the post made sure to emphasize that say ox political views were mentioned in the headline while a guy that shot up skill lease was not mentioned\nPolitically at all and it's Chris Wallace holding needs to headlines up and pointing it out let's say a headline read bombs suspect outspoken supporter of Trump Wallace said that the headline really surprised him he\nBombs suspect outspoken supporter of Trump Wallace\nSaid that the headline really surprised him he expected the Washington Post headline to read in something like suspect arrested\nA closer inspection of a article finds that it does not even mentioned the ... was the bombing suspect until the fourth paragraph\nInstead the first three paragraphs read like a psychological profile of the guy talking about his support for Trump and all of stickers on his van but on the other hand the headline after the ... shootings Sandy congressman shot in Virginia\nIt didn't mention his name it didn't mention his support for Bernie Sanders and the front page article did not mention\nUm anything infected foot noted his support for Sanders and it barely like he wanted an asterisk mentioning that the guy was highly critical of President Trump\nSo here's Chris Wallace holding up the obvious evidence of media bias here that he said surprised him\nAnd later on in the in the show adjacent riling up a Wall Street journal was on he said if you want to know why Trump won't give up Twitter and if you want to know why Trump won't give up social media this is why these two headlines or why\n... right ... ... every day Donald Trump is the only Republican waving or informing people about the success of his policies\nEveryday stock market good Trump tweets everyday consumer confidence up Trump's tweets it every day what ever the economic noses or whatever the successes that his agenda his administration is having he tweets\nAnd if it weren't for him it wouldn't be out there other than us of course here [noise] uh in so called alternative media but the but but the point is the Republican Party is not even touting the Trump administration's agenda successes Trump alone is doing it\n\nAnd that's why he's not going to give up the opportunity to do it in and I hope we never does\nBut when I when I realized this that Trump is the only guy like today there are a couple of tweets Trump tweeting the consumer confidence as being in a record high\nAnd and relating it how can people be voting Democrat when this kind of great economic news has been the the news of the day for two years\nThere's all kinds of Republicans are running for election and four hundred and thirty five house seats [noise] thirty five thirty six Senate seats\nWhere is I don't ... McDaniel is out there reading some things out now but where is the party in general touting itself\nAnd its achievements and you don't see it other than from Donald Trump\nAnd he's not whining about that he's unabashed in just tweets about\nAnd ah and ... and eat sweets the truth out about the media\nAs they report on him and law or just starts or what have you but there is an incredible incredible series of success stories\nThat at any time in the past would have been\nOf great help and you ... and assistance in running for election or reelection great news that would portray and show the Republican Party and a great light and Trump's it for the most part\nI'm it really when\nYeah that's such a one man show in many regard as such such a missed opportunity\nThe consumer confidence news I mean\nHow can that even be with all the news you see every day if you tuned into any drive\nBy outlook even reading the drudge headlines you would think we're on the verge of imploding\nAnd yet consumer confidence is that an all time high well that's a reflection of how people living literally living and their and their their thoughts on the future\nAnd his role bus we positive how can that\nBe if everybody's running around miserable in various stages of Faisal is a more defeat\n\nIts it's important it's very uh being positive is a hard thing to do in any circumstance were not hard wired for it human beings are hard wired for pessimism\n\nI've discussed this many times human beings have a natural tendency to defeat ism and federalism 'cause it's easier uh it leaves the victim hood which of course that's attractive because it always means somebody else's to blame for what didn't happen to you or did the failures or whatever so\nIt's just a natural tendency to tend toward the negative everybody knows how and everybody does it but it takes\nDirect application you have to pause and take stock to actually think positively about things I Do it all the time I'm I'm ... I get myself in the other off or something and I'll I'll stop and remind myself\nHow unbelievably fortunate I Am an blessed but the\nTendency is to be overwhelmed with the things that are disappointing or depressing or angry [noise]\nAnd\nFor that reason I it's easy to get caught up in all of the the negative is them and we are no doubt in the midst of a serious serious\nChallenge for our country but it shouldn't override or neck gate\nThe real truth that we still live in America and we still have the greatest opportunity if we want to try to make the most of it in capitalize on the yeah the obstacles may be bigger and there may be more of them but it's still possible because people are doing it every day\nAnd\nI think the election needs to be looked at in a with a combination of these ways it's a positive opportunity to continue on the corrective pass that were on\nAnd it it it's just better way to live but it takes application to do it when you're bombarded constantly\nWith negative things that I must you know we all are guilty of doing that in a sense because we all want to sound appropriate mornings what's important to keep things in perspective at the same I've got to take a break I should develop this even more\nThan ... ... ... were you were listening\nTo Rush Limbaugh on this issue where Montana\nFive point five when you put a safe in your home what will you put in it what are your most valuable possessions well there's just one brand to say if you should trust to put in your home and that's rhino saves the craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America what amaze you it takes\nTo produce the most beautiful and secure or safe in the world and that's what rhino saves are beautiful creations that help keep your possessions secured parts art part furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "30"}
