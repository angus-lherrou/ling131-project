I\nI think that that that's what organic consciousness all feels on one level or another\nWho were we before we we came into the matrix when we can reach down into that level and I call it the rock consciousness\nThat's where the ... comes out that's where the understanding comes out that's where the ability to be able to look at these programs and see them for what they are um actually starts to starts to come out so first of all it's about recognizing how these programs work\nThey are working through the airwaves but they're also working through what I term are cons um little entities in the background some people call them demons or the black magicians will call upon them so on and so forth but there are centrally just programs\nThat are working in the background these are ... what they do is they whisper all of these negative thoughts into your mind and they they have a direct link into the mind and the more that they're whispering into these ... into your mind then they start to be able to affect physical reality because now you're getting all of these stock program stop loops\nUm and so on and so forth when you're being put into these are ... states when you're sitting there in front of the television and so on and so forth\nSo when you start to get these start loops if you just recognize wait a minute\nThis isn't really coming for me this is coming from some type of programming um that's been injected into my brain Lenny go deeper than that let me go beyond that what do I see when I take a step outside of the matrix or take a step outside of whatever situation that we're looking at whether it's the political situation of spiritual situation a day to day situation\nHow can I see this from a three hundred and sixty degree perspective once you do that then all of a sudden the programming breaks and when it does then you start to see the world for what it really is and you start seeing elements in the media or in the political atmosphere\nThat are good some elements are bad you don't come from a place of left or right anymore instead you just come from a place of what is right and what is wrong and the way that I defined right or wrong it's very simple lightened darkness\nIt's natural law it's a A R U hurting somebody they argue impeding upon somebody's freedom or are you a damaging somebody's property um if you take a look at the situations around us and you asked yourself does this piece of legislation there are about to pass\nIs that impeding upon freedom as that impeding upon life liberty you know these basic fundamental principles of freedom\nThen you can take a look at the piece of legislation for example as what it is instead of saying well my party says this and so I have to believe this are my party says that um so I have to believe that and then presumably realized that this whole divide between us\nHas been systematically programs within the matrix to keep us fighting with each other you know while they continue to manifest all of these realities that they once but really to power lays inside each and every one of us to manifest our own reality\nAs I said before I have a CIA document in my hand called um analysis an assessment of gateway process and it shows you how to manifest the reality around you\nSo by realizing that we are in a matrix realizing that you have the power inside of you to manifest your own reality what I always tell people as we look at the the huge mountain it's in front of us you know and the truth or community and the media community you know all of that and we want to change the world but that's impossible we can't change the world all we can do\nJust change ourselves but what we can do also is we can pick up a rock and move a single rock and then we can show somebody else how to move another rock and pretty soon that entire amount and starts to change\nUsed to say you see a slogan a you know getting the truth about one mind to the time and it just seemed to me that that was you know that was spinning back then but now it's the idea of\nYou split right down the metal and consciousness is is as as being revealed for what it is organic and non player character\nI Want to recommend a book and it's a book that if you were paying attention is in the matrix in fact that the book where\nI remember those guys come to the door the one girl has the rabbits tattooed on her arm and he's looking for I think ... or some sort of drug and eat and a meal has hidden in the book in his book ... the drug\nAnd the book is called similar ... civil acreage simulation it's a book by John ... yard\nAnd basically he's talking about this he said you know their relationships between reality symbols numbers or how society looks at them and how they're used as ...\nAnd the seat with ... and symbolism of cultures and media and constructing and understanding a shared existence that's what the book is about is about how they try to create a shared existence and the collective there are programs that no the words the numbers the codes\nAnd if you can crack the codes and get the cheat sheet you'll be able to master a master of the game not be someone who's just been ...\nDid you know that the end\nAnd how to read descriptive the matrix had to read that book first\nYou know it's an amazing book I've read it to its jumbled yard a eyes I recommend this book is another ground zero must read it's called ... simulation it'll help you understand the matrix a hell of a lot more just like ah the ah the just the gamble book\nAbout myth power of myth also helps you understand Star Wars I Want a lot more to go to a Jimmy Jimmy a Jew in California you're on ground zero go ahead\nHey ... what a great show tonight wow and Christian Sharif thanks for letting us all behind the veil tonight I gotta say I'm I've been a listener for a long time but I think this is one of the most cogent discussions I've heard about the nature of reality\nEspecially a new guys abroad and the and PC to the category of a human existence now and I think the humongous list you may be talking about is is a humanity and another itself because you know through the through the hyper reality programming that we received through a\nFacebook and all I'm we're pretty much a reacting on emotional responses are based on whatever feed we're getting from the matrix\nAnd a Christian ... um I really wanted to thank you guys for bringing a this conversation to the table on on ground zero that is and I was wondering is there someplace where 'cause I Know I I I I heard about a video that you guys did I'm over in Egypt earlier in the show\nAnd I was wondering is there a place where we can see the videos or is there someplace where we can get a hold of you um you know maybe you guys have a website or something\nYeah absolutely we're working on a film called resetting the matrix I ... in the great pyramid which details are journey into Egypt I'm working with this acreage demonic um brew\nThat we actually had four hours in the ... some of the great pyramid completely alone we just a minute there when deep deep deep into trans\nAnd um you can get that film at resetting the matrix dot com\nUm there were some remarkable things that happened on that journey and it was all live streamed which was incredible and of course um we have a radio station CF aren't alive dot com where you can listen to beyond the veil as well and YouTube dot com slash beyond the bail thank you very much for asking that\nYou know you guys do you think you were only ...\nHate Clyde I wanted to ask you if you're on\nOn this um post modern is um this this term hyper reality the book that you just brought up is also I'm highly this the psychology and philosophy behind that has a that book\nBecause I think one of the main scenes in the matrix that a lot of people overlook is the scene where\nUm the ... goes ignorance is bliss ... you know he saw behind the curtain he got behind the scenes he went on a facade he's he realized she wasn't eating steak\nIs really just eating gray slot and eventually he got sick eating the gray slap and he wanted to go back into the simulation yeah and just pretend that he was eating that steak even though he knew it was gray slides\nBecause what a ... or send in the end we prefer the simulation or where the real and that's what we are doing now we're ...\nWe're looking at the simulation and most people are believing the simulation they believe what they're told eastern speaking the script and people started getting ... ... it's going to destroy us because no one is going to know the truth in reality they're just going to prefer the simulation that's why sex box exist\nVirtual reality six exists that's why you're finding sympathetic I people would rather be sympathetic with human beings\n... ... virtual reality sixth exists that's why you're finding sympathetic I people would rather be sympathetic gay either with human beings is because we prefer the simulation because they can control the simulation reality or whatever it is we are doing in the matrix is not good enough they have to program themselves outside to become NBC's\nCan I read one sentence listen to this hyper reality tricks consciousness entity catching from any real emotional gauge Matt studying instead opting for artificial simulation right an analyst reproduction\nRight ... exactly right and that's something that is\nHitting a you've got the hardest hitting show on the air class you are the alternative the alternative thanks for letting me call and you guys great show\nThank you buddy appreciate that very much is very good thank you so much for that kind of in Texas the around with Christians Riggio go ahead\n[noise] um I had actually yeah I wasn't listening from the very beginning so I just came in what you're talking about the the main magic and the person sending the message about it\nAnd I was curious about that so I looked it up at one point and basically it comes from like the the random number generated on for Chan when you post and people would call out like what the end you know if you've got\nRepeating numbers that was supposed to be significant and so people post\nNames and they would call out like what they're what what they thought the end of the sequence would be and if they were right it was looked at as some kind of say let's send in\nThe paper I mean was already I mean you know used and then they used it and then Donald Trump was getting elected and they thought he almost like a me\nWell well another uh affected me ... jobs for the church the sub genius\nYou ever seen that it's a guy smoking a pipe view was taken from an ad and they use it as a as a a a representation of their religion how pretty Newman was from a to Z ad from the Nineteen twenties and he became the agriculture mascot or whatever you want to call it a mad magazine so yes sometimes means can be hijacked sometimes that can be used for other purposes\nThis one seems to be this NBC one seems to be very original but it does a very look uncannily like a human ... among the was would you be announced chemical magical vigil or at least a representation of such\nAs well and when I was ... I went back and I found the post ah there though and it's like that and it said that basically boils down to the main magic is going back to like chaos magic which has to do with a ... with a ... and basically that is I guess that I mean\nIt's just more powerful because more people are doing things with it or spreading it or whatever and so the additional people adding to that means that they're making the schedule effective in the ... in the real\nIt runs the risk aspect it runs the risk of stepping out of the Internet into the real world because there's so many people that are empowering it I\nI uh yeah I mean I ...\nI'm ... it's it's it's bizarre how that happens when he does happen like I said slender man is an example of this\nAh you know I remember a ... somebody had a bit to the director of a nightmare on elm street I actually told me he said that he felt that Freddie Krueger had stepped out of the of the screen and became a Richard Ramirez denied soccer because of course the movie was in theaters\nPretty Krueger stock to people in their dreams\nAnd of course are richer merits would break in through the through in people's rooms and kill them in the middle of the night so it was kind of like the the representation or the shadow or it's like the idea of the joker for example in the black Knight Rises Heath Ledger a play the joker with course paying the didn't play him as a regular clown you play them of course pay\nYet the joker for example in the black Knight Rises Heath Ledger a play the joker with\nCorporate pay he didn't play him as a regular clown he played with course pay which eventually some people say let from the screen and a and became the killer in Aurora [noise]\nSo we need to be the things that the you know certainly ah have power and they certainly blow your mind when you see and you know of course Sandy Hook within Batman as well as so many different means to have ... from the screen and look through the computer into reality and so this may be one of whom to the end PC [noise]\nBut uh certainly is a a new name and usage all\nWe have a Chris geo Riggio whether it's in the program triple eight and six seven three thirty seven hundred it's triple a six seven three thirty seven hundred do you want to witness a magic go to the Internet and finally in PC you'll see that this is the new digital it's empowered it's basically mocking\nThe left and when it does the left field there'd be these humanized by it it's certainly a weapon of warfare especially uh when it comes to cyber warfare Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred ... fix every three thirty seven hundred\nBack with more ground zero don't go here we're listening to ground zero on news talk about five point five [noise]\n", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "19"}
