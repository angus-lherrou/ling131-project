the better your intuition or you or do you feel you're psychic in some ways\nI'm charged\nAt Shea that just goes so capital and I've been\nJust along basically so when I heard your caller or when I heard your guest speak I call in right so you're pretty isolated that yeah you don't have many friends\nYou don't have any adopted ripe friends sure but you were adopted in it that shows I mean [noise]\nYou know I bring it up jokingly trying to feel people out but nobody ever we don't believe you and\nI think the best thing to do would be to start doing some investigation on the Internet and compare when you're experiencing to other people's accounts and I think if you are looking you're gonna you're gonna find your answers one way or another\nYou'd probably find a lot more people do that or like you Jim for at least the you know that what you would find some deeper relationships that will understand what you're saying not not ridicule your will laugh at you if you say that you are one\nAlso you're talking about religion and I went to Catholic schools\nAnd um I've never\nYou know burned or anything like that all the water\nEarning it I really don't feel like you know I've done

for you I'm sure it's been a struggle and of course you say you've been\nThe taste of it okay you like the taste of their own blood\nAnd everybody says directly or vampires are not real correct and you have to be shown to be a believer so how do I believe\nIf you find if you're fired his native believe are just like oh I've got a lot about belief okay with ... I Believe I think it's kind of becoming cleared is not about believe it's about so you like the taste of your own blood\nYou read this is not a religious follow it is not something that it's a religious or act if somebody you know would you if you're a vampire or not so if you like the taste of your own blood and you want to explore further into what can be done to become a vampire at least to\nHave is insatiable a you know there is for blood and four or whatever else energies or whatever else you want to seek out ... ...\nYeah a truly or what they are and how how that'd be proven how can I Know that for myself while\nYou're trying to do a um go ahead can I can I say something I'm at ... so so from the beginning of the\nCall it it sounds like\nYou're looking for something that I was looking for at one point which is to see the fireworks of something to know that something is true now I I've done that before and\nI've been in in haunted places I've always looked for proof but the truth of the matter is there's [noise]\nThere's rarely fireworks so if any rarely earning ...\n... am I going to turn into a vampire if your dream level and that's why I Want to know\nNow now now

be ... be be destined for another state and after death or you understand\n[noise] yes I Do understand and and the answer that I can give you at this point is unless you're like me now\nYou have to find your own path you have to find your own way yeah everybody does yeah that's what I hear from people people who uh\nEmpires I've spoken to say you're gonna find your own way and it's only you discovered self discovery in awakening\nThat's when I hear from people people who uh other empires I've spoken to so you're going to find your own way and it's only you discovered self discovery in weakening I heard the term awakening and human nature sometime in sound editing and\nYou know and if and if that did happen to you and it wasn't for you if it wasn't already in you you wouldn't be happy anyway\nYeah true we'd be happy if you were doing some you don't like it's going to join Missouri Hi Joe you're on ground zero\nThat guy that was good\nI just wanted to tell her drinking the

it how do you get your blood though I mean I I mean do people who you were talking about donors there'd be ... willing we don't need to\n... times and and you know done as do it for their own reasons I've had done is doing it because they say it gives them an experience that they need [noise] which one I I've always wondered what that meant but I'll never know because I'm not them\nIs there a blood letting into a into a cop or do you drink and drive right from the body\nI drink it from the flow of blood putting it into a copy of the fast way to get blood jello\nWhich you know interestingly enough viewing or the girls that are more single donor or killed their classmates right and the blood on the glass and he would have ended up with a big glass cello that's gross [noise] Joe how are you saying I'm Sorry you were talking over a year ago\nI was asking if this was just to satisfy her own body craving or is there more sinister darker reasons for the drinking at the [noise]\nWell initially there's a definitely a physical need and the blood cells some sort of role in my ... not to keep me healthy\nAnd keeps me a disease free [noise] and uh as far as darker purposes\nNot intentionally but I'll tell you a there is definitely something to talk to him [noise] ah okay just there is and I and I'm not it's not my Amer but there's definitely something dark about drinking and other human blood\n[laughter] obviously now it's like a weekly daily or anything we got to do\nSome ... a couple of times a month as good ... times a month so uh\nYou know check your delivery and
