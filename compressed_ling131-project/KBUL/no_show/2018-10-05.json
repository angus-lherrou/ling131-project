Washington is it you know it\nWell the thing about this you remember the Clarence Thomas case any deal\nSure for yes I did\nIt ever this bad I don't remember ever being as bad I remember that the hearings happened but there wasn't the threat of civil war ... and there wasn't security on Capitol Hill\nThere wasn't a Dianne Feinstein and cheers there were women saying that if this decision is made it means to be America doesn't care about women who have been raped he was a very very it is serious serious decision and it has been made series because of the symbolic ... and what is going on in Washington DC\nIs because someone or something\nHe's tapping into the synergy and bringing forward the darkest powers of the darkest feelings in everybody's hearts and minds right now\nSo I don't want people to control or at least try to control themselves because if you know we will have some problems here in the United states\nI'm telling you and you're right because there is I agree with you there is quote injuring going on by dark elements because they have this feeling that in a month from now they're in trouble I think the Democrats know\nThat there's something big happening in the lungs and it's it's not going for them and so uh this this is not the same Democratic Party that was John Kennedy's Democrat Party this is a diabolical dark Marxist Party\nAnd they have to talk about culture and I agree with you [noise] um I don't know whether you are at liberty can you can you say who is is a building has built this temple or this or ...\nWell yeah I Know is responsible for it I mean it was a group of it was called um the digital archaeological and then the in super digital archeology\nWell basically what they do is they do three D. uh three D. printing of a sudden these monuments\nAnd they found it interesting to to ah basically reconstruct and and uh actually erect these ah this arch all over the world and every time it goes\nGoes there people always protests and they said this is a representation of evil do not bring the the the doorway or the arch way to the temple you up to our city\nAnd they do anyway and when they bring to cities things go weird when when it was in Trafalgar Square\nOr they actually somebody decided well we have that why don't we wrecked a a a statue to pursue the demon or The Exorcist was sitting there on the library of the queen\nThat's it is incredible then then and then uh you know what in New York they do it they put it right next to the for the call Cleopatra's Needle which is which is basically horses member as the it's the ... because the Jed and and it would be a symbolism of the meeting of both male and female in New York they did that and no one seemed to blink an eye about that I'm not surprised\nBecause one of those cities that right it's just dark all the time\nAnd so the rice in thing that happened the other day where the guy males the rice into the president and Ted Cruz's snapping all those people had happened when the stars just happen to align with the moon and it was Gemini it was ... it was the crown of\nThe crowd of bail Gemini with the with the two stars the twins politics and caster castor oil caster seeds make make rice and a sister that are out there is all happening yeah\nWho were mentioning the same to the occasion to your show every night you were mentioning about the uh the uh the European Parliament is in the shape of the uh the tower a battle yeah and and then you're talking about the horror ball on top of that part but the horror Bible on top of the beast in the ...\nAll over the it's all over the area in Brussels wherever the European Union is\nThat and then they have the the twelve stars and the crown of the of the woman the battle on 'em in the European Union five you see the woman a battle on writing the beef dinner for your you see it on tapestries all over the place and then they have an unfinished looking building that replicates or at least books like the tower battle they're they're they're just open about\nHow they're using that symbolism the symbolism of the apocalypse to bring about the government's they want and the synergy they wish to tap into pay and they're tapping into the dark forces of confidence strictures\nThat are that are are old demons like time on as Modi is I could go down the list of all the demon did they decide they want to worship and bring forward and this is where they're doing\nThey're panicking in Washington because they know if they get this fits the conservative vote on the uh nine membership a Supreme Court then that means things like baby murders going to be reopened and of course the other thing which means you know Saddam equals marriage\nThey well and and and what does bail represent baby murder\nExactly baby murder and everything that is Washington I mean ... if ever there was a ...\nYou we listen to you thank you yeah I just remember man love is solved the coldest solver and gold calls the shots God's cheese and the weights and while the Democrats are panicking and if you if you're implying that their culture and I agree with ya\nSomebody's got during I don't know whether it's a party it's someone that wants to see everyone come together class together in some reputable operation with the Colts overtones that really is it it's crazy Paul thank you for the call triple a fix every three thirty seven hundred a AAA took them at three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back\n[noise]\n\n\n\nSo there were letters that have numerical value so if you look at the Hebrew equivalent of our W the letter is vi V. A. V. vibe or it's Bob and so the number of value of revive he's six\nSo vibe Bob Bob or WWW numerically it's six six six\nThat is correct and now I think again solidifies of everything\nW W numerically is six six six\nThat is correct and now I think again solidifies uh everything you're saying mhm and uh I just want people to know\nIf you take the Romans looking as if you take the Roman numeral or you take the Roman numerals six okay which is vi\nYou'll vi vi vi and then you could not to be ... it's a WWW so you have another six six six\n... and\nIt just it's just weird but it it it's weird a cold ah numerology a new we're number gaming and let her gaming but it's certainly a comes together in such a way\nYeah uh that you know are very you know we've got so many different languages and alphabet and all but just like he's a confirmed it uh it just seems to go on and on and you know again will never date set or anything but I just wanted to thank you for the show and just like Paul basically said the other night we're not going to studying dates that I\nReally believe we're in the delivery room ... and I think people need to get ready\nFor the thing about long vaguely is is that I Know that he's certainly you know he follows my show and I just love him and that's why I bring him on all the time because he just seems to be you know he has a great personality and he delivers what he delivers in such a way that makes it interesting it doesn't make it bore he's not as dogmatic is most preachers and that's why I find Paul Begley to be very interesting and\nVery very entertaining and I've seen is I've seen his sermons and they're amazing so you know I uh I Love the guy\nA solo anyway appreciate the time you're getting ready to talk about this and I hope it will help people understand that a lot of the anti Christ has the tools and that's going to be the computer and\nI get the feeling that that didn't matter what go ahead I'm Sorry what you're saying\nI was going to ask you are in relation to the Israel becoming a nation in Nineteen forty eight\nAbout because forty eight or forty six okay\nDoes anybody know like the advent of the computer like well ear that was no okay I just wonder if that coincided anyway\nIt was a it was Nineteen forty eight actually they're not as you put in May of Nineteen forty eight where they became indoor Israel becoming a nation in yeah may Nineteen forty eight\nOkay again or just everything that's going on and Trump recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel\nAnd those are the things the easing looking at ... I mean you're a Christian or right and many of us are like I say you know Christians are right now looking at their politics and they're looking at their belief systems\nAnd while they're not diametrically opposed they certainly are throwing wedges into everything we think and everything we do and what a what bigger which is better than the debate about sexual promiscuity rape and the death of children and these are the main things\nThat are focused with the horn got a bill and this is the main things being focused in this hearing and it's the main thing that it's going to be ruled upon by the FBI and by the Senate so if this is not a coincidence a very very deep and meaningful coincidence I don't know what it is\nYeah you're spot on with everything you're saying I appreciate you are bringing outlets to light and keeping it in the spotlight um 'cause the mainstream media share is not going to do it\nThank you Todd I've received a call already thinking liar let's go to Felix in Pennsylvania Hi Felix from ground zero\n[noise] hey and I are doing good man hey you know it it isn't stressed up it's very interesting that ah you know the topic of the aisle number here the internal growth right that washes and Clinton and I believe for Rocco bottom all hang out there together\nYeah a lot of ah a lot of famous uh you know dignitaries leaders me Henry Kissinger\nI'm all hang out there together\nWell yeah a lot of ah a lot of famous uh you know\n... dignitaries leaders meet Henry Kissinger Ronald Reagan Nixon\nAnd go down the list of all leaders I mean the fact that the plan to drop the bomb ... Hiroshima was made the bohemian grove under the hour\nSo I mean it up yeah yeah the Manhattan Project it was all just it was all talked about and playing down to the human growth that's where it all came down and came down ah after revelation from the hour and of course you know that when Oppenheimer build the bomb you build it on on ah some old uh historic\nUh things you discovered from ah the ... the end you punish odds and it was all ancient ancient destructive history that are maybe reveal the anybody then when asked well\nHow does it feel to set up the world's first atomic bomb because ... was the first atomic bomb to go up in modern times meaning that they got the information from the old text and the writings of uh of some of the older civilizations that had that power way back when\nYou know\n... I I think that you and I have a very similar religious background\nOkay and ... and and uh and thinking is because I was raised a forest fire very devout Christian parents okay go ahead everything pounded into like you say get out of town and then you can rent and this whole thing about the end of the world you know the second coming in and uh\nYou know ...\nI I've I of course have become a bit of an agnostic\nBecause a lot of it doesn't really make sense to me you know like when you go back to the beginning of the Bible you know\nWhere you know they say God's perfect God Knows everything and got ... evil and then the new the new world is gonna be you know no more evil evil will ... right okay but if God originally created the world ... Scott has um that you know knows everything and there's all powerful and hates evil\nIs not the ones who created the devil\nHe created the hell but the ... but the devils are I guess you could say destiny was to be in opposition of God and that is that was the plant anyway it was a plan that uh we agreed too and we all agreed to it okay\nWe agreed that it would be best that we had liberty and\nAnd the ability to choose rather than being forced into slavery under under the direction of God Satan wanted slavery or he wanted the slavery a man uh and and God didn't want that you wanted ... you wanted to save your he wanted to wanted someone to come down and save\nThe people from their sins because of the original fans and the\nProblems that came about in the in the ... era\nSo I mean we want to get even buy that goes out\nThat's what makes no sense to me though you know what I'm saying because they've got ... uh are already you know there's this despises evil why would they created and the first place and the argument is always drawn up you know I mean I come from a family of eight and half of us are are like me you know and the other half are very devout\nAnd they say well of course you know it's because it's free will but that\nDoes not want you know sin or you know\nHe's ... okay here's the deal the created opposition to engenders strength that's the reason why the opposition exists you know wouldn't be strong without opposition you wouldn't gain\nYou wouldn't gain muscle without opposition you wouldn't gain fire without friction there's gotta be and opposition to make things happen and the choices whether or not you wish to go with the opposition or fight against the opposition\nAnd the Democrats thinks that what the power of valuable\nYeah um how you know man like you know ... the way that the scripture says that you know ... unless ... becomes like us you know uh we should separate them somehow and you know of course and people were given different languages that they couldn't understand each other right but the thing that I've always\nIt's separate them somehow you know of course they people were given different languages that they couldn't understand each other right but the thing that I've always wondered is is that every single geographic area of the earth people or the state with different until they started you know ... together ...\nSelf in some ways it's got to make is got to make in over the course of a couple of thousand years man couldn't have evolved you know and to the states different character\nLanguage raiders language was a protection mechanism that's why it changed that's why they were different languages because of the scattering of the people they needed languages to be different in order to protect themselves it was a protection mechanism in the beginning\nNow it's not we we we inter relate with one another but in the past it was the idea of using language is a barrier to keep the enemies away and to have those were of your same kind learning the language is and the codes in the hands gestures or it's just like the secret meeting I'm Talking about tonight with the esoteric knowledge\nThere's esoteric speak their esoteric signed symbols and sign posts and symbols mean a lot to people and and to argue that they don't I think is is is completely ignorant because when you say\nLike for example if I were a swastika into an elementary school I'm sure that I Would be escorted out handcuffed and thrown in jail but see that's the thing is it a swastika used to be an eastern philosophical symbol the Indian cultures\nWould uh have a swastikas their symbol but since it's been\nHijacked by the Nazis you can't wear it but the symbol means something to somebody and it means different things to different people with a by ... by a where across people will say well obviously he's a Christian\nAnd yet if you were if you were a ... they'll say well obviously euro which the ... used to represent what the cross represented ... at it until after the crucifixion\nSo I didn't know that and so yeah I mean see that's the thing is because it represented the they had their hands outstretched and the legs sprayed turning it upside down in ... so they head is in the ground and the body is played awkward\nSame with the upside down cross it was the same principle that you wouldn't hurt the hat and the arms and it perverts a perverse the meaning of what the symbol is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Billings", "day": "05"}
