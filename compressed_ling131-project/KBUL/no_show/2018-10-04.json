get a group of researchers and they say we need to rush to come to a meeting and they meet in California Irvine and they meet their ears and California are invite\nMe there and they're saying guys we need to reevaluate what we're tracking here which is something that's a techno signature not necessarily extraterrestrial intelligence but it's a technological signature from extraterrestrial intelligence and we need to take it seriously because we may be looking for things in the wrong place\nAnd we need to start understanding this so NASA of course follow suit and says okay\nThis week

know just some natural thing this could be extra in ... extraterrestrial intelligence\nCommittees are their machinery like flashing light or some sort of a flash from their uh their burners going off

happening now and why is all this stuff happening in a ... like to think of it in a way that it it's like I I think there's always been profits and it told us stuff over\nYeah and I think one of the big things that we've overlooked\nAs a or one of the big people that we've overlooked all over the years as a profit was gene Roddenberry and one of his biggest things with the prime directive right you're going to face with a plan so what are they going to do they're not going to come right here and see they they are going to come\nThey'll send a robot ... the guards are going to return they'll send the robot for ... for them to see what's going on\nSo center they'll send their emissary first and what's an angel in Missouri what you know it it's like back in the day they called the angels but they were emissary is and what do we do we don't send humans out do do the work of exploration of asteroids I mean we've got\nRight now we've got jumping probes from Japan on an asteroid we've got a rover on Mars okay got you know we're going to send robots out into space to do exploration\nWho knows maybe I mean our technology is pretty damn primitive but who knows maybe these little alien graves were robots that they are robots or they are synthetic ... looked like synthetic life forms their their their life forms\nThey breed they they they think they do things but they're not you know they're not biological they're not like a great\nGreat grains or just clones there just clones and you know um windows ... head on this one night and then she was talking to you about the graves yeah or they have no soul yeah that's because they're born in space\nWell not only that but they're just you know and and what is it that lend them on the house said many times she said\nAnd I think she did this when we were interviewing her ah I'd go back and review that interview we did an interview with her when we were in ...\nAnd she interviewed over Skype without she wasn't there\nBut she wanted to go on the show when we were there and she was bringing up a these these thinking robots and these alien technological marvels and she was saying something to that effect you were saying that the biggest concern the aliens how were the biggest interest the ailing raise have\nHe's an interest in our consciousness don't they don't have ...\nI wanted to say he said in our soul\nYeah basically are so that they have it here in our souls rarely the barn\nAnd face they have no soul right are they interested at us 'cause we have an enlightened salt\nRight and they're wondering how is it you know they're wondering what was this some synthetic technology was created by an intelligence far greater than us you know can you imagine Bailey and saying that about us saying wow you know you know we're we're tell you that we're sort of what's out\nThere they're a creation of the gods to write God's word here either you know you were talking earlier about cargo calls and stuff right as far as I'm concerned the cargo calls on this planet go back\nSix eight thousand years because our religions today are based on what was left after the garden left this world right\nBut see we have you know it's now thinking about this we go back to the ancient religious they ran amok religions and they had technologies most of the arc of the cabinet that was a technology right\nSo back even before the amber hammock religion she has a scenario and you had that\nThe Vatican ... I mean remember laws do walk a in China's remember\nWhen I when I ever said about the atomic bomb he says this was the first atomic bomb that was made in modern times he says that phrase\nWhen I get from it is that they see us as an advanced model of synthetic intelligence where they see us as an advance modeled them have something that they don't and that's consciousness and I think this is a because that was\nI was reading a long time ago you know what do the aliens if they come here what do they want for us but they don't they don't want\n'em they don't want to some of the of the building blocks for live music me found all over the universe\nThe only thing they could think of would be a two things water and Cora filled because corn feel I think is unique to planet earth and water when they can get water anywhere usually in space we have probably the purest form where the foreign they need for either fuel for sustenance for some reason they need water\nFor the other one would be either they look to us for did Jeff ... meaning the aliens come here to eat us or they're here to examine us and they're here to look a silver because we have things that they don't have and they're wondering how we've been made and they also feel the same way about some animals that's why they\nYou know the alleged Cato mutilation ideas they they they see us in the experiment on us and in some cases they have mutilated people or they have taken him in harm them\nInsane with animals I you know it's not just how the\nAnd the experiment on us and in some cases they have mutilated people or they have taken him and harm them\nIn seeming with animals I you know it's not just how the mutilated horses and beer sheep other animals get mutilated the same way cows do so we have experiments going on with these creatures because they don't understand how were made and why we work\nThey know what a brain is being with a computer brain is they know how a synthetic Bobby's operate but whoever's program them have this as a keen interest as to why we exist\nAnd they don't know why we exist\nSo I can see where were you derive that from because that's what we do to lower forms of life right we either a lower life forms or we experiment\nOr maybe they don't see us is lower life forms they see and says some higher unattainable lie for him and they want to take it apart to see how it works\nWell I mean look all that is possible but I\nI think we we have to assigned to the concept of God what level of intelligence is God is God's spiritual since day or biological\nAnd I'm just saying that it's may not always be the case that biological create synthetic\nWill be okay what is guidance biological plus\nMeaning that if you use biological or if she's biological then what we have is a limited God or we have a group of them died and they were just the remnants of there's a a a they're a creation that\nThey created us they died and now we're here to take the stewardship and many people who are afraid to say well we can't play God that's the point we should because\nThat's why they created that they created us to grow in nature and they are they create is to grow in intellectually and that way they were basically leave us to do what other civilizations have done in the past and that is grow\nAnd then of course they get to a certain ah news you know they get they get to a certain level where they can't go any further either die off or they then branch out into space\nSo how do you handle the argument which came first the chicken or the egg\nI've heard it's the chicken but then again I don't know\nThe I Would say it's they both happened at the same time and uh because it's a creation\nAnd but then you go back to the the age old question of who created a God and so therefore you can say it would be whether you say God is biological or God is spiritual intelligence or synthetic intelligence you always run into that argument\nBut what Hitler so the right biology by biology in our sense would be limited would it not\nYes way\nThat there would be less limits on synthetic\nTechnology there would be less limits on synthetic technology am I correct\nYes and and and but then I Would say after that there would be even less limits on spiritual intelligence if you want to recognize spiritual intelligence\nBut that is something that they're doing with ... thinking about that for a moment they want to know if everything and I guess I could use the parlance every ... they're wanting everything has got in it\nWhen I mean by that it does everything have a consciousness spirituality to it or does everything have ah some sense of being\nThat say and so that's exactly where I'm going because in order to determine that does everything have God in it you first have to determine what God this is God's biological synthetic or spiritual wow\nSo I'll leave it at that\nAnd then of course I think that's\nWhat God this is Scott biological authentic or spiritual wow I'll leave it at that\nWealth and then of course I think that's going to be the big question and future used to be you know where did we come from why are we hearing where we are going now it's what God do we have six watching it over us as a biological God is it a synthetic God or is it a spiritual God\nAnd if it's spiritual than all the power to this guy has run everything in the planet\nEverything in the universe and it's immense\nIt's men's intelligence that covers the entire brain and the various dimensions that come from a brain yeah\n... and I think he's a ... explains that God has a spiritual intelligence because that would explain that God is everywhere that it's not\nGoing to have the same limit\nAs biological and synthetic which is limited to ... you know travel and transport in a body\nIf your spiritual on television you don't have a physical form to transport so you see everywhere just at every time\nAnd so once again being the attainment of spiritual being comes after death payment of of what you do with that spiritual being after death either determine whether or not you're going to go elsewhere what's that\nIsn't that what we mean by a soul isn't that in fact uh our spiritual intelligence is because it's something that that doesn't really have a solid for\nAll the way it goes with quantum immortality and we talked about going to be more tolerant before have we not yes\nThey did say some sort of transmission it's some sort of broadcast it only our machinery whatever it may be organic or whatever we want to call it may be some form of synthetic intelligence he's picking up on that signal and when that when our bodies breakdown that signal gets taken from that body and goes elsewhere in transmits elsewhere\nSo whenever you have to solve for example complex math problem you first have to define the terms and so that's what I wanted to do it like\nWhoa jak thank you it it did it basically makes the discussion even more fascinating thank you so much I can I\nCan I yeah that that that uh once again a brings up some very valid points about you know we have the hallmark card version of God and you can and I I don't mean that insulting way what I mean is is that we have had God simplified for us in the Bible\nSo all we know is God but due to basically determined\nThat type of God\nHe she or it is it would be either biological synthetic\nOr spiritual\nConsciousness is the most valuable thing in the University of this is what the synthetic intelligence with the techno signatures want\nFrom earth then obviously this is what he meant by being made in the image of God that we have\nGod's consciousness that we have the God consciousness in each and every one of us in that we are potentially use it\nFor good things and not use them all the time for bad things\nIn abusing that ability is when we commit acts where people die and suffer and live in pain when we have the ability to do great things and
