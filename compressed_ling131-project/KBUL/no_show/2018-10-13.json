she is she is\nThe the most elegant first lady we have had since Jackie oh she's not been on any cover of any magazine she has and nobody says anything nice about her nobody says out of all it's incredible that when she was when she was out just recently last last week in where Africa and\nThis was a Ralph Lauren photo shoot it was one some of the most beautiful photos she was in Egypt in front of the in front of the pyramids it was in\nTrouble so beautiful so tasteful\nNothing you know it's not a major issue obviously per se as compared to others but what I honestly think it is the most pure example we have\nShaggy as this great guy Nobel Prize winning oh yeah he's got to be he'll be a Nobel Peace prize winner so\nHe came out so surprise surprise he really came to prominence or the media loved him the west loved him during the Obama administration\nUh why was that because well he was one of these one's advocating for democracy and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other places when the Arab Spring was breaking ... now that lines of exactly what the Obama administration was wanting to do and also who are they in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood and places like Egypt will surprise surprise ... is Muslim Brotherhood\nHe's actually that's the reason why he's not in the people in the media have said oh well he spoke out against\nYou know the the the kingdom the Saudi kingdom and that's probably why they don't like him\nNo kidding but it goes way beyond that like he they support a political Islam group that wants to overthrow the monarchy it's a lot goes a lot further than ... spoke out against them yeah he is the public and I would say public enemy number one but he's right up in that group with them um and they was friends with the crown prince though it was he not um\nI don't know how they're framing it he was friends he was he was ... he loved the crown prince they got along and\nAnd he said a lot of great things about the crown prince now he disagrees with some of the crown princes policies and that's where they've\nWants to take the Saudi out of Saudi Arabia basically that's the best way to put it for this guy but he's a he's not a good guy he wants to political Islam he wants to political Islam to invade countries all over the world and take it over and he was living here for quite a while before he went to work in Washington Post yeah no no issues there whatsoever\nI'm On the other hand you have this one guy that's not that great of a guy even on the other hand you have a Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince who ever want to send this is this great reformer he he he's a great guy is a great leader is going to modernize Saudi Arabia women can drive now all these social is all these tackling\nHe they dug plain and simple he is eight Doug they go after he's doing this to tons and tons of people thousands of people in his own country people just disappear they go to jail for the rest of the life he is a thug and the only reason he's tackling social issues is because they have a lot of young people in Saudi Arabia\nAnd social unrest of the doubt that hit the streets have you want to see the place where the next ah Arab Spring might happen Saudi Arabia\nThey the demographics point to it I Would not be surprised rattle so how do you keep Saudi Arabia under control though without a thug\nYou can't I mean it's like Russia really either bright groups like other countries like that you really can't here's a disturbing part ... most likely most likely this guy was killed by Saudi Arabia yeah um it just it just feels like a man and maybe all of a sudden he pops up and I'm like\nNo I was a chick fillet and nobody in the news media wants to look at ... fillet so I was invisible for a while\nMaybe doubtful here's the problem we are we are pushing through a major arms deal with Saudi Arabia we should not be doing that now we should not be doing that that should be canceled today I can tell you however what is being what is happening is\nYou know the United states was supporting the Muslim Brotherhood now we have some people who know exactly what's going on in that part of the world and they're probably being talked to by Saudi Arabia going look look guys guys\nYeah I Know you don't like what we're doing here but uh it's the Muslim Brotherhood and its a caliphate you what you want the whole region to be in the Muslim Brotherhood caliphate have at it you know and that's the decision our president is is having to make\nIt's why we should stay out of other people's businesses and then stay

was it was a much lighter weight\nThan the shattered by the Saturn I've been a liquid fuel and the constellation\nBeing solid fuel mhm by Brady so bad\nIn order to actually kill the astronaut\nOkay and they work you know that for half a dozen years\nAnd the debt down now and I the cost overruns that we're probably due to that at but ah if they've got it down there shouldn't be any reason uh for Don sustainability in this project\nWell that's all it was it needed to dampen down the rock and I mean why don't they braving like Neil Armstrong did I mean come on they got shaken before they went up and then it got really smooth right after he got out of gravity pull right\nOkay yeah yeah but while the consensus is that\nThe liquid fuel is much danger is a much more dangerous than the a solid field because you remember on the shuttle was a call us\nAt the ah over in a failed\nAnd it shut up blow torch end of the liquid fuel the big liquid fuel tank and that's what blew up\nTo boosters just kept\nThey shut off in two different directions or without\nThe main carriage mhm the think tank\nAnd shuttle but uh I as far as I Know we were still scheduled to do a a a pre or a Apollo a or a a fly by\nA visa the Apollo eight or with the ah new Orion and a constellation next year\nWell I Hope and fill on top but they're saying that it would cost overruns we may not see we'd be seen indefinite hold on a space exploration and they didn't say how many years but I mean\nBush said twenty twenty or well actually said twenty Fifteen hundred and twenty been theme of the moon base on the moon will you know moon base or twenty twenty or not they're not happening we've started I Know but\nNot very somewhat Robert Bigelow was working on a Bigelow Aerospace I thought yeah that that could be easily done we can have\nThese you know the kind of like a how can we compare them you know those jumped castle have birthday parties that's what I like they're they're like these really advanced a castle jumps type uh inflatable or did they have free speech stations on the moon for the ...\nYeah I've I've seen those are those kinds of stocks and they look they look I don't know they look pretty ... to me but uh as as far as uh uh\nThe Apollo and needs to be faked a I've got a Ellen's dean Alan ... book is illustrated book with all his paintings in front of me right\nNow mhm and it is just the most spectacular thing enrich it you know he went to art school and ah the sides being at a ... a flyer and test pilot he went to art school ... and he\nJust got hundreds and hundreds of stuff then testicle paintings of his experience all the way\nThey're marketing thing they last the pictures are right wink wink I bet it but yeah\nHe was he says he says that\nAs he signed it finally said that Glenn hold on their own special dreams Ellen de\nOh that's great well see that that's the big question though you know there's so many questions that are unanswered about the sixty nine moon landing you know one another when whether or not they advance to\nAdvance up in a studio whether they were orbiting the earth the whole time or even that's how it could have been done the rocket went off the orbited the planet just like they do the space shuttle\nOr in the meantime they'd already a pre produced a number of shots on the moon and then it was time for them to come back the ab ab a command module back to earth\nNo one was the wiser\n[laughter] [noise] I I I didn't get argue for it or\nYou're a believer aren't you absolutely\nWell I I have my question I have my doubts I mean I don't you know a battle Ryan spacecraft does not go up or two years would not send a doubt into your head or at least next year window down through your mind that they're they're they're screwing with you there playing with your head\nWell my brother is working on the project it was the shuttle project ... and ... and he didn't want to start a company and they got the ground test contracts for all the systems on their Ryan tribal\nInside and well it'd be a Ryan goes up hot that doesn't mean we're going to the moon see that's the thing is I Want a guy I Want a man on the moon before\nI die that's that's what I Want to see I don't think I'm going to see it and it sucks because\nI I thought I'd be go to the moon as you said earlier now to get it was just\nKind of that kind of twisted me quite a bit\nYeah well it hurts me enough to have my doubts that's all I got to say [noise]\nBut they can go and thank you I mean if I found out tomorrow that we did go to the moon and they can prove to me beyond doubt I'd shut up about it but no there's no I haven't seen anything yet he convinces me we went to the moon only TV\nThat's the way out after that I I\n... either way I I think I Will come out and the next few years whether that it or not out there\nWell I don't think they're ever going to go back on their uh I mean there are going to go back on their ideas or they went to the moon but thinking about this you know before Kennedy died you know he was talking with the Russians about UFOs all kinds of other crazy stuff I mean what if he said that the Russians\nHey we're gonna we're going to the moon and that we're trying to go to ... go to the moon and uh you know we'll give you a little bit of money you know do do\nYou make this a little this little space race a little more interesting and you know I I just wouldn't say that you know the space race was wasn't really a space race if it was\nRussia basically having an interest in space the United states saying wait a minute they can't have an interest in space we don't want them to spy on us and then they started to say well hey we challenge it to a race that I have compared it to like the fat kid\nGoing up to the the buff guy saying hey I'm going to I'm going to ... I'm going to run a race with you and I'm going to beat you and then in the ...\nAnd the and the the guy must going to say OK guy given a chance and so one day the guy wakes up and says wait a minute and he ... he won the race how did he do that and that's how I think Russia saw this thinking we were before we were more successful in the United states was and now they're doing this how they do it how\nWould they get Ben on the moon impossible\nYeah genius does it get bless everybody went down\nYou know if ... if it was a good buffet was genius Michael thank you for the call it's true it was a genius if that's if that's the case to go to Doug in Pennsylvania Hi Doug you're on ground zero\nAnd you don't find that show is you think you have a hard\nTime believing the whole thing I mean the technology that can engage label took a car up there with him in road around\nYeah [laughter] yeah I Know it just uh the money that it would it\nTake to get there I was sure would have been a lot cheaper to fake it and I think that's why we're not going now because you get up there and here there is money there is\nNo equipment or stop playing there\nWas that was the thing I remember I remember when we went to the moon is really cool and they started talking about the shuttle program and I thought to myself well why is the shuttle so so important and it doesn't make any sense to me I thought\nHe was a shuttle came off to me like a bus it's like hey we're going to drive a bus around the earth for a couple of orbits and then we're gonna we're just going to drop it like a rock through the atmosphere and I always thought to myself ... that's pretty lame you know we went to the moon\nI mean why is this such a big deal and I and to this day I Can't have anybody tell me why they show it was such a big deal it just wasn't a big deal it was like a a space plane in big deal\nIt would have been a big deal if they would have used it to build something like some sort of you know space ship to travel our solar system or something\nBut yeah I Would have been nice if they use it to build something in space but things got nowhere near the moon you go to somebody and say to them well you know how far is the space shuttle go into space they wouldn't know they didn't know they went like three hundred and forty miles in space they didn't know that and then when you say well how\nFar away as the moon they don't know that the only two hundred thirty no other way that you know\nAbout that that was my dog\nHow they're going to have done that because\nIt will German Shepherd each third wife just come home and\nSelling the devil dog from held at all [laughter] like I say of being home I got world for tech right here on the air and I want to know the difference\nHere we go [laughter] for happy Halloween dog can't take care of by probably the like\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six every three thirty seven have to go to Kevin in Ohio Hi Kevin you're on ground zero\nSay on there\nThank you [noise] ah I Can't prove to you that we all know the uh I Can't say that I met this guy who\nWas supposed to have been on who know what I mean my\nDad was an air force his career force and here are near uh Thirty years ago or so we're on a trip out west and we spent some time with a safe Scott ... who was on a couple of missions and was\nA supposedly walk down the middle of a an a policy in the Apollo Fifteen a mission ... ah yet I Can't prove they did or not because I've\nBeen there myself but seem pretty convincing and they\nWhat did you talk with him about it\nSo yeah that's quite a bit yeah I remember in his son was about my age it's aimed at the time we were there and a kind of felt bad for him because it seems you know when your dad has been into space\nAnd then on the ... ... what do you do [laughter] [laughter] it's it's gotta be tough to be back yet right now I'm\nA pretty sure it was a replica of one of the rocks he brought back in his house um I don't think they would let him have we'll walk\nYou know that stuff was better lock and key in behind ... butter paramedic seal uh-huh someplace I'm seeing a couple of those things was playing off a\nMets amazing to me it's gone yeah yeah great guy I said I don't know\nIf you recall he was also involved with Jim and I said I think he was in the gym and I miss yeah the gym and I ate anabolic\nFifteen and Apollo nine I think he did the pollen nine to\n... yeah he was up all night yeah yeah\nSo do you want a couple of mission so what\nWhat exactly are you talking about the ... smelt like cases like the smell anything did he feel anything what was said well\nNo because they would have been they were going to jail that would've been filtered obviously there's no no air no atmosphere up there right but\nBut do you need to I mean you gotta you gotta be able to describe dumping I mean it's not like they\nYeah eight to ... to be with us and they all do it for and things and stuff like that to be under those conditions for ... days is a is a very fun and kind of thing\nI mean it would be it'd be just so weird do you know just say oh I left this planet for another beer in space and I was on that fear for three or four days and I was weightless and\nAh you know I just\nI don't know how anyone can handle that that would be such a mental you know I mean that that was mentally just screw with you I mean I I I just don't know how anyone could uh you know mentally or you know contemplate depending on the planet\nThe opposite and I always say if you're down deep south you know if anything were all men are\nYou're breaking their your phone's breaking eggs or your phone's breaking\nSo I took a um if if the brain and you know we got plenty of that you got the sense the whole time that you know the opposite right and that's you know up in space out that said pulling away from the Kevin\nAre you sure you are not on the moon your phone is breaking up I mean like you know then again you would probably be a lot better if it was moon because I Know here are filled with a reception for the moon was just immaculate who's the immaculate\nReception so yeah I don't I don't know you're breaking up I I ... and ... the reason why I'm so bizarre but you're breaking up is that when I worry I Want to hear your story that so I worry about that man\nIs okay yeah I Can't prove it\nThey're right I Believe I Believe that I Believe they do I understand why people do doubt on the head of only ... you know I remember watching that at the time and thinking well yeah that could happen\nWell I I'm not saying I'm not saying we never event and we we didn't eventually go I'm saying that I don't think it happened\nIn sixty nine I think it happened much later setting that whole Nineteen sixty nine being was was staged and and you know and\nAnd they were able to do more work on trying to get through the Van Allen belts and trying to get through a bunch of other things and and to make it happen took a lot of years because I think even order von Braun and said some of the fact that he didn't think that it could be done and it was done it was weird the even more than ...\nSo that that was very young at the time but I Do remember it until a\nSo do I I was in a few earlier it yeah I was in kindergarten and we\nHad a what would a reading [noise] lunar module ... we had a a a lunar module made out of construction vapor in our home room when I was in\nElementary school [noise] and I just I got to do the picture I I I had I was able to draw the pictures for the uh there was these little screens that I had to drop drop his is a planet earth and things and put them on the screen it was five years old and draw these run\nAround circles of planet earth than [noise] and put 'em in the lunar module so we had one in our kids enter a kindergarten class was amazing [noise] so yeah when we thought it was cool to back then it was cool to be
