Clinton back with a spotlight on her his killed it\nBut yet we're seeing the meddling going on between both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both talking about possible violent tendencies or activities and the mob speaking of the mob is they say\nGroups like anti ... and other groups that are basically protesting in tearing down walls and doing all kinds of things so\nYou know very habit things are changing and uh yeah\nI'm beginning to wonder what's going on is going to roads and Ohio high road from ground zero\nLook good [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI I I just one of the phone\nThe misunderstanding and a lot of other crazy things and uh I think it's because of the fact that once again we have to ask ourselves are we pretty much going to you know just\nStay by the biases are we going to weigh things out for what they truly are and that is if you're not seeing any meddling going on with Russia or you're not seeing any meddling going on with any other group and now you see how Facebook and Google have taken a complete three sixty turnaround you're going to remove all kinds of sites Facebook\nBecause I'm sure there are responding what Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump said\nSo now they're saying well we got to remove these sites because it's you know creating a ... a what we call the political\nOr a political mess and then Google turns around and they say well what we're going to do now is we're just going to send out our boxer algorithms to look at the tone of the voices how they're how they're voicing their opinions we don't want to create any more fury with our subscribers\nWhich means that I think they know or they've been put on notice that they have been helping and creating this anger in this hatred in the country\nAnd that ah it's all because of the fact people are tired of being silenced that doesn't mean they're not going to stop their silencing in fact I had a friend of mine told me I just tonight that ah she was attempting to put something on my site and it was erased right after she put it up\nUh in fact there was another are actually there was another email I got to where apparently uh someone had put something up or on my Facebook page and I can't remember what it was I'll I'll have to find it over there it is right there\nSays here a few minutes ago after writing on messenger a Facebook sent me a warning of content because I had a comment my comment blind was a rebuild the u._s._a. and now the pages been polled so they're really they're they're algorithms and bought some really active tonight going after people who are\nWanting to make political statements about saving the United states because you know I think that these words that both President Trump and Hillary Clinton said have triggered a lot of attention it triggered my attention that's what I tried to attempt to talk about two nights ago\nBut now it's captured the attention of media some of the media the New York post a Google Facebook the number of groups now and so you notice that one type of meddling has left us and now a new type of meddling is here\nAnd and maybe a server was right when she said maybe some people are whispering in their ear to say this because it's it's really the needs to be said putting everybody\nInto a new form of government which you know could be it could be an interesting theory it is I think\nThe other\nOne or wait a minute we'll put out there on the phones yeah mhm\nI don't think so I mean it's true yeah people\nWell the tone you hear on the radio triggers people it's a pulsing tone it's meant to trigger impulses that's why uh I don't know if you know this but you are not allowed in any circumstances to play that tone other ... of the other than for emergency broadcast the reason why I Know this is because\nWe used to use it in a ground zero intro long time ago and we were threatened with a fine if we continue to use that so there's something magical about the E S tones that you are you here when they weren't even said something very special about\nFirst player [noise] I have to lay down their off the air and get law\nNo this is ... this is something we're not doing but it is it's dog whistling their dog whistling their people to kick them when they're low their dog with me there are people to be an simple until everything\nYou know go down the way they want to do and then what happens is immediately both ... and the guys Google Groups groups that we'd better we're going to be I think maybe we didn't want to be held responsible if there's a civil war\nBut here's the thing about that anyone who says Hillary Clinton does not know what she's doing I'm Sorry to that woman who called you yeah idiot Hillary Clinton knows one hundred percent ... exactly what she's doing and there was no one that can give me otherwise\n... okay remedy the recall there were some\nGood out of breath in Michigan Hi Brett you're on ground zero Clyde she meant [noise] [noise] ah you know I recall\nA presidential up a tree by a fellow Andrew creek mhm uh was interviewed by Webster ... remember what straw\nRemember going to ... before he died he was building brings worst nightmare\nWas interviewed by western ... remember ...\nBefore he died he yeah he was building brings worst nightmare\nYeah yeah and then and so it drew Craig presidential up the tree\nAnd others uh there's a YouTube presentation the walls in sheep's clothing right\nUm and then there's ... there's another one everyone needs to see a one hundred secret societies per who rules America\nAll these these agents actors as William Coley stayed at to a congressional committee one was ... was that Seventy four Seventy five\nMillion Kobe was probably the only truly honorable righteous CIA man we've ever had\nAt least in my lifetime that I can recall because he said look or all of the power gatekeeper physicians throughout the entire media complex is populated with CIA a controller approaches\nWhen we found out in the church hearing okay thank you yeah you uh [noise] and then let's see who was at a uh uh\nWas it what it was a twenty intellect over Seventy seven or it was a feature article in I think Rolling Stone or know Carl Bernstein talking about CIA and the media\n[laughter] okay so it really is a hill the beast Clinton east uh when she was secretary secretary of state\n... do you remember February of twenty fourteen you mentioned a quarter okay so in that very same month or a quarter was supposed to have indicted high level folks um HSBC\nHonoring ... remember that HSBC right for money laundering operations at all and there was that I ... go of a Baker's that were mysteriously dying committing suicide whatever remember that\nYes that was one I remember when that happened I was saying wow it's just like the dirty war because bankers people involved with a I guess wandering the money the who were killed\nA man and then we add you know how could we forget a good all our trip patriot Ollie north right right you know hey we got to stop those are ... or whatever it was the Sandinistas right uh\nAnd yet the biggest drug smuggling operators ... on the planet of from various\nSources including a man I Wish you could interview this guy Ralph McGee he okay\nWe interviewed someone better we interviewed the guy remember when I met a no matter what it was a trip Payne them we interviewed ... river to pay them a yet he remember ... yeah he was running for Iran Contra we interviewed him back when we were talking about panic and\nWhether or not he was running guns for the CIA and that's why guy in Las Vegas everything went wrong so okay you know we do about that stuff on a corruption so yes we know that that\nThey would ever something happens like this you're talking about you know agencies and what have you and and you will\nOut I think we'll find out in the very end Indian Game here is that it's the agencies that are manipulating everything\nNot just the agencies here in the United states agencies all over the world did there yeah the ... ball of intelligence ops miners are doing this every country that they see maybe they can actually bring down okay now and that's been that's been something that's been a conspiracy theory of mind for a long time and I've never really talked about it\nBut I don't consider myself a conspiracy theorist but you have my own theories that I've made and one conspiracy theory that I have about this whole Russian meddling thing that I never really got to because it really wasn't relevant 'cause as relevant as it could be later on he is that the deep state that we talk about is not\nA a deep state that has devoted to one party or another I mean does it most of the most conservatives would have you believe the deep say it's a bunch of liberal you know bastards in the day they want to bring down Trump no no no no the deep state\nHis ... agents from all over the world that want to bring down the United states of America is a bigger bigger pot that they want to topple has nothing to do with Trump the only reason why they're going after Trump because Trump is easy\nThe reason why Trump is easiest because Trump has a nationalist and they can immediately discredit him and some nationalist white supremacist Bozo and it'd be easy to do because he loves to play into it and he loves to get the media all worked up and stuff\nBut the trail matter is is the deep state that I talk about and that I personally think exists\nIs a deep state that is worldwide and the worldwide cabal of agencies and agents are the ones that are trying to bring Trump down not some it's not some left wing conspiracy as Kelly ... economy on Conway's said\nThe Christian I'm poor through it that Hillary Clinton and she rebounded with wealth civility blah blah blah blah blah you know it is a worldwide phenomenon and and there are plenty of allies you can call them that have agents both with the European Union Israel Saudi Arabia does go down the list\nThat are there to topple our government and that\nDeclined you're kissing ... genetically speaking there kissing cousins\nWell see that's the whole point it's like you're ... you're gonna watch Star Wars but family feud right to say about it you about it a star wars is based primarily on bloodlines fighting one another okay they're all related in some way for instance layers uh loops a sister\nA Lucas is a addict can Scott Walker's a son in Skywalker started ... ... it's all a family affair I wouldn't be surprised if like bank to nobody has a hand in this way or\nOr what's her name the the new one not ... but the the girl what's her name re ... it's it's it's just a family and says to his family a bloodlines fighting for planets\nIn this world it's fighting for one planet which is of course the spaceship that goes through space every day about three hundred sixty five days or go round our son and they want the steering wheel and take over the spaceship in power the way where they want to and there are plenty of secret societies in the background\nFit you know they're they're the guys that were the hood and you look at me and say oh they're like senators and their their ah presidents and princesses in rulers but in reality they go in their little feeling a little ... and they're all like to know sixteen year old man they do all\nThe studies prove who rules America is a ... it's it's a thesis ... sister says it's All right it's all these ... you know enter enter facing now it's all claim to keep us in theater fake little appear on real\n... dialectic is how they rule now it's always about hey there's a problem but what are we going to do about it we'll we'll give you the solution and where the guys who created the problem the first place we'll give you the ocean after we created the problem that a lot of power\nQuite I gotta tell ya yeah a couple of nights ago you're you're you're you're like citing scripture [noise]\nCarl Sagan in his cows most serious way back when I remember a Patrick Stewart Kayla at the very top of this episode he said the old coal heaven and earth to witness against the state that I said before the life of death the blessing of ... therefore shoes to light that\nI call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that I said before the light of death the blessing and a curse therefore choose to light that don't may is live now and I see I thought you know that sounds scriptural and I like Catholic what do I know but finally glad I got into a good book one died\nAnd voted doodle enemy thirty late teens we have a choice like your wife she was giving back she was\nTrying to help out in in what was reward you know that's great to the public trust\nWell that's a broken heart more than the assault that they believe it or not the revoking a public trust because she works [noise] in a position where she knows where the public
