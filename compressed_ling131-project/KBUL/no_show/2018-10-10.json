it up or the or indigenous peoples\nThe American Indian or will they held slaves oh wait what\nYeah they they they bought African Americans on the block\nBut here's the interesting thing um when America abolished slavery through the civil war\nThe the indigenous nations mhm they did not they went on\nAnother decade or so before they went you know we still have slavery ... just another decade yeah just another decade or so yeah so I don't make deal if I had to guess I Would say probably the Jews made them do it I'd probably that's probably that's probably like they they turn Taylor Swift\nWhen I'm I just wanted to say that we can be outraged about anything so what we need to do is to turn that negative and positive actions like when President Kennedy challenged America that you get to the moon we need to turn or negative thoughts and chew that positive thoughts\nBut I don't think it's ever been easier do you I mean we're just ignoring all of the positives that are happening to us I mean you want a moon shot OK you learn must go into Mars twenty twenty five\nI mean what's bigger than that it's just not a national project do we do we need to wrap it up in national money to be able to get excited about the future\nBecause that's what that was all about the moon shot was all about doing things because we can doing the hard things not the easy things I mean that that was just that was the whole goal and it did galvanized people thanks Scotland you know what people don't think\nAbout is Nineteen sixty eight is when we went to the moon\nSame years Woodstock mhm\nWow that's that's weird yeah\nSo you were either rolling around in the mud or you are reaching for the stars there were two Americas well where is the America that is reaching for the stars where is that America that says no not gonna stop me\nI I I ah I saw post today or that I that I had to answer a in my Twitter feed let me see if I can find it real quick um\nThat was actually at this is so wrong what is being taught to children into it to everybody um there was a a person Helen plot grows\nAnd apparently fat is my identity and I belong to it whether I'm aware of it or not and even if I'm not to this is what I've known for and I'm kidding myself to think people actually think of me primarily as a writer and speaker rather than a fat\nPerson magic living that way\nI ... I responded ah ah to that\nAs a growing member of the fact community\nI find the real problem is when I look at myself in the mirror and I define myself by my body I Am more than my body you can define me any way you wish it's your loss what you say after I Am\nIs much more important than what others say about you\nSo which are we going to be America because the choice is here and the choices so much more than Donald Trump or Kavanaugh heat is so much bigger than this who are we\nAre we the people that role in the mud and are constantly looking down and ... basing ourselves\nYou know absolutely Ben you know when when you you know intellectual expiration when when curiosity I'm going against the grain in any way when that when that becomes punishable\nUm view I think I think they really risk a driving good people I'm Down some some unsavory roads and there there's no good and that\nBrings a tradition out yeah absolutely absolutely\nThank you so much for reading the book and I'm gonna send you a a signed copy but thank you for reading and calling in I'm Daryl in Kentucky you're on the Glenn Beck program Hi Darryl\n[noise] hey how's it going I'm good how are you doing great I just wanted to say that I really love the book and I think that my my favorite part of it is that\nEven though we can't you can't surrender like you said several times we have to remain civil because maybe I'm not even thinking this but I think that eventually the blast will realize they have gone too far they will step back from the ledge and if for civil if for their standing strong\nIn our principles will be able to bring them back into the fold and\nI'm bringing the country back together but if we get in we do the same thing we're doing we just healthcare the country apart\nYou were on the left as well at one point\nI was a I was raised in southern West Virginia or my family were very deep blue Democrats and um we believe that Republicans are just people who took money away from the poor to give it to the rich and um\nYou know I I was pretty progressive guy in college and um I didn't really start looking at the other side until after twenty fourteen I I went to war um I was a soldier in the military a\nSpin off two thousand fold in Afghanistan a leading some of the best men and women I've ever met in my life I Would I came back to my country\nI couldn't figure out what happened my I was no longer welcome and less as a straight white male veteran so I had to figure out\nWhat happened and I started looking at people that I had mark including yourself in the past and are actually started reading our ... Williams and Mike orders manual which you noted in the bone and uh\nThat really you know maybe I'm buying into their theory a little bit too much but I've I've seen firsthand and uh I I Do believe that we have another five years of of this getting worse before it gets better but I still believe that Don his coming\nSoon why it's whether or not um [noise] we can uh pull enough people away from the cliff before running for years twenty twenty five where it starts to come back the other direction um and that's all right so how can we help people like you because I\nI I I think we need to start defining um Democrats when we say the Democrats I think we need to start saying the people in the leadership of the party um because I don't think you like you there are Democrats who are good love of the country and are finding themselves going wait a minute I don't have any place to go\nAnd uh and we have\nTo and and I'm not saying it's in the Republican Party [laughter] I'm just saying people need to start being more welcoming to people who are finding themselves on the outs what should we be aware of that you went through\n[noise] I think you should be aware that even though the policy and is is an area that we may never agree on that principle is something that we can agree on that things like\nIndividual freedom things like\nUm you know not a having a government that and control you from you know several hundred miles away that control every little aspect of your life\nOr something I talk to my wife and my niece about all the time is that you know before before President Obama even though I voted for the guy I kinda liked what he was selling um the president's name didn't get mentioned at the dinner table every single night at my home when I was growing up\nThe the power that we have given to Washington over the past ten Twenty years it's too much and I'm not really sure what the end state what the solution for that is but\nI think just talking about the things you talked about in the book the principles that make us all United are are you know the bill of rights the things that that make us all Americans are are what we can can unify behind\nSo the the section of because I I mean I've really struggled with what it is that brought us together and it's really or can bring us back together and it's really so simple when you finally get down to it it is the bill of rights don't you think\nI agree um I think that you will never find in any other country that I've been in I've been in several Africa Germany Afghanistan um Romania you will never find a country that that beach itself up over its past as much as America does we\nWe realize that we've done some horrible things like you said in your region and your monologue but we've also\nYou know I think it's something that didn't actually sue the says ... by recognizing are false by admitting to our faults you have to kind of in a way to America's moral superiority because we realize that we've made mistakes and we're trying to fix them\nDarryl thank you so much for your phone call appreciate it God Bless them he broke\nThe president's name didn't come up every day at the dinner table obviously that's getting even worse now with Trump I mean people are obsessed about talking about of all the time the story to enact feels about how they are the networks have recognized this and they're out they're doubling down or they've enjoyed high ratings engagement from Trump coverage and\nFor the networks at a relatively low cost now that our president has been set around these high returns it's unlikely news outlets will cut back meaning the barrage of fickle content being created an absorbed during the Trump presidency will likely outlive this administration\nThey want it they want to make I mean like Trump it's a celebrity well America and he's a he's a polarizing guy and people love and hate him but they want to change they want this to be the norm they want you to be obsessed with this all the time at the expense of the rest of your life\nIt is and it's a ... regime it is the norm\nYou have to know what there are fewer or the leader is saying and doing and wants you to do but it is the norm ... anything that normalize as as any intention of saying you know what that's good for America is mistaken it's wrong\nAnd this is you know this is a it's driven I think at this point by clicks and viewers and you know it's it's one of those things that just because it's going to continue it can be hard to reverse that addiction is well\nThey you know when when they can get you know the Rachel Maddow audience or is it ... outrage maybe more than any other right their ratings have gone through the roof because of it and you think MSNBC is return you know he's going to reverse that path now no they're not going to say oh well you know what maybe we went to I don't know I mean I'd like to be optimistic about it but I don't see it happening All right\nI'm going to take a quick break back to your phone calls a day to day Seventy Seventy easy cave and in our number three we're going to show you an experiment we did\nUm and take you behind the
