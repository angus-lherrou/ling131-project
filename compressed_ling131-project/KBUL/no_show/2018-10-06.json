Gerald uh I I was curious you are in the ... kind of been an analogy is way way I'm currently in photography will show like a an expansion of the or in a shrinking though the or depending upon your thoughts whether they're positive negative\nOr neutral it kind of goes between as you've been any kind of\nSome sort of a testing the ... the weather like especially when it's maybe a got her hand on the ... these are obviously trends Sievers that there is some kind of a an energy\nTransfer that comes into this ... go and you ... where the school's acting as a receiver or is this all this just\nWatch contained within the school itself\nUm\nAm I trying to that yeah\nUm well for me it's like a computer and if you put them instead of typing the keys or any um even having to open it up if\nYou put your hand on the scale it immediately stats transmitting I'm into your mind but it doesn't it it took even I've come to realize computer language because\nIt doesn't speak or announce as the way I Do and so it sometimes there is a can\nSpeak on now as the way I Do and so it sometimes there is a confusion of wood usage\n... and but no it it\nIf you could imagine a computer that was programmed aliens ago by a greater intelligence than we have and by the way it says I think ... the Atlantic and most is with out this analogy without that it now that would disappear knowledge not what they think\nAnd and also Atlantis was not a it always says you are looking for a piece of geography when Atlantis was a state of mind which meant that there were many Atlanta and ... and so we have\nAll kinds of extraterrestrial things are in various different countries I think\nWell and and then of course is a you know the very thing the very reason why I wanted to revisit the crystal skulls because of technological signatures these they\nExist or from being out there who said ... they were going to find a way to find them using ... technology with the crystal skull and of course new technologies and that's what we're going to do next Carole thank you so much for being on the program and I didn't really\n... what was that was a would you keep growing so\nShe wants to join us brings to shore okay so Carol I I Want to introduce you to the black cube coming up so stay with us okay", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "06"}
