GQ columnist or talking about Trump radicalizing what's the most\nAnd this president one of the things that have really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic rattle radicalization and this president has radicalized so many more people than I ever did I mean the\nWay he didn't talk the way the way he is that just it it's really hot the way that they asked allows the weightless and yes and I know the whole\nTheater right he said I Know I'm not supposed to say it but I'm a national asked quitting his task kind of says fine okay I condemn ness but then you know\nAnd you know I think that we feed out the pushback on that you're about to do as much of her to say the President's Day says radicalized more people than ISIS is irresponsible\nStop do you notice the animals but was not just saying that to hit to to her the guest was saying it to the host yeah Browne you not to push back on that is irresponsible he's not talking about are being ... yeah he's talking about CNN being irresponsible and one thing to notice in\nThat clip she ... she says uh one of the things that the president ran it was a fighting Islamic extremism and now we know that she is radicalized more people die says there's a set applied to that so not only is it a catchy little thing that might get her in the news it's also there's a set up blind to it\nAh to me obviously a plant wind\nObviously she mentioned on television and said just that she set it up out of ... didn't make any sense in in the context of the conversation she wanted to get to that line right and she's totally under control mhm she's dispassionate about it you know he's just having a conversation yes so here's her apology when she realized just how bad that was a few minutes later\nI think I've spoken to hit at the moment that has been a very emotional and personally she has for me I think I exaggerate and I apologize for that\nBut what the point I was trying have ... to make is that it's not a coincidence that according to the ... the number of anti Semitic attacks has jumped by nearly sixty percent and the first year that Donald Trump was in office and it's no coincidence because\nEven though the main danger is homegrown right wing extremists many studies have pointed out this administration has methodically shifted resources away from monitoring those people away from the control those people will keep them from committing violence\nOkay All right that's not on it outside of it or not an apology further inflame yeah what you were saying and there's no pushback from CNN no they don't care I don't really great for them they like it yeah because like and leave it they do they believe it\nIt's it it they are ...
