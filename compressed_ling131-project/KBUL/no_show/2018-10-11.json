grand\n[noise]\nI'm quite used to ground zero Ralph's in Oregon Hi Rob them drums zero [noise]\nI think you guys nailed it [noise] when I last [noise] yeah I think that's what's going on down there [noise] uh I was\nGoing to talk about the uh inter galactic cloud that we're going through right now but I think that's a that's another topic that you should just cover some other time that's why the sun was looking kind of where these days and some of the weather and stuff but\nI just had two interesting ideas of these sounds on the earth\nOne you know with the earth is moving you know we're we're moving pretty fast right through the through the solar system right I mean there were spinning we're moving what if there were some times it was almost like a whistle or a home\nGoing on there was picked up almost like a a flute or something and like I flew to probably\nThe wrong and what made you want yeah like we're making some noise when the world around her wobbling around you know that I think that's been taken into consideration that we would be hearing something that would be like the music of the earth is like you know you've heard when I played Saturn's right out and make the music in it now has talked been selling its every once in a while\nBut uh yeah it could be that I I thought about that when you're thinking about the horns but it but he's hired different do you think all these these homes are a little different than those horns\nWell let me tie and the other thought I had worked together okay you know there's this idea of the electronic universe that fit electrical forces maybe have more of an influence\nYou know the things that control how how things interact with each other and so you had you know you think of that sound that sounds like also like almost like a a like a an electric a discharge or a a um you know something is being energized electronically right\nAnd that could if we had an electronic universe that could also explain some of those sounds where you have maybe there's a if something part of the earth gets charged up\nAnd then it has to discharge that energy is somehow ... um I I look at that is another possibility of course you'd have to accept a whole new way to look at the way things interact with each other\nRight and then one has already there's always the ionosphere heaters too that tend to use you have hard when you have other um you you have the right and they maybe\nThey understand that there is an electronic universe and that's why those things work or scratching our heads thinking how could they just beam up something you know when you only have pressure and gravity but if it is an electronic universe and they're not letting us know maybe that's why all that stuff works\nYeah now maybe I mean that's the thing that you know you have to kind of think outside the box to wonder why we have all this stuff going on and I think that when a immediately when they said\nUh we we got to get a better way to identify what we're doing rather than just looking after a you know a overhearing phone\nCalls between extraterrestrials what they're doing they're looking for technical signatures left behind by the machinery and the technology and and so when we have these sounds that aren't necessarily that of\nCommunicating biological entities we do have sounds of what may be their synthetic life forms\nWe may have sounds that may be their machines and the robots and their spaceships and most of the time when these things happen what we're seeing as we're seeing probes we're not really seeing aliens we're seeing probes we're seeing robots we're seeing a these types of things that you know observing earth from a distance\nI think we have what's happening is the future and the past are kind of coming together or rediscovering\nThat there was probably much more intelligent a civilization here at one point and then there are yes there are other [laughter] maybe future beings maybe artificial intelligence was able to uh time travel [noise]\nAnd ah then we're in trouble aren't we\nWell yeah I mean it's going back to the idea that what if this is just one big encyclopedia we have some sympathetic aliens just watching us every once in a while they ripping page out and that's where history kind of like ... pick up and start over\nAgain and again another uh another chapter in another verse you know\nWhat do we get our head spinning too fast here we're gonna lose or any sort of court\nCharged with Emily yeah around some great thoughts I appreciate your calling thank you so much no problem at an event\nTo really six Seventy three thirty seven hundred and strip believe six seven three thirty seven hundred hey ah October the thirty first Halloween and then from there we have

[noise]\nA you know around the you know we have bases around here and stuff like that and um you know here things all the time but [noise] um\nYou know as far as the atmosphere in the country there were were the capitals Canfield out here I used to be out here in the sky and all the time and they're you know things like you know you can kill a lot of waves that way you know as far as that goes\nWell I think that you know what we're seeing here is we're seeing a lot of things from oh elements in all of actions and we're\nAnd you know we have these discoveries that are going on and they can't put their finger on what these discoveries are but they do say that there are strange they say they have to reevaluate how they analyze and what they think of the phenomena that they're they're studying and so that in mind we we're waiting for some sort of the answer but we're not getting the answers were looking for all\nI don't ... I mean who's ... who's getting these are just and he's trying to say they're trying to discover this I mean who is\nThey already have play they they discovered things they've discovered things\nFit of force them into changing the way they view the universe changing the way they view\nStories about alien abductions and aliens arriving neatly all these things are now being considered because ah they're thinking that we're looking at civilizations that may have advanced synthetic AI or looking civilizations\nMaybe sending robots are way rather than a aliens are way or we have civilizations that are certainly\nA you know sending us messages through a more um\nI guess you could say a microbial means we're we're getting microbes that that don't respond like they're from earth we'd get neutrinos that ah don't respond like the the standard model here on earth these are things that are before science would never even considered but now it's it's something to think about\nOh it's I I ... I mean as far as that goes it's it's it's there's\nI mean right now we're in it in a transition is a there is no that isn't it surprises me at this point right there so there's so much that's being kept on this for many many years I mean I'm even what's what's that [noise] you know even I don't think many people realize but\nUm ah Winchester did pass away and they are the good luck it takes some of their race is files unless of course mhm mhm uh\nWho was Trump's son go to those files you know that right\nWell John John John Trump you know I thought that was and he said there was nothing there that was that interests us close to what an added a lot of things\nI think there was a lot of things in there I think that has a lot of things about it like plus older groups groups that are uh the go underground that are secretly creating technologies that we don't know about maybe have an underground a breakaway civilizations this type of thing so yeah I mean\nYou know we're going all over with this but certainly or something to think about definitely something to think about let's go to Mike in Texas let's go to Mike Mike Hi you're on ground zero\nTime first time wanted to touch base on a little bigger picture that local [noise] oh what a shame in one poll transmitting another poll therefore protest to relay stations other planets another entities for\nThat would make sense because the sun always sends out a signal to the euro the earth has to respond feared maybe sending signals to under ... other planets the planet I mean this would be like you know when they say in the Bible that a certain God's\nWould roar certain planets would war they were roaring maybe it's because they were closer and the ... can be heard with the auto ear that they can hear the wars in the thunders communication between the planets planets communicate that's why we have such a\nYou know I think we're in its orbit that's why we have such a you know uniform uh cosmos is because of the fact that we we have to\nHave these planets in line so that we use them for communications and others and other things\nAnd so that's the thing that we could be one big transmitter Sears give me one big transmitter and this could be the answer is that we had been transmitting out extraterrestrial intelligence for a long time and then extraterrestrial intelligence has been sending stuff back to us as well\nWeren't listening but we're not hearing\nYeah it was because we don't know what we're hearing we don't know what we should be hearing for I mean I played the signals uh the guy that that it's been picked up on we just hear that his homes we don't hear them as a perhaps a semi it'd be intelligent\nYou know a guy that that has been picked up on we just hear the homes we don't hear them as a perhaps or something it'd be intelligent we don't know that there's some hitting hitting messaging they're on the on the a particle ever the atomic level that's up for the scientists to decide I Believe\nWhy don't we put things on both poles and listen and\nI'm sure they do they have these uh these projects like ice cube and others that are\nThey're trying to a ... a controller released trying to uh gather together neutrinos to see what kind they are when they are or what the standard model they're going to be on a Saturday my own right now they're seeing everything going beyond\nThe standard model and that's something that a either a is a alien or be we're doing this to ourselves with CERN or I mean I can just go down the list of all the reasons why the plan is doing what it's doing it's not good for one thing\nThat could harm us it where it's not harm because you have do we know of but it could be the reason why we're seeing all this abrupt climate situation we're seeing all this abrupt or earth a seismic stuff going on I mean\nThere's a lot of things that could explain this end of course we have to also say that they're trailing other planets in the solar system they do have as was said earlier\nOr an electrical universe effect on everything we're just not smart enough yet\nOr we may not be but we are getting their er and and we are reevaluating how we go about the uh the investigations which I think is interesting\nThat's all I got I keep listening\nThings you might recall I really appreciate those going out to Jerry in Tennessee Hi Joe you're on ground zero\nThey collide hey what's up how you doing good finally get to talk to you man hallelujah well that's good to hear from you\n[laughter] hey I wanted to just ask you what about the have you heard of the five hundred and twenty eight hurts frequency when you read tune for for forty four hundred and forty four hurts\nYou're talking about Schumann residence or anything else excuse me are you talking about Schumann residents are you talking about something else\nYeah is it there might be a connection there with with what ... what you were talking about\nAh well anything there's I'm sure that what they're picking up is ah being picked up and ah\nIt's being hurt beyond her I felt beyond the Schumann residents and I heard that you know it fluctuates from time to time and no one can tell you why so or the background noise this is beyond the background noise and it's got to go beyond the background noise in the background pulses otherwise they wouldn't be able to figure this out\nAnd being able to pick up on the particles too I think it's a major issue if they're able to pick up on this a political decay the nuclear decay and they're saying this is not something that's the standard model it means something else is making it\n... ... ...\n... ... command\nAvatar he's a allege us apparently in a from the ladies he's had blond hair ... of blue eyes big blue eyes right
