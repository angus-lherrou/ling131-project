a bunker well these events are sure to the uh the the theory of the old real life is stranger than fiction\nI was taking perhaps the timing of this asteroid are easy to do is right in line with some of that story line if you recall\nBut there are a lot of things that you know people people tend to remember certain science fiction stories and stuff like this goes down and the one I remember was Harry housings ... versus a flying saucer everything didn't work\nAnd then there were starting to get the signals and finally the aliens arrived and they just wreak havoc on everything you're saying you know you know we want to speak to your leadership were a look to your son for warning there'll be a big sun burst and not let you know that something's about to go down and have you I don't know

show up and you'll be ready just surrendered to us it was just amazing how they they they pulled it off in of course when you lose the war of the world's\nIt it's about a asteroids coming from the from a Mars uh hitting the planet tonight it's a shutting down due to be some nights it something hit the moon and then of course the budgets for protecting our\nOur planet go up Ninety million dollars a year we got rocket that can't work we've got ... telescopes and X ray telescopes that aren't working something is going on it's bizarre\nIt's indeed a strange time to be alive and I can't

overtime always watched and those stores seemed to know the night looked like Mars or you are one next to it but as I was watching it looked like something left\nTell you what I say that I felt like it confirmed or I saw the light I had no idea what it could have been what I saw that movie and I just\nSo you saw something moving away from the moon was heading towards Mars I mean there's a red dot in the sky and that is that you see the red dot in the sky right when you look to the southern sky\nRight yes directly across from it I was ... about two o'clock from the moon when you say Yes sir yeah okay\nSo the the is about two o'clock for the moon you see the you you see it there and then you said you saw something pull away from the moon\nIt looked like something just looked like a store or something just took off from the loan I I never said I don't know how to explain 'cause I'd never seen that but like it I just I felt like they showed a lack of cargo what I've seen it just it just it moved away from the movie asked directly yes because it just looked like a star I thought it was another\nFlorida sky or something that does but it it's a little did I Know there's a ... a meteor shower an area of the night but it wasn't it wasn't a quick made it like\nIt's supposed to be a meteor shower tonight I heard there was supposed to be one but last night there wasn't supposed to be one day I I don't know maybe ... yeah I don't I usually Janine and I go to these meteor showers we go out to rooster rocket we watch them if we have time so I was supposed\nTo be on here and says that it's a night but it wasn't like that it was just a slow steady stream it just it looked like I don't know how to describe it like a rocket just took off from that loan and it was it was the oddest thing I've ever seen in the sky\nWow well at least we got you as a witness and you saw something in the sky some weird UFO\nYes sir thank you John for the call I really appreciate it thank you like\nI Want to remind you that uh if you want to listen to this program after\nIf you want to go back to the program after we're on SoundCloud non ... dot coms I was ground zero media listen to ground zero dot com available to people especially when we go into the later hours run with the ground zero dot com\nAnd ah\nYeah it it just to keep our eyes on what's going on your keep your eyes to this guy's too because I think a lot of people are curious as to what's going on I mean I don't know I it just like all the coincidence I mean think about it I mean a lot of people are probably thinking that this is all not nonsense but you wouldn't read what's going on mainstream media is not going to talk about this\nCertainly aren't going to talk about it and we got to get used to the idea that they're not going to talk about it and just because it's being talked about on the show like mine or other shows it's not conspiracy\nTheory this is happening okay tell me why\nWe have two major telescope shutdown\nTell me why it's so use rocket couldn't go to the I. S. S. tell me why the rovers shut down as well all three of these uh uh ways we can see the space of shut down\nYou to shut down last night because someone said they were pushing a video by early about something hitting the moon last night\nAnd so they wanted to take it down and they had to shut it down to\nGet off the Internet before anybody saw unless you've done a good job because I don't see it I didn't see the man the uniform they are talking about but there is some footage right now that I put on my Facebook page Facebook dot com slash ground zero\nSo that video is bake the only one that I can tell but he is legit the one with the with the um [noise] uh the possible a ... a night vision\nTracking something in the sky ah and that's that's what I think is the one that were they were trying to push but I could be wrong maybe ... maybe the video will surface\nOf the man in the military uniforms saying that somebody's going to hit the moon but until then we have not found it\nWell I ... ... ... ... certainly don't want us to say I want to ask for all I don't know I feel that they're still for Saturday So stay safe like comic\nYou Margie thank you for calling this program is go to Jason in Ohio Hi Jason you're on ground zero\nIt even Clyde hey I've got a theory about says remember about three years ago up in Antarctica they had discovered something but they never really told us what it was right at the religious a leader from Russia there are rumors that President Obama sat up there\nI think maybe what happened up there as they discovered a shift for a city or something and they trip like uh oh like a distress signal mhm and then you know the sunspot Arizona facility\nSolve the ships coming in and around the sun and they shut that down and that maybe last night the ships or you know around the mood or whatever and uh they went ahead and shut all that down and shut down on YouTube and everything you know maybe it's just that long for a signal to get all the way out the space\nAds for whoever contracted to come all the way back in because you know you said that little uh the short radio first mhm and uh\nThey actually back by the way I'm Glad you brought that up Nineteen more rooted tactic last night for a you know the observatory in Australia Nineteen more hobbies fast radio burst were actually sent and somebody sent me a story that Russia has said that\nSeen more of these fast radio ... were actually are sent and someone had sent me a story that Russia has said that uh they are now calling them the flashes of solar cells themselves they're not calling them or they're not calling past radio versus what Russia's officially said they believe\nThat they are flashes from solar cells of extraterrestrial ships that's what Russia's file\nAnd that may be so maybe they're trying to contact they are sick and all that was set off and they're not getting the response so you know they're they're wondering who sent the signal and what happened and why it's been so long\nI mean it's just a theory like any other theory but ... I mean it is kind of strange that everything that's going on and everything they're trying to hide from us and uh and I'll I just thought I'd bring that up and mentioned that since you're all that's\nAll I appreciate that yeah it's a very strange night in any theory or I mean you know everything is all about uh right now hypothesis and speculation everything's hypothetical until we prove\nSimilar things about what we do know is is that two of those uh telescopes were shut down ... you're not going to be I assess the rover on Mars to shut down a we know that they shut down the sunspot observatory on September ... six no one told us why it was shut down we had an inkling as to why we shut down\nWe now have a budget of sixty million going to protect the planet from incoming asteroid that shut up to a hundred and fifty million dollars\nA that was overnight they got funded overnight for that and it's almost like why do we have to increase the money but it's not really that big of a threat well now I think they're thinking it's a threat because it's something that happened last night and the fact that you to shut down without notice and people are saying it's because some guy had a viral video saying something's going to hit the moon and they didn't want anybody see it\nYeah it's absolutely too much to be a coincidence and others definitely something going on we'll probably never know exactly what\nYeah and another thing to have you been noticed I don't know if you're on the Internet that often but you've been noticing these UFOs that have been seen in the sky they're not UFOs the rockets and it'd been like these errant rockets flying all over China and California and all these places\nYeah yeah that's kind of weird because that's a little out of the norm for you know your regular UFO side in or whatever\nYeah these rocket launches yeah there were these rockets going to and what are they trying to hit out of the sky I mean these are missiles that bring out or to take out UFOs\nOr whatever I mean there's been a lot of that going on to I've been posted on those pictures have been UFOs\nWilderness UFO it's not a UFO you can tell that these are rocket ships these rockets\nOr missiles being fired ah the I I there was one over a South Korea I saw some lights that were up they said that could have been rockets one over China and won over California and I think the one over California with another rocket fired by a either basis or mosque so but other than that we don't know what they are\nNow but there is an awful lot of activity going on and you know for them not to even mention anything and I'm sure where that comes out you know your job will have a a some kind of excuse to what we needed to update in the middle of the night or anything like that and I I had all all the crazy bogus\nWas there and certainly jeopardize our work last night we didn't know it was going with just has a simple because those are the simple shut down but then we started hearing about you know a guy who's there and I had another I had a guy like you said send me a a sent me an email did you get this one of the guy who's\nThe military guys if something's going to hit the moon no that didn't happen I didn't see it I didn't even know was there and then comes the story\nThen comes the shutdown and going on that's what he was talking about All right Jason I appreciate the call All right thank you very well but it's going to Mike in Pennsylvania Hi Mike you're on ground zero\nGood you got a little different take on it\nHi Mike you're on ground zero good\nYou got a little different take on it you can do all the stuff he said tonight about what's going on that is they're grown hasty strange square there was\nA kid it possibly be the age of the planet X just moving into you know or they\nWell as a matter of fact did you hear what they were reporting in the news about three or four weeks ago we did show and it was called the goblin remember the goblins story [noise] uh no I didn't\n... case well they've discovered a planet and uh they call it the goblins and of course before that they discovered Vulcan\nSo ah what it is is that it's a dwarf planet or about two weeks ago maybe because they were hunting for planet X. by the way and ah they found is a ... along gated orbit this uh this dwarf planet sands along gated orbit they're calling it the goblet okay\nUm and uh they they said that uh uh they they don't know they're they want to call a planet X or not but it's not new bureau okay\nBut there are saying they were looking for planet X and they found this planet are called twenty Fifteen T.
