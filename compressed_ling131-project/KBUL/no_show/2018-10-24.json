the content of this advertising this is\nGlen back from\nMy point\nI Want to make sure everybody understands I'm air quoting when I say the my grand caravan\nThat started off in Honduras with about two thousand people has now doubled to five thousand and as of this morning there are now just over seven thousand people wake making their way north to the U.S border line of people when they're not writing in the back of several mysteriously paid for trucks\nStretches out for over a mile\nNow I err quoted migrant and the caravan for a reason\nIt's not a caravan when's the last time you saw more than seven thousand people marching towards another country's border and carrying their own flag\nIn\nOr most of us would say never unless you served in the military and you were invading\nIt's not a caravan there was no other way to describe this then invasion\nAs I've said before this is a Honduran political stunt it was organized by a leftist Marxist group has ties to the former Marxist president who was exiled after a coup in two thousand nine\nThese people never got over it and they've been doing political stunts ever since to make the current right wing government look bad\nThe organizers of this invasion have ties to the Castros in Cuba and ... in Venezuela this done is designed for media fallout and it is time to very specifically for maximum exposure\nEarly voting for the midterms has already begun by the time they reach the U.S border\nOn cable news the election polls and the status at the border\nSo what do we do it\nIf the caravan is stopped in Mexico this could help the GOP come November six and what's the greater example of why we need stricter border policies or even a wall after seeing this play out\nMexican immigration officers were completely overwhelmed when the caravan first crossed into Mexico they could only process about six hundred people before the remaining five thousand just pushed through\nSome on land some just waded across the water\nIf these invasion caravans are new nor am what choice do you have other than to build a wall\nBut let's say the caravan does reach our border every single media camera will be pointed not at the migrants\nBut at the national guard and the U.S border patrol dressed in riot gear\nVideo will be rolling his tear gas clusters or fired at the waves of people attempting to cross pictures will be snapped or the people showing their rubber bullet bruises it will be mass chaos it will be exactly what we said a year ago will happen\nI'm actually renting them and we would if it was going to Canada and they were protesting Canada I think that would be a lot of people just don't cause any Trump just let him go to Canada I'm sure a lot of people in Mexico are saying that just running just what it was not our problem they just want to go to America just not a problem\nWell it is your problem and if Mexican candidate would say to us you stop this or we're not going to trade with you we zero eight though like they give us any aid\nZero zero cheese whatever it is we're not\nGiving you any of that as a good neighbor we would stop it\nWe need to be very clear no aid for Mexico none I Know

fact I have video of it today they're doing it again they're not shooting from behind so you don't see the crowd\nAnd Obama is out and he's in you know these these rooms that are like four hundred people maybe ... maybe tops two thousand\nAnd they're shooting it so it looks like a big crowd but it's not they did that in the midterms 'cause he's crowds went away here we are at the midterms\nDon't think that's\nCounting [noise] online [noise]\n\n[laughter]\nDon't think I had a campaign promise to Tom tom\nAround them and how often do you remember the\nFor helping make America

or running against Ted Cruz I Would be a little concerned um because it was an overwhelming response from Texas where Texans\nI thought were a little um [noise]\nI don't know calm about this election and it didn't really realize how much money Soros and others have poured in to make this a blue wave here in Texas more than any other Senate candidate\nOr for any quarter and history thirty million dollars for Beto just for him that's right although I think\nThat's not including the ... money that is going into the state I mean outside a pack of money and tons of that um so uh we're going to talk to the uh Governor Greg Abbott we're going to talk to them a little bit about the care of and and also about what's happening\nHere in our state he's also running for reelection but his he's so far ahead of any contender he is\nIn Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that has funded these grand games to get out the vote and so he is trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for candidates like that but let's go back to the first part of your questions and listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really\nBlew cities and blue counties you have a Dallas year after year and you have San Antonio you have all that and you have El Paso\nAnd so you have these massive blue regions across the state of Texas that makes it\nSo much harder for people who are conservative people\nAre who are Republican to be able to cobble together the votes that are needed to make sure that we keep Texas the passion of freedom that back to the liberty\nOr in the past she lived conservatism and so uh every vote counts and we really need to get people excited enthusiastic about this the same way they were ah it last night where we were in Houston, Texas I'm I'm Sorry what people are fired up and they are ready but we need people to go about\nTell me a little bit about the caravan is there\nIs do we have any idea other than the you know political leanings of this group ah when it was back in Honduras do we have any idea just the logistics who is behind this and what we're prepared to do\nSir I've had the opportunity to speak with both the secretary of homeland security as well as the president about this and I I can tell you what I can tell you publicly and and that is or if you think these are people who are leaving Honduras or about a mile or wherever that coming from a just trying to\nEscape violence and income seek asylum or that is incorrect\nOr this is very well organized it's funded has a there are there are others who are behind it and very importantly a end this caravan are not just people from Honduras Guatemala a we know that some of the leaders of it are are involved in their midst Thirteen we don't we know that some of the people in it are from\nCountries across the entire glow a there are what we use in the in the lingo ... which are a special interest ATMs or who pose a a very real dangerous threat or to the security of the United states of America who are in bed at in these caravans\nRight under the Univision just reported this morning that there were people with terrorists ties ah from Malaysia involved in ... in this\n... and and I've heard the same thing with with regard to a terrorist coming from countries other than Malaysia and I'm thinking about this if these people really were trying to escape by horrific life on whatever country they're coming from\nWhy is it that they are marching with the flag of the country that they're coming from ... you know that\nThey are not coming to the United states of America to make the United states of America a better place\n... mhm you know they\nThey they are not coming to the United states of America to make the United states of America a better place they're not coming to the United states to ... a ... a solemn from the dangerous they have in fact there were multiple reports on TV last night and he channeled would have shown that\nOf the interviews with these people in the Caribbean and they were talking about what was their strategy or when they get us and they said it's very simple and those are numbers are overwhelm the United states' ability or to uh go through the salad process for all these people so they they have been taught him know already\nThat their strategy is to basically rushed the game so much that the U.S loses ... let me tell you something that we lose control of our border they released lose control of our sovereignty\nWe're no longer a sovereign nation and we must step up and use every tool that we can to make sure that we put an end to this care and because I understand this clean also when that has this maybe two or three or five thousand people but they make it in right behind him\nIn the air out of twenty thousand people behind that will be a caravan of fifty thousand people and the United states of America as we know it will be forever altered we don't do something to stop this\nYou know the press is going to treat us like the Israelis and the caravan like the Palestinians um is the president leaning on the president of Mexico and\nThreatening to cut off all I mean if I mean I think this is the time to really lean hard and say this is not our problem turn them around or we'll cut off all aid with with Mexico is there a chance of this\nOr that the president has been outspoken about cutting off aid to Honduras and brought them out right now the the United States is working collaboratively in in in this might be hard to believe so I Want to emphasize that\nAh the u._s. is working collaboratively with Mexico Mexico has made a decision that they have not made in the past Mexico is working with the United nations or to try to work on a temporary settlement of these care band members in\nMexico film and so ... ... is is actually\nPlaying a ... a very beneficial role in this whole process with us right now and we applaud Mexico for what they're doing or at least as of this moment in time\nOr they headed towards taxes no no invasion plans of the United states with the former Soviet Union ever included taxes because they knew Texans would not take kindly to the invasion force are they headed towards a Lexus or California\nI Will tell you what are what was reported publicly last night and I will not disputed and and that is a early on before yesterday on there was great concern that they were headed for Texas and it was reported last night that they are headed toward California\nNow that makes sense because as you know California is a ... state yeah and and they ... they would welcome this caravan and Tim or caravans like it\nAnd and and these care band members and the leaders of this caravan\nOf they understand one thing and that is a if they try to breach the gates in Texas or we're not going to tolerate it and we're going to be very uh you know protective of our sovereignty here and so uh I Can't tell you for certain to right now where they're going ah I can tell you what was said and what makes sense and that is they may be headed to California\nLast question that one is the way the\nSame as you know what was there in the United states there in the United states' rights and once they're here they they can migrate anywhere\nRight um the your campaign is going really well you're a great governor and um and I don't think your election is a is a going to be\nIn your campaign is going really well you're a great governor and um and I don't think your election is a is a going to be um a in jeopardy at all\nHow is how is a Ted Cruz how how is Ken Paxton how is Dan Patrick\nWell listen all these all these races are closer than what people will\nRealize and it is because uh we we need to understand that this the liberals or a socialist whatever you want to call these days uh they've got what I was their forces coming out to vote early and so\nUh is too hard to tell right now and because they are so close uh I Am going uh across the entire state of Texas campaigning every single day in multiple cities to help\nA Republicans up and down the ballot to make sure that we are going to have policies that are antagonistic to to open borders to make sure we have policies that cut your taxes that cut your regulations that improve our schools and so is very important that people turn out\nOr they vote or your listeners have a lot at stake in their own personal lives of baseball is going to happen in this election and everybody's going to matter because the voter turnout is it sky rocket levels right now\nAnd if you're listening and you had a voter you need to go vote because your future is at stake for today for example when we hang up I'm headed to\nA belt and decode campaign for some people they aren't going to be a in Dallas County later on today I'm going to be in ... county later on uh in in the week and then parents coming up we're going to spend a lot of climate north Texas and in South Texas east Texas in West Texas or to make sure that we win these elections\nFrom the top of the ballots at the bottom of the ballot\nGreg always go the good stuff do you think you'd go to appreciate it God Bless you God Bless you have to stay safe [noise]\nGovernor Greg Abbott of Texas by the way from Texas a matters or to you\nTexas goes blue\nYou then have New York\nYou don't win an election again [noise]\nTaken the electoral college uh every
