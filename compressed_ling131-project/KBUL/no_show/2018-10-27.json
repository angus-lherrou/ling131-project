these have gone off none are so love these were just lucky we are we are on this this\nThis Trump supporter this conservative boy oh boy he's a moron luckily he's just a bad luckily bomb a building I mean and we can we check with the New York times is saying about this I can now there's of course we all know we all know let's rush to judgment\nKavanaugh was of course a gang rapists and these bombs are clearly Donald Trump's fault okay here's the New York times\nOr none of their devices harmed anyone and it was not immediately clear whether any of them\nCould have wait\nSo these are ... are very dangerous yeah I mean in fact uh shows the level of sophistication and I that's what I heard from CNN these pipe\nBombs show a level of sophistication ... what's the New York times say now I'm One law enforcement officials said investigators we're examining the possibility that they were hoax devices instructed to look like bomb would not have exploded wow now you may uh you may have read the story from the New York times\nIs that why they never gave us really any details on\n... ... well you probably didn't get to a paragraph thirty four\nUh that ... you know you know how you know how like Jewish people read from a right to left we read left to right\nMm okay mhm I with the New York times it's like reading a foreign language I like to read the bottom up a lot of good stuff towards the ... yeah when you go to the bottom you start with the bottom it is funny because usually the headline doesn't matter I mean\nAh some bomb technicians who studied photos of the device that circulated on social media suggested the bomb sent to CNN had the hallmarks of fake\nExplosives kind more typically depicted on television and movies rather than devices capable of detonating almost like a Wylie coyote kind of almost a digital clock was taped to the middle of the pain of feature that experts say is typically shown on fictional\nBombs in an attempt to ratchet up dramatic tension ah but that's the theory in real life\nI'm Sorry in fact in fact they go on the news\nBomb makers generally avoid attaching visible clock into their devices really cheap\nFrom tipping off they're targeting no about when the bombs are set to explain it was just a like a nice little clock they were sending to these people for their death [laughter] that's what I thought they look at that and you're like that's not a bomb here here's a bonus if you survive\nAll it is that it got an handler and you know what one hundred percent survive abilities so far on these bombs\nOne hundred percent survive ability\nWe're is weird now look it could be a I think here's a plausible scenario that someone on the right did this okay someone on the right who really does not like all these figures decided that they wanted to send a message to all these figures but aren't actually or murder they want to scare the hell out of them but they didn't actually wanna kill\nThey wanted to let it a point you want to know what you could be doing to this country let let me show yet and they're crazy they were wrong only horrible despicable and everyone they weren't murderers and so they built this to look like my bomb\nIf you look on I mean you get the example of this on social media all the time I mean if we counted all of the death threats and horrible things that you get on social media as real all the time\nYou'd have to have a staff of salads and checking them all out ... instead you know most of the time people say crap on social media that goes way too far and that they're actually intend to do they don't intend on a you know you start to happen to for example Dana lash right like has to take all those things seriously when she was on TV\nUh she got all sorts of threats on her family and they did take them seriously but like\nAs far as I Know at least no one actually acted on those things thank God right so you have these serious threats that come into public figures often and ... and sometimes they don't wind up panning out most of the time right even ego to look at terrorists\nI mean the the amount of ... people in the middle east who say that they would uh execute a terrorist attack\nOn on people who are on you know people from another country for example you and I noted states it is so high it's incredibly disturbing you almost would never walk outside if you realize how many millions of people will tell pollsters that yes I Would kill American citizens however obviously they're not doing it\nRight whether it's because they're not capable of doing it or whether they're a in reality they just want to send a message or they really don't like them but I'm not going to go kill someone whatever the reason is and that could be the situation here\nCould be the same thing from a someone on the left who wants to make the right look bad a week before the election or sending these things around with no intention of killing anyone but wants to make a big media circus you things are all plausible possibilities we have no relatives and know\nThat other than the fact that these were all political figures and none of the bottom seem to work and they're really all that's all the information we have right now\nBut the issue here is on the freaking NBC yeah\nYou can spirit us ally early for mentioning it but you know like Jimmy you're going to give Jimmy Fallon the top but place in your network so what\nShe said was weight but if you are if you are\nHolding somebody up if you're if you're making fun of them okay but if you're holding somebody up like this woman who you know with Diana Ross she liked Diana Ross you unlike Diana Ross for the night and she's not making fun of and she's not making fun of Diana Ross\nWell isn't that what ... Fallon did actually didn't ask the question he just ... ...\n... ... ... you brought up a great point yesterday and I thought about this as we were getting close to we're getting close to Halloween\n... ... the biggest deal in the world was made of finally African Americans have a superhero Black Panther finally they have one finally after\nAll this time we've given them superhero and one that actually people want to meet with the yeah the white kids and black kid wants to be so if you're white sun decides he wants to be\nBlack Panther 'em and thinks that it's\nNow of course as a father I Would be like sorry dude you're going to be surprised to hear this but knew you could not do that like we have no awareness of race but I mean if if what he's trying to do is to\nBe you know the the one of his heroes who happens to be African American and he obviously noticed is the difference in characteristics that I mean he's a\nHorrible horrible thing for a child to consider golf course not to be horrible of a black person dressed up as Superman\nNo no no not that way if they put on white face as Superman no I mean it seems it seems ridiculous you wouldn't do it because you don't ... I don't see Silverman is white or black he's just a Superman it doesn't matter\nBut because of the name of the show was white Superman they bring black lab and try to game I just got this from a an African American a friend of mine who I Am not going to name because I'm afraid that they will be targeted\nOK Glen what about white face\nThis morning my son in eleventh grade said he and his friends want to be white chicks from the movie white chicks I thought it was funny but I don't know especially at [laughter] people will take what's supposed to be funny\nOffended by it and start this back and forth drama that none of us need uh we live in a white community ah and I literally said I think this is going to come back to bite you later I never thought I'd have to tell my kids that\nFrom an African American [laughter] miss a thing [noise] amazing\nAnd you know it may not they're not may not be a backlash we're going the other way for blacks dressing and white face\nThat movie came out depends on the ends on the political climate now yeah\nThere would have never been before everybody thought it was funny yeah there would have never been but because of the political climate because people are you know you can't even talk about it this is Ken so what did we learn from Megan Kelly\nThe only reason for even ask a question ... care even asked the\nQuestion here is a woman who is one of the smartest people on TV she is as sharp as the sharpest razor we all worked with her we all know\nYou screw with Megan Kelly and she will connect you to rebut ... she is a wicked wicked smart agree ... okay yeah so here's this woman\nWho is working at a place that hired her and then my theory is they hired her because they thought oh she's a great investigative reporter she's great as a interviewer object to get at the time they were in a bidding war yeah she was a huge get as soon as the end they all thought this was going to be great\nThey put her in and then the social justice warriors all in the network it outside of the networks like good news how could you possibly she worked at Fox News and then they realized oh crap we're we're in trouble now with all of the fringe\nBut we thought would be cool with anything that we do now all the social justice warriors and so they needed a way out they have persecuted her\nPersecuted her all the way through\nSo what happens they see this opportunity she asked a question that's it she's just says well wait a minute is this wrong so here's what we learn that even one of the most powerful celebrities one of the most powerful educated women\nIs so frightened by the social justice mob inside NBC but the very next day this very bright woman\nWho knows who she is goes on television crying literally you can see it in her face\nCrying she so frightened by these people\nThat she says I'm Sorry I I I've learned a lot well what did America learn America didn't look\nAt I mean this sincerely mean this absolutely sincerely tapped stew\nCan either of you give me a note on politically correct to reason why this is so offensive to wear black face like Diana Ross if you are not\nMaking fun of her you're not you're not you're you're ... firing to be someone you admire right men either of you give me a non politically correct answer\nIn other words you can use a political correctness well because people will be upset nope nope no tell me why ...\nWell the only reason I have is is the one from our ochre and um which is which was that this was used to sort of as a battering ram against blacks in the twenties and\nOK okay they'll hang on on of right sure apps and it really over the top impersonating exactly right off exactly right and that's the twenties thirties ask any millennial ask anyone under thirty\nAnd now they don't you know who Mr Bo jingles is ... from the song from ... from you know oh yeah dancing with surely handle you know the guy that you always see with Shirley Temple is doing the dance up the stairs that's Mr Bo jingles okay one of the greatest dancers of all time\nNow you know Mr Bo jingles that's just short for some reason politically incorrect\nWe you ask people who've Mr Bo jingles if they don't have any idea didn't may have been in the twenties and thirties but it's not today\nAnd again that your broker still inserting and over the top impression knocking voted by making ... wait a minute like an over at the top\nImpersonation like Sarah Silverman did with giant cartoon lips mhm uh you mean like ... like what uh\nWhat's his name distributed among many chemical or do you mean foul and they're going to study in Philadelphia a Robert Downey junior\nOr in a in the tropics under I mean a blackface is not a\nIt's been used particularly in comedic circumstances usually vote to make a point that black faces ridiculous not the case with Jimmy came right anyway and just like you I mean but he was on ... face changed about Adam ... on ...\nBad if you are trying to ... you know live this person because you're a huge fan that's what she said this was a political hit jobs here was and this should sniff in the back\nOf every single conservative and anyone in the
