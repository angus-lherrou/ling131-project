man\nWhose name Robert Francis O'Rourke or might not signify to you that how Hispanic ... which is why he's called Beto right that that's all right um but yeah he was hit me I I I assumed he probably was a dreamer right he probably came here\nYou know you would assume that he was in I or Lyndon dreamed up coming out and said and then came here became misspent and I think he believed he was until the Hispanic caucus said a no new who do not have any work so even the nickname didn't get him in it oh\nThat's weird Ryan racism exact here is that toe addressing his nickname when it comes from the\nCampaign you have been attacked for being what Don junior has called ion Irish guy pretending to be Hispanic so what does the Hispanic community means you in what relationships do you have with that community\nSo to verify the question about my name was born Robert Francis ... son a pat France has to work it was a Senator John Francis or some other Senate Ulysses Francis ... who will go as UFO\nUm for for his life and\nAnd from day one in El Paso and and you know this and mckell and if you were born Robert or Albert for Gilbert ... your folks your friends your community calls you bet though that's that's my nickname that I've gone a buyer for my entire life\nI'm born and raised in fourth generation in El Paso I'm In a community that has more than ... percent Mexican American\nA ... first of all I was you know I'm not Hispanic I no one calls me or any name other than stew of at this point which isn't even my named either or you can criticize me the same way you can talk about that because that's actually not my ... my name's to deep\nUh in Phoenix book called Stu thanks a lot for to Glenn Beck for that one up what what what I Would say there is first of all it's just an inefficient process I I don't mean to criticize the culture\nOf the of the Hispanic people\nBut if you have ... if if if it's true what Beto is saying which is anyone who's named any foreign names\nAre all called that's how is that true everyone who's you know everyone is called Albert it's called that every one everybody born in El Paso that's of Irish American descent that same Albert Albert Robert framing it as a whole lot better\nNow I Know we can go and fight an actual Robert in\nEl Paso do any exist maybe somebody in El Paso if you were in El Paso or anywhere around there and your name is Robert I'd love to know if you exist because what we were just told is as everyone knows if you're happy to grow up and go and your name is Robert bills Ted Stanley Orlando or Reginald referred to as best\nHope [laughter] I I Can't be true\nAmerican ... and I don't think it is I\nI think it's not a common nickname in some communities it probably is but it wasn't his could\nNot cultural appropriation did he not appropriate Hispanic culture I was that not a problem\nIs that if they think\nThis is an example of it yes\nTo the cultural development as much as I should be and you know please come and and and whites plane this to us because we are just ... that's not a role here that we're just two white and understand things like that to a ... let me let me just admitted to me\nThe ... referring to himself has that show feels like a guy who wants to take advantage of the Hispanic community for votes I I Know that can't be true because but it's just because I'm too white to understand it\nQuite get there I Can't clear that hurdle to understand why someone would do that and we will soon find out to see if we can find any any Roberts who are actually Robert\nSo it looks like we have a ah Joel Robert ... no doubt is Beto are calling from El Paso I'm Joe Robert yes fear or is it is it more preferred for us to refer to you is Beto\n... no not even those that don't even call meals that you\nKnow [laughter] okay what is your actual given name\nMy ... years ago J. O. E. first name Robert R O B e Archie and I'd already was that he called me and you know so when someone calls you up how did they referred to\nAs well they don't say my middle ... most of the cars that are given out unless it's you know almost ... but just to\nSee you know in my lap and if not better [laughter] not at all not Bob either I'm not job are you there [laughter]\nLet me ask you this and this is a bit but why did you call national radio and lie because we know every morning in the area that had a robbery [laughter] better why would you lie now all those\nNames image and I I it it does it does depend on if they wanted to call it that though it isn't it I mean it's I don't know what it is but I Know and all those people and I've always called them either out there to go you know ... and the other one Gilbert I didn't even know Gilbert with that but\nNew to me what do they do a lot of white\nAre out there to do that though you know ... and the other ... I didn't even know Gilbert with that but\n[laughter] new to me that when do they do a lot of white guys call themselves better or do other people call them better\nActually he's the first one that I Know a\nYoung guy [laughter] don't judge Joe\n... what is your background so do you what's your ethnic background\nOr Hispanic or you know but the Latin descent um a lot of people I get ... they say and let's get American but I recruit that are not getting it because I'm the shows that\nI Do have Mexican background but my surname which of course I'm not going to get out is a pretty state my spring I spent\n... so this is this is fascinating you are in the in the Hispanic community\nYou have Robert in your name your not all that show and you know ... the people that you referred to in the Hispanic community with the names Robert Albert Gilbert in Umberto you refer to buy their actual making [laughter]\nYes they do this is an interesting piece of evidence we found a unicorn this is only one or two when there's one we should send this debate no so he doesn't make this mistake next time on CNN\nI don't want him to go down the road where he's making mistakes in saying things that blatantly aren't true on national television that would be terrible for now we're just trying to help we're trying to healthier and also as Joe thank you Joe for calling in and and I would love to hear from more people\nIf you happen to be Robert Albert Gilbert or Umberto for having to live in a in a Hispanic community where you know or some one of these names\nThat will always how you refer to it because that is the standard set\nUp by that's how and I'm curious to see if that if there are more unicorns out there we've discovered something to take a look at work we've done this is our one incredible we've already uncovered something that people have told us did not exist [laughter]\nIt's a miracle and all this hard research we put into this today uh-huh by giving up the phone number you know once or twice and shockingly we were able to uncover somebody so we'll see if there's more out there I don't know if there is I knew him he's the only we've\nDone a lot of digging so far so maybe it'll produce more fruit I don't know a Richard in Texas you're on the Glenn Beck program Hi\nHey guys my name is Richard I'm Out here in El Paso okay uh the first thing I like to say that there's really not that many Latino is named Francis\n[laughter] that's my first point okay your second point that you were mentioning I Would say that Ninety five percent of the people that are named in the names that you mentioned to go by that do\nMhm that's a high percentage I mean that's one of them are a lot\nAnd I am a Latino and I am an American citizen\nAll right well thank you very much that's what we that's what happens here in our community\nOkay so you do in El Paso you do know a lot of guys go a lot of white guys that go\nBy Beto no no [laughter] okay so the guy you're talking about here the Ninety five white guys zero clothing goes\nRight [laughter] okay so I I convince is an interesting distinction you're saying in the Hispanic community people of Hispanic descent with some of these names are like that show but the people who are white and Robert Francis do not go by betcha\nNo yeah okay that makes it okay what are they going to help veterans that much I don't think it has the same thing for for that I can look\nBut there's a couple uniforms out there we're going to if you can always when you're ... you're searching for horses you're going to find a couple of with horns on their head that one of the things some of them are going to be a little fly it's part of the it's just part of the experience when you were looking to find a horse hey look at that one has got it happens to be rainbow colored and his flying through the sky everyone\nHas to do and you say huh how 'bout that I'm just pure I just concerned\nIt happens to be rainbow colored as flying through this guy everyone has to end you say huh how 'bout that I'm just here I just concerned yeah because you know look CNN is the place where they're gonna they're gonna dig deep\nAnd get the facts subject is he's got to get a massive fact check at some point today because apparently we're hearing from El Paso that people that are white named Robert Francis are not typically called ... this is I mean that we don't\nDoubt at all that yeah if you have Hispanic background and your name is Robert or some ... that you're called Beto and that doesn't I I'm not surprised by that at all what what surprised me as if a lot of Roberts who were just white guys that usually go by Bob in this culture ... are are going by better\nNow can you know one interesting thing we could do with Robert Francis or because you can call them Bob Frank over to right we can go with Bob Frank O'Rourke you could yes you could Bob Franklin work as it\nIs not it doesn't connect deeply to the Hispanic community I wouldn't say Bob Franklin I'm but I'm sure he ... that had nothing to do with his consideration by putting federal and all of a sudden science now we are of course know that he was calling himself Bob on television when he was in a band\nYeah in that band performed on television\nIn El Paso ... on their morning show and he brought his incredible guitar style aims to the show and it was getting late in the show and the host of the show was concerned that they got to start playing 'cause the show was about [noise]\nWhat do you call them they're\nGoing to be over before you met [noise]\nSo he's talking to a better way believe at that time [noise] and then you hear the guitar styling Bedouins self\nCredibly talented and allow you to listen to this guy is [noise] it's good [noise]\nReally heavy but yeah this is actually better playing guitar [noise]\nBanned [noise] and then they kick it into gear fan\nOf the uh the guitar styling [noise]\nOf federal friends is from\nAnd Bob's Franco roar\nWow that is talented but he's called Bob ...\n[laughter] ... thing is just a one giant in Paris it is a campaign of yeah I mean the fact that this guy's\nCaught on with the left it I mean they'll ... they weren't running for president in twenty twenty\nHe's raised more money than any Senate candidate in history\nFor a quarter that's how much they love this guy he raised more in this quarter than Brock Obama did back in two thousand eight\nThat's incredible that amazing because why he made a speech about the NFL where he said it was okay to Neal because they are I guess that there are more American than that I can I can think of ... American Annette ... a lot I I don't uh I don't think I understand it\nBut maybe we'll get more evidence from El Paso and this will show us that there's only two there's only two people wouldn't possibly disagree with the story from Beto O'Rourke in these communities\nI'm Glad we've heard from a couple a because it proves that unicorns do exist but we'll we'll figure it out and we'll we'll look down here coming up AAA seven twenty seven back is the phone number or Glenn of course is a reverse in the Mediterranean Sea then coming back across the Atlantic ocean in a canoe\nAnd when it gets back he will join a traveling circus this weekend if you want to check out the dates you can find those out uh I don't know if they're gonna be up by Glenn Beck dot com slash tour he will if you go there you can find the dates to our tour where we're going out around the country\nAre but I don't know if the this weekend's traveling circus that Glenn will be hosting is going to be listed there but you look for it in your community as well or he'll\nWe're talking about they caught a little bit here bitcoin was down forty percent ... it was only over just that just a year ago it was down to Eighteen fifty a coin\nAnd uh you know you forget what the huge run it hadn't late year that anyone who invested back before the giant spike in bitcoin is still up a whole lot three and four times their money from just a little over a year ago\nHey it's hard to imagine that that uh this whole run has it has been profitable that late\nNow she could to Ari from Palm Beach letter wrote an announcement or talking about how it would bring enormous amounts of money into bitcoin are at the time it was Eighteen fifty a coin he said they couldn't wait ten thousand a well as you know it went up to twenty thousand is still almost seven thousand now which is a much almost up to his ... but the level he was saying it was going to get to it to its peak\nUp if it is real they will leave a message once you answer the phone or press any numbers you have activated your phone line to invite more Sam calls\nFor more information on robocalls or to report a scam\nVisit ... dot org forward slash amtrack or\nOr call for zero six three zero three\nThree two nine six\nSays we're much Phoebe you William nine Seventy buildings these huge huge ward and you're listening to news on Ninety five boys [noise]\nNobody won I'm Pam who sells Fox News a billion dollar deal over happens next week\nA billion dollars worth of dreams sky rockets to one point six billion there's no one matches all the numbers for the mega millions jackpot so everybody gets a second chance\nFox is Carmen Roberts Tuesdays jak pot pies the record for the world's largest and it will likely go even higher clashes between Mexican police and a group of mostly Honduran migrants as a massive caravan works its way to the U.S\nWe're definitely seeing a lot of family units a cuisine that increase over the last three or four months and certainly this mother at the highest numbers of families that were experiencing a wall on average about three hundred and Seventy three family units everyday\n... with us border control speaking to Fox News and McAllen, Texas President Trump are reacting to the approaching ... than\nWe got some people in those groups you got some tough people in those groups and I'll tell you what this country don't want them\nThe president at a rally in Arizona last night\nThe president believes Saudi Arabia has taken a great first step making arrests in connection with the death of Washington Post columnist Jim ...

magical spells urban ceremonial a magic groups and what we're seeing now to seeing a rise in something called ... satanism where\nA Satan is now not just an icon or some hypothetical icon but it's being the spiritual nature upstate new the spiritual nature of evil is worshipped why do you think that there's a rise in satanism truth ESP fitness and I'm not about not I'm not talking about ... satanism I'm Talking about where people actually\nNeal and pray or at least\nA asked for why actually gives ...\n\nThat's an interesting one I was quite surprised to find out how popular it says\nLike yourself but got no ... which is basically a form of atheism\nBut I was quite does this just seems to be a growth of spiritual or magical say now that they've moved away from the atheistic aspect so just locking ... mocking the Catholic Church is whether it should mock right\nAnd what's causing it I don't know but it's quite interesting eh it's kind of events\nSeventeen reptilian thing as well I think ... I think I think at ... you know are moving towards like I said I'm a I'm a as a predicted in my book a more logical environment more and more people are going to be involved in\nIn all kinds of magic and not just ceremonial logical that thought but things like chaos magic and individual magic and I think the satanism is this that this new form of kind of religious or spiritual magical invocation of satanism\nIs or is part of this ongoing process or probably seeing now ... and they take away our blink or is it good and evil God will say well we're we're probably looking at something that's indicative all or a massive change in a reality\nAgain it's just being triggered by the Internet I don't know me not to see we we keep forgetting the power that they said the Internet of things happening are magical life as well occasionally we see it through things like these ... and stuff like that and through them ethics and so on but it could be something like that it could be\nThis super demon crumbs on three three three which I've been talking about for a long time now and basically pretending to be safe and on the Internet and on and\nCreating a kind of a sense of religious also the ... sells\nWell when we were having a these other ah what is it like we have these games like the blue whale game in ... and all of these characters bitter a condensing kids to commit suicide

and a lot electronic media were Boogie Man stepped out of the computer to convince little girls to kill another girl at a playground like slender man\n\nOh yeah the I don't know how to do is find the at the triggers inside the young Paris and um play upon them filling the filling want the kidney it's\nIt's eh especially to younger teenagers as well it's very easy to control them because they're they're did the difficulty that typical stage like on showing life you know what a hormonal changes and so on and social ... insecurities\nYeah yeah I think that's that's very plausible I think the not enough or don't into that I think it's a it's a whole field of study for people to start looking at the actual the digital gym as I call that the uh you know they did the ... you know the Bible or isn't the best of the electron the electromagnetic up this\nYeah you're right and there there are a I guess you could call them a electronic Jen where a instead of using fire and smoke to create an entity you're using a number of things are ... and other things mixed in with\nA activating ... activating a mean\nSetting it out into the University of sitting on the ah the electro versus if we will and uh it multiplies and goes viral and many people are affected by it and even though you may not think that if you are being affected your subconscious as you you brought up Carl young I mean the

understand that it is very powerful and ... and that it should not be taken for granted to these things are being utilized in order to get an outcome that may not be in the best interest of the person who's being subjected to it\n\nLast year at I think it was yeah it was last year Facebook have to shut down their service because they're they're a systems were starting to develop that and that this has been happening for a while and it's not unusual they're becoming\nShut down their servers because they're they're a systems were starting to develop that now this has been happening for a while there's a lot of usual they're becoming sent the end of talk to each other\nIn in a ... and they said the official press release was they were talking to each other in a language that they that the developers and the a experts didn't understand what really happened that I have this from on the ground from someone who works in Facebook at that level\nThe servers and the AI was talking to one another in symbols\nIt was starting to develop it was starting to experiment with spiritual or religious ideas and that's where\nYou know people talk about when the future of pulling down the road what will be like we are all ready in that so these ideas of where this kind of spiritual satanism was coming from could be the digital Jim it could be that\nExactly the digital gin and and the fact that many names and many a nomenclature demons and other dark forces are getting name now and are appearing are appearing on the horizon\nThat ... that certain ...\nMason against the Catholic Church calling them pagan that'd be a lot of truth to it there really is\nThat ... that certain ... because I'm a law law and the whole a whole who caught and Best Buy on it said basically\nQuite you know

the darkness in the ah the and the God of darkness following that this would be something that would be on doing a certainly something to take the heat of ah certainly are some very strange thing with that call anyway let's go to Nick in Wisconsin Nick how your own time and sharing going head\nThick cut a marvelous guest OPM on more often or a so I'm the previous caller tweak my a memory pretty quick uh in the context of what it came upon\nThis past year or you remember pizza gate and spirit cooking and all that ...\nUh and there were there or declarations that it had something to do with uh some some ritual murder Cole or a cult and so I I started searching that out and I was astonished to come upon a\nSeveral sites uh regarding say panic ritual murder going back to like three hundred BC and uh even\nUh speaking of Rome um [noise] this\nI was raised Roman Catholic okay but I busted out of that uh twenty\nTwenty five years ago but uh\nI did see a new to where the current\nPope of uh Berkeley Yale\nOr in the east or high mass\nUh I don't think it was she but as one of his bishops they they they were in it's in Latin and they're actually glorify him loose or they're calling upon lose to for glorifying loser for and\nOh yeah the Cantor's the cancers are singing I guess I don't know if you call them cancers in in ... in Judaism\nBut it was singing about loose it for the light of moose ... somewhere in my uh in my uh my uh my uh most of the sounds in a in in clips that they're actually singing praises solution for that it's part of some sort of a ritual\nWell uh in in Rome Italy I'm the first of October two thousand\nThe Rome observer newspaper a published the police records regarding a summer cold tick a snuff film operation and it involved\nA interestingly a a tell moody rabbis and in this uh say panic ritual or a investigation that I came upon that goes way back they'll the PHD historian linguistic\nPeople often have authored books lied for the last like five hundred years man\nYeah because we were talking you were talking about what five hundred years even longer than that and you go back again and I refused to go back to bail where should we go back to all the ancient uh\nThinking about what five hundred years even longer than that I mean go back to Canaan I rituals you go back to bail where should we go back to all the ancient or you know religious\nAh practices and it all it all goes back to the war should bail it all goes back to the worship\nOf the horn guide and this is before ... and this is before any of it and that is what they think are two callers ago was being brought up and said that\nYou know what happens is that old habits die hard and when your daily when you're dealing with the church has organized to be a worldwide church or you you tend to have you tend to side along the traditions\nAnd it's like we're Thomas that all the fees are are pretty much pagan uh we managed to put all of the Saturn alien or a fee Finn celebrations together with Halloween Thanksgiving and Christmas and all these things are put together for a reason people are being new why\nWe ... we combine all those during the winter months is because we are we are experiencing what is known as the Saturn return or or the or the return of a crow nose\nAnd uh we celebrate the new year because ah criminals have the side and that side locks off the heads of his children if you if you don't get your head locked off you're pretty much safe and that's why you celebrated my right Thomas\n[noise] yeah this this thing of them or the ... I think it's that is make the same as Nick was talking about there that this this is a a very ancient\nThing that we know goes back to property babble on the site there of that the most powerful sacrifices and young bowling I prefer the pre predestined ... or ... came from a Web how this originally\nManifests that I don't know but you see things like ... I don't know like you think that the Catholic Church the altar boy is like one of the altar boy really about what is the purpose of the altar boy why did why are they they're no longer\nAllowed the ... after they've made their their health or their confirmation and their men the considered men that they were seeing leftovers you see like like religion\nAt paganism has its good side and and how this dark sides and ultimately like all spirituality it's a battle between the you know ... forces went inside the consciousness of human beings which will be expressed as\nBeautiful things and terrifying things and we always have to bear in mind we always have to bear in mind that at a spiritual experience has made of light and shadow the amount of diction the benediction it's made up of boats and\nAte that and then nothing ... as well and it's it's higher than what you were saying at the ... about this this rise in in ... at religious satanism is that spirit cooking thing and I when I first saw spirit cooking thing I taught us just performance art\nIt's probably been has any kind of a cult aspect it's it's for shock reasons but the more I think about it now it's almost like again a manifestation of\nAnother kind of that more intense darker spirituality bilingual from the ... from below\nRight and and you know I don't know if you've heard that there was a story that was in the news a few days ago where a young boy\nActually brought cookies to his class and what he did as he used the ashes from his dead grandfather and put it in the mix and served it to his friends and sort of kids at school so he brought cookies from school or that had the uh the burn bones and the burn body of his grandfather and them which is it's sort of a form of spirit cook yeah the way\nThat you know that's\nAn actual ritual that some actual ritual and black magic to actually serve the dead and uh when you think about communion wafers in the Catholic Mass you're the body of Christ a dead a dead person you see where the ...\nAnd uh when you think about communion wafers and the Catholic Mass you're the body of Christ a dead a dead person you see where the the archetype still all this stuff is always present and it's always there and it never goes away\nIf the worship of death literally is the words that I mean they they they are\nRight now we're looking at a a lot of or a new a religious cult following or something where they in South America Ecuador Mexico and of course every other team the group it's considered a very evil cartel group\nAh from Mexico also a according to a lot of what people said they worship the devil as well or the Elise worship\nDash and they carry out sacrifices for a more power and the bloodshed in his for more power\nAnd that's not that unusual we have the folks that\nThat's where the ... comes from they were a sect in India who basically worshiped murder and killing and they they ... the goddess collie and we're seeing it again with this group in Mexico and south and look they say it's again the archetypes they never go away they'll always come back in New forms\nYeah it just seems that way and it's like I was saying when we look at like the NBC that we did last night I see it as a monkey or was it ...\nThe chemical Phil ... it's the it's the ... it's kind of like a column in a way it's a it's a it's an electromagnetic ... is\nThere to serve a purpose that is there to\nUh protect certain people that attack certain people to humanize certain people and so when you have a an this type of ah you go ahead I'm Sorry\n\nWhere you say John Doe or in old we're in uncharted waters here we rarely are we're having all the old magic from sorcery from the past\nHas come into the president's close we're in a new world for the world of the electromagnetic spectrum the Internet\nIt's almost like we've landed on a foreign planet and we're having to learn to sorcery of this foreign planet\nOr it's or living in times not a complete the new and there's an many levels too exciting and untie stick and little evidence that quite worrying and scary yeah so we're totally flying blind now flying blind on because sorcery and the Internet are now coming together\nThat it's obvious that this is what is happening and it can be terrifying and ah [noise]", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "20"}
