disassociate myself\nFrom ... to praise of Brett Kavanaugh with respect he's a fifth vote to the hard right turn on voting rights and so much more that will harm the Democratic process\nHe's a fifth vote to the hard right turn on voting rights and so much more that will harm the Democratic process and prevent a more equal society\nOkay so in July she came out and she let everybody know I'm

world her independent independent viewpoint Emily exercise the or other\nPlatforms she has the New York times with a holy crap bombshell on Brett Kavanaugh and I hope you're buckled in for this or is this in the early the allegations\nAre horrifying you'd ask yourself what could be worse than attempted rape Glenn well gang rape yeah but what could be worse than gang rape well here we go Emily in the New York times reported that in September of Nineteen eighty five Brett Kavanaugh\n[noise]\nThrough glass of ice it somebody yes\nYes I'm Sorry if this was a triggering event for you if you're all of a sudden like you remember somebody coming at you Jack Frost trying to stab you with the icicles I I get it I get it I'm Sorry I had to bring this up\nAnd it makes him into sausage ...\nUh you need to announce that Mike Lee is the candidate we're going to have this done by the election there of course going to go crazy because Mike Lee is a member pro life uh and he would vote a\n... the bottom line is he cares about the constitution anything I mean he will vote he will vote the constitution and he will also vote for a ride of life he's not going to go in there with an agenda but he is a right to life guy so Kevin I wasn't good enough here's Mike Lee\nThere's not going to be there is no drinking parties would likely there's just no drinking part maybe and it'll be like Mike is like\nAll right I\nConfess I tasted beer in Nineteen eighty three I didn't really like it when I Try to they wasn't root beer have you lived in\nA so anyway he's the only one that you could push through because if you don't if you don't have a plan immediately then the Democratic plan works of delay yeah that and that's the most important point\nTheir strategy is not to say that Kavanaugh is a sexual abusers\nTheir strategy is not to say anything about Kavanaugh specifically their strategies to delayed this thing so they can get to the election and if they get past\nThe new Senate coming in they can potentially have a chance of stopping this now if you were to the day after the um it did that after this goes down God Forbid you know would they find something terrorists have let's say

Senate but I mean it's going to be really close and you might not make it really is the only thing you'd have that you have be able to get that through faster\nNeed also is the guy that everybody in the Senate has to look at it after they voted against\nI mean they will vote against it but Democrats will still do it but we'll\nWe'll Jeff Flake vote against you know a highly I don't think so would a I think so you know I mean you know I don't know have good relationships with Lee even though they know they think he's gas service for for them and remember it's advise\nAnd consent and now I Know the Democrats won't care about that but there's a chance you can get all of the Republicans on board if you don't\nI Want to lay out some scenarios of ... what we're looking at here and please help me

a you know in a positive way I I I think though that we should also get into a movie to this beforehand get into the idea that there are accusations that Kevin all light in his hearing\nYeah and you know the New York times laid them out in ridiculous detail yeah and we should go through each one of them because I I Would like because there's an idea that if there is let's say he perjured himself which is one of the things a lot of people are starting to throw around now they're starting to say well he perjured himself he like\nSaying he was trying to paint himself in the best possible\nIt was he perjured himself that maybe he did I don't know I mean I haven't seen any perjury about sex doesn't matter we all the way I forgot about that yeah um but ... ...\n... if he perjured himself he we perjured himself for me it's a problem yeah\nI I mean to me it would it would matter on the context of it I guess I I I mean if what do you mean like the booth thing like one of the things we're talking about his ... the the word ... which is a word I have not heard since probably Nineteen eighty five\nUm uh but he it was what does it mean and he said it meant flatulence and there's a I mean I'm pretty sure\nI I I could be wrong but there was a word like that and I thought was\nThem that the number one meaning but that's the number one I have never heard of that blood funneling oh now\nI Know my neck nickel terms I don't know who says you know what a bad it's better if we drink beer through our bought\nBought apparently that's been done\nA [laughter] I didn't I didn't know you kind of I Know you can do that either is it and I don't recommend and it's not called really drinking if you do it that way now also really learning here nothing\nNo I don't know if you're if you have bought blackouts if you know it was on your butt falls on an asteroid or not or okay okay so there's a there's the there's the the number one a ... or the next one is something that is whack\nDumb or F up used to describe objects people or stuff you don't\nWant to do that like a you know that guy's a booth yeah I feel like that's maybe also how I heard it now that you're saying it that way it's just kinda like an insult yeah that may have been yeah right\nI just know I remember the words but I don't remember in connected to [noise] you know sticking things into [laughter] anyway ah here's one that kind of makes me feel a little better a synonym for weed\nOkay yeah\nSo how would it is there a sense of smell you use it in a sentence place smells that booth [laughter] mountain I assume that da da is what you're saying yeah smells that boom yeah yeah yeah it makes me feel uncomfortable\nFit me active lifting the ah the bow out of a whitewater kayak well going over rocks waves are waterfalls like uh in order to launch over hydraulics or rocks this entry sponsored by ... yeah that's what I've never heard that before I Move\nThe low tones noise a dog may okay typically when they are suspicious or unsure of whether they should actually bark or not\nI haven't heard a flatulence one but I have heard many things related to the bought a which I think somewhat another term for having sex it that'd be in the bud Bob [laughter] okay so again [laughter] I think this is the interesting point here they're trying to say this is essentially perjury\nThere's no way that's perjury to me that is a bonkers claim the idea that they're that word probably meant different things to different schools as as mine and yours did right as there are seven different definitions on Urban Dictionary for it not not just because flatulence didn't make it there does not mean that low locally that was not the way people used it\nBut you do have the problem of people in Georgetown Prep now starting to come out and saying look I I was for him and I don't think he did this Ford thing but\nNow that he was saying that this is what these words mean\nAnd never really fall down drunk yeah you\nOkay well do you have that one too if you want to go to that acts as a\nAgain the lists of potential perjury or from for judge Kavanaugh um the next one is excessive drinking judge Kavanaugh portrayed himself in his testimony is enjoying a beer or two in in high school and it's a college student but not as someone who often drink to excess during those years I drank beer with my friends and\nUm then this is disputed is what they say and the times his statements are at odds at a with some of his classmates and how they remembered him nearly a dozen college classmates of judge Kavanaugh said they recalled a him indulging in heavy drinking some saying\nSo now it's not it's less than a dozen 'cause some of that I'm drinking some saying a it was a beyond normal consumption ... parents had to go here to be sure a smaller number of classmates that his drinking was unacceptable\nSo again this is like\nJudging yourself and how much you drink is notoriously difficult as I Would assume Mr alcoholic over here will be able to tell you\nOr I mean the whole point is the toughest thing to do is admit you're an alcoholic right yeah it's very possible and I would say likely that most people who drink to excess and these periods would not necessarily say that they're doing something abnormal even if they are\nHere's what I here's how I take this I took that testimony what I watched him talk about drinking it was very clear that he was getting drunk\nAnd and he said look we drank drank to actually drink to excess we all did have you done that I mean I ... the on the drinking thing\nI don't consider this a problem because I\nI Believe that he was in effect saying yeah so there's a difference between a blackout mhm gay\nAnd maybe he had blackouts and didn't remember them I don't believe that at all you have a blackout you remember it you don't you don't remember what happened do you remember the ... I remember you were like oh crap I don't even remember now maybe at Seventeen\nYou know your local ... remember or maybe you're Seventeen and doing that but you have to consume a lot of alcohol I I I you\nKnow I got to that man is gay or ... expert witness yet in a Glenn Beck please come to that sort of a you know to me\nI don't I make a generalization but with a specific accusation Ninety five percent of people who say they drank to the point of blacking out or like I\nBelieve it's Ninety five percent I Believe that blackouts do exist but it is extraordinarily rare I spend a week in France which I Can't believe my liver returned with me out for sure it was going to be like you know what I'm saying on the beach here I [laughter]\nI drink a lot of other I'd say I got to get back home [laughter] I got to dry out my\nVoice though is that I've had a lot to drink in my life you know certain times I've never even been remotely de ... go home\nThat you have to consume in a very short period of yeah I Know I've done I I've I've done my homework on it\nUh and it's not exactly the way I have experienced it um apparently you can have blackouts if you drink a an enormous amount of alcohol if you if you were ...\nOr maybe um even if an enormous amount of alcohol gets in your bloodstream quickly\nYou can blackout\n... I I have read places where they say it's rare someplace to say it's common I'm Sorry but I Do not believe I Believe it's a movie trick that most people you know they're like\nOh we do in one last night we had six new right\nShut up Ninety five percent of the Ninety five percent that's a lot I had a friend who had rankled\nAnd blacked out blacked out fell off the stage and had to go to the hospital\nUm and that was a legit this was in college and that was a legitimate like he drank way too much nothing to do anything wrong he just fell off the stage name was killed himself and didn't remember any of it but and and just remember being there but did not remember the falling or anything okay um\nAnd so I'm not saying it never happens but like the idea that you would say to someone oh this guy's lying he did a blackout is completely absurd you can't you cannot\nYou cannot accuse someone of lying about the only they wouldn't know if it occurred you can say\nThat in this is what they are saying that he lied because he said you know he he gave the impression that he wasn't ever out of control falling down drunk well okay I don't believe that but I also don't I wasn't left with that impression\nNo he said I mean the quote business I drank beer with my friends almost everyone did sometimes I had too many beers sometimes others that I like there are still like beer but they're not drink beer to the point of blacking out he just said I didn't blackout in and say to drink to excess and back he said he I have a drink to excess\nAnd you know I mean I Am not a big drinker and my life but I drink to excess several times but never I mean the idea of the black blackout Germany and maybe a different story blackout drunk is I mean you've told me some of the levels of alcohol you had in your life\nThe levels are almost in human [laughter] like I Would definitely be dead and area\nI mean you're dumping poison into your system of it your body can handle it a blackout is\nShutting your body down ... saying I Can't keep you alive\nAnd to run all of these other systems right I mean that's that's you know that's intense so\nWe have a couple of more of these and go through yeah if we need to but I mean I think you get the point this is the level of almost every one of these accusations so I don't think that ... thing I don't think the ...\nUm what about the well let me take a break come back there's two things that could pose a problem for him\n... ... ... ... and some people are asking like why are you given up on cabinet I'm not not all I Know there's a fifty percent chance maybe higher then you get through the issue here is if he doesn't I mean because if you have faith here you're having the non ...\nCollins and Murkowski and ... if you have faith in them then fine don't worry about it but if you don't like I don't know maybe you better have planned be set up by the way I just want to make that really clear I'm not giving up on him at all\nI'm just playing this out and seeing where the Democrats are headed than we are and how will that affect those three senators\nBy July twenty Seventeen bitcoin was down forty percent taken tore came in and said Palm Beach in the Palm Beach letter a ... there's going to be some activity is going to bring enormous amounts of money into bitcoin what's bitcoin today\nA bitcoin currently sixty five forty eight sixty five forty eight bitcoin was parading around Eighteen fifty a coin at the time we all know that it went up to twenty thousand and his crash down to about five or six thousand and it's still kind of hovering there it's gone up and down but you know it's been ... for a while", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Billings", "day": "03"}
