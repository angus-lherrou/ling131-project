thin resources OK and Jew instill that feeling that everything is going\nCrazy to sound familiar to anybody\nWell yeah I I was ... I Would say that what you're what you're describing\nIs a you know as you say you're ... you're spreading out resources you're spreading out ah information you're you're\nKilling one side of the information spectrum ... only give birth to another site this is full on asymmetrical warfare asymmetric warfare and that's why I think it's important to the point that out\nWell your ex exactly right I published an article today called freedom's worst enemy today is the mainstream media\nBecause what again most people don't understand is that the civil war if you were describing and we can find any test that it will pass okay but what you're describing is a face to face one that can\nGlobally is an elitist civil war\nOkay there are factions fighting here anybody who believes that even Trump can get in to office the highest office in this way without having to kiss somebody says hey you know would have used a different metaphor but we'll stick with ring for right now I'm isn't idiots would\nNever happen okay so we're looking at one faction against another and they are playing the American people like a Stradivarius\nWhile the ... here in the instability of of the political discourse is one of the first signs of civil war the idea that violence is the only way to somehow or change the discourse is part of civil war all of these factories are part of civil war and the only reason why people don't think we're in civil war\nBecause he didn't happen the way they were told it was going to happen we're not having an armed conflict right now between America and there was it'd be Americans just shooting Americans well I mean American should Americans every day\nA mass majority of all these things are ... they're not fleeing perpetrated by the same side\nBut they all have goals those goals are and you had to get this over and over again you get this label on that over and over again they are for the ... of you and I this is\nThe program's ignorance vicious why you get so frustrated at talk talking to people that way you do why the liberty we can get so frustrated but we still get up tomorrow and do it what am I got this wrong ...\nDo you have an agency this is the thing I I don't think you know\nCivics or Mississippi or no longer taught they don't understand most of the younger generations don't understand that if they don't understand what the ... terrorism in which would be the idea of ... fire still Catholic terrorism is we're communications are twisted\nIn order to incite the riots drove the violence\nAnd we can argue that the president does then we can argue that the media does it we can argue that Hillary Clinton is doing it and you want to hear what's what's really creepy is you know what's trending on Twitter right now\nGo ahead and make America great again bomber duties hash\nTag may go bomber M. A. G. A. bomb or make America great again they are now calling him the make America great again bummer because they're attributing it to Donald Trump they're attributing it to the Republicans they're pushing it towards the conservative same conservative was responsible for the bombings today\nAnd and yet none of that we've done when the shooting took place of the senators nothing was done about nature when\nThey sent the rice and but now we have trending on Twitter the mega bomber this is this is amazing and there was no there's no evidence nothing uh nothing has been released to the public\nOf any kind of a of evidence saying that it it points to a conservative or some right wing extremist or something but now it's already turning on the Internet that it's the make America great again bomber\nThis this obviously happened today as a way of creating ... for the masses and they're falling for it\nIt's common even stronger when the um on these migrants get to the borders or the border of the United states if they are allowed to and I have a strong feeling they will be allowed to because Trump will just put to test [noise] um if you take a ...\nYou know and you stop to legalize okay that you and by the close to the same age we've never seen anything like this\nThis is the most exciting time to be alive in America and please do not ever confuse the word exciting with enjoyable\nRight because they are not spend nominate but they are exciting we are looking at and we have a\nPresident who get way back when okay a President Trump declared a state of emergency mhm now if you look into that state of emergency that basically will bring in a state of martial law\nWell her talking about how he an activity reenact the emergency powers yes he did that I could have timber eleven three did that after September eleventh and uh\nHave you been jak one of our callers call in and he reaffirmed that to us he says yes Syria preventing after they did that when do we do they do the task to the emergency system in every cell phone\nWhich was another a way to get people thinking what's happening now you see after all that took place you see the writing riots were happening in in Manhattan\nSee the riots were happening here in Portland and then from there we now have\nThe the bombings or the ... the rice and being fed the bombings now that have happened I said that there would be a final blow\nI didn't know what to do or how to count or want to point out to be the final blow someone sent me a headline today that even the Daily Beast it talked about everything from Kavanaugh on\nWith the rice and and now the bombs were the final blow and I might be good while either they listen to me or or they may sent the headline out to try and confirmed that it was amazing when that happened\nI I totally I totally agree I totally agree with everything I totally agree that we are on a precipice were standing there right now we're looking at a world that is teetering but\nMost people also need to understand is not only did it clear that state of emergency okay I'm going to say some things that are purely my opinion and they're not conjecture that based on that but this is what I see\nWhat I predict may happen All right\nWe have what could be as many as five hundred million guns in private hands in this country that is one of them any military and more than most military combined on the planet part of the reasons the United states has never been taken over is because a\nLot of things like that exist on the planet how many what percentage would you figure of those could be as many as five hundred million guns belonged to gun toting conservatives who are huge\nTrump followers how many of them would welcome US Marshal law if it brought the so called out of control and stuff like Democrat progressive in the line\nWell and okay with you I agree to a certain degree but here's something else okay so while you're talking about the guns\nDid you know that the other side is talking about collapse of the economy just to make Donald Trump look that they'd be willing to sacrifice the economy so we have one group it's willing to take up arms we have another group that's willing to sacrifice or at least destroy the economy or to prove a point about Donald Trump\nEconomy's going to go down in a way\nAll of us who look know that there is going to be something that's going to there's going to be a reset I'm not telling that it's going to be in six weeks it may be in six years there is going to be legal monetary reset and one of these days you owe invites you on sea of and we will discuss that that is a there are so many\nLevels out there some say so there is going\nBut one of these days you owe in charge of and we will discuss that that is a there are so many fold out there some say so there is going to the ... the only thing is what I heard five will not some very good sources to the liberty thinking is that when Trump got elected\nThey collapsed economy by the second tier of Hillary's first her\nWhen Trump took office they realized how much more money it sucked out of your pocket my pocket and basically decided at that point a lot say what exists now that there were lots of collapsed the economy and chill Trump left office\nNow see there's a lot of conjecture but this is what I heard this is what I see now take a look at what's been happening with international thanks for the last couple of days takes a look at their stocks\nFickle how many of my jumping out of windows\nI look at the point is dropping because of geopolitical tension and the geopolitical pinned down right now is hurting us the stock market\nBut I don't know if that's going to be a major collapse but I over discussions today from a from a ... you are our radio station is in bankers halls all the bankers around me as I was over hearing a lot of businessmen today and they're just saying ah you know be ready for a tanking because\nUh you know and and I actually heard a banker used the word civil war he says the civil war we're in right now is going to collapse the economy and we need to be prepared for gas prices go up advice to go up and the economy to fall and I said well if I'm going\nTo have those all the Federal Reserve will collapse the economy it will be there ... politicians it won't leave those puppets who sit on the board of directors but at the fed it will be um the child so on and so forth the word will come down when the economy goes down and they will be and it and we can do about it except\nThat I Believe Trump\nDoes have a play\nAnd again that's another show but I think he expects within the either the end of his first term or they're going to a second term to see a major global I'm double ... banking's awful\nYeah there is certainly something that uh you know the economy is the one thing that I've avoided it ignored because\nAt one time you say yeah were you see a major collapse and another time they'll say where's that collapse coming from and usually if you if you get really really directed you get really defined it's a guarantee that nothing's going to happen so I'm I'm standing by and watching the the slow trickle down fall of what we have going on\nBut the the violence the symptoms of violence the problems we're seeing a certainly are are part of what I said before a with regard to how the military would define a the the began to the civil war civil war itself infringe national pour a polarization with obvious\nNew meeting place for resolution increasingly divisive press
