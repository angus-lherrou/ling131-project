McGuire um go to my pod cast and listen to gene McGuire\nHe was wrongly accused spent thirty four years in jail in prison um and ah his attitude a and his story of redemption and also a sobriety is remarkable\nUm and then also you might find it useful I did an interview with Louis house\nOr from the school of greatness a few weeks ago a and that kind of goes into things are a little more I was operating on about three hours sleep\nWhen I did that interview and I listen to it and I went oh dear God what am I doing [laughter] ah so there is it is very Frank on that one or you might want to or you might want to listen to those who may and one more favor\nYou have your wife called me if you fall off the wagon just ... just for a little just it gives them when we can we can we can chat on the air and then you know maybe that would provide a little incentive for you\nFor you up to my wife my wife told me if I ever drink she'll leave me and I believe her a and that that that does cross my mind I Believe even if you don't start drinking she may yes she is she's getting up to the point now where did you like I'm going to start drinking or I view [laughter] ah but ah but best of luck to you will\nWhen you least expect it expected a\nIf you just remember that that your mind will knows you better than than you think and it will play all kinds of games with you you will make it you know when you least expect\nIt expected I made a book a out to you and we're going to put it into a into the mail for you thank you so much great thank you Glenn pretty she had it\nFor me I you know I Want to spend some time maybe on tomorrow's show I Want to spend some time about this I'm getting so much ... ... ... ... e mail now\nOn people who are trying to go through recovery but more importantly I'm getting a lot of mail\nAbout depression and I'm a and suicide yeah and I don't know why this is happening but suicide is a huge spike\nAnd I don't think people understand it a and I want to share some of the things that I have seen in the mail and some of the things that I've heard I don't know if you saw a star is born\nI did not know Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga yeah it has to be a an Oscar contenders\nAre I think they're both gonna win Oscars I mean they should it's\nIt's it's fantastic um but it is um I don't want to own\nWreck anything but ah it um it deals with alcoholism uh and and suicide and it's a it's a very powerful and his portrayal of that\nAnd um I don't know suicide is in our is in the ... right now um and ah\nSo we'll we'll talk about it possibly tomorrow you mentioned you signed a book or for a for him and the book of course I Do to to outrage we talked about about twenty five million times in the past couple of months you may know that it is available in bookstores\nFor him and the book of course a duty to outrage we talked about about twenty five zillion times in the past couple of months you may know that it is available in bookstores however we want one thing we don't mention often is subtitled\nAnd you know\nIt's about how treating the country right ... ... and then meeting that we have a problem not and yet like us but like the country as as as a whole as a whole has an issue with the way they're dealing with problems\nUm and if you if you look at that because it's about what do I don't have it in front of me it's a it's a um a house thinking like a recovering addict can help you heal the country yeah I mean if it if those principles that are helping him get through that alcoholism right\n... ... a lot of those same principles would work at a on our country no they definitely would and I ... you know you get into some of the ... addiction issues in the book but also how that applies to everything we have to deal with a ... ... you know once a cure for Michael ... like this is it that's what the book is about\nRight it's about being able to apply apply those and it principles to other situations it starts at the ... and it starts at the beginning it's not just admitting you have a problem\nThat we all have a problem of the nation has a problem and I think we can all admit that um but it really it released\nIt it's just got a I think there's a section in here that in the book that really came before as an alcoholic I had to decide is life worth living and in the book there's a chapter of are we good or are we bad is this republic is the American experiment\nWorth saving\nAnd we're not talking about that we're seeing people tear it down but nobody who's talking about is it worth saving so how do we answer that question\nThan the book goes through that and I I think the road to recovery of of our ills in this nation start there you know you you can say Hillary Clinton can\nSay well I Can't compromise with people you know I Can't even talk to those people because they want to destroy everything I Believe in what what is that you believe in\nAnd and really\nBelieve in don't tell me the ... little things tell me about America\nTell me who you are now she can't do that because I don't I I just don't think that she's a she's honest enough\nTo tell me she's this is a politician sees of calculating and and so are most politicians right and left it up to us we have to say that to our neighbors that we think we disagree with can we just can we not talk about politics for second\nIs America worth saving is it a good place or a bad place\nAnd the book shows you how to have that conversation and gives you some some facts both on good and bad\nBecause both sides have to have to step to the plate both sides Republicans generally see ra ra all of the good things red white and blue and were patriotic because we believe and we don't want to hear the bad things because usually the bad things are being told to us by people who have the country\nWe have to go out and learn the bad things about the country and those people who just know the bad things about the country you have to go and honestly look for the good things\nBecause\nDon't know about you but I'm both good and bad and my struggle every day is to be more good than bad to be a little better than I was yesterday and if I let myself go I'll be a bad guy well we've let our self go we're not trying to balance that anymore", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "17"}
