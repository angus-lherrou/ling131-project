you know that's pretty lonesome country here mountains in words you ain't seen anybody like that how are you\nOh no oh no not not at all I was just a technical question oh I see\nWell that'll be just dollar forty nine with the tax\nUm\nThen gradually pen ruin minus you when I had a good night's sleep and mark I didn't think about the mental next\nDay until he'll just outside Zanesville, Ohio I home again with bright sunshiny afternoon\nThe peaceful Ohio feels round was the autumn stumbling dreaming of the golden light and I was driving slowly drinking it in\nWhen the roads suddenly ended in a detour in front of the barrier he was standing\nWhen he explain about to go\nOn there was nothing sinister about him and he would just drive as much sense you know it was his attitude menacing really stood there\nWaiting almost ... little sheep overnight bag in his hand he looked as though he'd been waiting there for hours and he looked up he hailed me he started to walk forward\nOh\n\nNo not not just now sorry grown echo or\nA no no not today and the other way going to New York story\n[noise] after I got back in the car on the road again sort of\nPicking them up even having 'em sit beside me was somehow unbearable the same time I felt more than ever unspeakable alone [noise] hour after hour went by the fields the town's ticked off one by one the light changed\nThat I was going to see him again [noise] and do it right at the site I caught myself searching the side of waiting for him to appear\nYeah what are you sell sandwiches and poppy or don't ya yeah we do in the daytime uh were closed up one of the night I Know but I was wondering if you could possibly let me have a cup of coffee coffee oh not this time and I met during the season back I no no no no don't\nShut the door please listen just a minute ago just a minute ago there was a man standing here right behind the standard suspicious looking man I I don't mean to disturb you see I was driving along I just happened to look in there he was\nOh is he going well nothing you're going to take it and that's what you owe on your way we're like oh sure oh\nYeah [noise]\nI got into the car to get a little more slowly I was beginning to hate the car I could have found a place to stop the rest of the little I was in the Ozark Mountains in Missouri now view resort places there were closed only an occasional log cabin seemingly deserted that's all they broke the monotony of the wild would landscape I had\nSeen him at that roadside stand I knew I'd see them again maybe at the next turn of the road\nI knew that when I saw him next I Would run down [noise] but I didn't see him again\nI didn't see him until late next afternoon [noise] accept the cars sleepy little junction just across the border in Oklahoma to let a train passed by when he appeared across the tracks\nLeaning against a telephone pole [noise] perfectly airlift dry day the red clay of Oklahoma was picking on the south western son yet there were [noise] spots of fresh rain on his shoulders I couldn't stand that\n[noise] without thinking blindly I started the car on the tracks you need to look up [noise] staring at the ground I stepped on the gas hard gearing we'll sharply toward am I can hear the train the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we're back hope everybody enjoyed this week's actors Coney presentation of the Lucille Fletcher classic the huge hiker and now we're going to talk a little bit more about this particular play we're going to talk about hitchhikers and things like that city or do you want to start us off\nThanks cats um yeah I was very fascinated by a Lucille Fletcher the author because actually I had never heard of her before only in connection with um these radio than your I yeah and she wrote the hitchhike her and she\nAlso wrote a sorry Ron number which Orson Welles said was the greatest radio script ever written and and I think he probably correct um her style of writing is amazing\nAnd I think and and you and I read through the hitch anchor we were so impressed with the language and and and they in Detroit mission\nIn going earlier that feeling of dread that she managed to name in a pretty short\nRadio and you just get an audio on medium yeah\nAnd it's amazing what really\nI agree and um it also turns out that she remarried she\nBernard Herman probably one of the greatest Missouri for them\nOn the twentieth century it's an ongoing tomorrow yet\nHe was kind of a genius and you know and so often and\nOne of the electorate Mary\n[noise]\n\nAny way in which is interesting though that\nSo many great many\nYeah to me a lot of family radio ... machine\nIn the more interesting work for television and film\nSeriously I mean based on the strength of those yeah thing right there who knows what else you know and I just wanted to mention\nUm or the or the other place sorry Ron number on it was a performed originally it's almost one person that radio play and re performed by Agnes Morehead for radio forester spans\nAnd it was so popular they kept bringing it back and bringing it back and bring it back that's right and then Barbara Stanley ... who is one of my hand which said that you know of all time had amazing\nI'm a made the film version of it which is really stand right and I happen to know that the actress comedy is currently negotiating with Louis Lamont\nTo star in the creation of that famous radio Brad Garrett ... sorry Ron number that originally started acting more head\nNow that is a fascinating little nugget in my third one okay so if that happens that means we're going to be able to get to hear that their version of\nFattest Morehead her swelled grits we're going to want to use that so I'm very excited about well I'm excited about that too I Can't wait for that and just a couple\nOf words about Bernard Herman I guess any film saying no ah the named Bernard tournament he\nAnd won several Academy Award for scoring and most famously he works with Alfred Hitchcock psycho\nFor which she created in all strings soundtrack why don't you think about that film and the ... attention\nThat that those strings create movie it's pretty amazing he did north northwest the man who knew too much he did vertigo heated Citizen Kane the day the earth stood still andme anymore and his last film was taxi driver well\nAnd he he passed away shortly after that film was completed and she won the Academy Award for best film score posthumously\nAnd didn't you mentioned that he was rather young dish when\nDied at age sixty four which ... which radio Coleman area that's too bad but he also this is just a funny\nFor what she had which Mario ... that's too bad but he also this is just a funny little nugget ... he wrote the theme\nSong for has gotten will travel [laughter] which\nIs one of my favorite like western you can't call it a cowboy series get Leonard TV Western\nStarring fabulous Richard Boon yes wire pallet in San Francisco I'm and she wrote the theme song which I loan thing for you know I wrote down the\nRoad and I'm maybe on another you know I'm tempted the younger you do that but yeah well maybe we don't want another shallow maybe Kate an entire episode to all the songs we wanted to saying well yeah but we couldn't for maybe I should\nJust devoted to western [laughter] yes I Would regret anyway I Bernard Herman with an extraordinary a composer and snake collaborated on the hit tracker\nFantastically okay great segue because what I was gonna say next was uh just talk about how the inspiration for this particular\nA radio play came to be and the uh the whole what of it is is that ah Lucille Fletcher married Bernard Herman and shortly after their marriage Nineteen thirty nine they left New York for Hollywood\nHe was starting to work on the score of Orson Welles Citizen Kane they've traveled across the country many many times by air and by train but they're most memorable trip was in Nineteen forty where they decided to drive their Packer convertible across the country now\nFletcher on the way out from New York saw quote an odd looking man on the Brooklyn Bridge and then on the Polanski skyway\nThey never saw him again however didn't quite know what to do with the idea until a year later they can see the idea of doing it as a ghost story so\nI think it's fascinating that they it was based on a similar unreal incident or the inspiration for came came from a real incentive I think that's very cool because it certainly back then before the interstates came around you know driving across country was\n... it would be I think it would be cool and it would be fun but it would be you know it'd be a little scary there would be an element of danger there as well\nThat's right and it took a long time yeah I say in the script eight days of dry that yeah it wasn't like\nA yeah they're they're the ... the interstate system which really began around that time or they're they're they're worried a whole lot of roads that you could count on absolutely be safe and speedy and yeah you know done anyway that's right\nI'm going to add one more little nugget that's very interesting about ... seal Fletcher she also was inspired by real life incident\nWhen she wrote sorry wrong number really yes\nAnd um the I ... she now even though it it that we can we could save it for 'em\nSay now will say it again later\nWe'll do that um she was standing in line in the grocery store in on the Upper East side of Manhattan\nAnd her daughter was sick and she was buying special food for her and this very well dressed woman who lives in front of her would not let her cutting line\nEven um she asked if she could because her daughter was home alone and she was ill right so Lucille said that she wrote sorry wrong number ... play\nOn that NASA nice ... on a ladder cut\nThat's interesting many great creative endeavors have happened because of things like that I was just talking about something like that the other day\nI'm the only oh that's fantastic and I I uh man I really hope that that whole thing with the actors colony works out they're able to do that particular uh production so do I yeah the last thing I Will say about the whole uh uh Fletcher a Bernard Herman thing and the inspiration for this story is that\nUh I think I saw one of the cool things about it was um\nShe said in an interview in Nineteen eighty eight quote we really share\nThat story together he was very interested in that story so he had to write the music for it and I just think it was great that they were both in the car so they both had a very personal vested connection to this uh this particular incident and and I think it just made it better yeah you know like exactly okay so moving right along\nMarley
