I Believe as you know cause you participate in some of these project a process season the the chief could could write each hearing could probably ask you to analyze for ya\nUh but they are more everyday enforcement rather than some some times a day and then making it easier just to identify the vehicles that are part ... part if that's easier than\nThan the existing system have talking tires and and the writing the tickets that can be made easier by streamlining lowering the time that you have to dedicate to doing that uh that's what it means by efficiency and that was kind of each one was kind of looked at with that guy on and\n\nI'm so is it your visit if I'm your hypothesis that charging for parking will create will improve capacity\n\nIt does almost three things at a bite discouraging\nParking dancer and taking another mode again we're very good with our most split on this island you know so the six percent drive alone they drive down town trying to get down to sixty percent one of the fundamental tools to do that is creating parking management creating a financial disincentive some people will do the economics in their mind saying I really don't want to have to pay for parking and I wanted to go purchase a permit\nAnd what kind of data on that as their ... at what level it becomes price sensitive parking\nHonestly that's something that you measure overtime by implementing if something here we've had something for as as much as five dollars per hour beat beat the price point\nFor a lot of people it's going to vary in this community we have a a wide range of incomes that in the summertime and his island so it's it's very different I think the point is is that we do want to charge for it so that it's not free and as acceptable\nAccessible right or a\nBy creating a deterrent to parking downtown you do indirectly create more capacity by charging per hour or to keep the time restrictions you do encourage the turnover of the space as he can do that by a price or he can do it by the time restriction up so\nThat's what we're we're at like ... cents at creating capacity is you're decreasing demand and that's what this is the demand management program\nAnd you set the price to try to end fifty percent\nOpen spaces you might not hit it perfectly in the beginning we were to go forward as we learn over time you were talking about this places like Salem that are fifty cents an hour of the dollar per hour ... in their consult are saying you could go to too and it can improve this disease but they're just they're taking a while to get there\nYeah I can find that price point will take time I think the goal here is to have Fifteen Percent of the spaces available to the public that she could go a if you can do that with fifty cents an hour a day and mission accomplished if he can do it with five dollars if it takes five dollars an hour or that would be a mission accomplished\nAt the point is we find something that's acceptable to most of the community and that it's considered quote unquote fair\nTo the board understands that we can set this the first hour can be free for thirty minutes can be free verse to ours could be three hours before there's a lot of different ways of doing this that can solve a lot of the how do I go to the post office outweigh those type of concerns for people who go in quickly\nAnd again just to reiterate the schedule and then again conform so there's CGI planning go\nThe word group will provide a recommendation by the end of this calendar year the uh the structure of managing will be provided by march or at least that's the the idea or the the target here so I don't believe in Iraq action is being requested for tonight other than the update but know that it will be some time in the near future\nWe started to look at which to pick I I knocked out any that don't meet parking availability goal you know I look at a down on the way I look at this\nMeet parking availability all the way I look at a down on the way I look at this chart and why would you do something if it isn't going to meet the goal of ... of increasing barking\nThe other thing just you know traditionally what happens is businesses are against us and a lot of places and then once it's implemented they realize it's actually you know people are against it and then you do it and you grab you take them kicking and screaming in two years later they say it's the best thing that ever happened\nNow that's interesting you say that because I asked the consultant Jason I said\nYou know how to businesses react to this question he said they all are are gifted or first and after a year or two they see that either doesn't hurt them what helps them and I said how many communities he's been doing it for Twenty years does it happen that way he said a hundred percent right\nAnd and um and bring it up 'cause we have to you know as as the ones making the decisions we have ... have read enough about it about it and understand that some of the pushback was going to get his normal push back and you know there's been tons of studies in tons of you know tons of work on this and you know we have to have the\nSort of the gumption to do it as as how I look at it\nTo do the right thing is hard sometimes [noise]\nWhat what they wanted to know that we had two different workers going we have one with\nA a jeep Pitman and myself and like burns couple others\nDown in ministry Schumer meeting on this and then we also have a strategic goal one so we're going to combine those and make it the ... instead of to run it may come by to make one no that's the only thing I Do for efficiency here they might than you guys came out of your meetings absolutely I mean I\nJust ah you know it seems like a pretty aggressive time line and you're talking about implementation when\nYou're changing goal is by twenty twenty to have a lot about\nThis including one of these technologies and whatever when do when do you\n\nWhat what was the deadline they're you're asking about I'm Sorry twenty twenty twenty and try to mount ... trial something in nine okay okay\nOkay yeah and my only other comment is I think the neighbors neighborhoods have to has to be a little more mention of it's sort of figure out how to get the neighborhoods mhm yeah so they just don't become\nSpillover barking and that's one of our goals is to be able to figure out how to you know fairly distribute the parking permits in those neighborhoods and so it doesn't become a name those people need they need a you know they need to have some consideration throughout this process\nThat was in American history\nOr just a basic try to give us a call ... kept calm or update we ... we did a IT an airport and ah airport was pretty much smaller than than usual there they kept the big FAA projects off but two of them went to tell me that they get voted on\n'em and then there was I. T. I. T. or one of their line items was to run and fiber to the deeper W facilities there are so many issues out there\nAnd then an out years to solve they were running fiber to a lot of different other town buildings and so I asked if they would add that in a flight twenty\nAnd try to get it all together maybe this five ten percent efficiency as it was that one or the um and then we also found out that I'm from ... or ... or ... that you're going to upgrade the downloading uploading speed for the entire for all of town government\nAnd it's um the school did it a long time ago or a little behind and it's not a lot of money for a huge upgrade and I'm getting things done faster so I thought that was good that we're getting better tools to our staff to get the job done we're asking do\nAnd then the last thing is a gym and on and I rode the bus here um and you know TV was there\nTo just I'm kind of promote you round transportation and found it interesting to three or four people we talked to ... you know we're sort of like oh are you are you writing all year do you like this uh they said look at one guy said oh I asked if you had no you around us what would you do so do I would I Would have a car I Would go buy a car\nAnd I I look to the gym and I thought\nGee there's just a can be the only one that is so happy and you're out transportation that one of the ideas is that there are some people who will not\nBy a car right and there was one or two other people that use it they love it they're excited at its here and I was just on one arrive fate and the gym you had to really um interesting comment to the gym about cost avoidance of ... made a lot of sense as I write\n\nKnow the cost of ordinance up having a year round transportation it was about uh\nIf you can avoid having a car um that would be money that you could spend on housing 'em and that sort of it so it's a way for you know it's an investment in that we can make in the community to\nUh to um avoid cost him apart individualistic the gentleman you talked about [noise]\nSo that's all I have anything else who air 'cause your phone\nAnything else [laughter]\nAnd it's only the males who your your ... names [laughter] motion to join it seems like most new germs oldest\nI bet you all [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nW.
