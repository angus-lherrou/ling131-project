you know at least get ready if it's pretty clear that there is the first\nThree four and five were also by law amendments all of them are related to marijuana so the marijuana consumption um that was the public consumption by law there was a bit of an amendment to that that goes up\nTo the age gee we get it approved coordinate with general code to get ... get the town code updated and then I'm going to need to coordinate with the political depart\nThe political departments for some kind of an implementation plan or\nEducation about how we're going to\nProceed with that the licensing is something that again\nI'm [noise] I've got a couple of aspects here [noise]\nWe need to get the licensing process in place and that is going to take a little bit of time because we don't need to develop regulations and again a lot of towns are doing this right now I'm there are some that have finalized ... recommend a regulations many more are in the process\nOf that and that's going to require some input from a variety of departments but that's something that would be a follow up\nTo be what one such a will that will will Amy Baxter and watch the department types of charges like liquor review it and have oversight\nUm yes with regard to the issuance of the actual license once it's like you know renewed by you all and you only know or however many years we decide to license is good for\nWhat is our question them up or maybe it just goes back to the floor term but I heard someone say in one of the um ... or or accused there's language and that says\nYou know I hereby agreed all the regulations poured into this the townhouse along those lines right [noise] 'cause they're not thinking well if that's true we're going to need to develop this regulation right and so we developed a criteria and we didn't so I think that this we ...\nI I think that's going to delay the process of guy so I think we can achieve the same result by um\nBy a drafting the form of the of the\nHost community agreement which would have all those requirements in their anyhow and that they would we would attach that to the to the rescue and we would require anyone who\nSays they ... they take no exception to any of the provisions they would be rated much what they would be rated very high we can all the regulations can follow later the key is to have in the ... to what the expectations are\nAnd that that those expectations will be in the agency eight and the regulations to follow which could have additional\nTo rescue member abide by regulations they haven't see no we're going to ask them\nTo abide by the terms of the draft host community agreement that's attached to the you are if you\nHave has enough and you will abide by all the regulations well they were that will were you there will be developed yeah okay right well regulations regulations they could have been put into how they drafted or public comment but that's what they're going to us on camera that's kind of work flow chart helpful for the issues like that there's\nWe were discussing today there's a lot of chicken egg type things with this whole situation\nIn the other the other point I think what we're being warned against\nOur things like charging extra money because that's a hot topic up in Boston on this entire issue some of the other things that we're talking about are ... are going to run be under the radar a little more\nBut if you know if it's a money issue there you know they're arguing about that on a weekly basis some of the other things we're talking about probably won't be as you know as much of a flashpoint\nMhm [noise] particle five with our limitation and that just get sent to the ... office six and seven um\nAnd actually several other articles as you know we cannot act on because we did not have a quorum\nSix and seven specifically\nAre dead exclusions which are are which require a ballad vote debt exclusions require a ballot vote and it how many voters does not matter which order that isn't and they already as you know were put on to the state ballot so that vote can proceed and then if the board is so inclined\nWhich I anticipate you would be we would put those articles on to the end he won't tell me\nI never was around him before and what happened at the ballot yesterday has happened before we clear oh I don't know about you're talking about mental electric or some you know I don't you take an electric now talk of the electorate\nOh sorry [laughter]\nSo I probably I I don't I don't\nKnow but I did I was asked by on Libyan Greg to draft up a um\nPublic statement OK to explain to the electorate okay what the process is and I actually did that this afternoon I doubt Libya has had a chance to look at it but\nMy thought would be that if you could um announce it at your next couple of select ... meetings you can put it on the website you you can um you know you could write a letter to the editor or you just can't spend town funds\nFrom I'm providing that kind of information on a pending ballot question so you couldn't send out and mail it to everybody for example um but you could in public forums the website here you could explain that to the voters\nNow we can explain it in any newsletter 'cause we're working on that right now\nBecause he does that news let it get Senate you have to subscribe to it\nDo you spend town funds sending it up\nOr it's just it's labor okay well we'll talk we'll talk anyway well I'm back to what Jim just asked had this ever happened for what I don't really recall that we didn't have a quorum\nBefore to act on the financial article\nI remember we had to call people up all night to have to call people and ask them to hurry up and get there yeah but I don't think I don't remember that [noise] you know it's close from yeah this one was talked about maybe doing something for a ... hour the\nCrime requirement yes I'll get to that in in a second I'm so\nSo these appropriations I Would anticipate continue on the ballot and then get put back on the next required vote which is where the twenty Nineteen and he'll tell me\n\nArticulate was inappropriate for the new sewer force main design we're having some internal discussions right now as to whether or not we\nCan somehow use it existing funds to at least\nSomehow scrape together um something of a solid number for ... for the construction of the new sewer force made\nAt the annual tell me without being too unrealistic about it\nMore ... more on that later ah ten was not was no action anyway the supplemental preparation for the town here eleven and twelve or the airport um appropriations no could not take action on those and\nI'm I'm here I he was kind of expressing concern at it\nUm you know I he was kind of expressing concern at a department head meeting earlier this week as to those projects but I guess I'll work it out there was a big issue I think it'll get worked out [noise]\nThirteen um I think was a transfer article which actually was able to be handled at the town meeting fourteen and Fifteen could not be handled sixteen was hit by a woman on the St Louis plastics\nThat will proceed to be sent to the attorney general's office and I'm In a weight on whether or not that's approved and we're going to need to spend that amount of time developing a program for a moment Haitian on that [noise] special town meeting to\n'em by law that with which had the three articles that first was hit by a lot of them and about the coastal properties that against sent to the town I'm to the attorney general by the town cleric and I don't think there's too much fellow\nAt least at this point necessary on that article to designing Matt change did not pass into action needed they're\nGoing through with the ... um regarding they\nImagine that chapter of convenience of town property which had to do with the installation of private tours in public ways and that did pass however town council has developed a memo that was sent to all of you about that with some concerns as to whether or not that will pass the attorney general\nDo you want to speak to that for the public so they're aware of it certainly\n[noise]\n\nSo we all read the petitioned article it was on the warrant ended a centrally provided that I'm a town board could not grant approval for a private party to enter on town property for the purpose of installing\nMaintaining our operating a sewer\nThat town meeting remain motion was revised um and the word installing was taking taking out\nSo that when it ... ... has passed by town meeting it requires town meeting approval\nFor a boy to grant permission for someone to\nSpeed up town meeting would be nice [noise] yeah please [noise] I was hoping you were going to speak on this I'm\nSarah outer I actually went to east him inside town meeting\nCouple of years ago and talk to their vendor it works really well\nUm it costs about thirty thousand dollars a night\nUm we talk to them about coming here we wouldn't have to change at that point anyway may have changed since then but at that time we would have had to change when we had our town meeting\nThe sand because they already have towns lined up for this particular times\nAnd said they were trying to push us further into the spring or further back into the winter um neither one of which anyone was all that excited about I'm doing it is a little bit more expensive to bring them here because we also have to put them up\nUm but it does work really well and I sat through the meaning in it and went very smoothly\nThe meeting and mediate way after that um that we had here we didn't have one hand count\nAnd ... then points about too much faster than the than the voting by\nClicker really yeah but the voting clicker yeah because you say there is a thing where you say everyone be prepared to vote\nVoting now and it's thirty second a lot of people are voting tallies that it shows up then you announced about that it's a little slower than a voice phone but it's a lot\nFaster and a lot more accurate than they can click you know the person coming around clicking and it certainly faster than if we ever had to do a paper ballot\nSalary I I\nJust from my own personal health would love to do a meeting with crackers and see how it goes\nUm but I don't think that's the reason to do it just because I think it would be to try it [laughter]\nIs it is it propriety equipment or there's a today on it or is it you can\nBuy it but it becomes it's expensive to buy and then it becomes obsolete very quickly so there is a dentist and there's a whole\nThey have a whole bank\nOf computers that they're running you know probably ten servers running the whole time and they've got people checking that things and they don't always work so people are always coming up and\nAnd there's a little bit of can force men stuff like you have to make sure that people aren't coming in getting a quicker than handing it to their labor and\nGoing home so that you have someone up in the back you know when the bank 'cause you know having like\nA ... so we can guess who that might be but [laughter]\nWell [laughter] so I mean it's definitely intriguing\nThat might be but [laughter] well [laughter]\nSo I mean it's definitely intriguing and if you're interested in you know going to one of these meetings and seeing how it works um\nWhere they would actually come here and do a demonstration if we wanted it\nThat makes sense\nYeah anyway I'm I'm very open to trying to doing anything I think would make sense so\n\nAll of you to talk\nThe sudden on the ... on the town meeting\n\nThere is there is yet another way to to put the ... which I which I haven't seen here in between the years I've been on the island and nobody likes it but it does work very well and I'd just like you do not have it in the back of your mind to know that it's possible it's called division of a house\nEverybody says yes stands up goes over there and everybody who says no stands up and goes over there oh it's very effective that's a big nuisance 'cause everybody's got to move and nobody likes it and I just wanted to know that method exists in this little ... illegal\n... house [noise] I say it is interesting [laughter]\nYes I just wanted to does a speech to article ... um I think everyone's aware that we did not have a quorum or some of the articles um the special commenting what\nIt was nearly three to one vote in the room to to move this forward to prove it and I just had one request that I'm One of the select for um prepare for this to son to the attorney general that um\nThat you put in a request that the gentleman that wrote this uh ... be consulted and are able to answer questions with the attorney general's office\nTo clarify in terms of the article\nI request was made I don't know that process but I'm sure they'll\nSee his name I'm somewhere along the line\nAnd anybody can\nAnybody can can send an email or a memo or a letter to the attorney general on any article and that will be taken into consideration in my experience\nThrough you might want to ask them to do that that's I I wouldn't I Would say however that\nThe attorney general's review\nIs quite limited it's whether the Bible or is consistent with state law or not not whether it was a good idea not whether\nThe intent\nDiffered from what was voted the standard is is it consistent with state law\nBut nothing to do is what town code or sewer commissioner and just just state law\nWell\nState law includes the Nantucket sewer act okay so it you know it has to be consistent with the special acted govern sewers in my email address all of those issues\nThat okay I I understand that anyone can send a letter in the mail and I asked but I'm just pleased passing of the board request that\nBall threats us be able to work with or answer questions for uh the attorney general's office\nWhen looking at this\nGuy like it like\nAny other comments on the subject line and we'll be bored [noise]\n\nThree it can be anything for especially tell me [noise]\nSo my takeaways is how to get more people here who trucks clicker and more bingo sorry Megan\nMegan Perry um I just kind of wanted to follow up on our country and I'm I'm hoping that you guys will see that the voters are very disappointed in what they want it and I'm hoping that you guys will help support sending article straight to the attorney general\nIn any way in any capacity that you can um\nI think it's going to attorney general regardless whether it's harder to get it yeah\nYeah thank you I I Would do this I I'm Sorry I have to speak I I ... I think I understand the intent of it but and and I didn't vote for or against it because I had a feeling we were going to be in this quagmire when I read it and read it was the first time in the third time and then when it was changed but I have a feeling\n[noise] I I think we could spend a lot of time or we could waste a lot of time trying to get this to pass and try to do something that\n... that I think you guys intend\nBut it may not be the most effective way I think that what might be more effective is taking direct action torn zoning and other issues at the regular channel meaning\nAnd so and that doesn't require in a special legislation or you know all this kind of thing that's a two thirds voted down meeting for some of the you know could directly do I think\nMore quickly and efficiently what I feel like you're trying to do here\nSo that's you know that that's and I and I'm In favor of what you're trying to do so you know that's you know this is coming from someone who I think is supportive but I'm not necessarily supportive of this mechanism to achieve the rubble\nAnd I definitely respect your opinion on that and ... and the positive emotion partners any general\nActually\nThere's nothing else town managers report\n[noise]\nSo I thought I Would just review with you some upcoming agenda items and obviously there's been a little bit of change I'm from tonight so on October twenty fourth we have next week we have got public hearings\nThe big item next week is the review of the strategic planning framework within that group and that I think we want that to be our focus in next week's meeting but we do have some other items on the agenda as well if you want it um\nI don't know if you want to move them out or not but\nWe do have some already scheduled real estate matters\nThe border recently asked for not being paid parking pilot program for twenty Nineteen and we combine that with the transportation plan are coming in and revealing the design for the pending three round about projects\nAnd the traffic safety committee recently is I came up with some loading zone modification recommendations or I think there are four of them\nAnd say I'd rather find a way to get more voters that and if it's for the trucks tax whatever it takes a find even mentioned signs or wouldn't signs at the at the rotary things like\nThat yes my idea was the you know the football sign that you see the the film I Love that it's like oh it's once it's friday is a game tonight at five and I tried to get to it that really helps the why can't we have a sign very similar that's wouldn't and everybody loves high school kids can make it if you W can make it whoever\nThe says town meeting Monday Night six it's at the rotary you know something very simple just remind us where we got a big round the side that we put up the rotary about scurry closures and you know we could put put that up so early digital yeah I wouldn't want yeah\n[laughter]\nReally touching something a little more in a wooden\nAnd yeah\nWe we've talked about this tax dollar thing and we we are we are working on that we have been working on it I I personally have my doubts as to whether or not people really why shouldn't other thing that attacks but we did more public outreach for this town meeting than probably any town meeting we've ... we want to stop and shop we had\nUm twenty was putting out constant Instagram Stories and Twitter posts and\nUm ... we had a new wedding ... newsletters we talked about a here we went to a bunch of groups\nWas what was the most outreach we've ever done since I've\nBeen involved in my house and on the issue mhm unless you think it's going to directly I don't show up\nIts unless your pocket book is impacted you you weren't there that's the ... unfortunately that's what are\nYou know our island has kind of turn it into 'cause everybody's pocket but will be affected but it will be but but it's well it's not even getting an extra lot or are you getting raises for the next three months you know three years you know people show up for those things and they bring their whole neighborhood and they you know but there's something like this where I'm going on yeah I I I'm more\nPeople would show up to talk about [noise] I thought they each of us are going to be a pack I thought it was from the ... the second one\nI thought the uh the gymnasium was going to be packed with people\nI was where do you have enough room and I it was the exact opposite [noise]\nI just wanted to put one of my plan I Know we did a lot of outrage and I I Do think they stop and shop is great but I think it's possible to miss some of the social media not stop and shop and I will say I forgot it with my rent ... day and as an anniversary that I remember attend meetings I think it's possible to\nHave so many things going on that attacks I think even now you say people don't read enough anymore they barely\nLook a lot of people don't they stuck I don't but I'm techs I one of the best way to get people out for anything\nThat isn't the only comment he said\nThey said that text that ten minutes to get people to sign up for the ducks and we don't get any I Can't let\nThat idea of sucking harder yeah\nThank you for saying the text or it will be up this Friday to sign up\nFor all kinds of different excellent [noise]\n\nYes saying thank you for mentioning that said there are you know different ways to get the text out and we don't want any well people do I guess like to get taxed about things they don't like to get hundreds of tax about things and every single time is a town they they don't want to text about it\nWe just maybe you know careful about what things were texting out their town meetings probably an important thing to text at an election is probably a good thing but\nThe the option so if you're in yet if you're in a lot of planning board you'd attacks were plenty more likely than opt in or you often to like I I get sex now with impunity Sikhs I forget when they\nYou know just you know I'm\nPacking goes out I get a tax like oh yeah that's this coming Monday and I check it out for themselves to be better right\nKinda clarify one thing that might make me feel better you forgot your own anniversary\nIt was a close call came quickly I Hope she'll is watching [laughter]\nWatching that happens to other people look at that mine's coming up and I get in big trouble almost every year\nIt's a ... I have one meeting this week MTV Eighteen you mostly talked about the Comcast new coming up [noise] uh but they're just as a reminder they have a new building that they purchase and it is on high ground and it'll get flooded all the time\nAnd it's about a thousand dollars more than ... from what they were paying\nAnd they own they own the building and um things are still looking good\nCash in the bank but the next big thing is for this this renewal right because what Congress is doing we three percent that we all pay is only on the TV part in that there's less and less people using TV writers using Netflix Hulu or whatever\nIn other ways and so we're really asking probably four four or five percent on that fee and capital improvements for some of their building to increase of the programming for the kids I'm really\nWhat I'm trying to bring to the board has really pushed the programs\nI'm really\nWhat I'm trying to bring to the board is really push the programs for the kids to get somebody or an opportunity to be interested in camera work editing you don't think the actual doesn't offer so the\nCBC team can supplement\nSoldiers community but we're having a kid where you're coming to walk us through all this week five months to figure this contract out Comcast before it's out of our ... it'll come to the sport it's out of our hands and that's a warrior in contrast\nTo go see that that's all I\nDid your second call I think you for your\nComedy I named the performing here and my main station\n\n\n\nEighty nine point five W.
