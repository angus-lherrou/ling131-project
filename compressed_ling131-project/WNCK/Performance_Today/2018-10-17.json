conversation the other day this\nIs ... ... email today any lessons email gains I'm a vegan suggestion about when the ... would come into play she gave the I think it was a good time frame and timeline of events\nThe lowly should clearly discussed that I I think what the ... going to be is um from what I've been thinking about a little bit more and trying to keep in mind or interest than really promoting local\nSo what's your take the the criteria comes before the AC days I think that was one point yes yeah\nAnd one question that I had was where does the licensing come into play 'em at the very end of the of the process that we passed an article for\nOn last Wednesday in the licensing as more of a base of regulation that we look at annually like we do liquor licenses right today they do and they said they were supposed to do you have to put it in a um [noise]\nUh penalties should dreamed up says there are places that do help regulate okay thank you [noise]\nTo them before [noise]\nBut based on the direction of that was provided by attorney walkman today in the memo I I just wanted to outline for the board the way we see the timeline of the process so the first thing the the board would do is\nDevelop or or an are rescue a request for qualifications and in that document you would include\nThe criteria\nEither minimum criteria\nAnd um comparative evaluation criteria and the board would apply that criteria when when deciding\nWith whom to execute a host community agreements so the first step would be the are if you once you got the proposals you could certainly interview the um [noise] the the respond inch on and then in all of this could be done by a\nReview committee on a rather than having the boy take the time to do that because the ultimate recommendation\nA rather than having that boy take the time to do that because the ultimate recommendation of course would come to the to the select Boyd um but uh\nYou would interview those candidates and then you would evaluate them based upon the criteria that you've already established in the yard of cue okay um and then you would execute\nThe host community agreement with those entities that satisfy that criteria keeping in mind that you have now a limit on the number of uh don't use recreational establishments that you can bet you can happier in and took it and it's essentially to\nOkay um the next step is really um and this varies a little bit depending upon where they\nThey are at the licensing process but if if we were starting from scratch the next step would be they would proceed with their state license and bearing in mind that they have to have a science host community agreement which was the first step on before they can they're eligible for consideration\nOnce that provisional licenses issued and has Katie explained in her memo that really is going to have a great amount of detail\nAs to the project and the conditions and so forth\nAnd so once they have their provisional license it would really come back then to the question of local\nUm zoning approvals\nAnd um we know that a town meeting last week um there were some substantial on revisions to the zoning by law uh\nConcerning where these um facilities can be located in what districts in one of the performance standards um and so that would they would have to satisfy those requirements including any zoning approvals that are needed\nUm and then um after that is completed\nYou then would be at the point where the board would be issuing a license a local license which is authorized for adult use\nMarijuana establishment is you have a Bible which will be presumably be approved by the attorney general which allows that the um the boy to establish a licensing scheme\nAnd you know we would be assisting you it in the development of those regulations but his Jason indicated those are really going to be the requirements that any establishment will have to meet in order to uh maintain\nLike a liquor license on the safety issues for one year they would be renewable but there would be an opportunity for the for the boy to ensure that they are complying with all the requirements of of the regulations and the host community agreement so that would essentially be the process that we would recommend you follow\n... once they have the eight CIA then as long as they get to the state process and our local um zoning board I are planning a view that we wouldn't have any grounds for denying license they essentially would well if you're limited to two\nSo ed waves ingesting it in a situation where we put out an or ask you for we had three respondents we can negotiate age ca is with all of them if they pass our criteria\nOr do you put out an ice cube for two\nAnd also you have\nYou have an adult use marijuana was establishment that you've already executed host community agreement for\nSo you essentially have another one I Would what we would recommend is you use this opportunity are a few um opportunity to decide who's going to get that second license or I should say that second H. C. A.\nL. I'm try again with my question has I guess what I'm asking is if we put out and I ask you only got four respondents we put them through our criteria we select one to negotiate an age ca last yet at that point as long as they get to the state process in any local permitting process\nThan the next the final stages license at which point than the ones we have a CIA it's almost a guarantee\nHits it's more ministerial that I ... that's how I Would describe it that the local license would be more ministerial at that point okay but\nThe reason why you want that licenses so that you can hold them to get to their obligations under the age see eight and your licence requirements so that for example I've just give you an example you may want to consider in your regulations that these facilities bus remain open you asked\nUm so if if they get through the whole process and you wish you the license and they close within nine months um or they or they're not willing to continue to operate year round then that might be a ground not to renew license [noise]\nDid you think should send you regulations John as you say that should be in the criteria that should be as a license level you negotiate that or I think it should be in both of them I Would recommend it being the H ca but it should also be in the regulations\nAnd spend the regulations are going to give you the real cheat in terms of enforcement\nAnd it was very helpful thank you for John though\nI just started making a lot nicer sure yeah things that I mean I I support the idea of an arrest you I think that's enough than process that goes around um\nThe some of the things that I've been about is that um it said the ... medical and recreational\nLocal control would be favorable local men knock on members of the corporation um\nMay I ask a question this might be getting to detail but are you speaking about minimum criteria\nRight now okay minimum ... here for\nI guess the local control it'd be advantageous or I mean I'm ... I'm\nControl as a ... other property\nUm some criteria\nPotentially to review location proximity to others establishment on financial stability best\nAnd growing testing and packaging that security plan open year round\nRecognition that the contents are a father I could not be sold that is on if it's not so that's all they would have to come back and renegotiate I knew I sense\nThat if I had so far with the non transferable or they wouldn't really be in the criteria that'd be something that I think it should be recognized at all levels that are not a market that were that were interested in her mouth that's awesome market for the value of life and just the thought um sometimes\nAnd probably in this and are asking is you have the kind of a preamble and if assuming that and I probably in our licensing regulations we would say that license is there not transferable we could we could mention it there\nYou've gotten your age and I think that's the problem with the new railing any life is that there are violations what does that really made it out and said after that level of investment how do we really going to not ... but\nThat part of it as as you know there's ten percent twenty percent coming from a cooperative if someone to buy it I feel like a a business could adjust that individuals\nAre just going to comment about that wouldn't it be very similar to liquor licenses people could very well invest that same type of money in in establishing the liquor licensing if they had\nCertain types of violations the board can revoke their license that'd be two hearings subject to all of that stuff and then it would probably go to any appeal to the candidates control commission or some group they set up to hear appeals of license replication\nBut he would have to be pretty bad\nAnd that that's my point is that what you would have to be pretty a really bad ... yeah because they take into decay proportionality into\nInto fact when you when you're going through something like that they look at what is it really costs like when someone does something wrong in the building apartment they do something wrong with that I was you know you'd think that we put a stop work on it they just keep work as fast as they can because the more they can build wrong the less likely it is the government's going to overturn it later\nSo I think the same sort of thing here you put so much in that you really want to make sure that you you\nKnow it would have to be very egregious\nUntil suddenly matching wet foot if they've got thirty conditions in the agency a first year you've violating two\nSecond area of violating the same thing like it would be a cumulative and if you're three is still in violation of ... like I don't see it I Can't imagine doing that that you're close this yeah but it would be cumulative\nAfter his [noise] yeah ...\nIs there any other criteria that we'd people out on the list and good luck to incorporate some of the frontier that some councils email which is one like on me here in terms of the\nExpectations of a sort of established review criteria to say Africa to have an agency a Disney up could have written policies and procedures a\nPlan a place to prevent diversion\nThose are so we're we're going to incorporate all of this yes I think so if\n\nAnything else from the board going to go to the public can see that many um\nWe uh comments on criteria to be helpful to for a next time just to have a list of the criteria so we can do whatever work on these things so we can kind of\nYou know given the blacks if there is some of the things we've picked up between now and then whenever we discussed with again yeah ideally I'd like to see a a draft of the criteria slash are a few\nUm connected with the host community agreement if you need to make any changes we can and then try to ratify finalize that future\nFuture muted\nYou know comments where we go to the the public on criteria\nJust a going more to anybody can after but I think I think we like I think we want to move relatively quickly I think we have a couple of people now one that I Would say Ninety percent through the process one that's\nYou know fifty percent are Seventy five whatever through the flooding to not quite as far through I think we should move relatively quickly I think uh you know if Greenland he's going to be open next summer you know ... we might be remiss if we didn't have someone else\nBecause of the impact will out if we don't get them both going uh but I Will say I mean that's the\nYou know what we're going to see what happens with that\nAnd the other part I worry about when we try to do criteria and we score them I think there's I think it ... I I like to Salem sort of had a you know a general thing because sometimes is one aspect that that you feel very strongly about and and if you get a good are\nYou ... you know a good attorney or a good grant writer they're going to answer it the way that gives them the highest score all of them were going to try to do that but if you have a you know something that you know very strongly feel very strongly about you should be able to score that properly you know and so sometimes the criteria sometimes trying to be exact\nDoesn't work you know and I'll use just to\nUse the ... as an example we had the criteria and the Japanese but the group that did the criteria didn't\nYou know take into account how much money the giants of jet is going to say can ... Marshall was going to give more money than the group that went in the group that went in has done a great job and it's been fine but the group\nDidn't do it and Marshall was gone and so in especially those so I thought I feel like those criteria failed I feel like that was a failure because part of it was it looked out properly by the people doing it which was us\nSo I in a so anyway I think like that we don't want to be in a situation with this what we're doing the same sort of thing if we kind of the group looks at it it knows he has the right way they should be able to go to the right way\nBut that's why we need to take the time to do the criteria\nYou should be able to go to the right way but that's why we need to take the time to do the criteria 'cause what you talked about wasn't in the criteria\nFor that\nSort of the rent and won the rent was around now it doesn't well you know I don't think that financial and running\nAlready very few they all this other\nYeah but the financial ... no but you you don't open it but then the\nBut the but you're supposed to give it to the high better you know if a base of the criteria similar it's was well now that well I misunderstood that them because I thought you know one of you and not be so well and and this is my point about\nThe criteria here we are on a different issue where we thought we were clear in it and it it wasn't sometimes I give it away the high bitter and sons or give it away the people and better criteria\nSo I just think we have to be in a way to figure this out\nIt just it depends on which pick him up process you using the Internet the specifically allows you to choose to propose are based on the evaluation criteria he did run by anything you'd think the lowest motions sponsored responsible better than they were\nVery specifically is the ... the process and the Japanese example and this is an ice cube passage which is it lightly different from both enough [noise]\nSo the earth due process that you're talking about here is very similar to\nDesigners selection when you had someone when you hire someone to design this building um you you don't consider that prices not a consideration you negotiate that afterwards but you're already skew lists criteria and you evaluate you rank the\nThe proposals proposals based upon who best meet your criteria so they can and not in an Iraqi Jew is not just developing the criteria but is articulating the reasons why you rated you know\nProposal number three as the most advantageous to the town and so there's some work that goes into that at the end of the process developing a written explanation as to the basis of Pine Ridge you decided that proposal\nWas the most advantageous you're going to do a similar process here\nI just think for me I mean it's a cause that whole um you know the judge things was it was\nKind of complex it wasn't something I've been through before and I was just a as a bystander on the board um\nSo I I don't know if there's some material we can live or you can give me to give us to a an understood it I just I Know I was a participated in one of the openings and beds and\nUm you know ... a woman them you know they were a couple of ten minutes late so they they their bed was thrown out so uh and I don't know if we can have some flexibility in those things you can so so the ... I Know that's a that was a bit and not a cue so\nThe problem with the Japanese are recipe is that the way you had to conduct that evaluation was very strictly regulated entities after thirty the\nAnd and you know Don his correct what happens is you open the non Christ proposals and you evaluate each of the proposals based upon whether they're highly advantageous advantageous or not advantageous and you give specific standards to make that determination\nOnce you finish that evaluation and everyone is given a composite rating then and only then do you open up the price proposals in thirty be says that you can then award\nNot necessarily to in that case the highest bidder but you can award to the proposal that isn't the best interests of the town taking into consideration the evaluation criteria and the price here you're not going to be doing it on price\nIs going to be strictly qualifications and that's why it's just our cue and not an RSP and because it's not required by law on\nTo go through any kind of a particular process you have a great deal of discretion in determining how you're going to conduct the evaluation you just can't be arbitrary as a general proposition\nIn on this more but I'm the money in the in the public like to talk about this David and if you are associated in any way with one of the applicants please let us know after you state your name my name's David Martin and I guess the only\nThing that I've got going on is the green lady people offered to buy me a beer after meeting that's the only conflicts that I have other than that basically what I Do is I'm a can of his consultant I help people get through\nSince his arrest today\nUm artist or a few process is not sure we talk about the ... and how long this will take a lot of time and time\nYou know with all due to do is back to what people are saying about let's hurry up and get this done there is a lot to it we are if I'm going to attach regulations to the rescue for example does have to be developed and there I\nI get that people want to hurry up and start you know no opening and there's lots of reasons for that\nI Want to hurry up and start you know no opening and there's lots of reasons for that\nThis is very new to us and many of\nThe other towns that are going through it and we are trying to get information from them a lot of them don't have it a lot of them are having the same conversations we're having so while we will certainly work diligently in as quickly as we can let's please not forget there are a lot of other things that are happening right now\nThey did that have nothing to do with marijuana like the budget for next year and that town meeting for next year and the fallout from the central town meeting\nThat's all next year though yes Jim so um you know I'd I'd ... we've been asking town council for a couple of months to get some guidance and um and I think they were\nYou know spend a lot of time looking for one of their communities are doing these ah the regulations or that kind of rolling regulations being developed by the CDC I'm\nEven what's in our pack up today um we know that there were no Katie really had to struggle defined what some other communities are doing um I'd argue that you were a little head and he's based on what we can see\nFrom what other folks are doing so I'm just bored to spend a lot of time on this matter um it's something we had to learn about individually um I think we're being very expeditious\nUm and I know that probably people may have a difference of opinion about that but I'm In a town councils given us\nGreat advice and we have to and you know we have to or were you know we're making our best efforts but um it's a ... when I I personally am not going to be swayed by people coming up and saying we have to do this because it's it's real important so\nI have some comments later about to board of health but I'll put those under my ah related to this little put those under my select my comments\nI Would just kind of I call it that I feel like we've been working on that\nVery diligently I Know it feels like the vote statewide path a long time ago that we have been waiting on all the state regulation and we are moving faster than many communities that I Know I've been doing a lot more work ... hours at a meeting on that\nAnd we also had to see what how meaning wanted to do before we could identify with the next step was\nIf there was no limitation we couldn't afford with HGF from anyone who not our criteria\nNow that we know that there is a limitation to ... we've already granted one agency I\nWe have to identify us our process and not by ice apart they are asking a process because I think it's not fair way to lay out all of the criteria and get the ball to respond by engaging certain which I Hope will be you know within the next\nTwo months now but for a for we get to them are to the end of the moratorium\nWas\nReading you know\nI just thought I think I ask you process will provide some clarity in some guidelines as soon as they get the criteria for it and the draft age ca I think again that whole process is meant to be um very clear and hopefully provide as time famous people are hoping for\nCriteria that town council since the gym referred to what we've heard tonight where the sunset clauses um you know export ban or not\nYou know good direction\nIs there anything else which are good unkind\nJust had one thing um\nI think we have is to include something where\nThe facility to open with a certain period of time it was a ... to keep their life and that would be the sunset clause correct\nI wasn't Cherokee meant sunset clause in terms of why we are\nYes so he can hold on a license for years to\nSee I was a man and one other question moment John here that I wanted clarification on was there's you can guarantee that if one is one of the other of these doesn't get the recreational license though most likely pursuing medical license and we had some you know and and my understanding is there's a like you to explain what\nA kid he put about the number of medical that are allowed here\n[noise]\nThe three three medical ... yeah I just want to have for the camera and be partly because I was little I rented a couple of times and I'm Still a little jumbled so if you left jumbled than me [laughter]\n[noise]\nSo as you know a ... it was just last Wednesday night town meeting voted to limit the number of adult use marijuana license um establishment to two and um there is another provision however in I'm\nIn the a law\nThat basically says that if you want to limit the number\nOf or any type of marijuana establishment to fewer than the number of medical marijuana treatment centers you need to do that by a ballot question so I'm\nRight now I think it's fair to assume you're gonna have to\nUm uh I don't use marijuana centers which means that you could issue HCC a sport too um medical treatment centers and not be in violation of that provision of the law the question becomes what happens if\nThe town or to approve three medical\nH. C. H. and you know Katie and I we've talked about is whether or not um\nThat would create\nA legal issue for the town\nBecause of the language that requires the ballot question I think is strong arguments to be made that um the limitation onto\nUm adult use Sanders was you know voted in accordance with the same law and at the time there was no conflict with this other provision in terms of fewer than the number of of a\nOf a medical so we think there would be a strong argument that you would not have an issue but if there were an issue the way you would have to resolve that\nIs either to have a ballot question\nOr to amend your general by law that you just passed last week maybe to allow for example\nThree adult use treatment a um [noise] I don't use the facilities to match at least the number of medical that you issued so it's a bit speculative Matt we don't really know if that's even going to be an issue for the town\nOr were trying to get guidance from the candidates control commission on how they're going to interpret that provision\nSo for the time being I think we can assume that um you're going to go forward with the to the limit of two\nAnd we'll just have to see how the rest shakes out\nSo just took so let's say that we had we have to recreational and another person comes in and wants a medical\nRecreational and another person comes in and wants a medical\nThat we ... we are saying we may not be able to give that Seoul medical one I I sort of read it the other way I Will you do have discretion as to whether or not to the medical we have a discussion right\nYou know if it's possible to limit the number of medical ... by the number of age the age that you that you actually agree to same with recreational um\nYou may not want to do that however they may be a good reason why you want to have three medical right and I'm ... and they may be a\nSomeone who comes in with a proposal that is really terrific and you would like to accommodate it and then we would have to analyze the interplay between having three and the limit on two adult uses and there are relatively icy easy\nFixes you could imagine you were by law you could have the ballot question okay Jay would go to the ballot\nYet which would be you know not the worst thing in the world\nAnd then the next question John and it's actually two questions one is whether or not it's appropriate in a nice cute essentially has a blank line that says describe any other additional benefits to the town you would provide secondly I'm Wondering if there's any way that I'm\nA one of the operators can potentially find a way to support a a local cooperative as in right now we just have an issue where it doesn't I dated vest they need some kind of support to get started is there any kind of conflict of interest or that there is potential additional benefit that a an operator could provide\n[noise]\nThat they would um as part of the age ca they would support financially the establishment of a grower is that what you're asking\nI suppose that can be one way I'm not quite sure exactly how they could support I think many different ways what I'm trying to get at is awaiting trench by local from the local operated into the criteria or the conditions right in a way that it's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Performance Today", "city": "Nantucket", "day": "17"}
