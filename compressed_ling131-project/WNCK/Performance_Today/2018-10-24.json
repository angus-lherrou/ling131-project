[noise]\n\nI have a lot to say hopefully won't get anywhere near the red socks that time no\nThe first time I think Mike and the planners because the options they're presenting preferred now look a lot better than some of the options we saw before and I echo that uh I appreciate being listened to a senator a barren your patient for a little bit longer hair\nI Want to provide some additional comments to the board as they're considering these projects um and I said that there are a lot of them um\nThe\nUh let let me start with one small one the boulevard option that is not the preferred option but was presented here\nAs indicating that protected the tree\nIt does not protect the entree because it rips through the entrees roots down to put in a slip lane and so I just want to make the point that protecting that tree is not about refraining from cutting it down it's about protecting the ability of that tree to continue to thrive on that so that means not parking construction equipment under the tree\nMeans not stockpiling materials under the tree\nI mean they're not putting a roadway under the tree such when a hope that that is part\nOf the construction process is the active participation in protecting that trade and its ability to grow um\nNext one up is I live on ... which is off of that is probably just pass the hospital there and um\nThe rotary at this intersection or the roundabout\nDoesn't address the difficulty of traffic on ... trying to get into this intersection uh orange traffic on Williams lane trying to get into the intersection and so while this might be the right solution for the intersection\nIt leaves a lot to be desired for the traffic in the entire local area um so I Want to urge you to consider what improvements can be made\nTo the additional affected areas in this intersection desperately Williams sign on the bike path\nThat ends at best probably in on our side road where we're sending that now into the around very as somebody who has tried to ride their bike um I started getting off my bike and walking through this intersection\nUm I've started getting off my bike and walking through this intersection it's just I'm not comfortable in it and I'm definitely not\nComfortable riding my bike so rotary um I Would like to see the bike path routed away from this somehow maybe along the edge of the hospital property from the surface I wrote tournament is\nUm you know definitely the uh what they call it a pedestrian desire path\nIs something that we need there's no reason for a bicycle to go through the round about to get from our side wrote a sparks avenue or vice versa um there are a lot of things that I think need to be added on to this project to uh to really improve the environment for pedestrians and bicycles and for the traffic in the neighborhood [noise] um [noise]\nThe other thing that I Want to say is that we we haven't really talked about why this intersection has a problem\nIt's a problem because when it was originally built this road was to connect to places that were far away a town and\nAnd the out of ... airport area and there wasn't a lot along this road so it was a connector it's now part of the neighborhood you know not only do we have the school and the hospital we have a lot more houses in this area\nThan we have fifty years ago and I think that this needs to be thought of as a street grid kind of neighborhood I think town has expanded out\nInto this area just no longer edge of town this is town um and in order to accommodate traffic moving through this area certainly there are people who are going through but there are a lot of people who are originating a trip or ending a trip in this area\nAnd giving people the option of a street cred would I make sure it would allow people to not have to go through the intersection\nUm it's it's not something that I can address in detail here and I want to take all that kind of time and I don't have the visuals\nBut there are options that I can see on a map where we can\nConnect some of the streets that have been purposely not connected or one example is Kate Elaine it's the street with a big pile of dirt in the middle so you can't go through and there may have been a reason for that historically but we might want to reevaluate that that gets people that have starts to give them an ability to not go through this section in the first place [noise]\nThe reason this intersection such an issue\nAs they're too many cars trying to go through it the reason they're too many cars is because they don't have a good alternative um one of the things that we have to think about is we're making changes this intersection that will be effective twenty four seven I'm the intersection definitely has problems but it doesn't have them twenty four hours a day\nAnd so if we are speeding up traffic\nAt all hours of the day or what does that do to people invest relate and who are trying to get into traffic right now the traffic that's already stopped is very\nNice to people invest for laying by saying oh yeah go ahead through but if I'm moving through that twenty or twenty five miles an hour approaching a rotary not expecting to have to stop I'm less likely to pause and let somebody into the traffic pattern [noise]\nUm yeah they're just all kinds of considerations that we need to think about outside improving justice specific four corners area I like to call it six corners because there aren't just for [noise] um\nI'm not even remember all the things I Want to say\nAmerican you pause when I was like yeah was that was was ... was up there was that considered was ... and the other ... spring Williams with those considered the way you're taught she's talking about them not to this point\nYet okay to all of\nOur focus was on the the four legs because of her right\nBut they are part of the whole you know\nFor the word is grid or whatever but it's you know they're part of the whole issue around about it because in the other point to marry me I was just talking about an urban environment and she's she's right would you be installing around about in an urban environment\n\nIs the question do we consider the city in urban is considered as an urban environment I Would say yes like would you would you like would you do this in an urban environment would you do around about you know in New York City do you do around a boat in parts of Cambridge I guess that's sort of\nIt all comes down to traffic numbers and and what can be process but um I think we're out of us can fit in urban environments where bill properly\nI think the last point I Want to make is that\nImproving the intersection it is you know definitely desirable um but we have to realize that if we improve the intersection we're inviting more cars to go through it\nUm right now is living on off of desperate lane I make a point of avoiding the intersection if I'm going into town for instance I don't come down best burger in ...\nAnd into town that way I go around through the cemeteries um but if this intersection was not backed up is quite likely I Would go through it and I'm sure a lot of other people would so we have to think about the possibility of increasing traffic in this area if we make it easier for them to go through\nA most intersections are going to achieve that capacity\nSo we may be spending a tremendous amount of money moving a couple of houses are making major changes and a few years end up with the same kind of traffic backup that we have now\nWe need to think more about how we improve the wider scope of this intersection um\nAnd then the other thing is we can do some cash we can do some small a experiments that would see whether or not we're giving traffic alternate routes will have an impact on this intersection\nWe're about to do major construction move houses and spend a lot of money and hope that it works and and I do trust that the engineers have found the best option\nI Want to reiterate that I think the plants we've seen tonight are much better than the ones who saw before\nUm but we're we're kind of taking a leap here when we could do a little bit of testing and incremental steps and find out what would happen if we gave people an alternate route\nSo I urge you that that the planning isn't done here um it's it's certainly well on its way certainly reached some great um suggestions but I don't think we're done planning for how to fix this intersection thank you like ...\nOr ... of course you're from murder to share your these issues\nConcerns or comments to uh with my yes okay so here's owner sorry I\nJust\nWish that you fall cars and my wife and I live in twenty three Atlantic Avenue a on the car of ah one of the evidence on prospects [noise]\nAh I've ... my wife and I have gone over the alternative of a four corners with Mike and I'm you know there's some impact to our own property but uh in the main I think it's a I we like the alternative\nHowever [noise] um [noise] it does not address the problem of the speed of the traffic\nWhich comes down from the hospital and then goes up when they come down the hill from the hospital they should be and stop\nAt the stop signs when they make the chair and to go up by the hospital's day species\nAnd Main concern was pedestrian traffic also if you want to see something which is perilous watching all the way to get off the bus and attempt to cross the street to go to a hospital I'm Amazed at the hospital does not seem that concerned\nSignificant increase well no\nI'm not sure of comparison compared to former stop in order I can see that we do analyze the speeds that the vehicles\nUm can achieve when they come into their run about whether operating around the circle and when the eggs with round about because each one of those points has some curvature to it it's not just the slingshot out once you're in a circle you you don't just rocket out of it I can definitely say that um because really shut the\nFall of the natural um top of\nThe circle and the way the um you can see it on the side here the way the exit Williams works it's kind of have a reverse curve coming out of it so you don't just have a straight line oh I'm from I'm not sure on a comparison to speeds\nI'm coming out of a subsided but sure\nYeah my name is ... and I work with Steve I'll give you the straight answer I'm\nRoundabout and the approaches and departures to them have designed speed associated with them and\nThe way that it curves the roadway curves up to the Ronald ... and then curves away from the roundabout Israeli traffic calming measures you don't want it\nTo have a straight ten and going into the circle because if you do that you're correct it would be an acceleration either into the circle or out of the circle so yes there are designed elements\nI'm typically a a roundabout is designed for like a twenty or twenty five miles per hour designed to be so it's a very low speed going into and out of that and the and the intersections of Saccone five going through it would just go in and out of it that's right yeah\n[noise] like you\nTo read us a question just um it it seems like there's sort of two things I keep coming up and I'm Wondering if we're at a stage in the design where they can still be addressed and it it seems to be in hiding in more layers of sort of the user experience increasing the\nI'm sort of the appeal of for cyclists and pedestrians um\nWas the other one uh so yeah and I think because I was a great point about the production safety by the hospital um\n[noise] what was the other one there's two can I can I just comment on that um safety of the multi moral\nComponent of this you know that's one of the biggest objectives of these types of intersections in areas I don't want to say earlier but in areas that are densely populated our dense population residential you know commercial things like that there's a school right here in one of the things that we try to balance is ... and\nA bicycle and vehicles in the same area um what were wanting what we're trying to do one of the objectives of this project is to get people out of their cars and make it more comfortable for cyclists or for ... to go through this intersection and one of the things that Steve mentioned was a split rail fence as a separation between\nThe motorists that are using the roadway itself roadway proper and the bike path in the ... and so um I actually John Donne additional landscaping because you're right there that additional landscaping a lot of shading things like that will make it more palatable I'm\nA context for people that are not in cars to travel through and and more inviting for people to actually be encouraged for healthy types of of transportation modes which is the cycling and and you know walking biking things like that\nOkay so you really feel that it's already baked in over a balancing the functionality for cars side by side\nAbsolutely as I point that we're at right now is we're actually trying to balance the the the different uses of the Carter themselves in what Steve had shown with the different majors season and there's a lot of information to to absorb here and and I apologize but it it's not just something that we just put on a piece of paper and said here you go\nAll we do really evaluate it for different criteria right of ways another one that's that's a criteria if there are environmental wetlands things like that we would also evaluate it with that but right now what we're doing is we're just putting pen to paper taking a look at different different criteria which is\nYou know put gesture inexperienced and cycling experience and what the cues are going to be how the actual um intersections operating from from a vehicular perspective not necessarily but operations but also size to make sure that people can pass through the intersections and we're not making them too small um or too big\nSo there there are a lot of things that were actually evaluating at this point I'm we're still at the conceptual stage I think that's the point is we're giving you an update on where we're at right now\nBut also how to advance at what the what the things are the concerns that we're hearing from the the community because of course we don't live here I'd love to live here but we don't live here\nAnd we want to make sure that whatever we're presenting as part of a design really does take in the input from from the people who work at the time but also live in the top\nPrinting 'em so back to the um\nThe option here to pose for the amount of coming down prospect in dispute actually speeding up researching the curve there\nWill say people down for to get into the rotary\nSo just a um round about one on one and unfortunately I'm One of the design\n... which ones are the top on one of the design team that um took a look at what what's called the deflection deflection angles going in and out of the um the roundabout itself you can see how does it\nAnkles going in and out of the um the roundabout it sells you can see how the deflection hair on sparks on prospect what we were trying to do is we put in a deflection here\nAnd here but because it's it's so concentrated because we didn't want to impact any of the residential properties I'm Better adjacent to the\nThe roadway itself we we had to minimize that you know be terrific if we could put in truth traffic calming measures in and out of the the roundabout but we were just constrained with land use adjacent to it\nBut there's something there there is definitely something that yes you have to split ... also work that way so the split our islands which are these try and get an areas here and unfortunately they're not call it in in this um\nThis graphic but these here also narrow the roadway down and went to a traffic calming measure for any roadways to even if it's not um an actual better perceive narrowing of a roadway because that will make people slow down and that's what the intent to girls are also\nCan I just and I just want to confirm the preferred alternative did say that it was protecting them tree we're definitely protecting our country that was one of the things that we heard that first\nUm public meeting was the the workshop that we had and\nOf the intersections um that we took a look at the three locations the elm tree came up I'd say most of all the comments that were the that night\nAnd you end up and to make sure that the specification if this project as good a construction will make sure the specifications specifically say and the plans specifically\nCall out an area that's a no build zone essentially so there cannot be any construction equipment or materials place or anything that would be adversely affecting the longevity of of the tree but sensitive to the root structure to that's correct yes well I mean for the campaign so we actually\nYou know you take a look at the tree and you're actually shoot it down to the ground and that's the\nThat's the no work area that we're looking at\nWho have oversight over the Wu maker that'd be\nA yeah the ... if this was ... it depends on the funding mechanism so if you\nGo for state and federal funding for the improvements to this\nUm it would be a is it would be town folks that would be involved obviously because it's a lot of coordination there would be ... it'd be state folks that would be overseeing the construction\nThe contractor would be responsible for any of the work activities so there is going to be a group effort to make sure that this project gets executed according to plan and that's going to be a lot of um [noise]\nOversight to make sure that it is um built according to the specifications that'll put together for the project\nCan you walk me through many micro Olympic can do this if we were to approve this but like okay we like what we're seeing in concept what are the next steps\nAnd does does the public at a time and again when you want to question\nFor tonight I'm\nIn one thing that really resonated with me that was sad\nBike path in front of the small ... ... is really not a thing and I I find it extremely unsafe policy can\nAnd is there something that we're looking at as we do this I mean this is a huge improvement that cannot be that's for sure bringing in hand and wrapping it around the corner and prospects but\nIt's got to be improved anyway and so on and we're planning to do\nThat is a highlighted need in our transportation plan just widening that out maybe that's achieved through a treatment like we did with a Bartlett road basically reclaiming work was called in a buffer between the path on the roadway and have a vertical separation rather than a horizontal separation\nOr that could you would gain an extra little bit of with a ... as we realized on ... road you know to to more beach really makes a huge amount of difference\nAlso say who perform wrote that was reclaimed as well that grass strip in our mission makes all the difference in the world as far as users of that path\nA you know know that on through the surf side a bike path to this area that is a huge widening uh uh you know it was a brick sidewalks there was this area right now it's been four or five feet there'll be significantly wider to wear all users could teach bikes bicycles but actually it's could use that to that court or show it's absolutely touches on the permit through this project area\nThat high to pose the entire I rent around a wave of the intersection and cousins\nFor those looking to go east yes it does\nYour beer out and just remember you're also hearing the neighbors saying they're willing to potentially gives you a newsman for her property and you may have more than one if you need it\nI see my kind of shaking his head [laughter] but uh but I think that we have to start thinking that way\nAnd and I and so anyway I Want to I Hope that this is a you know that this doesn't push us a different direction\nYou know and I don't want to see these all and I don't want to see this a kitten circle and everywhere else I mean this is you know I I had a hard time voting for four corners just for that reason alone I feel like we're encroaching with this modern\nThing in in a historic district you know I voted for it you know how might rub you know el my nose and vote for it but I don't want to think that this was going to cause us ...\nYou know el my nose and vote for it but I don't want to think that this was going to cause us to have to do it in a lot of other areas\nSo I just um\nTo me it's less it's more about safety than it is about getting cars through when we heard the you know we heard and are in the public meetings and you and you mentioned is with us trained but at the same thing if you're if you're the four way stop and you look this way and you see and then you look this way over there but you know but you got to let me so there's\nIt's very unsafe uh and and I see this is a big improvement even if even if we are no difference in the number of cars I'm that go through the rotary\nBut what what happens if this makes Kate in a circle a or milk and that's another point ... is our doors are just talking about I agree with you resented\nThe when you argue emitted this is a way to get more cars through and to me it's as much personally as safety than it is you know in our cars to really\nUnderstood and I agree is what my my question I have been is what's gonna happen when we do these at you know a middle street and\nI'm a pawn ... you know milk street anomaly upon what's gonna happen at Katyn circle ... you know what's gonna happen going down pleasant straight and those are if if if those become as unsafe is these are are we what are we going to do\nIn ... when I talk about modeling those are the questions I have and so and that's you know and I think I've had that consistently\nCan I just make one kind of like my second but as a category ... and I I I feel like whether it's the immediate intersections that impact on these roundabouts are these proposals or it's the next intersection anytime\nAnytime at this stage as an opportunity to assess uh the broader functionality fun I think these are huge improvement for these specific London there has been other elements included but I just I'm sensing a concern\nUm for the broader functionality and if we're at a point where we can address that at this stage with this particular project is that something else something else that I think it's both immediate and next\nIntersection right um\nThe the modeling the transportation the regional transportation models was really outside of the skull through or dressing specific mobility issues at these specific locations but I'm speaking with like\nIt sounds like that's something that he would monitor and take a look at in the future to see how exactly improvements here of an impact the region itself I Want to I don't want to say the neck and it's actually the reason itself and then he'll adjusted as as needed\n\nSo in in concept I'm I Am for um these but I really liked hearing people live in prospect street and Mary anxiety when everybody was saying because it is um you know the locals who live there they see it more than us here in New so\nUm I I Would uh approve this concept if I really knew that those comments are taken into consideration if you have to expand the scope\nOr we can we can fit it in I Know some of it's a you know widening suicide room all young nationalist might not be in this particular uh funding bar or can it be or what else we have to do so I think kind of what you're saying ... to thinking about it a little further out\n\nSelling off yeah I I'm I'm we're going wrap it up and I'm a\nBit when when we're in you know this has been very\nPowerful and I and and I know it is outside the scope but I don't I wouldn't need to know exactly how it's going to be so but the issues about a spur lane and I'm Williams lane I'm just to know that there is a potential\nFor a solution would really go toward my being able to\nUm support this not\nJust the point I I did take notes of all the comments and and the comments from the board um what I'll do is I'll consolidate them and we'll speak with Mike and will respond to it and see how to advance this from here how's that are at work you're okay grandkids\nDo you need a consensus union emotion right\nThere were there was a emotion and the a ... a packet of basically well I didn't see you know should or\n[noise] I\nThat that's the underlying tax credit was that it has been on its staff recognize dislikes board approved the ...\nPreferred conceptual alternative design of a hundred foot diameter
