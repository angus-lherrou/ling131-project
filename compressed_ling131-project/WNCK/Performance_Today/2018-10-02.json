like that\nI've talked to a town house a little bit about this we may have one giant joint public hearing to\nRe adopt them all there were won't be any substantive changes there will be a lot of

about the twenty Nineteen in your town meeting this this is nowhere near final just preliminary this first bunch of articles are all the annual article\n[noise] um you may have noticed that there's a bit of a new item I don't remember twenty three under annual articles ride share money this is new all cities and towns in the state are getting what's called ride sharing money it's a it's a portion of it it's a some kind of attacks on who bears and and other ride sharing\nPrograms and there's this very specific allocation\nTo all the cities and towns and they because it's so new they sent out some guidance earlier in the summer that said you could just appropriate the funds and use them they subsequently sent out another bit of guidance that said you can't appropriate those times without a town meetings about our share is very minimal something like twenty three thousand dollars [noise]\nBut nonetheless we're going to have to appropriate at a town meeting for\nSomething to do with the impact of ride sharing services on the on the other guy he was there you know there is a calculation there there's a um [noise] the guidance document that I don't have totally handy but I can send it out again it was yeah and there's a number of\nCriteria I think\nAh okay now we're getting into select twin sponsored articles and I keep a file of\nYou know what we might think about for the next town meeting I put stuff in it as we\nProceed throughout the year\nDang I put stuff in it as we\nProceed throughout the year\nThe there may be\nOther appropriation of finance related articles other

it I Believe I now have that list it's in my email I haven't pulled it out yet but I Will be forwarding not around shortly and I just noted that last year the board had a discussion in January about zoning articles and and how you more wanted them presented met I think\nThis might have generated from something that you put forward so I Will if if the board is so desiring I'll put that forward to the planning staff\nYou know I think it's I mean I think it's good practice I think that we should understand what the implications are in that should've happened early in the process and then that should be that should help inform the Finance Committee I mean it shouldn't be us having to guess\nWhat how many what what is what impact really going to be it should you know it should actually be quantified in and detailed\nSo I agree thank you for I'm putting that on there I agree\n[noise] some more on that later general by was again these are just things that have come up over the year ...

sewer to to it um and it seems like we're going to be able to do that however the property has to be put into this concept or district\nSigns have come up recently I'm In a number of ways so I have taught had some discussion with town council and other staff about how to more clearly\nDeal with them there there's\nIt's a bit unclear as to who enforces what exactly and we have some ideas about how that can be a bit clearer so that may or may not required by law might be able to be some kind of a regulation\nShould be some limitation on where the placement and length of time\nYes we are not in ... and probably some things\nWell we're not allowed to regulate content you know nothing inappropriate obviously\nThat gets tricky there maybe some ways to standardize some of that [noise]\nUm there maybe some\nVarious amendments in connection with some of the legal issues that arose as a result of the regulations project\nThe general ... people were very detailed and thorough and\nReviewing the regulations and they pointed out they also reviewed are bylaws in conjunction with the regulations and they pointed out a number of inconsistent there's not a lot a few minor ones that they said we don't need to change your by law or change your regulation so we have a little bit of a list of those\nThe non voting taxpayer advisory committee is requesting a change to the quorum requirement to be lesser number\nOr the Ford will housing trust I have some emails about this there was some talk\nEarlier in the year about incorporate into one hundred thousand dollar spending limit which I think is just a board policy at the moment into into something more formal I don't know if people want to do that or not I just had it in my file as a discussion point\nIs all about two or three weeks ago maybe drinking a language or so it's not as was communicated usually\nRead a little bit of a confusion yeah you're yeah maybe that's an opportunity to\nClear it up yeah\nA lot that had more it was more to do with them being able to move forward with putting a deposit on property to\nExactly and that the what we what the trust was\nRequesting was actually already allowed\nFor I'm\nI'm not sure that we need a change but yeah I I think a clarification um maybe at the very least you should have a written policy\nI I don't know I'm\nI'm not really sure what people want it to get clear but\nYet we can do something that we can discuss before the housing trust as well as to where the confusion came up and then see if that's suited to\nMore formal clarification or if it's something that we can do with a written policy\n[noise]\nPotentially rescind the historical commission this is a by law commission and what we're finding is that\nThey have not achieved decorum in well over a year perhaps more like two years um they're very difficult to get a hold of and because they're a biological group which are actually statutory in nature sometimes we need a recommendation from them and it's been virtually impossible to get\nSo maybe we don't need them anymore they can't\nUse the ... I was I think that part of the reason that there were having trouble with them is\nThat ... and the and part of the trouble we're having with signs is that we don't have\nSort of the strong age do you see that we had previously I think the fact that we've rolled into another department and there isn't you know there is a staff and people dedicated let the way they weren't drawn has is doing a great job but you can't do it alone instead of having two or three people on it\nAnd the endless choices busy it used to be we you know we were splitting and I think that's why we're having trouble with some of these myself and maybe the you know the Novak group when they're they're announces might\nDetail that to us and maybe there's a better way to set up and do that\nBut historical commission there's some history there going back for as long before clause was immigrated so I'm ... I'm not sure their mandate is very clear\n...\nI've had a couple of people ask me about speed limits on electric bikes on bike path it may be something to look at I don't know how big of a problem and is or isn't but some people have\nMuch of the things that we could do or we could you might have to have some meetings about this whether it's maybe the package give her recommendations or we could there might be something like there's three classes electric bikes you could say well the regulation or you know we always do class war because classroom you can go twenty miles an hour\nYou can buy real regulated more creative way like though\nI even non ... yeah and even non electric bikes have has been commented to me perhaps it needs to be a\nLimit on regular bikes [noise] how do we enforce that I don't know Rubio and\nIs there a clear differentiation between an electric bike and a hover board or an electric skateboard in terms of its ability where they're allowed to go\nI'm reading something about pools that was giving me by Rita who can you know\nI I can talk about phosphorus is one of the things now but she could talk about it a lot more ah my wife\nGoes on a Facebook and she sometimes shows me Hey Matt every scene that said so she showed me a a thread with thirty or forty people talking about bike path started by a Rob it all\nAnd it's very interesting but as his what he's talking about is similar to what we talked about ourselves similar to a conversation we're having it be pack and it's you know how\nThe bike sounds the stop signs but they don't stop and then the cars don't have any stop signs and they don't stop and how do we set up something a system where you know we the people understand what is the travel way and who has the right away and how to bike safely and I think uh\nAnd it's interesting you know when you even see it that Facebook's read there's a you know while the bikes have to stop every time and the cars can drive through his people that complete attitude and then there's people more like me who say the bikes should have to stop the three or four times\nLike they're dangerous like Tom numbers were odor down this road and you know sconces that they should stop of those but they should I think the rest of my nuisance and that science\nI counted them one time when I rode the loop and they were like fifty something stops\nSo you're our bike ride turns into an hour and a half bike ride if you actually just came to a full stop and look both way got going again you're not exercising anymore and so I think that you know and then we've had a at Deepak we've had\nUh what's his name came up with the uh in this city will end came up and he showed us some bike paths pictures of them in a Colorado and they were the way I think the bike paths should be they they had stopped science where the vehicles that are crossing that traveled way\nOn all any crossing any driveway any road minor road that crossed in the bikes had the stop signs at the major roads\nAnd so we're talking about can we look to see how is that legal how do we make that legal because if we want to encourage people to ride bikes and to use that transportation mode and for it to be safe we need to be thinking about those things and I think is very interesting that that was\nYou know and earlier kind of conversation tonight when I had written it down as one of the things I wanted to talk about because\nYou know are too sunny us months when we want people on bikes are one way or the busiest we need to sort of changed the mindset so people are thinking okay I'm In a five thousand pound vehicle I'm On a ten thousandth vehicle on the one that has to look out\nFor the other people I'm the one that's going to do the most damage that has to be the mindset when someone's behind the wheel of a car and I think\nAnyway [noise]\nAh [noise] the conservation commission held a public hearing on the SPF a application yesterday last night for a
