right [noise]\n\nThere were celebrations outside his home in Rio de Janeiro that continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office\nOn the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man that I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they ... the restoration of national pride\nI think that it helps explain why both not defeated the workers' party candidate for them to a dashing so comprehensively\nI should say those are both NATO himself insist the survival adult democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty rather help part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future president to respect\nThe judge had to remind him and the people the people Brazil about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget we're both low also has a record of making sexist and racist and how the fed the remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not as hub in Rio\nHe's rainy on that's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any racism I don't believe this I think he's really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption\nAnd one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him is his promise to fight corruption to fight crime is as you said that this is a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high moody right yet the prospect of more guns ... police violence social concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which says Sperling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... power to a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are especially the poor people than minority\nOkay so both concern and excitement over Brazil's new president NPR's Philip Reeves reporting on that election in Rio thanks You're welcome\nNow we are more of a social media site where the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect reportedly posted anti Semitic attacks\nBefore walking into the tree of life synagogue with for weapons Robert Bowers apparently got fired up with words he reportedly used gab which calls itself an alternative to Twitter and its popular among the far right Here's NPR's Jasmine Garsd\nGap is a site that proudly promotes free speech\nIt both that it lets anyone say anything but it's been controversial critics have called it a home for anti Semite and white nationalist Robert Bowers was a user before allegedly going on a killing spree he posted about the Hebrew immigrant aid society a group that supports refugees\nHe said the group quote likes to bring invaders that kill our people I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw your optics ongoing in Andrew tour by is the CEO of gab in an interview with NPR he defended the platform\nI I don't know you see a direct threat in there\nAnd I don't what what would you expect it to do it like that where you would you want us to just censor anybody that sent phrase ongoing in is that what you're proposing here well I rented and here's the thing the answer to that speech or hate speech however you want to define that\nIs more speech and always will be\nWhen does online free speech become a threat this isn't the first time the issue has come up in social media just last week it came to light that the man accused of sending explosive devices to prominent Democrats and the media had a history of threatening tweets\nTour but says gab follows strict rules including no threats he says he created gap because he saw no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nWent down on thousands of people calling for someone who killed Donald Trump finger going to kill Donald Trump expressing hate toward white\nPeople towards Christian towards minorities who may now for Donald Trump they allow hate to be viewed at certain groups and certain people\nSo where is the line between free speech and inciting violence\nI think the line is we're free speech become a threat\nKelly McBride is a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute for media studies she says tour by is prioritizing free speech above all other constitutional values\nAnd that is not necessarily what our constitutional famers intended right they didn't want the government curbing free speech\nNor did they want citizens to be responsible with their speech she says last year Google band gaps up apple\nRejected it and Microsoft terminated its agreement with that last month just in the last twenty four hours at least two Web hosting platforms have suspended gab CEO Andrew ...\nIs not backing down we're not going anywhere\n... says gap condemns the shooting but he thinks it's now

made the trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford and she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the ... she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all

Nineteen settlement is usually found in beauty products Basset trace in some aerosol they put ... into a tiny plastic hassle many drew a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSo that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it when it's been left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back\nI didn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scaffold stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know if it had a four cylinder six cylinder a solar engine does it have

doesn't add up ... says the customary charge for this test is thirty five dollars and that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill in ...\nDid the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patients being left with to pay out of pocket so the mass still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance\nLike hers when I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr they're reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for a partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test [noise]\nUh yeah it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test at a sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary\nLevel in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live well\nNo the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so if everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do well\nThere are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert and the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much thanks\n[noise]\nSupport for NPR health

first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves who is reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nFor two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all over the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and\nThey use for the restoration of national pride\nHelps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate for them to a dashing so comprehensively I should say though that both NATO himself insist the survival adult democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters about\nThe need for the future presidents who respects\nTo judge how to remind him and the people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not as home Andrea\nHe's rainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any racism I don't believe this I think he's really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as his promise to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said you have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high motor right yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up

to the nation about her decision what what is your saying\n[noise] she she sounded very steady and she looked a little sad but she said that she said before she was not born chancellor\nA that it has been a daily honor but also a daily challenge to service a chancellor for the past Thirteen Years and as head of her party for the last Eighteen but that it was time to to move aside to listen to what citizens had to say uh and and that is that they have a lack of faith and her government um and so she's stepping aside to make room for the next generation\nY feel like I'm you and I have talked um countless times of America on some of the challenges and calling her times embattled I mean she and her government has been in trouble since she was welcoming refugees to Germany in large numbers back

she had never announced that until today so this is going to make it very difficult for Brussels for example to push through a its plans to try to integrate the union more\nUh this is probably not going to help the the breakfast situation those negotiating that are going on I mean she is the strongest leader there and she's also been someone who's helped forge consensus and she's an incredibly we can position now even though technically what she's saying is this isn't going to happen until twenty Twenty one you know she's not going to seek reelection until uh twenty Twenty one and that she's\nBasically going to remain in power until uh until then a but it and she's a lame duck at this point\nIn any talk of who are likely successor might be\nWell even though she hasn't really said who she wants on what what political insiders have told various media a is a hurt the city you general secretary unemployed come ... she's a fifty six year old\nWho's who's someone who many would like
