has been postponed that after an attack that left to senior officials dead including a top police chief\nPamela constable covers Afghanistan for the Washington Post and she's on the line walking to the program\nI'm Glad to be with you I guess we should figure out what was supposed to happen this weekend what is the original plan what's at stake and what's the campaigning been like\nA health plan was to have a very big nationwide election more than\nTwo thousand five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament candidates of all all flavors a and a lot of these\nUh there was lots of excitement about the election but also a lot of concern and worry\nPartly because the threats by the Taliban which has now come true\nAwe and partly widespread of widespread charges on that there was going to a massive fraud [noise] do you said a lot of a positive uh campaigning a lot of fresh faces a lot of the ads and but also a great deal of worry a A N and an anxiety at the same time\nSo you've been reporting that in Kandahar Province of really large and important province the voting will be delayed for a week but this does raise the question what is possibly going to be any different a week\nRight and we don't know that I obviously that says at a metric taken on an emergency basis\nUm just to calm things down I mean the kind of a very large province with the ... it's the least tape ... tape and the governor has been a great word that I'm ... security vacuum people are very nervous and worried so I think that's obviously a measure designed for short term a release of that\nI'm obviously the sick and will be made later on I I Would think and hope that that elections can be held there because it's her I said right pocket lots and lots of voters but let's let's see what happens tomorrow and let's see if there's violence elsewhere or not\nUm and to what extent that happens how how bad it is I I suspect generally speaking they got to be taking\nIt is I I

the an active have not been doing a lot of public campaigning they've got a credit card is gay that inside events\nUm it had a lot fake our trucks but you have not seen a massive public rallies a few

works at a pharmacy\nAnd sell them either in the ... and for me I go out in the world I experienced racist that I Know what it feels like to be discriminate against I I think my parents haven't because really they get their lives or hear their communities here they go to a Vietnamese math they go to their customers are meeting these are our ... our diverse\nNow I realize my experience as an American very different from my dad\nAnd these generational differences extend into politics older Vietnamese Americans have\nTended to vote Republican many of them fled communism and they see Republican presidents from Reagan on as being tougher on communist leaders some younger people like ten term trend has been leaning more democratic and that is one reason the party believe they can unseat the Republican incumbent here\nSo when we went to visit the anthem train them we had heard there were some political differences in her family though I'm not sure she herself new quite how stark they were\nHigh high\nShe invited us into her parents' home her kids were playing around with eating snacks and they were orbiting around the grandfather [noise] how Tran is ... father he primarily speak Vietnamese and his everyday life including when he talks politics with his daughter\nHe's been backing Republicans since he first started voting in Nineteen Ninety two and he told me he was certainly no fan of president bronco bomber who he said just wasn't tough enough on the world stage\nWhom are and they're like him very much\nAnd and then what now I guess we're today we have

president that basically calling to press the enemy that people like we hear that from communist Vietnam so we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that would be valid effect today\nCould you say that you're dead and yeah I'm just I just wonder why when Trump calls the media enemy of the people what your reaction is to that\nMan you know I like oh yeah I'm actually\nGoing to see them time to press talk about what the thing\nBut they don't care about it through a thing\nYou did his CNN against them with ... theme\nSo they're not there by us yeah Fox News clearly is by it and I don't know if you're dead sees the al ... and a lot of the lack of Trump boxes like trying to you know make a phone [laughter]\nYou think you think the media\nIs too negative about Trump that\nHe's not fair\nTo say that Russia interfered in to the left in this country mhm\nBut when they know that why I said oh I shouldn't before the election [noise] the way until from both elected and they make an issue\nSo if if they find out that Trump worked with the Russians where that would that bother you yeah you don't you don't believe that yeah\nThey're doing proven that I don't need to believe them\nDo that but I don't either at me I just don't know ... got now he believed\nThat the Mueller investigation she continues so they they have we have the facts I agree with that\nYeah to some of

yeah it I mean this is it doesn't seem to be happening in this\nNo because I don't think our country should be torn apart because up one percent\nI clearly have strongly against you know what the president stands for\nBut I also believe it's important to me I respect my parents I Know what their experience has banned and and we came here say that we can have the freedom to have different views to half these kind of conversation and they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother and gives me how that free and that's why my parents' lead Vietnam to be here in the first place\nEverybody\nGot to go to vote yes you would fall toys and for future either we thinking\nSo you think everybody should vote yeah\nAnd

states let's take a moment to check on democracy in Afghanistan that country has been planning parliamentary elections this week up most of the voting will proceed but in a very large populous province\nThe voting has been postponed that after an attack that left to senior officials dead including a top police chief\nPamela constable covers Afghanistan for the Washington Post and she's on the line walking to the program\nI'm Glad it with you I guess we should figure out what was supposed to happen this week and what is the original plan what's at stake and what's the campaigning been like\n[noise] um their health plan here have a very big nationwide election why that\nI'm I'm a very big nationwide election more than two thousand five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament candidates of all all flavors and philosophies\nAh there was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of concern and worry\nPartly because of threats by the Taliban which has now come true\nWell and partly widespread of widespread charges on that there was going to be massive fraud so you've seen a lot of a positive uh campaigning a lot of new fresh faces a lot of enthusiasm but also a great deal of of worry a an an an anxiety at the same time\nSo you've been reporting that in Kandahar Province of really large important province the voting will be delayed for a week but this does raise a question what is possibly going to be any different a week\n[noise] right and we don't know that obviously that says at a measure taken on an emergency basis\nUm just to calm things down and kind of hard for very large province which is tough loss it still is to have its intelligence tastes and its governor has been gravely wounded um there's a huge security vacuum people are very nervous and worried so I think this is obviously a measure designed for short term relief of that\nI'm obviously decision will be made later on I I Would take and hope that that elections can be held there because it's a very popular lots and lots of voters but let's let's see what happens tomorrow um let's see if there's violence elsewhere or not um\nAnd to what extent that happens how how bad it is I suspect a generally speaking out they gotta became famous one day at a time here\nDoes it feel and the rest of the country Pamela constable like a democratic process does do do you feel like you're in the middle of a reelection campaign where the people's will might be expressed\n[noise] I Do it does ah it's been it's been a a a\nA nice experience so to speak out

from the John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation asked Mac found data work\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene and I'm Steve Inskeep in Nineteen sixty five when President Lyndon Johnson went to Congress to propose the voting rights act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not\nProhibited from voting\nBut even though when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and the government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal is All right here's our first listener question\nIs claiming heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five however last changed from Supreme Court granted black citizens the right to vote have white could have been at least barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes but do ... laws were controversial at first people staffing the polls were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood\nBut then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration and ... century moved on it became more widespread a partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote\nBy the late Nineteen the early ... centuries a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machine\nWhat about the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens'\nWell of course black men but given the right to vote in the fifties amendment in Eighteen Seventy but the Jim Crow laws and the south effectively stripped African Americans who they're voting rights in terms of light of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineteenth amendment in Nineteen twenty\nBut you know before the sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registration frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nAll right we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why as a candidate for governor allowed to purge voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state while he's a candidate\nBut I assume this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and this and thinking about using himself he's provoked a lawsuit by putting more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for a minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nThough they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy payment chart and I live in Ohio ... when I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me\nAnd I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office address how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWell they're complaining about it this has to do with the recent Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law which does require a current residential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and pointing icy irony that the nation's original residents are being questioned about their residency\nIn very dark ironies thanks so much Cokie good to talk to\nCommentator Cokie Roberts was nowhere okay you're going to ask Cokie your questions about politics and the government by emailing
