will be able to fix that drug problem by themselves in order to do that they would need more money and more resources that they don't have\nThat it's not like bills getting up and that's another thing that popped out and NPR's rural poll Robert Blendon says ... half of those surveyed say their community problems can be solved within five years\nIt is not all the world the hope was that many others

inquiries each week about how politics and the government work either Cokie high speed and it's certainly a big question how this relationship works and here's our first question\nThis is Nicole ... sketch from Nashville, Tennessee in the U.S Saudi Arabia special relationship really based primarily an oil arms arrangement or is there something more to it\nPlus not oil for arms until an arms of recent years the United states is much more self sufficient in terms of energy that Saudi Arabia remains a huge producer of oil and more important incredibly influential in the international setting of oil prices\nBut it's also purchasers President Trump has repeatedly said\nOf arms made by U.S companies but there's something more and that is mainly Iran the United states is seen Saudi Arabia's a check on Iran both in the region internationally and to the extent that it's alive issues the U.S also thinks that Saudi Arabia could be helpful in in the elusive Israeli Palestinian peace agreement\nNow oil is also on the minds of our next listener hello my name is Shawn fits Morris I'm from New Orleans Louisiana how did the U.S view Saudi Arabia before oil was fang thank you\nBasically there was no view before oil was a thing as Saudi Arabia as we know it was it became a country in Nineteen thirty to the very next year inside an agreement with standard oil of California to form aramco the Arabian American oil company which is now owned by the Saudi state\nAnd that happened even before it was clear how oil rich\nBy the Saudi state and that happened even before it was clear how oil rich country would be the leader for a unified the country and started a relationship with the U.S\nWas Abdulazeez even felt he had forty five sons Steve and all the king's centers death in Nineteen fifty three yeah I've been one of those times the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman we've been hearing so much about lately would be the first of the next generation if he becomes king\nThe next question is whether us being so close to the Saudis can get them to do anything\nI was out of the south from Upton, Massachusetts how much influence does the United states have over Saudi Arabia's foreign policy\nWell I'd say the question is more how much the U.S has chosen to exert\nA the biggest case in point at the moment is the civil war in Yemen\nWhere the Saudis have been accused of bombing civilians and closing off access to a humanitarian aid so that now there's an enormous food crisis taking place but because Iran is involved with the facts and the Saudis are fighting the United states has sided with the Saudis\nBut there's ... and Congress which showed up in the last defense bill of trying to protect civilians\nAnd there's talk of sanctioning Saudi Arabia

S. much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China and it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edits weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well what's interesting here no al is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U.

about how he could help mitigate climate change in all sorts of\nLand use agriculture harvests oils frustration\nOur sometime and co chairs the climate change ... he came to the conferences spread awareness about blocking [noise] so what is\nA chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology [noise]\nOkay [noise] think of it like the ... is like an accounting book\nEveryone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank but instead on the computers of everyone on the block chain\nTransparency is its main advantage tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to ending human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... is a black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credits systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNow the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because he's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara says the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those\nIs that it's just there's a quick and easy solution the things that the climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nBecause it before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause it could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially Ken kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something then solvable\nWith a clock ticking on climate change ... there's no time to waste sorting facts from high\nRent PR News I'm Sam Harnett\nThis is NPR News\nThe Democratic nominee for governor in Illinois has contributed more money to his own campaign any other candidate in history and voters don't like that\nIt's just

counsel at the Brennan Center for justice at NYU school of law he says Michigan maps are among the most skewed in the country\nIt's very clear that their number one goal above protecting communities ethnic geographic otherwise at Michigan it's very clear that their number one goal was to maximize Republican political power\nRepublicans have taken the majority of the state's congressional seats nine out of fourteen even in years when Democrats have gotten so far more votes overall\nThe redistricting proposal would create a commission made up of for Republicans or Democrats and five independence\nA majority that includes a mix of all three would have to agree on the maps but the opposition calls the proposal an expensive way to change your system that already works when delete harbor is a Republican and has worked for for secretary of state she says this whole thing is skewed to help Democrats\nThe gimmick and it bypassed us our elected official in our democracy and if they

the last few weeks but it's still a difficult subject to get people excited about Chiquita Hannah of Detroit plans to vote in November and she's leaning in favor of the proposal\nWhy should that person in an office get to decide like who gets to vote in that area when I have a right to choose and and it just makes me wonder well how much rights do we really have\nEven if the redistricting

dollars to the families of top flight basketball recruits one of those convicted James gotcha worked for Adidas\nAnd steered certain students to Adidas sponsored colleges schools with storied basketball programs such as University of Kansas and low for among them\n... longtime coach Rick Pitino was forced out of a job over all this but he was not even brought on trial\nAnd joining us to talk about this case and what the NC double a can do to clean up corruption and college athletics is Washington Post sports columnist Kevin Blackistone also familiar voice on our program hey there Kevin hey how're you doing do I'm good thank you so what does all this mean for college basketball as a whole what happened yesterday\nYou know I'm not sure it means anything for college basketball um in in total because what happened here it was a pretty isolated incident um but what it does is it exposes the recruiting practices have been going on in a big time college athletics and football and particularly in basketball\nFor as long as I can remember and that is basically the channeling of money from a one source\nUm to the families of talent um to ensure that that talent goes to a particular school and what has happened over the years is that the uh manufacturers of of basketball shoes Adidas\nTo Nike or those those uh operations\nHas gotten people in the middle of them um to help transfer that money\nSo that the surprise here is that it has been criminalize or by the federal government as opposed to be policed by uh the NC double A. is it's been done for years and it used to be that the worst thing that would happen in this situation is that a someone would be banned from\nThe NC double a coach who was who was caught um funneling money or or some middle man now actually go ... which is which is a step at absolutely now you could possibly go behind bars which is\nUh what these uh these three men are facing\nWhat you have these three men facing that you say um but I Wonder your colleague at the Washington Post Sally Jenkins room recently that they're real defended here should be a university but the universities are actually considered victims and all of this do you see at the same way that she does\nI I don't see it that way but that was the way that the federal government decided to get involved in this basically they said that the your universities were being defrauded 'em\nBy the system uh because by funneling this money um two players are are players families um these people knew that they were making these players in eligible under NCWA rules and therefore that at some point\nIt would all be found out and they wouldn't be allowed to play to the universities that have given them scholarships\nAnd therefore they had to fraud at the universities of of value\nWhich is a very strange thing to me because I still don't know\nHow that's fraud I mean universities or a university basketball programs in football programs are still going to get these talented players under they're very um a low level of remuneration a for athletic talented brings them um tens of million dollars in revenue every year\nWhich speaks to what you said this is something that uh this is this is just a drop in the bucket in terms of potential real change here it really is Kevin Blackistone sports columnist for the Washington Post also teaches journalism at
