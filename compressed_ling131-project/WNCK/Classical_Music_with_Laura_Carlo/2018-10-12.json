with the national Catholic Reporter good morning\nGood morning it the pope's decision to accept this resignation comes to surprise\nNo we had been expecting after some weeks now the cardinal Wuerl has said he was coming to Rome is going to ask Pope Francis to accept his resignation for the good of the church in Washington so that it could move forward what did come as a bit of a surprise is that the Washington archdiocese also released a letter from the cardinal Wuerl\nAre basically portraying the decision the pope made us one or that was made reluctantly hopes that Cardinal Law had the heart of a pasture and could have defended himself more uh with that uh the pope was allowing him to resign basically to allow the church in Washington warmer\nI looked for a new the ship in after these revelations have come forward\nOr this is very interesting because there was a report released in August that decades of sexual abuse by priests in Pennsylvania what was world accused at the exactly\nYes the grand jury report that came out examine worlds history has this look it's broke from Nineteen eighty two thousand six\nAnd well the report did acknowledge that world had really in one case particularly had fought the Vatican and make sure that one priest who the use of the state out of ministry\nIt examines other cases what's said he could have done more a world has reported that saying that he did the best you could at the time it really tried to protect children um but if you survive or just said no he could have done more he could have\nEspecially in in three or four priests cases kept them away from industry are told the people in Pittsburgh what what's going on world says that he was fighting the Vatican on the one case and was trying to get clear authority\nOver what equipment could not do at the time\nTo accusations he could've done more as archbishop of Washington DC this this is a very influential man how are these allegations affected him\nWell has really been one of the most powerful figures in the U.S Catholic Church as thirty or forty years he's been in in in positions of power in the seventies the new Pope John Paul second personally were pointed to him as bishop of Pittsburgh in Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd so we're kind of seeing a passing of an era of one of the figures of the U.S Catholic Church within one show in many conversation and it almost seems as if we're going to wait to see who might be taking his place and who might end up the picking up that mantle was one of the most influential figures in New York's church\nIs there a prospect that cardinal Wuerl might face a legal action as we move forward\nI haven't been aware of anything like that of course not ... ... the accusations don't involve
