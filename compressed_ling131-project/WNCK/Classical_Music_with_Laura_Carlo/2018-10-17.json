curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ... she has thousands of social media followers\nThey're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girl on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released\nThree minutes to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by pro public at in time magazine some of the girls that more than ... was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who is a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with that charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's at more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its find or keep the ... had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media and about how you present the ... level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but taking a small step or making a difference\nSo who is Katie my lawyer why did she started this organization\nKicked him out there's a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of yeah community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and kitty ... has been very clear in her own promotion of the organization that or she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped start disorganization on the ground in Liberia was a man named Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the area of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in their equipment the girl said he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to other girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask ... and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven\nThere was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nNow my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports and to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were retested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if\nFor organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the cities that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the Chinese leadership that there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to\nSexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nIn Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools that\nWell the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community had the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something had gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit than these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin since his story was published Katie my lawyer has temporarily stepped down as CEO of more than me this is NPR News [noise]\nAs soon as the toughest building codes

was only Twenty one years old at the time and from a tiny but ancient religious minority groups the ...\nYeah the the people that they are very ...\nThey just on a simple life they they can they can leave we any group in Iraq in even habit and they are they're very ... piece people ... and they just want\nTo live in peace and think say\nTo feel safe I talked to an audience brought in NPR's Washington studios earlier this week it was her first full interview since she won the Nobel Peace prize with the help of an interpreter she spoke mostly in ... which is her native language about what she now hopes to achieve\nI'm I'm diminishing or I mean we have set it over and over that it's important for us the justice as you've gotten out of the six thousand UCD women who\nFor us the justice is done out of the six thousand ... women who were abducted by ISIS we hope to see at least one ISIS number who did this to one as a woman to be punished for the crimes they've committed against gives me the women and we hope to see them in court in public\nI think it is easy to see winning the Nobel Peace prize as a kind of combination or end of a person's career you've you've done what you said how to do\nIn your case it twenty four years old that is clearly not true you clearly feel like you have a lot left to do what is next for you after winning the prize\nI'm twenty five twenty five ... and ...\nAfter I delivered our message and do we have as a community delivered or message that how we would like to see the reconstruction of our homeland in since ... take place and to provide

Can't just simply say I'm angry because that word only will not describe how much we have suffered but what I can say is that we are right we have the right to speak about this we have the right to deliver a message\nIf anger doesn't quite capture it what is the word what do you feel everyday\nOr chemicals to show them that you know like I said what makes us feel good at least is that we are delivering a peaceful message we are not delivering a message to hurt anyone when I meet with students and presidents and anyone I speak about what happened to us and I deliver my message with a clear conscience\nThat I advocate for people\nDuring our half hour interview not humor odd seemed at times pretty shattered but also strong she says that strength comes from her UCD identity she calls the rape of using the women and the murder of UCD men including many people in her own family a genocide\nShe wants these atrocities to be classified as war crimes but even after winning the Nobel Peace prize she's not sure if that's going to happen and she sometimes find yourself frustrated\n... sometimes I feel that my message has not been clear they heard but that is not my fault because I feel like too much is going on in terms of women being victims and it's not the first time and certainly it's not the last time\nAnd perhaps every year a woman someplace in the world or groups of woman or thousands will be victims of sexual violence or terrorist groups and so I feel like this is not new to people and it's not going to be the last time and people have become numb to this kind of news\nI'm your mother your mother was killed by the Islamic state and I wonder when you think about her now\nWhat do you think she would think about everything that you've done what do you think she would think about you having won a Nobel Peace prize being the voice of the ... community to the rest of the world how do you think your mom would feel\nIn some of the ...\nWhen I received this news it was around probably five AM in the morning and the U.S and the first thing I did was look at her picture and cry but because they felt they needed her ... and not just her with the eighty women they eat or women that were with her\nAnd they were all executed for no reason just for being as eating and for being older women I feel like they will be proud\nProud\nYou are twenty five years old
