Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin is Nobel Prize week so far no bells have been handed out for physics and medicine and today's chemistry the royal Swedish Academy of scientists announced the winters in stock\nCar coming up the scopes academy and how did all this stuff up to ...\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate an athlete you know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and\nThe other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the end Marcy laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in the enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... and the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties she started\nTo use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve the performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme up putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith\nDeveloped a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria and it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world well you know\nBy using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on that so I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies are in development that could do things like fight cancer we heard yesterday from a NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel\nAre ... are actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular price sale yeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean Francis Arnold is only a fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years\nUm the prize can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say

the u._s. conflict with North Korea he's written the history of Americans in a brutal battle in the dead of winter which happened when Americans try to unify north and South Korea\n[noise] that's\nA radio announcer giving the news of the U.S military landing at a port city near Seoul in Nineteen fifty [noise] North Korea that started the war invading the U.S back south the United states and its allies struck back\nWith this landing commanded by one of the arrows most famous general\nDouglas MacArthur his landing works as this old movie newsreel proclaimed\nThe way the war at least a turning point as a fresh started and certainly move all the north Koreans\nSeemingly Hampton Sides says MacArthur is forces recaptured South Korea's capital\nAnd he began to get kind of greedy\nThe new book on desperate ground examines the plan that the guard they're devised next\nWhy stop there why not go all the way to retake all of Korea unite the peninsula under one democratic government\nRegardless troops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south\nBut what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans the threat and the huge Chinese army will soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially an intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he swept this information under the rug\nWhat was the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division whose name is general Oliver Smith\nRealized that this was a perfect scenario foreign circle meant he was very fresh and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen\nOn the shores of this frozen lake in the mountains of North Korea sounds like it was pretty cold eighty five percent of these men suffered from frostbite many died of exposure\nNone of these troops were prepared for fighting in these kinds of conditions\nYou given incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold he leaps out of his sleeping bag and only realizes after fighting for hours that he had never managed to put his boots on\nYou know this is Hector cat for at uh\nFor hours that he had never managed to put his boots on\nYou know this is Hector calf or add up to receive the Congressional Medal of honor for his exploits that night he may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his position\nThe Marines in parts of the battle were outnumbered tend to one by the Chinese and he never killed a man before he'd never been in combat and suddenly her he was surrounded\nPlenty of thousand trapped in their choice in reservoir slog than fought their way is sixty miles to the evacuation point to holding up\nThrough snow mountain passes they held off two hundred thousand [noise]\nThe first Marine Division escaped but Chinese troops retook North Korea and the country's remain divided today the dividing line only slightly changed but the Korean people those who survived changed a lot they had a different perspective on this story we just heard\nYou focus on one particular Korean Lee ... who was\nWell Dr Lee as he is now known he was a North Korean kid and um escape to the south moved to soul as a a teenager\nOnly to have the war reach soul in Nineteen fifty when North Korean forces invaded\nHis uncle and his aunt were both murdered many of his friends were murdered you had to hide out in a house in Seoul\nHe hid until American forces entered the city blasting to ruin says they took it back\nThe capital city of\nImmediately volunteered with the Marines and they gave him an assignment which was to go be an interpreter and a guard in the very city that he had grown up in in North Korea ...\nWhat ... experiences as an American interpreter in the north\nHe was assigned to guard a bridge in his home town a bridge they called the bridge of long life\nAnd he was there to prevent refugees from crossing it he hated this assignment but then he found out that his sister was on the other side of the bridge of long life\nAnd that she was not allowed to cross and that his whole family was about to board one of these ships for this great evacuation to the south and that they're going to have to leave his sister there forever\nAnd so he prevail do over the American guards they got into a jeep they hunted for his sister all over that part of the city and they found her and she joined her family and and made it to the south\nLeave by ... survived the war and emigrated to the United states he has now Dr Lee by ... of Cincinnati, Ohio and American citizen and Hampton Sides was able to interview him for this book because this story of a divided nation is still less than one lifetime law\nWhat is it been like to be working on this book about Korea through a period where North Korea has been exploding nuclear weapons and launching missiles and then sending their leader to meet with President Trump and everything else\nIt's been very strange and you know I'm living in Nineteen fifty and I'm living in two thousand and Eighteen where there's so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a war could break out again at any point\nIt's kind of terrifying but you know things have been happening in recent months that are exciting because there is such a profound desire both in the north and the south for some kind of a improvement in the relationship [noise]\nHampton Sides is the author of on desperate ground the Marines at the reservoir\nAnd the Korean War graves battle thanks very much great to be with you\nThis is NPR News\nOn

division for the police department in ... in Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the cabinet case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV is turn this on so any potential witness victim is um let's say tainted\nCooper did have this case you'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing that's because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote that\nThe interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing as saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation into case such as Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed recording but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try\nLooking at the circumstances hearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years\nLooking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this ...\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury to the Senate has allowed the FBI Martin costs the NPR News\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nIt's MORNING

battle before the one we're living through now judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week recall him earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown\nBetween Democratic senators and then federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that it's being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not ... well\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nomination to the presidents of center the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have the means that it's not controversial and that at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen have been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington while when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move it just is a more deceptive chief also failed in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected censor at lunch but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWow the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resign from his ship and went on to write books and make speeches than the man President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because it illegally smoked marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status if he is Mac\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused him to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely or the way you move the Supreme Court justice is through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate\nThat was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanting them off to quit because he disagreed with him politically he accused him of parties in rhetoric John Randall off in the house of representatives said hit wiped the floor with chase a shows this nastiness is hardly knew\n'em dead then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a justice for political reasons and that leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my heard from birth still Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have\nLifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now\nIs so what was the result that what is it with these lifetime appointments well lots of judicial plans in various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age summit both\nUh they've been talk of the Eighteen year time limits favors Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require a change in the law or the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much and he spends commentator Cokie Roberts and you can ask Cokie your
