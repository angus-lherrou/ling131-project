five legendary albums between some of Cuba's plaintiff musician these recordings were made in Havana as an art studios between Nineteen\nFifty six in Nineteen sixty four that's the period just before communist leader Fidel Castro nationalized the recording industry and since then these albums have become extremely hard to come by\nUntil now that is that is called the complete Cuban jam sessions volumes one through five and here to talk about it and feel it's ... host of NPR's all but you know podcast they feel like Hey David what's happening\n[noise] will I'm enjoying the music actually there's there's very little Cuban music you claim that I don't like so what makes us all\nFirst of all the studio studio was the best studio in Cuba so that virtually every major Cuban artist had played at some point or another and these sessions or from after hours Jeff Sessions after the musicians played their gigs in places like the hotel mess you know and the really opulent Kevin nightclubs\nThese are the best musicians gathered together to experiment with that mixture of afro Cuban music\nAnd just on the line [noise] [noise] so this was like the after our stuff yeah to take off ... and the little jackets\nAnd they would just go into the room and just started playing and the owner of the studio rent tapes the whole time sometimes between ten PM and fixing them\nWhile 'til the sun would come up there you go so what happened exactly when Castro came to power\nOkay eventually he nationalized the recording industry and the bureaucrats takeover right and the free wheeling bohemian themed suffered a little bit because the government felt there was a reflection of the decade next to the United states\nSo the owners of the studio were concerned about what was going to happen with the masters of what was going to happen to the style of music so they started taking these masters and smuggling them out of the country and depositing them in different Latin American countries along the way so what happened to those recordings over the years in hiding\nEventually they were sold the different labels in Latin America over the years\nSome shoddy reproductions were produced along the way but most of the albums became incredibly hard to find\nSo finally a couple of years ago California label craft recordings bought this Mexican label that was holding on to these
