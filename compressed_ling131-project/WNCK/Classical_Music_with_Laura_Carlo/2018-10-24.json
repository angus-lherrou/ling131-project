away\nYou know the old in the head a faith based approach to mid term elections we'd right at the cat is when but we didn't do myself democratic\nChairman Tom for as is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning\nFor years Republicans have dominated governors offices in legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections some our future national leaders according to the Republican who oversees his party's efforts\nThere part farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments asked\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group as the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWell when you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense and when you have an environment that the historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the mean\nAren't there several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nYes you have a one seat majorities in a Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding\nOr what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys won the dry you got the drawing even though you've lost a lot of ground in the election\nHow much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nAre some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber wanted them being Wisconsin and two thousand twelve where Democrats appeared to have a big images\nAnd being Wisconsin in two thousand twelve where Democrats appeared to have a big majority and votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing the district lines that's where they came from right [noise] well\nI Would raise a couple of points out that first and foremost the system we've designed to have local representatives that people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that statewide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives or is it fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um UC ... Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to a personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is understand their district and advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nYou had a wave election in two thousand to that went all the way down to the state level um\nHow do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand I team\nWell certainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if there are winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district the Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win\nPricing local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically to be more focused on sort of installing a ... a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue a in a more conservative philosophy wants to defuse that power out to the localities\nThat's Matt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee after historic\nFlooding in Austin, Texas that cities one million residents have been told to boil their drinking water most ... of member station ... has more [noise]\nThe water rushing into Austin reservoirs has the look of chocolate milk if it's so turned off by flooding around silk team and when it goes Austin's treatment plant it takes a lot longer to filter so on Monday the city told people to conserve\nWater and as a precaution to boil what they're going to use for drinking and food ... you can probably guess what happened next and I'm calling me as I say\n... find here yesterday Maggie Chapman was one of a bunch of shoppers at a supermarket wheeling out bottles of water supply had improving the day before when shells were bear after stores started to limit\nHow many bottles people could buy it just inconvenient at this point but I keep thinking about you know just daily things that we use water I hadn't even thought about\nWhat kinds of things some restaurants are closed cafes aren't serving so you meet a lot of people desperate for coffee and on a more serious note the city of San Antonio scent of a water tank or to help keep the local jail supplied with drinking water and the city of Austin worried about maintaining water pressure in its system\nWe've been providing water for a hundred years this has never happened to us this is blowing our mind to\nGreg ... is the director of the city's water utility he says after all that silk slowed water treatment the city's system of pipes and reservoirs started to lose pressure\nIt loses too much pressure to city won't be able to spray water from hoses to fight fires and water pipes risks getting contaminated as micro organism sneak into holes and openings they wouldn't normally access\nThe good news there says is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control is how much water we use we can't control the weather but we can control that aspect of it\nHe says if conservation continues and the weather cooperates things could start returning to normal by this weekend if heavy rains kick up\nMore silt and the river could last days beyond that for NPR News I'm

refused to disclose them Democrats would have the authority to get them\nAt the house intelligence committee perspective chair Adam Schiff of California says he would probe allegations that Russia has financial leverage over Trump\nThe Trump Administration has ignored virtually all information requests from congressional Democrats but there is a workaround for that get the documents from friendly nonprofit groups that get them through the freedom of Information Act Austin ... is director of American oversight a progressive group that snow filing for ya request\nIt's actually very difficult to enforce the congressional subpoena in court in contrast a freedom of Information Act request which we could file we can go to court very easily and force agencies to be transparent\nIt's worth noting this for us strategy was owned by conservative groups than the Obama era House Democrats plan to have all the committee's doing oversight investigating cabinet secretaries who broke the rules protecting Obamacare finding out what went wrong with hurricane relief and tackling other issues that Republicans have brushed off\nOne master of oversight is former congressman Henry Waxman during forty years in the house he investigated everything from the tobacco industry to the Iraq War\nWaxman lifted three goals have good oversight stopped the waste of money hold people accountable and make government work the way it should his word of caution to House Democrats don't do oversight the way the Republicans have recently\nThe committees in Congress use their power which is in credible amount of power and abused it for simply political points simply to advance their election interests\nWaxman said that's not what oversight should be about Peter Overby NPR News Washington

MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene in Culver City California\nAnd I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC this is a tough mid term election for Republicans although there is no evidence yet that they're doomed\nThough the party in power usually loses ground Republicans are favored at this moment to hold the Senate they're long shots at best to keep the house although many of the decisive elections there are close so where the Republicans place their final bets\nSteven Law is with us again he leaves the Senate leadership fund for the Republican side good morning thanks for coming by your morning so would you just explain what the role is of groups like yours at this moment when individual democratic star candidates people like ... rock of Texas have raised tons of money what is a group like yours do for the Republican side\nSure well we look at uh all the different races we try to figure out which ones are the most competitive and most importantly where our own involvement would make a critical difference and uh so we're placing our last bats\nIn these final weeks in the same way that outside groups and the other side are as well would you give me an idea of where some of those bats are going sure as a a majority leader McConnell a a described it they're pretty colorfully he said a lot of these races if not all of them are nice fights and dark alleys they're very very close\nAnd uh so we're investing in states like Indiana in Arizona in Tennessee at the data Missouri West Virginia all states where those races are essentially within the margin of error and these are states where our money matters\nOn imaginable even a year ago that you would have to invest money in Tennessee to keep Republican Senate seat on the Republican side [noise]\nWell yeah I mean Tennessee is definitely become much more Republican state Democrats recruited a very strong candidate or in Phil Bredesen and and he's somebody who's known to the electorate a so this is a much more hard fought race than many thought we our view was that it was going to be competitive from the get\nGo I hadn't thought it wasn't that close in the last couple of weeks but you're saying it's not decided you want to put some money there\nOr what have we been active for for weeks and weeks there or we think it's a pretty close race were very ah ... ah Marsha Blackburn but this is a tougher\nAre you still supporting Rick Scott the governor of Florida who's trying to win a Senate seat but it's falling behind in the latest polls against Bill Nelson\nYeah our our view actually is it Rick Scott as narrowly ahead and we think that's a very competitive race we have not invested their up to date in part because he has his own superPAC and obviously a fair amount of money of his own but we're very interested in that race and we think that when it's going to be one of the ones that will be a a seeing in the wind column by the\nJust a few clouds tomorrow night we're down to thirty three to

some of that power away\nOr the audience they had a faith based approach to mid term elections do we pray that the candidate for when but we didn't do much else democratic\nChairman Tom for as is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning\nFor years Republicans have dominated governors offices in legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections some our future national leaders according to the Republican overseas his party's efforts\nPart farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments have met Walter of the Republican state leadership committee\nThe impact that state and local governments asked\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group is the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWhen you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense and when you have an environment that the historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the meat\nAren't there several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nYes you have a one seat majorities in a Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding\nOr what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys want the dry you got the drawing even though you've lost a lot of ground in the election how much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans\nWere in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber wanted them being Wisconsin and two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appear to have a big majority and votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing of district lines that's where they came from right [noise] well\nI Would raise a couple of points out that um first and foremost the system we've designed just to have local representative that people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that statewide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of my system\nBut if you drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issue sets and there are a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um UC Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump the\nState legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to a personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is understand their district an advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election in two thousand to that went all the way down to the state level um\nHow do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand Eighteen\nWell certainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if there are winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district the Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win a\nPrize in local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically to be more focused on
