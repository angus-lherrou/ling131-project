France was a man named among Hong way he's from China\nBut in a stunning move China's government detained mom put him under investigation and now he has resigned from Interpol I talk to NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz and asked him what do we know about my mother\nSixty four years old he served as the vice minister of public security bureau which is China's national police are in twenty sixteen\nHe became the first Chinese headed Interpol and as soon as actually it was a big victory for China's government which under leader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate an extra day Chinese officials at it deemed corrupt would escape China as it turns out\nChinese officials at it deemed corrupt two at a scape China but as it turns out among himself is now under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption what\nExactly are they investigating him for\nWhich I think government hasn't released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how is the tension unfolded has come from his wife grey smoke on September twenty fifth\nThe day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mood even nights suggesting that she was in danger\nA week later she reported in missing to French police on Sunday she spoke to reporters and we own France were in trouble is headquartered in here's what she said\nThe the way they do when you hear when I'm speaking on behalf of my husband when my children will be for my mother for all the wives and children husbands and fathers so they may no longer disappear\nAnd as you can hear in that tape now while she's crying during this part of the video with her back turned to the camera because she's received threats and is under protection by French police\nWell when she talks there about the husbands and fathers who disappeared in China what does she mean\nWell she's talking about the government anti corruption campaign it was launched by Xi Jinping immediately after he took office and twenty Thirteen and it snowed hundreds of thousands of officials both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed my whole way to vice minister of public security was Julia in Congo highest ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign Joe was a former member of the pull up your standing committee the group of seven men who rules China he was China security czar before he was sent to prison for life and twenty Fifteen\nRob by removing month from the presidency of Interpol China loses a lot of sway within that organization that much is clear what does this mean for Interpol\nWell even before this happened China's use of it or Paul and amongst presidents he was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China tempted to issue a red notice that it's an international alert for wanted person\nFor an exile weaker activists were yours are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China who China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with lung is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over into international organization\nReally interesting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob banks do\n\nAcross the United states more criminal courts are turning to video proceedings this isn't an effort to save time and money that that happens some public defenders and others in the criminal justice system are questioning whether the rights of those accused are being affected by this technology\nFrom Illinois newsroom in Urbana league games reports\nToday like most days thousands of defendants will show up in criminal court for their first appearance in front of a judge it's likely that more than half of those appearances will not be in a courtroom in person the defendant will instead face a video camera from inside a jail\nSheriff Jeff standard like stat system he's in Lewis ten in rural west central Illinois he demonstrates what his deputies used to have to do\nThey would have shackles on so there are steps are going to be half of what we're taking and their belts are going to be chained together so you're walking down the line it's kind of like a three legged race\nStandard says the video system they now use freeze up more of his officers for patrol and he argues that the convenience of the system is better for everyone\nNow we can take them right in the back put them in front of a video camera the judge has access to their video camera and the conversation just like we are now but it's just over a video screen\nBut Charles David ... says it's just not the same Davidson is sixty eight years old and a recovering heroin user who was in and out of jails and prisons in Illinois for over two decades he finds the video processed both off putting and demeaning\nWhen I first went to the video of course it just blew 'em up because of uh watching everybody get up and go in front of the screen and it\nIs either yes or no sir you know you couldn't Sunni to\nDavidson says when you're in the same room as the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nOh sure and explain to the judge what happened and they told me to be quiet\nSoon after David thing was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison [noise]\nLayer Rosalie joy says she hears stories like David since all the time she's with the national legal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court had some defense attorneys concerned that it alienates the accused from those deciding their fate\nEven before the proceedings began\nYou already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process\nYou are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction and after a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my clients unless my clients stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase fail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for its cost savings and efficiency while acknowledging that some of those advocating for the accused say it's a trade off that's unfair to defendants for NPR News I'm Lee gains in Urbana, Illinois
