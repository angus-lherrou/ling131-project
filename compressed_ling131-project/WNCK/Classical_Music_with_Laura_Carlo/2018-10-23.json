from NPR News I'm Noel King and I'm Steve Inskeep much is at stake this fall as Americans vote for Congress but in the long term there may be more at\nStake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage their relations for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others they will have great influence in drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group tried to give Democrats influence after twenty twenty\nOne is the problem that you're trying to address\nBut we're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering oh we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and then so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw a line that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to um represent the people\nLet's be blunt when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that is slanted more to Democrats than to Republicans\n[noise] no I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine how\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focused building up their bench\nNot only do criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand Eighteen\nWell we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table in twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen who will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one state legislators who are\nIt'll be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving four year term in who were elected in twenty eight team\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have one twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission that what's that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a little over thirty million dollars and we are distributing um the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting Lynn so governors always matter a state legislators matter but in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor or the state secretary of state um they matter in certain places um Supreme Court justices will matter when North Carolina we're supporting an IED or else\nWho's running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so hard for Rebecca ... who won he Wisconsin Supreme Court seats\nAre you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the the laws\nAs they have been written look at our constitution as it has been written look at the state constitution says they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally and I think ... or a a a fair process\nOne other thing attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you may do what you ripped off a famous remark by Michelle Obama\nWindy low [noise] they go low\nWe what did you mean what what I meant ... in that remark was that uh I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful is that something to be expressed through votes through protests through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate [noise]\nWell I certainly think votes through protests um I I save it just personally I Would not be yelling at them lawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes\nUm you know I I'd be going at them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump ... who was very powerful when young people

out which could lead to some awkward conversations if you were to win and that's not all\nI've been involved where people used to play in a group a long time ago and then somebody wanted a single and then the group went after them said no we're always playing together\nVery awkward but curling is not entirely against office pools\nWell you know I understand why people do it because you know you'll feel terrible if you're going and you didn't contribute just because you didn't like those I Would never say not to understand that there's always peer pressure because you don't want to be the one
