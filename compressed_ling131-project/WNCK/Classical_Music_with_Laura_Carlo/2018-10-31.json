News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin when mass shootings happen in this country we often don't understand the motive that is not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say he has to visit rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can't take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are liberal it out to control the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nDon't go to first and only go so I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest people you know what are they talking about they talk about the the elite do you ever see the elite\nAnd not\nYou are the only [noise] her\nSays when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nDanger for the Jews that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether it\nFor the Jews that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and he has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people\nKnow so then what's the connection he\nWants to win and he has a special talent knowing how to appeal to the resentments hatred and if in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms with taking on other people that share their views and urged them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of an anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or Christmas shops that temporary model is becoming an increasingly popular marketing strategy and not just for the holidays

shops but this year they only have one he says they're facing more retail competition and getting squeezed by more expensive short term rent many landlords used to shine short term leases that Steve shorts with commercial real estate service jails says that view appears to be changing\nI definitely think it's a benefit um it really allows a landlord to activate the storefront in activating storefront in any way is always a good thing Halloween shops you know they're fun they're positive they're engaging they attract families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't just holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stores may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect model is New York based storefront think of it like the

specific artist or washed as as recently as five years ago many landlords would rather sit on a vacant property for a year then entertain a short term lease but now he says more are seeing the upside is getting rent from a pop up store\nYou're changing the traditional model of long term is\nYour ... replacing it by a space which is getting booked every day or every week\nHe says in some cases the

I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence that for for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't\nKnow [noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and and restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just\nWhining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year what do you think about President Trump\nI'm not a fan I voted for Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered I guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump\nCorrect and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of that democratic check boxes I\nI Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and that's coming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nI have been avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio and I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just\nIt's it's

make it easier for citizens to do business and help them to trust each other more it's similar to the American credit score but much more sweeping attracts far more than financial transactions and it's called the social credit score Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast explains\nMany people in China don't have bank accounts don't really have much of a credit history so China has never created something quite like the American credit score\nAnd so there is a lack of a better way to trust deficit in China that is impacting economic activity\nRachel ... teaches trust and technology and is the author of who can you trust she says a lack of trust in people and businesses have held China's economy back\nSo in China decided to make a centralized score the government turned to people's behaviors to extrapolate trustworthiness from them and you know who has lots of data on how people behave\nCompanies especially big companies like Ali Baba that is China's version of Amazon Ali Baba owns one of the largest online payment systems in the country and has its own credit scoring system called sesame credit so the government has been working with Ali Baba in the development of people's social credit score\nThe way people that school is not seem to do and they missed the Billy could be what they buy online I mean I think the example that the head of sesame credit public gave the press with you know if you buy nineties you're responsible so your school go out but if you buy video games you're lazy see a school will go down\nBut it's a credit score will not be all about what you by the government is also collecting data its own and that data will factor into people's social credit scores to the social credit system is not scheduled to be rolled out nationally until twenty twenty\nBut we got a glimpse into how it might work because China is testing out versions of it in pilots cities across the country\nWe talked to a thirty two year old IT engineer named Huron John he lives in wrong Chong which is one of those pilots cities and she joined explained that everyone in the city starts with a score\nOf one thousand what is you know bringing my score as full scar\nSays when thousands and there's a whole letter grade system behind the points so from nine hundred and sixty\nAnd and there's a whole letter grade system behind the points so for nine hundred and sixty to a thousand plus point isn't a eight hundred and fifty nine fifty nine points is it\nThe eight forty nine to six hundred is a seat and this is considered a warning level\nThat you are a D D you were labeled in untrustworthy citizen you can get points for all kinds of reasons get a DUI that is an automatic downgrade to be and if you spread rumors on line minus fifty points\nYou know really high score you get discounts and a bunch of local businesses your heating bill can go down you also get special invitations to community events\nSure on John says it's made people behave better before the pilot program being a pedestrian in Rome China was just terrifying you basically had to hurl yourself across the street when you saw breaking traffic\nThat but now after um\nThe changes have happened the cars and they wait for you\nKnow we're not sure John is an example if somebody with a perfect score if you're a social credit score is low or if you end up on something called the list of untrustworthy people you can be banned from certain kinds of travel or\nEven suggested the public shaming life gets hard Stacey Vanek Smith Cardiff Garcia NPR

President Trump visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to a climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are level it out to control the world Jeffrey her a historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nWay of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a person I don't get paid by Soros or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean the President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another book into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element who says his deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as he did in

are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThe danger for the Jews is that we are a very small in number but we are prominent Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in law are Jewish and Herve is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special
