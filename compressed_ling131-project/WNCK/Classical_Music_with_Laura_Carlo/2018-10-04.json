executions goes well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nWill Steve a rocket seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done but you know the streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kind of bustling in a way but what's curious is\nThe shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings is sort of a skeleton of a building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they said there were more than five hundred homes that have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say\nThey need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water sewer electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and do it\nFled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes\nYou'll drive the streets so look completely desolate from the damage from the IRS strikes ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war\nAnd now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states the control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves are setting up local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syria\nRight and there was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa\nSearches bomb removal and also education programs and that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNo President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line would that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic needs for living resentment will grow\nPeople become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq or in other liberated theories trying to recruit and they still have money to pass round so um there's a concern that ISIS could continue to come back if this rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nNPR's Tom Bowman is in Iraq and Syria thanks very much time You're welcome Steve [noise]\nIt's

swept across Brazil as a result thousands of babies were born with microcephaly or I'd normally small heads among other impediments that come with that\nAround the same time BBC producer William Kramer had a child of his own who was also born with microcephaly although not because of the guy\nCramer wanted to know how Brazil's so called ... babies were developing so we went there and produced a radio documentary called the love stories among the people he met where'd you remind us why as she is the head of a support group for parents called United mothers of angels\nYou lost your emotional about this on our thinking town of ... to get him out of whom I gave us two options either be a victim in don't do anything or become a protectionist into the lives of these kids\nI talked with William Kramer about his reporting earlier this week\nCan you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of this week a crisis and you meet this network of mother\nYeah that's right I mean it was a it was quite remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds on educated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I went over that um they were very very they were very tight group loss of solidarity very determined women some of them um were engaged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about ... ... as well which is kind of common to special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which is called the night shift mothers of angels\nUh this is a group in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's a ... one of the states which was was affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is you know really quite a powerful personality or she doesn't mince words you know she's one of these people that just give you a look and you sort of just stopped talking\nA but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians sympathetic ... people have sought to try and campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible prognosis that their children may not even survive beyond a year or so I'm ... how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are ... chest infections for three breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the air\nSince ... through breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand there are children who are actually doing pretty well I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most is that they were very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk to can stand there was some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind some of that is it you know at that age\nBut then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achievements that told me that that much much more um you know disabled\nSome of the children who are more physically disabled or actually called me to the left side and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and walk around it's an incredibly mixed thing\nSo so much so that you actually tell the story of twins or a girl who was born with them the virus and her brother did not was not affected\nYeah it was you had this for a job that will go minutes Victoria she was cooled uh she really couldn't move very much a tool she seemed very aware of what was going on around huh but then she had her twin brother who was turned off and he was acting just like you would expect it to an offer a boy to act\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they don't really understand they didn't know why it affected one twin and ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that\nSome people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the ...\nYou write that Zeke affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nWhat ice or is that the families had a really thinking about the social aspect so while they're largely going to be like like [noise]\nWhat school are they going to go to know and\nHow would they be able to

the health effects she tell them to give you a bus to take a charter school you know this kind of thing\nAnd those are the kinds of social campaigning took the issues that they really start to do it now\n[noise] I Wonder because he has his personal connection because your own daughter has microcephaly how did you come back from his chats I did it did it change your alter the way you think about her condition in any way\nThe children were very some some of the children ... the ... you mentioned Melissa the twin she especially it was very similar to my gosh you reminded me so much money we got

territory in Syria but it was captured nearly a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nUnder the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is a stadium that ISIS used to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nWill Steve Iraq is seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done but you know the streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kinda bustling in a way but what's curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIs sort of a skeleton of the building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they said there were more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say\nThey need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water and sewer electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look\nCompletely desolate from the damage from the IRS strikes ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see a family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states to control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves they're sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little aces here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syrians\nRight and there was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Rocco searches bomb removal and also education programs\nAnd that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates they've got these programs rolling again now President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars\nTo the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic needs for living resentment will grow people become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back\nInto Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass around so um there's a concern that\nISIS could continue to come back if the rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nNPR's Tom Bowman is in Rocco Syria thanks very much John You're welcome Steve [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene and I'm Rachel
