Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and emboldened there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be over because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could lead congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans and what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty eight or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we are dedicated to the luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern that means funding them all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security\nAccomplishments that looted them over the past two years and if they keep the house

I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need to drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry sent dirty in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country I'd be bar faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of Kentucky distillers association who described\nStill and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association described your product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's greatest sources at the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon Kentucky system of lumps don't show that I Am so shell filters out the water\nTakes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six\nCenturies so at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of of the bigger players um but uh in the past seniors you're probably are global sales have been out\nPacing your domestic sales wow and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the ... but yet they I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements be well a nasty and the agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements has become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nAh we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks is no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer and hopefully you have people you've converting some scotch do remain bourbon drinkers or you take your profits back or which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious as the state that voted for president today has voted for Republicans a lot to ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings\nI think we all understand there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why you know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nAh it come up as an issue yet you made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he said the meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what Barbie means Kentucky a heat\nWill note for the non geographically minded right across\nRight across the river yes ah in and he he told us he understood exactly that this with the sushi could mean for us Berman is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks design testing the federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which announced it can move some production overseas we can't do that with birth and you've got to make it here in American if he wants to sell you better making\nJak beginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been\nA I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and from a feisty and point if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before\nYou know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose for generations Eric\nGregory of Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage from hurricane Michael which hit Florida Panhandle last week

caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says the insurance companies will have substantial costs but it's also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do that in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from having coastal areas so with good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler

Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and emboldened there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be older because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could lead congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans and what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we're dedicated to the luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding them all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that looted them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrower majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News you're listening to MORNING EDITION on Nantucket NPR eighty nine point five WMGK a service of Nantucket public radio\nGood morning this is a meteorologist rose from early and here's your island forecasts developing showers today temperatures in the middle sixties becoming breezy is southwest Turley's increase to Fifteen to twenty five miles per hour this afternoon for offshore marine interest again warning in effect southwestern ... increase to Fifteen to twenty five not\nPushing up two to four foot seas visibility three to six nautical miles but briefly lower in any heavier showers showers and follow bike clearing late tonight is still windy fifty two to fifty seven\nPlenty of sunshine and breezy tomorrow at fifty five to six tape it'll be clear in Chile middle to upper forties Tuesday night golden sunshine Wednesday with high sixty sixty five looks like the sun will stay with us on Thursday and friday as well that's your island forecast this meteorologist Russ tomorrow at\nThis is eighty nine point five W.

Goldwater responsible for one of them Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does he see each of these waves that connected to to the previous well\nHe does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal [laughter] which I think actually illustrates a broader point about\nThe politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribally nature partisan in nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's out versus damp President Trump put it on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the\nBackstabbing duplicitous he and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable [laughter] uh what was Gingrich as comfortable swimming in this one he\nWas I mean a lot of ways he created the swamp set the Trump now says he's trying to drain right I'm\n... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich likes most about Trump when\nYou try to get him to talk about Trump is in ... or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and how how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end no I mean where Democrats support the idea of what Trump has the right in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institution does Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political breaks through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics has gotten more tribal and more vicious and has kind of shed a lot of these civilized and traits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and I ... and that's how he uh he sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nThe ... of the Atlantic magazine his new profile of Newt Gingrich appears in this issue it is called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome McCain top and thanks so much for coming in thank you\n[noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR\nThis message broad do but the ... took it off the job and on over to our website Nantucket lots of drought dot com or the ... or what to ship nationwide does hold is using your jobs can be delivered to your daughter the very next day guarantee", "show_name": "Classical Music with Laura Carlo", "year": "2018", "city": "Nantucket", "day": "15"}
