those are signs you know\nThe boys discuss several different situations and most seem to conclude that getting verbal consent is the best choice moving traditions founder and CEO Deborah Meier says the goal is to give teams the space to arrive at the right answer with their peers\nWe aren't telling them this is how you need to behave and this is how you don't behave and we don't shame them for who they are we help guys uncover the tenderness and the connection and the joined themselves as a human being and develop for themselves a sense of ethics and values and responsibility\nTalking about sexual assault and consent this way sounds different from what a lot of people heard in the past University of New Hampshire a sociology professor Sharon Potter says older generations might remember talks for incoming college freshmen\nWe have a plan and name any help and you know so and they went out and and he made and then we went in and and how he made\nThe problem says Potter is that only a

carbon so brutal ... group prefers to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurgers and says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nVerbal sin says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions brutal ... says the carbon taxes group is

statesmen\nJames Baker this third and George ... both cabinet members in Ronald Reagan's White House one carrot for Republicans is that the revenue from the tax or fee would be fully rebate it to
