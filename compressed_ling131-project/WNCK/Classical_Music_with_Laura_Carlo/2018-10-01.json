EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin we'd like to think America is the land of equal opportunity but that depends on exactly where in America you live it's often said that you can predict the future as many kids by finding out the ZIP Code where they grow up\nAnd online data tool being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries ... has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties she says you are virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but you\nSee that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improved those thoughts so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program\nIt works a lot like a Google Map you can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder what are the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of the publicly available\nInteractive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope citizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better

done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so I saw\nWhat she saw was a segregated city where low income black residents especially faced the little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nThat group identified early childhood development college and career readiness families stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at us to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have that here right now it's just kind of care math median income in Charlotte said\nA

is already taking shape at such field middle school it's located in a majority white maybe not far from downtown Charlotte but it's just in principle Eric ... says the schools students are mostly black\nAnd Hispanic so we got forty eight point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white it's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte\nTo have a student body that's largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods\nThat segregation hinders upward mobility James e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift quite a bit this majority black and brown now but when in the coming years it changes are starting to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThe ... neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area where the truth is that may not be a high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man the social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord says the opportunity atlas should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permits us started making really smart and really intentional decision so that twenty Thirty years not

University in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years a Nobel Prize comes it's a complete surprise\nThe in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes just a complete surprise but not this year the center on just about everybody short\nOK so not such a big shock of but what exactly did these two scientists\nDo well I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties he was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even catch yourself and they came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on your immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes maybe the immune system would be more effective in attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case his observations led to in fact what's been called the revolution and cancer treatment\nIt led to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard of that we talked about that a fair amount on our air and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers and the list is growing and growing and growing\n[laughter] okay so that's Jim Alice and the other scientists who is winning this word ... how do\nYou have any now that him a hundred work independently of Jim Allison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one in ... uh which become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nOne example one of these drugs that you may have heard about is a drug called ... notes that goes on attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and in some ways they're more effective target\nFascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about cancer ...\nWell before the so I just made their discoveries catch her treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and the whole world of immunotherapy is no really the driving force behind drug development\nThese days right I mean we hear a lot about immunotherapy how effective are these new therapy that's what one really wants to know right when\nAnd that's an evolving issue in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies a failed\nAnd some people have had remarkable recoveries remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma in this recovery was spectacular but it's also the case that they are not the cure for most of the patient to take these drugs\nBut researchers are networking on combinations are combining checkpoint inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or to improve outcomes\nTo very exciting area of research but clearly there's a lot more to do this is not the end up destroying\nOK NPR science correspondent Richard Harris does Nobel winners thank you so much my pleasure It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep\n... your

the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to get people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are\nA niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products of veil of on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage\nMore than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the ... met\nSo people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people

Saddam Hussein\nAnd his interest joins us now from the Kurdish city adds to the ... gene I understand there are no official results yet but any indication as to what any Kurdish parliament could look like\nWell for the most part Rachel it's gonna be the status quo you know there are two main parties here that has existed for decades and they will continue their control but the interesting thing is their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections five years ago it seemed that young people\nAnd it looks like that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nThe most is it's not just on a fever you have to be implemented in reality but uh fortunately it's important to use the democracy is to make things look good quality but inside the not so much the last\nAnd my dad he means that he and a lot of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control a lot of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties\nSo what does that mean to people was turn out good as a result of this frustration you were at polling station say\nThat was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are actually pretty high\nNot see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are actually pretty high I'm One of the big fears is almost been fears of fraud and there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the u._k. immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in the very few polling stations we go in one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch them start to count some of the ballots so there is an election official taking out each paper ballot because they decided not to do the automated your ballot counting because they think that leads to fraud\nAnd he's reading out the names of each party's very laborious process so even a disapproved polling station which you think would be like super squeaky clean or people trying to get in with fake IDs huh but really the question is whether the violations or serious enough to put the results in question\nRight so I mean we've heard for

could the new government in essentially Kurdistan affects the the relationship with Baghdad\nAbsolutely you've hit the nail on the head because they had a referendum last year saying do you want independence and the vast majority of Kurds said yes so the U.S says of course that it warned them not to hold this and there were serious repercussions after that\nThe Iraqi government sent in tanks so they're going to have to repair relations with Baghdad and a lot of other things on their plate as well the economy is so it's all quite up in the air but um yeah a lot of challenges ahead for

opportunity but that depends on exactly where in America you live it's often said that you can predict the future as many kids by finding out the ZIP Code where they grow up\nAnd online data to all being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are and the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie economist\nRoss Jedi has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties you said you were virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did\nBut you see that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's uh\nIn eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it is a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improve those thoughts so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program\nIt works a lot like a Google Map you can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income ladder what are the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope\nCitizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nChatty found that moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten a head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen chatty and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you know anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nOphelia ... brown a prominent Charlotte physician says that ranking ran counter to Charlotte's image of itself as a thriving banking center with an expanding high tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\nOut what surprised that we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so\nI saw what she saw was a segregated city where a low income black residents especially faced little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nThe group identified early childhood development college and career readiness family stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at as to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I had up here right now it's just kind of pure math median income in Charlotte said\nA lot of Williams from the chat each team is demonstrating the opportunity outlets for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte in clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility if it's green or blue it has higher opportunity\nFor the outcomes for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank\nBarnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the two of has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is\nThe fathers for the Carolinas that brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to act on these data I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration that community partnership\nCharlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such feel middle school it's located in a majority white neighborhood not far from downtown Charlotte but assistant principal Eric heartfelt says the schools students are mostly\nBlack and Hispanic so we got forty point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white it's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte\nTo have a student body that's largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods\nThat segregation hinders upward mobility James e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift quite a bit majority black and brown now but when in the coming years at a change it started to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThis hedge field neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because areas a flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man this social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord says the opportunity at least should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis

I took good morning so who are these two winners\nWell the price of being shared of course by James Allison he's a Seventy year old biologist who's now with the NBA Anderson Cancer center in Houston and by ... hunt Joe at Kyoto University in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes just a complete surprise but not this year these names are on just about everybody shortly\nOK so not such a big shock but what exactly did these two scientists\nDo well I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties he was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even catch yourself I came across a part of the immune system that actually holds the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if you could release the brakes maybe the immune system would be more effective and attacking cancer and that indeed turned out to be the case his observations led to in fact what's been called the revolution in cancer treatment\nIt would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard that that we talked about the affair about on our air and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers and the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alice and the other scientists who is winning this word ... how do you have to you know that him\nOh hunter work independently of Jim Allison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one in ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nOne example one of these drugs that you may have heard about is a drug called ... notes that goes on attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and it certainly is there more effective target\nFascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about cancer care\nWell before the so I just made their discoveries cancer treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get the way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and this whole world of immunotherapy is no really the driving force behind drug development\nThese days right I mean we hear a lot about immunotherapy how effective are these new therapies that's what one really wants to know a win\nAnd that's an evolving issue it in many cases they succeed wouldn't conventional therapies a failed\nAnd some people had remarkable recovery ... remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma in this recovery was spectacular but it's also the case that they are not the cure for most of the patient to take these drugs\nBut researchers are now working on combinations are combining checkpoint inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or to improve outcomes\nTo very exciting area of research but clearly there's a lot more to do this is not the end of the story I\nOkay NPR science correspondent Richard Harris does Nobel winners thank you so much my pleasure It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep\n[laughter]", "show_name": "Classical Music with Laura Carlo", "year": "2018", "city": "Nantucket", "day": "01"}
