can't remember a time when I wasn't making art in some form during my life I'm the urge to create things as solid me from a young age and art education was always provided for me by my generous and creative parents\nSo I think by the time I got to high school I realized that art and art history we're always going to be defining elements to my personal an academic life and when I took a print making workshop at mass College of art back in my twenties I knew I had found my medium\nThat's great so interesting now Molly you have a long history on Nantucket your grandmother Gwen guy yard owns

observation of our surroundings\nA well put so now Molly can you tell us about your work\nAnd your process so typically I consider myself a colleague raft print make our which means they use the collage image honest if not bored to make prints from and then make multiples of an image and then they layer other images on top of them for those who aren't familiar with the process I tell them it's like making a giant stamp an after the prints are made\nI occasionally and now more often than not will paint on top of the prince tab dimension um and the majority of my work in recent years is

hit Charlie so hard his doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people the complications from the flu a lack of immunity\nBut Charlie was young and healthy it can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in and that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody\nIt doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but el the family members that came to visit got up to ... you know they got to visit her and me\nOn April sixteenth two days
