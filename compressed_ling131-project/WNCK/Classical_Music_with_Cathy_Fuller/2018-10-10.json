here [noise]\nSo now Molly can you tell us when you first started making\nArt so I really can't remember a time when I wasn't making art in some form during my life um search to create\nThings as solid me from a young age and art education was always provided for me by my generous and creative parents so I think by the time I got to high school I realized that art and art history we're always going to be defining elements to my personal an academic life and when I took a print making workshop at mass College of art back in my twenties I knew I had found my medium\nThat's great so

typically I consider myself a polygraph print maker which means they use the collage image honest if not bored to make prints from and then make multiples of an image and then they layer other images on top of them for those who aren't familiar with the process I tell them it's like making a giant stamp on and after the prince or made\nI occasionally and now more often than not well paint on top of the prince tad dimension\nUm and the majority of my work in recent years is centered around the way human memory processes imagery I create semi it's abstract shapes and forms a drop of memories of time spent near the ocean or on the beach\nWow well I Can't wait to see or new work and congratulations on your solo show can you tell us a little about what we'll see in the show\nSo this show is I'm going to be a jumping off point a combination of some new collage work where I Am taking prints and papers and re purpose thing my material to form obstructed geographic points on Nantucket\nUm it's

the things that Trump Administration has done in foreign policy and she did carry forward a number of the president's America First initiatives at the un up but she ended up being a much more forceful voice on American values in particular human rights than I initially had expected\nAcknowledging that you made a mistake does that cause you to approach the next nomination a different way I mean Dina Powell was someone who is being talked about she worked in the Bush administration but doesn't have a whole lot more foreign policy experience but that might give the president a little more difference because you saw what happened with Nikki Haley\nWell I Know Dina and I know Dina fairly well as deputy national security advisor um she actually was very actively engaged in foreign policy

I'm David Greene and I'm Rachel Martin for the third year in a row\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are playing for a spot in the world series a couple of the team's star players are Cuban now a new report in Sports Illustrated lays out the dubious ways that some of those players make it to the U.S\nThe Dodgers have long had a very rich pipeline to the Caribbean and to Cuba and one document that we started in in the article they at some point had an internal ranking system of just how corrupt some of their own scouts were\nAs I executive editor John Wertime says that at one point the Dodgers called one of their own employees unbelievably corrupt or if I'm told me that in order to get access to top baseball talent in Cuba teams often go through agents called ...\nDe ... is a middleman base in Latin America who essentially takes equity stakes and prospects sometimes it can be forty fifty sixty percent of future earnings but for prospects desperate enough that's you know it's a risk to undertake\nAnd now it might be a legal risk according to Sports Illustrated the Justice Department is investigating whether some teams broke federal corruption lost to sign Cuban players\nExtraction of Cuban players has always been shrouded in mystery in baseball but this evidence that the FBI was presented with and we were as well indicates that are that the complicity runs potentially to TV agents as well as the middle man the ... always been implicated in this\nAnd is it basically impossible for a baseball player in Cuba to find his way into the the major leagues without help from one of these middle man\nIt's very difficult part of that is\nBecause of the embargo of Cuba and a player must establish residency in another country usually in the Caribbean or Mexico before coming to the U.S [noise] so what you have is a network of the street level wages that really have been operating outside of\nAnything that the u._s. or major league baseball history addiction over\n[laughter] so you obtained these documents that uh you say offer a window into how baseball teams operate in Latin America especially in Cuba can you explain what you found him what a chess\nWe were given hundreds and hundreds of pages of documents that were also turned over to the the FBI this dossier what it shows is that teams and agents have what seems pretty clear from the documents any way on a level of complicity and in some cases that's\nScouts on the cake and in some cases that is about helping to arrange documents using outside counsel to\nActually falsified documents and one just think that this is something that could implicate teams in major league baseball the institution which is something that hasn't really happened before this is the first time so far as we can tell where you have this level of documentation\nClearly I mean as you've articulated this has been somewhat of an open secret for for generations really but now that you have the documents that allegedly show some of this a dubious recruiting behavior do you watch these players on these games differently\n[noise] it's interesting as applied with this information you do watch these games and some of these players differently you realize that the story of the extraction is often a lot more complex than if perhaps portrayed as being and you also wonder about the economics but again a lot of these players are not operating under the standard\nRate for agents you know four or five percent agent fee is not applying in a lot of these cases and to me one thing you think about it is just how many people along the way how many institutions even have profited by these players making it to the major leagues\n[noise] done were time of Sports Illustrated and she has a sixty minute John thanks for sharing
