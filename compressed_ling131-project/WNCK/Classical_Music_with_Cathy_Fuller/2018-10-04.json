week uh epidemic swept across Brazil as a result thousands of babies were born with microcephaly or I'd normally small heads among other impairments that come with that\nAround the same time BBC producer William Kramer had a child of his own who was also born with microcephaly although not because of the guy\nCramer wanted to know how Brazil's so called ... babies were developing so we went there and produced a radio documentary called the love stories among the people he met where'd you remind us why as she's the head of a support group for parents called United mothers of angels\nYou lost your emotional about this whole no ... to get him out of whom I gave us two options either be a victim and don't do anything or become a protectionist into the lives of these kids\nI talked with William Kramer about his reporting earlier this week can you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of this week a crisis and you meet this network of mothers\nYeah that's right I mean it was a remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds on educated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I went over that um they were very very they were very tight group loss of solidarity\nVery determined women some of them um\nA very determined women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common to special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which is called the ... mothers of angels\nOr this is a group in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's a ... one of the states which was was affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is you know really quite a powerful personality uh she doesn't matter how much you know she's one of these people that just give you a look and you sort of just stopped talking\nA but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians sympathetic ... people have talked to try and campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible prognosis that their children may not even survive beyond a year so\nI'm well how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are cut things up chest infections through breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand um there are children who are actually doing pretty well I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most as\nThey they were very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk to can stand there was some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind how bad is it you know at the at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achieve into that told me that that much much more um you know disabled\nSome of the children who are more physically disabled or actually talking to the left side\nAnd some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and and walk around it's an incredibly mixed thing\nI'm not so much so that you actually tell the story of twins a girl who was born with his ... and her brother did not was matter of fact it\nYeah it was you had this for a job that will go Minnesota Victoria she was cooled or she really couldn't move very much a tool she seemed very aware of what was going on around huh but then she had her twin brother who was turned off him who he was acting just like you would expect to turn off for a boy to act [noise]\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they don't really understand they didn't know why it affected one twin and not another ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that\nSome people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the cap\nYou write that Zeke affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nWhat ice or is that the families had a really thinking about the social aspect so while they're largely going to be like like [noise] what school are they going to go to ... and how would they be able to access a school um

Brazil and she was kind of giving talks to these women and giving them ... talks interest sort of saying you know you need to write to the main each right to the health sector chief telling to give you a bus to tell you a charter school you know this kind of thing\nAnd those are the kinds of social campaigning up the issues that they really start to deal with now\n[noise] I Wonder because you have this personal connection because your own daughter has microcephaly how did you come back from his Chet how did it did it change your alter the way you think about her condition in any way\nThe children were very some some of the children ... the political you mentioned Melissa the twin she especially with very similar to my gosh you reminded me so much with my ... year ago and holding how it was just like holding my little girl and\nHer mom was at that point where I was kind of Eighteen months ago when I was kind of despairing an Eighteen month Katie my daughter's done so much and I really wanted to say to ... she's gotta worry she'll come you know\nBut you can't you know you just don't know where every child different uh I just felt like they were very like kind of just as
