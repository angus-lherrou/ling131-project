whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are\nA niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products of them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think\nThat they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the ... met\nSome people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live in the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out\nThe government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people Alison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for

of Iraq has been semi autonomous since the U.S led a no fly zone there in the Nineteen nineties to protect the currents former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his interest joins us now from the Kurdish city ...\nGene I understand there are no official results yet that any indication as to what any Kurdish parliament could look like\nWell for the most part Rachel it's gonna be the status quo you know there are two main parties here that has existed for decades and they will continue their control but the interesting thing is their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections ties\nThe thing is their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections five years ago it seemed that young people and it looks like that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nMultitude of people you have to be actually I'm a reality but unfortunately for you to democracy is to make the ...\nInside the multi almost [noise]\n[noise] and my dad he means that he and a lot of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties\nSo what does that mean to people was turned out good as a result of this frustration you're at polling stations right\nYeah that was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears has always been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the PKK immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in a very few polling stations we got in one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch them start to count some of the ballot so there is an election official taking out each paper ballot because they decided not to do the automated your ballot counting because they think that leads to fraud\nAnd he's reading out the name of each party's very laborious process so even if the Supreme polling station which you'd think would be like super squeaky clean people trying to get him a fake IDs huh but really the question is whether the violations or serious enough to put the results in question\nRight so I mean we've heard for generations how the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there's an ... an innate tension between the Kurdish regional government and the central government in Baghdad so what how how could the new government in essentially Kurdistan\nAffects the the relationship with Baghdad absolutely\nYou've hit the nail on the head because they had a referendum last year saying do you want independence and the vast majority of Kurds said yes so the U.S says of course that it warned them not to hold this and there were serious repercussions after that\nThe Iraqi government sent in tanks so they're going to have to repair relations with Baghdad and a lot of other things on their plate as well the economy so it's all quite up in the air but um yeah a lot of challenges ahead for whatever emerges from this new government in the next couple\nOf days NPR's Jane Arraf in the
