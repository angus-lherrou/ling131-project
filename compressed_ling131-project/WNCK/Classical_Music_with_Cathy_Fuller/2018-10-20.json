source for informed guests and insightful commentary on a wide range of topics that impact the lives of every one\nIf you could name one American institution that pretty much looks the same since it's beginning what would it be chances are most people would say our schools and guess what they would be correct welcome to cross currents on NPR Nantucket in streaming on ... radio this is your host Scott\nWith fire over the next twenty three minutes I invite you to join us in here from a guy who's been called many things\nCommunity organizer activist dad reformer challenging the status quo and us secretary of education let's give a big welcome to Arnie Duncan who you'll remember as secretary of education\nDuring both terms of the Obama administration and before that head of the Chicago public school system which at one point in the Nineteen eighties were declared the worst in the nation by one of the army's\nPredecessors at the department of ed bill Bennett Arnie welcome to cross currents thanks for having me appreciate the opportunity\nYour friends and so the light would readily say that you never walk away from a challenge tell us what that is all about\n[laughter] try not to be scared I guess but uh I think\nIf you're trying to serve kids if you're trying to give kids a better education who desperately need it um that is the challenge that is the challenge\nSo what is what is there to walk away from that's the nature of the work and I think we all feel this huge sense of urgency that we have to help more kids have a chance in life and the consequences of not getting a good education today are obviously\nDisastrous not for you and I were lucky enough to to get a good education but for kids that don't have that privilege that don't have an opportunity the rest of your life the odds are stacked against that yeah\nSo to walk away from a challenger walk away for a fight or if you're fighting for kids it'd be a little hard to put yourself in there if you if you choose that [noise]\nYeah walking away is not an option\nOn cross currents we regularly focus on education and many voices in that field we talked to from Marc Tucker draining Weingarten the John marrow we've had top college presidents governors early childhood advocates\nArnie sense leading Washington you've returned back to your hometown of Chicago where you're leading a program for the ... and collect the called Chicago credit\nAnd they understand it focused on changing the landscape into the toughest areas of the city's south and west sides by\nWorking directly with young men who are most at risk of gun violence issues around gun violence and and joining gangs Arnie when you see how gun violence continues to rule the day in Chicago with homicide rates that are higher than both New York and LA combined how can we possibly have hope for the future\nWell the reality is still devastating but Scott honestly I'm actually very hopeful let me just sort of walking through the front and the issue is particularly acute here in my hometown of Chicago and while I'm honestly thrilled to DC\nTypically acute here in my hometown of Chicago and while I'm honestly thrilled about a D.C ended it back home [laughter] here with my family were living like three blocks from where I grew up which is you know fantastic our city is really really hurting\nAnd we're basically robbing kids of their childhoods kids can't go outside and play anymore\nThey're growing up of a level of fear and trauma unimaginable um it's not just Chicago issue as a national issue of race a generation of kids on mass shootings on gun violence\nAnd when I go talk to students which I Do all the time I stopped by apologizing we as adults haven't kept them safe and it it just breaks my heart we have to get to a better place so what are we doing here in Chicago um we're working as you said that the accurately Scott we're working directly with the young man on the south and west sides who are most\nWe have to vote for candidates again Republican or Democrat I could care less on the politics\nWho just want our kids to grow up you know free of fear and I would argue who are going to help to educate pet and I wish those who aren't radical concepts but sometimes I feel like they are\nWell hopefully when people do it on a number six they'll remember the Parkland kids know remember how else can they then these kids really have the answers to the problems that we're dealing with around gun violence let's just the topic in our schools continue to we need a little progress but we continue to fall behind in international comparisons\nOur teachers are still are not elevated to the status of other professions and like you say in your book we either have low expectations or no expectations with respect to education and district leaders you mentioned this continue to promulgate lies about how our kids are doing elaborate on that or any\nYet it and there are few allies again that's a provocative way to to start the book but I sort of say what I Believe the I'll I'll give you a couple um for me the biggest lie we just talked about it is that we all say we we care about children and you wouldn't\nYou wouldn't be any out of the country say said oh no we don't care about kids but we continue\nDay after day week after week\nTo choose to allow them to grow up\nWith these mass shootings and grow up with the fear and trauma a related to that and if we truly value to our children we would do something about this gun violence and again I I just pray that we do that in a in November and a couple of weeks now so that that's for me is the biggest lie but we say we value our children but our actions don't\nDemonstrate that I get I I don't listen to so much what people say I watched her actions I look at their budgets I look at their policy positions\nAnd when we say we we value kids and we don't act to do that\nUm I picked up for life I think that's a by the second one is that we say we value our teachers but I argue that we we desperately under pay our teachers we don't train them as ... as you just talked about we don't give them real good mentoring and career ladders and if\nWe truly value teachers we would pay them you'll significantly more I Would say principles a heck of a lot more pay teachers more who take on difficult assignments be that you know inner city urban or rural or remote on it or Native American a reservation where the shortages\nAnd so everyone say we value teachers but we don't demonstrate that with our budgets with our with our with our values the final thing is that we say we value education and again I Want to say we do about Scott how many of us go to the voting booth\nAt local elections state\nNational doesn't matter and actually vote for candidates\nWho are going to hold themselves accountable for increasing access to pre K.\nAnd increasing high school graduation rates and making college more accessible and more affordable and the truth is almost none of us vote based upon\nIn increasing education opportunity right\nAnd so politicians would give you the soundbites they all love to visit classrooms they all have the photo ops they'll let the pet little kids on their head or whatever but they don't commit ... Scott I blame us as voters not is not not the politicians when you watch the presidential debates I Would always be like um ... noodles I Can't wait for us to talk about education\nEducation never comes on and never come into it because we don't vote on it and so those are the those are the\nBig lives you know we say we value our kids but we don't protect them we don't keep them\nSafe we say we value teachers but we don't pay them as festivals and we said we value education but we don't vote for candidates that are serious about education and\nThat's why I got I think we're not getting better\nFaster relative to other countries other countries they simply invest more in other countries have universal access to prepay so our babies enter kindergarten ready to be successful re rank twenty eight twenty nine ths thirtieth relative to other countries to provide access to pre K. the dismal funny record we should be ashamed yeah\nI'm so those are just a few of the lives that that I talk about it in the in the book\nYeah we can go on and on and I want to remind our listeners your tuned to cross currents on NPR Nantucket in standing on the island radio search cross currents with ... and don't forget the lights on Facebook cross currents brought you life partners a leader in global communications marketing research\nLearn more than ... dot com we're back with Arnie Duncan we still have a lot to cover in the balance today show\nArmy in your book you prescribe moving from the current pre K. twelve focus to a pre K. fourteen focus\nI Know there's a number of high school reform efforts unfolding today that could be transformative including the execution highschool future work and out of the alliance for excellent education and there's others give us a sense of what you think it's\nAnd out of the alliance for excellent education and there's others give us a sense of what you think is needed to make high schools more relevant in the twenty first century\nYeah all that so that one second let me just sort of good the larger point is that we've had for the past century uh K. to twelve model but I think it's served as very very well and I think is driven a lot of our economic prosperity a at a thriving middle class but I think what has worked well for the past century is frankly inadequate not even for the next century\nBut for the next five or ten years and so yes I think we have to go to a pre K to fourteen model and as I said earlier we have to get our baby softer good start had them entering kindergarten ready to be successful academically and socially and emotionally but then as you know Scott if you just have a high school diploma today um it's really really hard to get good paying job\nAnd so some form of education beyond high school for year universities two year community colleges trade technical vocational training some form of education be on the high school\nHas to be the goal for every single young person around the country is not about sorting kid telling me you know your college material you got to go to a world of work or whatever but kids find their passion find their interest and let's help them be successful or whatever that that path may be we were very very proud to get high school graduation rates up to eighty four percent which is an all time high\nA historic high for the country Scott but as you know that's no it's nowhere near high enough when young people dropped out of high school today they're basically condemned to to poverty into social failure\nAnd when I talk to young people and the young man I'm working with now is that travel the country why do people drop out of high school it's it's so interesting it is very rarely because high school was too hard sometimes but very rarely\nIt's often high school was too easy and more so more than ... it's like high school for it I don't get it wise is important\nIn filmmaking high school much more engaging\nMuch more hands on learning many more ties to the real world\nThat's the work of whether it's you know X cue or whether it's as you talked about the the alliance for excellent education of how do we re imagined high school so the kids totally understand why this is good for them why do I need to learn this algebra why's this trick relevant to to my life why don't need to learn you know\nA calculus or physics or biology\nAnd where kids understand the relevance and know what this means for their life they're\nExcited that they're engaged and that hands on learning a moving away from the time to competency I'm just so many innovations that I think would help us continue to reduce that high school dropout right rate and give young people a chance to be successful not just in high school but for the rest of their lives that's what's truly at stake here\nWe're almost out of town they just got a couple of little short pop up questions and I think I Know the answer to some of these but do you ever hear from Betsy does all the current secretary of education\nWell it it's so interesting Scott that um the short answer is no and I'm I reached out repeatedly to to my predecessors Republican and Democrat it didn't matter and I tell you I learned so much from Margaret Spellings in rod page and bill Bennett an addict Riley these are these are people who\nAlways would pick up the phone call always give me their best thinking\nAnd it's a small club of folks who have ever had this chops you know it's not a\nTon of healing for Thirty years\nRight so else except people living and so but that invite that advice that they gave me was invaluable and the fact that the current administration has has no interest and learned are no interest in a in an opinion I think speaks volumes about what they're real priorities our\nLast question teacher unions affecting ineffective what do you think\nUm I think we need strong unions and we've had as you know a couple of teachers' strikes in states that have been led by Republican governors have starved you know public education whether it's in West Virginia or Oklahoma Arizona and so I think again if we're really trying to professional lives education they need to be teachers need to be paid\nBetter paid more than adequately ... some unions are more progressive something a little bit you know I think you could go um could be more thoughtful about\nYou know crazy they're real true profession but I absolutely will always fight to have you know teachers well compensated and respected unions are are critical or or um to that to that process\nWell that's the last word from Arnie Duncan I definitely encourage you didn't check out his new book worm ... what was going on in American education and other learned about the new rule that he's playing\nIn cities across the country I think even being part of cross currents were signing on days when my arm keep in touch and remember a little bit in the mountains without controversy in the new sending evil and overcome we now have a great thanks earning\nA great job making ... mosque earns which God wouldn't mind my Nantucket ... NPR station W and she came to an end again next time for insightful commentary on top of that impacts everyone's life prosecutor in the sky when [noise]\n\n\n\nOur small had rain in our small spaces and\nYou know I I think about this and to me New York is one of the greenest cities on earth and again\nThat may not be the the sort of prevailing wisdom but if you think about it we don't own cars we take public transportation we live in small apartments we use very little energy we are famous for our water which we drink from the tap\nSo you know it's it's and we walk a lot we walk a lot we don't have those big refrigerators and coolers where you sort of stockpile all your groceries and you know have have extra freezers and things like that\nUm you know so it made me really aware of how important it is not to waste things not to agree to much waste too much garbage to keep my area and my space clean to use the trash bin you know things like that\nUm and you know we have a long way to go here and we can't really compete with you know our friends in Boulder who banned plastic bags raid or\nUm my daughter lives in Austin where they pioneered the first green building program you know other cities like San Francisco they require recycling and composting but but we're getting there we're getting there\nMhm mhm [noise] how do you think that that has impacted your late ... how do you approach life\nI Am an optimist\nSometimes for better or sometimes for worse um I really have a very positive instinctual attitude towards life and I think\nI got that from my grandmother I think we all have a few people in our lives who imprint something important on us when we're kids and and my grandmother was that person um she lived to be Ninety nine and honestly Joanna she lived on black coffee rare steak and intimate it's coffee cake\n[laughter] but [laughter] not exactly your [laughter] your wellness or you're a healthy diet remotely with little packs of um artificial sweetener in a big handbag button I\nAm one hundred percent convinced that it was her optimism that led to her longevity and there's research now to back that up which is why\nWe're all talking about how to manage my stress right because we know how harmful it can be and we know how to much stress\nCan lead to inflammation which can lead to disease right right so um you know people are much more aware of trying to frame of things in a positive way um\nAnd you know one of my slogans honestly is something that Martin Luther king said\nWhich was um let me get this raid we must accept finite disappointment but never lose\nInfinite hope and that's kind of the creative for me [noise]\nWow that's great I Love that [laughter] I mean I I think you know having no sort of guard guiding principles are important\nThey are and you know it's um\nIt keeps you going really you know if you can keep your eye on the ball in that way\nAnd I I think you know that sometimes we don't realize how important we are in crafting that's for our children to or or grandchildren if your grandparents you know and how much of an imprint you can make\nOn a person as they're growing up but um\nBut staying positive you know is something that I talk to people a lot when people get discouraged about this or that and it's just so important to\nUnderstand that the world revolves in cycles and we've seen bad ones before we've seen good once before and we have to stay positive and do the work and keep on going and inspire other people as much as we can ...\n[noise] I like it um how do you define ballot [noise]\nYou know that's I think that's an interesting question um\nTo me the world is full of opposite you know you have ... people you have ... people you have proud people you have humbled people you have honest and dishonest people good times bad times\nUm for me that kernel of truth is found in that ... in the perspective of balance in a positive attitude and resilience and in love\nSo finding that middle ground always where where people can come together we're where an individual can come together with themselves in a healthy way for me is what balance is all about and sometimes\nSometimes it takes work you know sometimes we really have to do work hard to break out of\nA negative or positive and achieve that kind of balance but I'm ultimately the outcome in any situation is better if we can find that\n... yes in ... how do you feel about inspiration where do you where do you find inspiration\nWell I find so much inspiration in my neighborhood in New York you know if I get stuck inside my own head if I'm sitting at my computer and I just can't seem to move forward all I Need to do is walk out of my building and walk around the neighborhood and\nInevitably I Will see something that will crack me up or that will inspire me or trigger an idea or you know or or just you know be amazing [noise]\nUm I read a lot I travel a lot I talk a lot and I I find a lot of inspiration and people and in art\nI Love to walk across Central Park and go to the Metropolitan Museum of art or moma for a break and I'm really lucky because I can do that\nJust spend an hour at the museum just walk across the park spend an hour at the met\nGo look at one exhibition and then come back and it clear my head [laughter] um I Love nature um which a lot of the time when I'm not traveling means a walk in Central Park which is not what most people would think of\nBut um I find nature more relaxing than inspiring\nMhm mhm yeah\nAnd there's a third word that I like to explore here which is you know granted you know his I think that you know balance inspiration and gratitude all sort of go together\nWill they do and gratitude is\nThey're well they do and gratitude is highly under rated um I Am grateful for every day and as I get older\nI become more aware of the passage of time which makes me more aware of the importance of not wasting it so I Am grateful for\nThe love of my family and friends and all of the beauty that I see around me and I'm grateful in this moment for all the women who have had the courage to speak out on behalf of all of us\nRaid and remind us that we can't take anything for the you know anything anything that was once worth fighting for his still worth fighting for you know\nAnd a great example of that is for me the right to vote\nWhich many people don't have around the world and I'm grateful for that voice especially when you think that women didn't gain the right to vote here in the United states until sixty years after slavery was abolished so you know we we we need to be grateful\nYeah very very good point [laughter] especially in these ... times and especially\nIn these days and times absolutely absolutely I think it can be challenging to

Chatham a and more and more has has the biggest population great point\nWe'll give it a run for the money I'm sure but um\nBut it seems to be monitored more seems to be where they are what\nWas definitely in the news uh this this summer and uh and Greg who you spoke of has done a lot of tagging and a lot of these sharks have a tag on them so they can track where they are where they're going where they've been which I think only helps us with uh the behavior or an absolutely\nSo going forward we're going into winter what is winter like for for your department of you know once you get into
