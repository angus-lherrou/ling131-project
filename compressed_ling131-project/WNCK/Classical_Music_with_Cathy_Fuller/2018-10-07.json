I didn't\nKnow how to live with and she gave me two pieces of the best advice I see\nOne wise you can't as long you're going to have to hire a blond yeah how ... and she helped me that they have this is the courts and everyone else the banks than everyone else who wants to death certificate probate all of those things and um\nThey will not give you time to gory\nNow and so my daughter helped me\nAnd personal assistant taping it could go down to my husband's off as clean out I'll thought through records I had no choice under the circumstances that immediately to work\nLike you said very little time to agree\nOne of the interesting points in your book and and I love how you weave through and there's a lot of spiritual connections with the book and you we've biblical pieces into the book as well and particularly around Paul's letter to the Libyan\nTell us what drove you to think you know how policy letter to the ... and we all hear about this when we're in church or were reading the Bible tell us how that\nReally drove your thinking in putting this book together because your book covers a lot from Paul's letter\nI tell the family story in math but I have my great aunt and her entire life on a subsistence farm in rural Mississippi and when she died written in the ... for her five what was the first whatsoever said I Am with the content\nWas a very very young child when she died so I heard this story from my mother\nMy entire life and that was very very ill you're\nJust waiting for him I said we\nHad ... points in my life when I have read Italy and depressed discouraged I have read it as real or ages were rejoice or joy is watching that and when any place else that's old or new tests\nAnd that that's what I read it and the way all morning hours after my husband died\nAnd I just needed to hear those words that are over and over and over again and so it was bad for your lighter walking down main street I'm Talking [laughter] that I\nCould actually happy I Can't believe you know and so it was natural for me to turn back to Libya they use it as an yeah I can read it I guess that's the question because it has to be but that's the Libyans pride pride they approached\nI wrote it I think the practical ice is timeless that's how universal\nYeah in the book does not come across it all is a Christian book I mean there's obviously Christianity we each through it but it's not a Christian book uh it's definitely a spiritual book\nSo as much as the Libyans drove you I Do want to touch on this because our show originates on Nantucket obviously Nantucket played a big role in helping you move from a tragic place in your life to kind of a whole new life so talk about that I I I Do want to read one little passage\nOr that you have in the book I'm not going to quote at all but just a very short quote\nAnd it is we all need a place that gives us peace and settled happiness a place of both good memories and keen anticipation\nFor me that place with Nantucket\nAnd that really touched me because you know Nantucket is it holds a special place in my life as well but tell us how Nantucket helped you really kind of turn the corner as well\nI was ... when I went there I was afraid to go to a a week I had never been inside a place where I knew\nRight oh hey a week I had never been in a place where I where I'm at right now you mentioned that in the book\nTo be a oh for a while that the ... the ... ... what am I ... and ... ... ... well hunger and while I'm correct now for a house\nI'm All right now but at house next summer

thing I mean I get it to read to the black or\nWhite men have you mentioned that yeah right oh\nYes yes he's quiet and very far if well yes there is a history from women were alone going back that's

and take good care and I look forward to seeing you on TALK it thank you so much Scott\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nCross currents which God would mark on Nantucket ... NPR station WAMC Kaye doing it again next time for insightful commentary on topics that impact every one's life cross currents which would mind\n[noise]\nOkay so that's why I'm\nHere and that's why you're there and that's very cool and um and I know that you would have thought about having other locations for doing like tell me about that process\nYeah I mean it's it's already kind of the gun in some circumstances that guy partner with a hotel in Malibu, California\nFor a year and a half and I did like a retail component and their lobby and then I fill out the space in the back that was um a beautiful wellness center and so we did yoga and massage\nA beautiful wellness center\nAnd so we did yoga and massage and re key and found healing and all kinds of things um and then I said a pop up in um\nThe canal street market which is in Manhattan It's right on ... street you know and it's like I'm In like a community retail space um and then I Do so I Do\nPartnership pop up like all over the place that we've done them with men rep Heller we've done them with\nA Lulu lemon we've done them with the whole house of your peers are anywhere I can continue to share you know the gifts of what happens in this place an outrage but that's the thing that has been very apparent as what happens\nIn this door need to spread and it needs to be\nUm accessible to more people across the world because it again it is like\nIt's a feeling so when you come in here and you do the things you leave feeling happier and better about life I mean it's almost unexplainable because it's something you have to experience\nBut I just I Know it's like my sole purpose to do this you know\nWho you're going to mission\nOh yeah [laughter] so what so and it's go ahead\nWell I was just going to add you know I've also comes from a background of like working in corporate America and some of my design years and I see how business works and I see how I Do business that is different than the way other people do business which is person to person again and it\nYou know it's for the betterment of a greater cause rather than a bottom line dollar I mean we all have to make money and there has to be you know a financial purpose for what we do but it can't be what Dr ...\nRight right it's a you know it's the triple bottom line people profit planet and\nMhm yep\nI'm so in your store in Brooklyn which your favorite thing about it\nOh gosh it's so hard to say one thing I'm\nJust ... well I mean I what I think that our products like the ... the products that are very special because again what I've done is partnered with our current vendors I Would say we had a candle maker and she is a local candle company\nAnd she started out selling here we were second store or something so for me what's really exciting is to say hey candle maker friend we would love to do a collaboration Kendall with you ... for our stores\nAnd support for not only from another business development but also we get another\nProduct that's in line with what the growth of this Brant [noise] mhm so\nWe do candles reduced in care we jewelry we do have files and then personally under my label we still do apparel and clothes and home good so for me it's like sharing the experience which is\nFrom a business standpoint double the work because you have more cooks in the kitchen but from a story in a relationship perspective it's so important to be doing that for me\nThat's great that's ... that is really great congratulations\nThanks yeah it's been amazing 'cause even we've done amenities for hotels you know so then it's like we partner on bigger projects for other people as well right so it's like a little incubator\nWith that has the impact of the ripple effect right you're rippling out into the world\nYeah exactly yeah\nSo so what is next like what is next and your heroes and what's the next plan\nFor the next plan is\nSo after closing them out of their space um there was a bit of a temporary situation I absolutely know that we need a location in LA absolutely know that when you look in the Midwest\nAnd in the Pacific northwest so it and it's you know at this point if people reaching\nOut to me and saying we need what you do here and we need to sit here and I've got great practitioners over here and\nYou know it's it's the most heartwarming\nCommunication I can ever received because it's now people under stand it from a different perspective so I'm looking for the you know financial partnership of how to take us to another level and really you know because I started the store with\nA tiny amount of money all by myself with a free and fair and for six months\nAnd have worked it and worked and worked at heart and soul and blood and sweat and tears to what it is now and\nYou know now it's time we've built it we know what it does we know what it's April Fool's doing envy on so we just made that partnership to give it get up to the next level\nSo it's time to ruin out yet [laughter] All right so I'm definitely we need to put that sort of requests out into the universe yeah yeah\nSo I'm told me about your life right like what are the things you do to stay inspired were be balanced or even to find the talent that you have in the store\nUm well I Love to travel first and foremost so any second I can like get away just to see a different part of the world or\nBe in a different culture like anything from that perspective gives me creativity and it gives me ideas for how we can do things better how we can make things better um\nYou know I Do I I still\nBelieve in doing fitness as much as possible and right now I'm into a rumble which is like a boxing cardio bank [laughter] so I exercise as much as like and um which is part of the gross because we have in our wellness center don't air as we do ... yoga classes\nUm embark classes but we can if you know it's a small space that we can fit maximum eight people\nOkay so you know rolling not out into a more holistic fitness face is the goal\nAnd then\nI it's just so I being out in the world and connecting with people and to me is the most inspiring\nAnd I love hearing people's stories I Love sharing in other people's services so I'll just before other you know wellness centers or stores or whatever it may be just to kind of spread the love\nYou and where do you think you know all these services in classes there in this constant evolution pattern as people wanted to bring healing ... or they find things that appeal because I think it's human nature when you do things you know when you get when you do the same thing over and over\nThis I think it's human nature when you do things you know when you get when you do the same thing over and over again it can become more boring right exactly so how do you see ...\nWell this is really interesting because I was just having this conversation yesterday because um and I was\nLearning about numerology yesterday and the woman I was speaking with said that I don't know eight years ago\nIs when people started there was a shift in the way we were doing things and yoga got really big and everybody started being into yoga and we all kind of shifted and said okay we need to start stretching and breathing so that's been an eight year process\nOf us like opening up and ask for opening up it becomes this more intense process because now you have to make the time to do\nThe yoga do the things and be prepared for what it means to be more open hearted and to live a life that's in a more conscious way which is harder than going through life and just doing the things eating the food routine and so\nTo that point we have to find a place that\nPersonally what I think is allowing individuals know their own balance and teaching people to trust what they want to do what they need for their bodies but they need for their cells\nWhat they mean to be happy in the world because it's not that's just not out there for people so if you can really take one on one\nYou know like if it's if it's a fitness class we're all going to go to the fitness and like maybe someone's going to tell great maybe if someone's going to feel totally exhausted maybe they're going to afterwards go eat like\nPrograms on eighty nine point five WINZ KF or under written in part by the Cape cod five cents savings bank serving Nantucket with two

NPR dot ORG show was presented by the town of talking I'm David Martin president of the new Tucker chamber of commerce my guest\nToday is a good friend Jason bridges who is chair of the town of Nantucket select board\nUh owner or in poor there I guess you could say of the ... cafe in Oregon and coffee sorry\nThat I read about it when I started on her own with my ... my favorite my favorite place for coffee so it's it's a thank you for being on the show it's good to uh it's good to see you know one of my favorite stories Jason is that uh\nWhen I was I'm kind of debating on whether I was going to move to the island or whether or not to move to new talk it I remember I had to vote I had a ... vote with the time I had the vote the HGTV episode of you and your lovely\nThe TiVo at the time I had TiVo the HGTV episode of you and your lovely wife Courtney\nHouse hunting on the island and I felt like I knew you because I was trying to decide whether or not to make the move I was trying to find out a little bit more about the island I Would watch that show over and over and I think\nWhat I've told people one of the unique experiences that uh that I had if I moved here on a Sunday I moved in and have a got up in the morning on Monday got dressed out of boxes that I had an impact you had parked in the town lot walking my way to the chamber office at zero main street and the very first person\nI saw was you and I we didn't hockey were on the phone you were outside of the handle bar but I I remember I remember looking at you and\nThinking oh my God there is and you know or so and I've gotten to know you pretty well you're of course now the chair of the a ton of Nantucket select board and is a big um special town meeting coming up that's Wednesday October tenth or and this is divided into two uh the segments than one at six and one is seven\nThirty correct yes yup what's the reason for that so by charter anybody can have their own special town meeting so you and I if we wanted to go out and get enough signatures and we can have a special town meeting so certain citizens went out and they wanted a warrants articles\nOn a special town meeting and they timed it so we can have the same time versus having it a month later and having a town clerk's office set everything back up and having all of us come back and the other night and getting babysitters and taking off work to to to come here so they\nThey timed it so we have to so technically we have to say when does it start so people can show up maybe specifically for that one\nAnd so what'll happen is will be going through our regular special town meeting in at seven thirty will have to\nOpen up the special special right that's the number two and then make a motion to go back to the first one and if there's just a little bit of time left OK finish it up and then get into the second one that it does that's kind of how that works\nA lot to talk about uh I Know the first number of articles are all have to do\nWith a marijuana and the and the legalization of marijuana or I Know from um my role as a regional tourism council representative on behalf of Nantucket with the state a tourism I'm dealing with um marijuana\nA a store front and and you you know you have the you have that that smell that everybody's associated with and it goes beyond just smoking it's you've got beverages you've got edibles you've got a topical products you've got ... for for pain out of those types of products work into this process\nThink all of the the medical products were CBD and in those type of things I'm the medical side of a whip nobody who has a problem with but the edibles like the ... you know the candies and that kind of stuff there's been a lot of concern on the select bored out of the skin hands of children right right that's why we're concerned so\nCandles control commission is concerned about this and they said no candies but they also\nCould while I'm reading as it could look like a cough drop is type thing which to me that seems like candy but if it looked like it was in pill form this is what I'm advocating for right pill form in a little box that's you know child proof and it's in your area of your house\nThe other you know medications are than to me that makes sense and you're already taught your kids not to not such those things and it's the edible as they get tricky so it's you know you can self regulated\nI mean most most people are pretty responsible they're not going to allow the ... round is to go to the kids right but that's the vision that like this is what's gonna happen if we have medical\nThere was all use Smith you know medical marijuana so we're a little skeptical on the animals right now just we don't we we don't know what that looks like does it look like a gummy bear and we said no to that you know we we don't want any of those things starting off\nOr or maybe never\nI mean that makes sense to me I I ... well it and you know what it does to me to as as a father I've seen those and a lot of times they're individually wrapped it does look like a gummy bear it looks like a piece of candy you would buy in a in a candy store\nAnd uh it it can be very confusing there was the story a couple of months ago where a ... a youngster in elementary age a student I'm actually got his hands on one and and they made him quite ill\nAnd and I I Know that's a a that's a that's something that everybody everybody worries about\nI'm wearing island where surrounded by federal waters\nA federal air this has been talked about it I I Know a few people have asked me about it that are confused about it how do we get around that has that been been talked about because it's a little hard to grow it here if you can't get the legally can't get the seats here\nI think the state is looking the other way on how the seeds are going to get her they're assuming that the seats are already here or have every time I asked that question to the state because you know they say next question right because if not they would never be technically you would never start sure but I wanted a star\nBut technically you would never start sure but I wanted to start and I don't know the process of how to how to grow these plants but once you start to believe that you can continue to keep going you have to bring any more seeds over\nUm what we're trying to look down the road you know I've got conversations with other members of what happens when the if the feds open this up and it's and it's it's legal across our country\nThen you can get here\nOne of the advantage of this now is can we keep\nCan we keep them the money on the island ... and ... you know so it's not so not just bringing in product from somewhere else we can grow it here which means jobs which means\nWe have to produce it here manufacture here it's attached to test it here I I like all those ideas right right I mean I'm always looking for any other smaller industry even as small as it can be\nFor this island because right now it's just ... tourism\nNot that we're going to get you know a thousand jobs from the marijuana industry but you know you could pick away at it whether you know whether I have these dreams of having to ship building complex is here and\nYou know schools and that type of stuff just to add on to our economy so we're not depend or eggs aren't one basket so this is a little one I liked that idea but if the feds open it up then what happens how do we stop big marijuana which is slowly happening\nFrom kind of affecting us in a negative way and it's hard to think down the road or something that's not happened yet how do we prepare for that I think that's why we're trying to start off slower and a little more restrictive\n... restrictive side their body feels comfortable and it's safe but at the same time these businesses have to succeed as well I Can't we can't make it so restrictive that we all go out of business some people might want that\nNow you have to grow it here you have to test it here before you can sell it here is that economically feasible for a\nA business so that's the question for article five do we limits\nThe adult use recreation licensed to that's the question so that passes\nThan the select ... can only give out to licenses okay right and if it doesn't pass then we can still only give out to licenses but then we have to we don't have a general via law to help us say sorry number three or four or five who want to come here you can't we only have to\nTo the general by law makes it much easier for like word to control it now we can still say no to three four five six or nine or whoever is knocking on the door\nBut it's harder right without the general bottle okay and so I've I've got a lot of people come to me saying you're limiting this what you're doing is you're making these two licenses really expensive\nRight so somebody can start it and they can sell their license because there is only too if you leave it to market conditions two or three oldest it'll it'll work itself out right and the best will survive right coffee shops there is not limit of two or ten\nOr you wish that we're we're in is not really actually right because that motivates me oh no it's kind of coffee in the best sharing the best music in the best experience in our shop yeah\nSo there's some there's there's a legit debate there you're looking to the future\nA little bit you get through these these five articles things are approved everything has talked through where do you see this in six months where do you see this in a year as marijuana here and ah is it is successful thriving business on Nantucket\nBy next summer\nThere may be one possible you know there's there's one already\nGoing in the process already has a building and location that's already built they're just they're building already right right now and that's more in the medical side right in the medical side and they have to go through we've already given one applicant approve their host community agreement which they ... they would they have to have\nBefore they can go to the next level next stage of the state process and\nSo this is where it gets complicated so we've limited to two does that mean we've already given out one licensing our only choosing one\nThat I mean that's that's you know there's a lotta people who don't like that but we were Ninety five Ninety percent down the road with this one applicant before\nOther applicants came in so do we stop with this going forward with this one that we've been working with for a year because we have these new people you know limits to to um I think every were holding off everything right now sure until after a special town meeting for does look like next year\nUh I think there'll be maybe one open and the second one\nWorking to be open depends on how you build your facility or by next fall maybe there'll be right one one open is it thriving I I think it's going to be\nThe the people who are a little scared of it you know our our may be cautious are going to kind of drive by and go oh nothing's really nothing's really happened right\nWell it it's uh it it makes the Wednesday October tenth special town meeting even that much\nMore of an important get together for for everybody I Know a lot of people are concerned and uh I I appreciate you you are putting some clarity into this discussion because uh I think he would agree um if you could take a word it's confusing to ah to everybody here\nIt is really as it has it been established yet and there's a lot of fear with this I mean this is a is a drug we're talking about not trying to\nUh a license and to try something else back to the ship building the two more shipbuilders on that island right or this is a little scary some unknowns or public safety issues\nJust anything unknowns is a little um there's reason to be cautious\nAppreciate you talking to us through you're going to come back next week 'cause we're gonna talk about a few other things are not related to marijuana that will come up with the town meeting and again that is happening Wednesday October tense at the Nantucket high school in the Walker auditorium special town meeting number one happens it's six o'clock special town meeting number two\nHappens at a at seven thirty but thank you for being here and we'll get back together
