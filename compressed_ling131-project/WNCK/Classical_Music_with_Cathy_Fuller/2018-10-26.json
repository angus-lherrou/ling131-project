be pipe bombs this week\nCirrhosis of hedge fund investor and philanthropists who donated to causes many of them progressive around the world and we should note that the open society foundation which he founded in Nineteen Ninety three has been a financial supporter of NPR\nJoin us as a lot of enemies in politics he's been a target of conspiracy theories from the right\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of more money than God a history of the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages well the whole phenomenon\nOf the pipe bomb or the surprises me in a poor me but um if you were to say that somebody were to make a list or you know progressive leaders they wants to attack\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised to see George Soros on that list I think he is the single most important known politician\nI'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen thirty or well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary a serious childhood was donated by the Nazi occupation in this country and he survived by separating from his family and I think that ... explains a lot about the focus of its financial in politics and they lash\nExplains a lot about the focus of his finance or in his politics and they live and he left hungry at Seventeen to go to London and from that he went into financing moved to New York he opened one of the very early hedge funds in New York and it was a very successful\nStock market trader so that by around Nineteen eighty he was worth a hundred million dollars but I was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties nineties\nAnd tell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\n[noise] well I'm In the nineties a specialty whereas a currency peg than looked unsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England couldn't keep the British pound linked to the German deutsche mark\nAnd when the person's right or the pound collapse are us made enough food for sure and the u._k. economy a descended into chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nIf the gun in his native Hungary and then in other Eastern European countries where his finance ... he had a clear political confidence which was to build for less than that he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties on words but\nThe switch came in two thousand tree when he waited into us politics because of the Iraq War there once it became clear in two thousand four\nQuite how much money he was spending on democratic get out the vote courses that was the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans a and it became a useful trick\nIf you are being attacked in the major and you were a Republican member of Congress to say well the major is sharing me their credit set of SARS and his allies have put them up to it\nWhy does George Soros and particularly becomes seen as a shadowy figure hiding and talked to is it just because he has so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as Saturday you caught expanding rushing the birth actually his so that's you call the open society Institute He's very open about it he partnership figures are about where that donations go so I think it's hard to escape the suspicion that the critics you say he shot every\nI'm a ... on a long tradition of anti Semitism where Jewish finances are portrayed as the shattered me if it goes through manipulate the politicians and therefore I think it's a fairly clear indication of that tradition\nWell what do people in his native hungry think of Soros\n[noise] he was a hero early on in the transition away from communism things have turned more recently because of the anti migration populist nationalism taken over the country\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of several books and a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations thank you so much\nThank you President Trump is headed to Charlotte North Carolina today to rally supporters for Republican congressional candidate mark Harris\nHarris it's gotten a tight race in a former Republican stronghold against Democrat Dan McCready NPR's Kelsey Snell has more on how major shifts in North Carolina politics mirror changes across America\nFor more than fifty years voters in the Knight congressional district in North Carolina had been sending Republicans to Congress but things are changing this year Harris a conservative Baptist minister is slipping in the polls behind mccready a Democrat and former marine\nDavid the Clinton a professor of political science at Meredith College says the Trump rally is a sign that Republicans have to fight harder than there used to\nThe fact that President Trump is coming in is a sign that they still see that raises winnable it would've been inconceivable two decades ago for a Republican president to me become into that district\nNick Clinton said because of shifting demographics people from other states and other countries are flocking to jobs in places like Raleigh Durham and Charlotte young generations of farmers are doing it too he sounds like the rest of America a Democrat in North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you've got\nYou look at the political finds I mean you can almost see the county line the shift between the Democratic signs are on one side of the county line then you move into another county and more rural county and all of a sudden it's Trump country\nThe line isn't so clear in other areas like Polk County where the view of the political trend line depends on who you ask county commissioner ray gas ... says the areas about sixty percent Republican but he's the only elected Democrat\nAnd when he sees his party dominating in statewide offices in the future that doesn't mean the entire state is turning blue\nWe have a hundred and ... and ... percent or very rule which for him to go much more Republican\nCounty Republican chairman ... says rural Republican voters like Trump\nI'm seeing a trend where there's a movement away from the Democratic party to the Republican Party just because there is a lot of dissatisfaction with what has been going on at the national level\nTrump certainly could be the clothing pitch for Republicans who want to keep at least
