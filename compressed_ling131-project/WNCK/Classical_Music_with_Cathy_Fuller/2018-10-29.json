display until Saturday November third along with the exhibition titled all things great and small thank you for joining me today Molly\nThank you for inviting me less excited to be here\nSo now Molly can you tell us when you first started making art\nSo I really can't remember a time when I wasn't making art in some form during my life I'm the urge to create things as solid me from a young age and art education was always provided for me by my generous and creative parents\nSo I think by the time I got to high school I realize that art and art history we're always going to be defining elements to my personal an academic life and when I took a print making workshop at mass College of art back in my twenties I knew I had found my medium\nThat's great so interesting now Molly you have a long history on Nantucket your grandmother Gwen guy yard owns the opera house restaurant so you must have had some very interesting visits to the island can you tell us what about the island inspires you\nNeed it took it is really um a place that's endlessly inspiring to me that holds the place in my memory it's filled with a really rich history goes stories famous vendors\nAnd of course spectacular imagery to work with um kind of around every corner so I'm at the island culture and its community and the ecosystem here also fascinating places to study um and we're up to slow down a bit when we're here which allows for maybe more careful observation of our surroundings\nA well put so now Molly can you tell us about your work and your process\nSo typically I consider myself a polygraph print maker which means they use the collage image honest if not bored to make prints from and then make multiples of an image and then I lay or other images on top of them for those who aren't familiar with the process I tell them it's like making a giant stamp 'em and after the prints are made\nI occasionally and now more often than not will paint on top of the print sad dimension\nUm and the majority of my work in recent years is centered around the way human memory processes imagery I create semi it's abstract shapes and forms a drop of memories of time spent near the ocean or on the beach\nWow well I Can't wait to see or new work and congratulations on your solo show can you tell us a little about what we'll see in this show\nSo this show is I'm going to be a jumping off point a combination of some new collage work where I Am taking prints and papers and repurposed thing my material to form abstract the geographic points on Nantucket\nUm it's going to be a way that I'm sort of pushing my medium to make a change in my practice a because it's vital to to sort of keep that creative stamina going to try something different\nAbsolutely and so interesting

had no scaffold stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert

you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nI just did the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patients being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she did that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I walked into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr they're reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive still Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief or partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test [noise]\nUh yeah it's nice\nTo have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advising you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so with everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expense who could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert and the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser
