life\nUm search to create things has followed me from a young age and art education was always provided for me by my generous and creative parents\nSo I think by the time I got to high school I realize that art and art history we're always going to be defining elements to my personal an academic life and when I took a print making workshop at mass College of art back in my twenties I knew I

your work and your process\nSo typically I consider myself a polygraph print maker which means they use the collage image honest if not bored to make prints from and then make multiples of an image and then they layer other images on top of them for those who aren't familiar with the process I tell them it's like making a giant stamp on and after the prints are made\nI occasionally and now more often than not well paint on top of the prints to add dimension um and the majority of my work in recent years is centered around the way human memory processes imagery I create semi has abducted

EDITION from NPR News I'm Noel King and I'm David Greene eight out of ten white evangelicals voted for President Trump in twenty sixteen and poll suggests they continue to strongly support him\nBut ahead of the mid term elections new group is trying to carve out a space for evangelicals who find themselves at odds with the president's rhetoric and policies\nAs NPR's Sarah McCammon reports they're asking conservative Christians to think differently about issues like abortion\nIt sounds a little bit like a church there\n[noise]\nAnd a bit like a campaign rally\nYou hundreds you must vote Republican we're here to remind doctors they go\nOn a recent evening under the heavy branches of live oak trees duck pageants did before a couple dozen people gathered on folding chairs on the Rice

be reminded that you gave the whole world and you're very so\nHow'd you kind of the nation is called the common good and their focus is evangelicals and other Christian voters who feel out of place in President Trump's Republican Party had it says the group has about it\nTo feel out of place in President Trump's Republican Party had its group has about a million dollars in private donations their touring the country ahead of the midterms visiting more than thirty congressional districts chosen in part based on their religious makeup congressman Ted Lieu of the Democratic congressional campaign committee has informally advised the group\nAt an event in San Antonio this week Tracy Goodrich who still home schooling two of her four kids said she and her husband quietly left their evangelical

thought or talked about abortion in Fifteen Years as much as I have in the last three weeks\nPatch it published an op ed in USA Today this week arguing that evangelicals should put more energy into reducing abortions and trying to criminalize them and should vote against politicians who support Trump's agenda\nChristian Hawkins who runs the anti abortion rights group students for life is a former evangelical who converted to Catholicism she says she's heard this argument before and doesn't think most conservative Christian voters will buy it because of how they view abortion\nThere are certainly a lot of issues that Christian care about when they go to vote but at the end of the day we know that there's a human rights atrocity happening inside of our country not atrocity is abortion\nHowever the issues are framed poster Robbie Jones of the public religion research Institute says moving white evangelicals away from the G O P would be an uphill battle\nYeah once you have several generations that are voting eighty percent Republican I'm it's left that they're doing that because of one particular issue and more than it has become in many ways a kind of tribal identity that's just inextricably tied to evangelical identity I think that that is the tie that binds much more than any single issue\nThe common good is trying to push beyond those identities talking to
