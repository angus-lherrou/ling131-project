eighth parallel dividing north and south but what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans the threat and the huge Chinese army will soon crossing the border\nThe Americans that threat and the huge Chinese army will soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he sweat this information under the rug\nWhat was the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division whose name is

these kinds of conditions\nYou given incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold he leaps out of

because this story of a divided nation is still less than one lifetime law\nWhat is it been like to be working on this book about Korea through a period where North Korea has been exploding nuclear weapons and launching missiles and then sending their leader to meet with President Trump and everything else\nIt's been very strange and you know I'm living in Nineteen fifty and I'm living in two thousand in Eighteen where there's so many echoes of this war it never really ended we just kind of hit the pause button and a war could break out again at any point\nIt's kind of terrifying but you

we're living through now judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week\nRecall him earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown between Democratic senators and then federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork America there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme\nCourt for Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place\nSo that it went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics or the government work hike okay I see here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not well\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nominations that President who sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five it been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo I mean it's not controversial not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen have been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move just is a more deceptive chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of our question was interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like this\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then the man President Reagan named after Bork a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because it illegally smoked marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused them to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Randall off in the house representatives had hit wiped the floor which chase a so this nastiness is hardly know\nA dead end the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a justice for political reasons\nAnd that leads to another question\nHi this is Kelly my her from birth or Connecticut I was wondering two other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now if so what was the result\nOf what is it with these lifetime appointments\nWell lots of judicial plans and various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age summit both are there been talk of an Eighteen year term limits for Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require changing the law the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much thank you seems commentator Cokie Roberts and you can ask Cokie your questions about our politics
