wasn't making art in some form during my life\nI'm the urge to create things has followed me from a young age and art education was always provided for me by my generous and creative parents so I think by the time I got to high school I realize that art and art history we're always going to be defining elements to my personal an academic life and when I took a print making workshop at mass College of art back in my twenties I knew I had found my medium\nThat's great so interesting now Molly you have a long history on Nantucket your grandmother Gwen guy yard owns the upper house restaurant so you must have had some very interesting visits to the island can you tell us what about the island inspires you need a ticket\nIs really um a place that's endlessly inspiring to me that

culture and its community and the ecosystem here also fascinating places to study um and we're up to slow down a bit when we're here which allows for maybe more careful observation of our surroundings\nA well put so now I'm only can you tell us about your work and your process\nSo typically I consider myself a polygraph print maker which means they use the collage image honest if not bored to make prints from and then make multiples of an image and then I lay or other images on top of them for those who aren't familiar with the process I tell them it's like making a giant stamp on and after the prints are made\nI occasionally and now more often than not well paint on top of the print to add dimension\nUm and the majority of my work in recent years is centered around the way human memory processes imagery I create semi it's abstract shapes and forms a drop of memories of time spent near the ocean or on the beach wow\nWell I Can't wait to see her new work and congratulations on your solo show [noise] can you tell us a little about what we'll see in the show so this show is\nI'm going to be a jumping off point a combination of some new collage work where I
