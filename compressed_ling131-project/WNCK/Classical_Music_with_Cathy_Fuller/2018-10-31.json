remember a time when I wasn't making art in some form during my life I'm the urge to create things has followed me from a young age and art education was always provided for me by my generous and creative parents\nSo I think by the time I got to high school I realize that art and art history we're always going to be defining elements to my personal an academic life and when I took a print making workshop at mass College of art back in my twenties I knew I had found my medium\nThat's great so interesting now Molly you have a long history on Nantucket your grandmother Gwen guy our own the opera house restaurant so you must have had some very interesting visits to the island can you tell us what about the island inspires you\nNeed it took it is really um a place that's endlessly inspiring to me that holds the place in my memory it's filled with a really rich history goes stories in visitors\nAnd of course the secular imagery to work with um kind of around every corner so I'm at the island culture and its community and the ecosystems here also fascinating places to study um and we're up to slow down a bit when we're here which allows for maybe more careful observation of our surroundings\nAre well put so now Molly can you tell us about your work and your process so typically\nI consider myself a polygraph print maker which means they use the collage image honest if not bored to make prints from and then make multiples of an image and then they layer other images on top of them for those who aren't familiar with the process I tell them it's like making a giant stamp an after the prints are made\nI occasionally and now more often than not well paint on top of the print to add dimension um and the majority of my work in recent years is centered around the way human memory processes imagery I create semi it's abstract shapes and forms a drop of memories of time spent near the ocean or on the beach\nWow well I Can't wait to see or new work and congratulations on your solo show can you tell us a little about what we'll see in the show\nSo this show is I'm going to be a jumping off point a combination of some new collage work where I Am taking prints and papers and re purpose thing my material to form abstract the geographic points on Nantucket\nUm it's going to be a way that I'm sort of pushing my medium to make a change in my

I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence for for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't\nKnow [noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and and restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just\nWhining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year what do you think about President Trump\nI'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump's correct and\nBecause it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of that democratic check boxes I\nI Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and that's coming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nI have [laughter] than avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before the hearing on the radio and I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is you know best for the job\nThen
