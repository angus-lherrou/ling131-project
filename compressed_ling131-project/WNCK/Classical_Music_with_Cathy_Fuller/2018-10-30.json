[noise]\nSo now Molly can you tell us when you first started making art so I really\nCan't remember a time when I wasn't making art in some form during my life I'm the urge to create things has followed me from a young age and art education was always provided for me by my generous and creative parents\nSo I think by the time I got to high school I realize that art and art history we're always going to be defining elements to my personal an academic life and when I took a print making workshop at mass College of art back in my twenties I knew I had found my medium\nThat's great so interesting now Molly you have a long history on Nantucket your grandmother Gwen guy yard owns the opera house restaurant so you must have had some very interesting visits to the island can you tell us what about the island inspires you\nNeed it took it is really um a place that's endlessly inspiring to me that holds the place in my memory it's filled with a really rich history goes stories famous visitors\nAnd of course the secular imagery to work with um kind of around every corner so I'm at the island culture and its community and the ecosystems here also fascinating places to study um and we're up as to slow down a bit when we're here which allows for maybe more careful observation of our surroundings\nAre well put so now Molly can you tell us about your work and your process\nSo typically I consider myself a polygraph print maker which means they use the collage image honest if not bored to make prints from and then make multiples of an image and then they layer other images on top of them for those who aren't familiar with the process I tell them it's like making a giant stamp on and after the prints are made\nI occasionally and now more often than not well paint on top of the prints tad dimension\nUm and the majority of my work in recent years is centered around the way human memory processes imagery I create semi it's abstract shapes and forms a drop of memories of time spent near the ocean or on the beach\nWow well I Can't wait to see your new work and congratulations on your solo show can you tell us a little about what we'll see in the show this show is\nI'm going to be a jumping off point a combination of some new collage work where I Am taking prints and papers and re purpose thing my material to form abstract a geographic points on

Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm David Greene many of us have something going on in our lives that could shape how we vote on November six\nMaybe it's a family crisis pending job change maybe the birth of a child over the next three days our co host Rachel Martin will bring us conversations about personal questions or anxiety that shape election decisions the first is with Isabel Simon from Lauderdale by the sea Florida\nIs about lived in Florida for eight years she has two kids an older daughter and a twenty four year old son named Marco\nWhen he was Eighteen Marco injured his back on the job at a grocery store he was prescribed Percocet and even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's her conversation with Rachel Martin\nSo when did you figure out that this was a problem\nWhen I realized he was stealing from me\nI first I was thinking hey there's like twenty dollars less in my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied but it got to the point where he had any good night and then with one hand going that per se you know I like you know as I was reading in that you know these very heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on\nWas there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away now this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period and through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account\nUm while you're taking his grandfather and I thought it\nAnd to eat out the bank account um while you're taking his grandfather and my father yeah because I was the executive tricks at that uh the state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just going full bore\nSo he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right\nYes I had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had lived ... for short period of time and he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best help would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years\nAnd you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody\nIt was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child\nAnd I told my dad and he cried and I think maybe that planted that seed because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough buddies healthy is gained thirty pounds he looks good he wants to stay clean and he's doing all the right things he's trying to get his GED now\nIt's a it's a process\nSo it's hard to think about what's happening in Washington or how lawmakers can effect change in any life but especially in a life like yours where you and your son have endured this but as you think about voting\nHow would this experience effect you're thinking about the choices that you make\nThere are so many programs that are out there but not everyone can afford it\nAnd why did my son had to go back to Baltimore to get the help he needed to get better you know why couldn't it had been in my home state of Florida why did we not have the ability to get the help\nOur candidates talking about this issue in Florida no they're not right now we're so polarized for ... I think are ridiculous reasons\nAnd we're not focusing on our own people and what our own people need to make it through the day sometimes are you talking about like President Trump and allegations against him the Russia investigation all that stuff feels really far afield to\nActually I voted for President Trump did you I did not like the way the country was going and I wanted to make a change I was willing to try to change\nAnd I still don't think the president's role in this is as much an issue as\nOur local governments like why is that state to state so different why is there help available in one area and not in another area why can't it be uniform I look at the realities of our life what candidate will\nGive the access to the programs are people need health care drug counseling who will support fat and to me I really don't care what party that is I just wanted to be someone who will say okay this is my cars and I want to fix this problem\nThat means Isabel your your who everyone wants president from especially moms to keep your vote a with a GOP even though he's not on the ballot in these midterms in general are you satisfied with how he has done in the job in the past couple of years\nI'm very satisfied with his performance on the job I Wish she would get off Twitter though because that is an unnecessary\n[noise] I don't even know how to verbalize that I just think that takes away and it feeds into all the hatred we have right now and all the discord\nIt's like if he would just do his job the economy's doing well I Believe on for the things he stands for he wants it's best for America and I really truly believe that but he can't help themselves\nBut to take criticism many just blows up and goes on Twitter with Iran and that takes away from all the good he's trying to do in other areas [noise]\nLesley I'll just closed by asking you how things are between you and Marco right now I mean I understand he's in a good place how has your relationship\nIt's a strong as it's ever been I've never given up on my son um I've always loved him he knows I Would do anything for him that I've got us back to my last breath\nVisible thank you so much for talking with us and sharing your story You're welcome thank you\n\nRachel Martin speaking there to Isabel Simon and this is NPR News\n... hours after eleven people were killed in a Pittsburgh synagogue President Trump held a campaign rally\nWe just live evil change our life and change our schedule\nIs changing his scheduled to be in Pittsburgh today but not everyone wants them there I'm Ari Shapiro reaction to the president's trip this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nDon't Ellen auto center but made no talk it's tradesmen count on for quality values election and service between twenty Seventeen and Eighteen F. one fifty two fifty or three fifty four fifty super duty pickups and dumps Don Allen auto center twenty four papers road\nGolden wants to extend Medicare coverage to people age fifty five and believes there should eventually be universal coverage\nThat position has been attacked by a Republican and come and Bruce ... in TV ads like this one radical gold medal of government control your health care ending Medicare as we know sibling taxes we reached out to public ... campaign repeatedly for an interview but got no response\nThe sixty four year old is running for his third term as the only remaining Republican in the house from New England in a debate earlier this month he cited his votes to lower taxes and cut regulations while accusing golden of being in the pocket of democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others\nI'll tell you what I really object you is all of this on a state money by Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters all these dark money groups that are pouring money in here are trying to convince the people in Maine a and attacked me and say I'm ...
