Meyer your source for informed guests and insightful commentary on a wide range of topics that impact the lives of every one\nIf you could name one American institution that pretty much looks the same since it's beginning what would it be chances are most people would say our schools and guess what they would be correct welcome to both grown on NPR Nantucket and streaming when I heart radio is this your host Scott\nWith Meyer over the next twenty three minutes I invite you to join us in here from a guy who's been called many things community organizer activist Dan reformer challenging the status quo and us secretary of education let's give a big welcome to Arnie Duncan who you'll remember a secretary of education\nDuring both terms of the Obama administration and before that head of the Chicago public school system which at one point in the Nineteen eighties were declared the worst in the nation by one of his predecessors at the department of ed bill Bennett Arnie welcome to cross currents\nThanks for having me appreciate the opportunity\nYou were friends in those the light would readily say that you never walk away from a challenge tell us what that's all about [laughter]\nTry not to be scared I guess but ah I think uh if you're trying to serve kids if you're trying to give kids a better education who desperately need it um that is the challenge that is the challenge and\nSo what is what is there to walk away from that's the nature of the work and I think we all feel this huge sense of urgency that we have to help more kids have a chance in life and the consequences of not getting a good education today are obviously\nDisastrous not for you and I were lucky enough to to get a good education but for kids that don't have that privilege who don't have that opportunity the rest of your life the odds are stacked against them yeah so\nTo walk away from a challenger walk away for a fight 'em is you fight for kids it'd be a little hard to put yourself in there if you are if you choose that path\nYeah walking away is not an option\nOn a cross currents we regularly focus on education in many voices in that field we talked to from Marc Tucker\nThrough any Weingarten the John marrow we've had top college presidents governors early childhood advocates Barney since leaving Washington you've returned back to your hometown of Chicago where you're leading a program for the ... and collect the called Chicago credit and the way I understand it's focused on changing the landscape\nInto the toughest areas of the city's south and west sides by\nWorking directly with young men who are most at risk of gun violence issues around gun violence and and joining gangs aren't even when you see how gun violence continues to rule the day in Chicago with homicide rates that are higher than both New York and LA combined how can we possibly have hope for the future\nWell the reality is both devastating but\nScott honestly I'm actually very hopeful let me just sort of walk you through but both fronts an issue\nIs particularly acute here in my hometown of Chicago and while I'm honestly thrilled to get to D.C back home here in my family were living like three blocks from where I grew up which is you know fantastic half our city is really really hurting and we're basically robbing their childhoods kids can't go outside and play anymore\nThey're growing up of a level of fear and trauma mashable um it's not just Chicago issue is a national issue of race a generation of kids on mass shootings on gun violence\nAnd I go talk to students which I Do all the time I start by apologizing we as adults haven't kept up say no and it just breaks my heart we have to get a better place so what are we doing here\nAnd I kept them safe and it just breaks my heart we have to get to a better place so what are we doing here in Chicago um we're working as you said that the accurately Scott we're working directly with the young man on the south and west sides who are most likely to shoot and be shot by forcing their profiles of one of the same we hire them\nWe have to vote for candidates again Republican or Democrat I could care less on the politics of that\nWho just want our kids to grow up you know free of fear and I would argue who are going to help to educate pat and I wish those weren't radical concepts but sometimes I feel like they are\nWell hopefully when people do it on a number six they'll remember the Parkland kids know remember how can they then these kids really and the answers\nTo the problems that we're dealing with around gun violence let's just the topic in our schools continue to we need a little progress but we continue to fall behind in international comparisons\nOur teachers are still are not elevated to the status of other professions and like you say in your book we either have low expectations or no expectations with respect to education and district leaders you mentioned this continue to promulgate lies about how our kids are doing elaborate on that Arnie\nYeah that and there are few lives again that's a provocative way to to start the book but I sort of say what I Believe that I'll I'll give you a couple um for me the biggest lie and we just talked about it is that we all say we we care about children and you wouldn't\nYou wouldn't be any out on because they said oh no we don't care about kids but we continue\nDay after day week after week\nTo choose to allow them to grow up with these mass shootings and grow up with the fear and trauma a related to that\nAnd if we truly value to our children we would do something about this gun violence and again I I just pray that we do that in a in November and a couple of weeks now so that that's for me is the biggest lie that we say we value our children but our actions don't\nDemonstrate that I get I I don't listen so much what people say I watched her actions\nI look at their budgets I look at their policy positions and when we say we we value kids\nAnd we don't act to do that um I think that's a lie I think that's a by the second one is that we say we value our teachers but I argue that we\nWe desperately under pay our teachers we don't train them as ... as you just talked about we don't give them real good mentoring and career ladders and if we truly\nValue teachers we would pay them you'll significantly more I Would take principles a heck of a lot more pay teachers more who take on difficult assignments be that you know inner city urban or rural remote on it or Native American a reservation where the shortages and so everyone\nSaid we value teachers but we don't demonstrate that with our budgets with our with our with our values the final thing is that we say we value education and again I Want to say we do but I Would ask you Scott how many of us go to the voting booth\nAt local elections state\nNational doesn't matter and actually vote for candidates who are going to hold themselves accountable for increasing access to pre K. and increase in high school graduation rates and making college more accessible and more affordable and the truth is almost none of us vote based upon in increasing education opportunity right\nAnd so politicians would give you the soundbites they all love to visit classrooms they all have the photo op sale at the pet little kids on their head or whatever hold babies but they don't commit ... Scott I blame us as voters not is not not the politicians when you watch the presidential debates I Would always just be like on pins and needles I Can't wait for us to talk about education\nEducation never comes on yeah never come into it because we don't vote on it meant so those are the those are the big\nLives you know we say we value our kids but we don't protect them we don't keep them safe we say we value teachers but we don't\nPay them is a festivals and we say we value education but we don't vote for candidates that are serious about education and that's why Scott I think we're not getting better faster relative to other countries other countries they\nSimply invest more other countries have universal access to prepay so our babies enter kindergarten ready to be successful we rank twenty eight twenty ninth thirtieth relative to other countries to provide access to pre K. the dismal funny record we should be ashamed\nI'm so those are just a few of the lives that I talk about it in the in the book\nYeah we can go on and on I Want to remind our listeners your tuned to cross currents on NPR Nantucket in standing on the island radio search cross currents and Scott with ... and don't forget the lights on Facebook cross currents brought you might then partners a leader in global communications marketing research\nLearn more than partners dot com we're back with Arnie Duncan we still have a lot to cover in the balance today show\nArmy in your book you prescribe moving from the current pre K. twelve focus to a pre K. fourteen focus\nI Know there's a number of high school reform efforts unfolding today it could be transformative including the execution highschool future work and out of the alliance for excellent education and there's others give us a sense of what you think is needed to make high schools more relevant in the twenty first century\nYeah all that stuff on one second let me just go to the larger point is that we've had for the past century uh K. to twelve model that I think it's served as very very well and I think is driven a lot of our economic prosperity and I and a thriving middle class\nBut I think what has worked well for the past century is frankly inadequate not even for the next century but for the next five or ten years and so yes I think we have to go to a pre K to fourteen model and as I said earlier we have to get our baby softer good starting to have them entering kindergarten ready to be success\nAnd as I said earlier we have to get our baby softer good start had them entering kindergarten ready to be successful academically and socially and emotionally but then as you know Scott if you just have a high school diploma today um\nIt's really really hard to get good paying job and so some\nForm of education beyond high school for year universities\nTwo year community colleges trade technical vocational training some form of education be on the high school\nHas to be the goal of for every single young person around the country is not about sorting kid telling me you know your college material you got to go to the world of work or whatever like kids find their passion find their interests and let's help them be successful whatever that that path may be we were very very proud to get high school graduation rates up to eighty four percent which is an all time high\nA historic high for the country Scott but as you know that's no it's nowhere near high enough when young people drop out of high school today they're basically condemned to the poverty into social failure\nAnd when I talk to young people in the young men I'm working with now is I travel the country why do people jump out of high school it's it's so interesting it is very rarely because high school was too hard sometimes but very rarely\nIt's often high school was too easy and more so more than ... it's like high school sport I don't get it why is this important\nAnd still making high school much more engaging much\nMore hands on learning many more ties to the real world that's the work of whether it's you know X cue or whether it's that you talked about the the alliance back from the education of how do we re imagined high school so the kids\nTotally understand why this is good for them why do I need to learn his algebra why is this trick relevant to to my life I don't need to learn you know a calculus or

hear from Betsy does off the current secretary of education\nWell it it's so much since Scott that um the short answer is no and I'm\nI reached out repeatedly to to my predecessors Republican and democratic didn't matter and I tell you I learned so much from your Margaret Spellings and rot page and ... a bill Bennett or an addict Riley teaser yeah these are people who always pick up the fault always call always give me their best thinking\nAnd it's a small club of folks who have ever had his chops you know it's not a\nTon of around for years\nRight so you know six seven eight people living

volumes about what the real priorities our\nLast question teacher unions affect the ineffective what do you say\nI think we need strong unions and we've had as you know a couple of teachers' strikes in states that have been led by Republican governors that have starved you know public education whether it's in West Virginia or Oklahoma Arizona and so I think again if we're really trying to professional lives education they need to be your teachers need to be paid\nBetter paid more than adequately ups of some unions are more progressive something a little bit you know I think it could go

[noise] I like it um how do you define ballots [noise]\nYou know that's I think that's an interesting question um\nTo me the world is full of opposite you know you have ... people you have served as people you have proud people you have humbled people you have honest and dishonest people good times bad times\nUm for me that kernel of truth is found in ... in the perspective of balance in a positive attitude and resilience and in love\nSo finding that middle ground always where where people can come together we're where an individual can come together with themselves in a healthy way for me is what balance is all about and sometimes\nSometimes it takes work you know sometimes we really have to do work hard to break out of\nA negative or positive and achieve that kind of balance but I'm ultimately the outcome in any situation is better if we can find that\n... [noise] yes and how do you feel about inspiration where do you where do you find inspiration\nWell I find so much inspiration in my neighborhood in New York you know if I get stuck inside my own head if I'm sitting at my computer and I just can't seem to move forward all I Need to do is walk\nOut of my building and walk around the neighborhood and inevitably I Will see something that will crack me up or that will inspire me or trigger an idea or you know or or\nJust you know be amazing\nUm I read a lot I travel a lot I talk a lot and I I find a lot of inspiration and people and in art\nI Love to walk across Central Park and go to the Metropolitan Museum of art or moma for a break and I'm really lucky because I can do that\nJust spend an hour as a museum just walk across the part spend an hour at the met go look at one exhibition and then come back and it's clear my head [laughter] um I Love nature\nUm which a lot of the time when I'm not traveling means a walk in Central Park which is not what most people would think of [noise]\nBut um I find nature more relaxing than inspiring\nMhm mhm yeah\n... and there's this third word that I like to explore here which is you know granted you know he was I think that you know balance inspiration and gratitude all sort of go together\nWell they do and gratitude is highly under rated um I Am grateful for every day\nAnd as they get older I become more aware of the passage of time which makes me more aware of the importance of not wasting it so I Am grateful for\nThe love of my family and friends and all of the beauty that I see around me and I'm grateful in this moment for all the women who have had the courage to speak out on behalf of all of us raid and remind us that we can't take\nSpeak out on behalf of all of us raid and remind us that we can't take anything for the you know anything anything that was once worth fighting for it's still worth fighting for you know and a great example of that is for me the right to vote\nWhich many people don't have around the world and I'm grateful for that voice especially when you think that women didn't gain the right to vote here in the United states until sixty years after slavery was abolished so you know we we we need to be grateful\nYes that is very very good point [noise] especially in these ... times especially\nIn these days and times absolutely absolutely I think it can be challenging to stay positive and to appreciate everything we have and the beauty around us about but it's it's worth it's worth holding on to that\nI agree I agree so in terms of you\nKnow ability right in in your world I think you have sort of this duality you have this you know journalistic world where you are responsible for writing about sustainability and then you have this personal world where you practice sustainability and\nYou know how how do you how do you balance those things have balance those two parts\nUm it it's interesting because as a journalist I'm used to taking that sort of balanced view and looking at both sides of things\nAnd you know as a person as a human as an individual I think about sustainability everyday and I think about the little things you know how important it is to\nTo make an effort to understand the impact that our lifestyle choices make and not only on our personal health just in terms of eating healthy food or wet ingredients were using inner beauty and personal care products\nBut the health of the planet and how we need to connect the dots and how those are connected you know and how I I I think about how everything goes somewhere and how our individual choices you know\n\nNantucket NPR station eighty nine point five W.

how are you you're you're the first uh I'm I'm doing great and I want to say this is a big deal for me since I started hosting the show you're the first guess the disappear twice excellent so I'm excited about that so how how was the summer\nWe had a great summer who's really busy um our life starts guarded over two hundred and thirty five thousand people in the summer when they were they were crazy busy in non voting boating we had a you know good activity was a good summer overall though kept busy but you had a lot of fun\nInto the fall season how does your role of all when the busy summer season winds\nThe fall season how old is your role of all when the busy summer season winds down\nA world right now we're in the middle of trying to put everything away get everything stored in you know storm ready for the winter\nUm so that usually takes us up till Thanksgiving to get that done um we're a little bit behind this year um luckily for some people I think people are glad that the boos got left in a little bit longer and\nThat is a good thing that always are still in the water yeah we still have ... which is a good thing for the people that are trying to boats they'll bought a stress you of stresses me out because ... season is in a couple of weeks they have the ... season and it's getting colder and colder to be out there to start pulling those things and jurors\nYeah let's talk about um you're going to pull the floating docks um or because of the winter storms to talk a little bit about the floating docks and town peer given an update on that\nOK well what were we had a um we had to design um to get the floating docks replaced\nOn upon review of it we found a couple of red flags so we put the brakes on\nOn and we sent it back out for design what do you mean by red flags with what we saw some things that we were afraid that they may not withstand the weather conditions that we have we wanted the engineers to take a second look at some of the weather conditions that we experience okay because we are going to go to the taxpayers and ask for some money\nSo we wanted to make sure that we were going to get it done right the first time I would have hated to have\nGone and asked them for money then have a design that wasn't going to be strong enough to withstand and have a break up in a thousand pieces during the first storm\nSo we put the brakes on sent it back out on the engineers are redesigning it with on you know some current weather information and status\nSo it is disappointing that we won't have brand new docks next year but our plan is to pull the floating docks that are currently there to protect them so they won't get damaged over the winter if we have any big storms will do some repairs to them that we weren't able to do while they were in the water last year\nOn and they'll put them back in April with the hopes of we should be able to go to the town meeting with a new design knew exactly what we want\nYou know we're looking at some way of a tiny waiters which will break down the waves coming in which will make it a lot more protected we're looking at all kinds of different things obviously leaving it to the expertise to the engineers sure but um\nNot that I Know of I don't I don't know of any interaction like that with humans insurance okay and as I said just we have seen evidence of seals bought again we don't know what type of shark it was or whatever we just see the ...\nIn the seal population here is not near what it is on parts of the Cape\nRight exactly you know from my understanding it's a lot smaller we do have a lot I don't know what I'm saying that his Scott won or will\nHe will tell you that and I said\nBut I'm from what we know Chatham a and ... has has the biggest population great point we'll give it a run for the money I'm sure but um yeah but it seems to be modern way seems to be where they are what\nWas definitely in the news of this this summer and uh and Greg who you spoke of has done a lot of tagging and a lot of these sharks have a tag on them so they can track where they are where they're going where they've been which I think only helps us with uh the behavior or an absolute\nSo going forward we're going into winter what is winter like for for your department of you know once you get into January and February and march or what kind of things or you just planning or are you still was busy on the water\nUm well we do have the ... the commercials golfers out there no uh we we keep our boats up and ready to help them out on both will we keep a boat in ... in in in town um obviously we're not on the water every day or what if what we are ready to be if if they need our help\nUm we work with the coast guard we do a lot of training we do our hiring\nWe do um we try to get a lot of stuff built you know like our life our standards and you know we try to just do a lot of prep work so that when the season hits that a lot of the extensive stuff is all the way we do our paperwork\nUm and this is like when we go to seminars and meetings and training and stuff like that so yeah we're we're we stayed busy year round on beach access science is a huge thing we have a beach access signs\nAll over the island and we have to go make sure that the ah they're accessible so we we do our brush cutting and stuff to make sure that if we do need to get a structure or something up onto the beach that we're able to do that so that takes quite a bit of our time on ... we we we keep busy\nNow last winter I had just moved here but we had one two three four nor'easter Z in a row that really kind of beat up the beaches and and and the the the storms in the surf or just relentless what does that mean for your department\nWants all of that kind of settled down we were getting into spring what kind of a clean up did you have to plan for it to get us into the summer season it\nOf a clean up did you have to plan for it to get us into the summer season\nIt's crazy it that that that's the one thing that why we try to get everything done in January and February wall those storms are taking place you're obviously we try to help out with with the storms as ... as we can but then on springtime just means\nEnormous cleanup we're we're on the beaches all day every day and like there's parts of docs there's some in boats there's\nEverything you can imagine that happened and it takes a huge effort to get it cleaned up so that we we just start at one end of the island and just work our way down\nUntil we get people starting to come back and complaining about certain things are going to let us in different directions but yeah we we spend most of march and April although last march was when we got slammed it was the April\n... which they most maple cleaning the beaches\nGoing forward to kind of finish up what's your your your biggest goals your biggest objectives going forward as we go into it and go into\nWinter and then we get ready for spring and summer ... what are some of the things that you've got on your your goal is that you want to see done before before the next summer season and all of the tourists and voters coming back\nWell I Want to get this the shark um\nThink wrapped up I Want to work with the tape really closely just to make sure that we're completely ready um we're looking at getting some new equipment always looking into that to make sure there are a lifeguard you are right up to speed and\n... and stuff like that and and then just making sure our boat and all of our equipment is ready to go so if somebody needs our help we can be right there\nSure after um Labor Day this year how many were there many beaches that still had lifeguards or did that or did they all go to an unguarded beach\nWhat we what we end up taking the lifeguards stands in a life guard a coffin lockers off the beach we do keep a roving lifeguards on silk until ... laments day weekend\nOn and we had two of them out on the beach every day on ATVs and then one guy in a truck so that um if something was to happen we'd be ready to help 'em out there\nWhen you start the the hiring process for lifeguards\nJanuary okay that's when we start we we ah we hire a staff of sixty between the dock staffing the lifeguard so\nUm we get going in January there's a lot of resumes and stuff like that and it just the ... to get um hired is six time consuming you know we try to have fifty lifeguards and then we have ten on the dogs have you tried to meet them all know yeah okay yeah I got 'em all\nWhat is your what advice would you say which which the words of wisdom from Sheila Lucy a at a job interview for a for a lifeguard\nWell just make sure your priorities straight public safety comes first ... and now we just need to make sure that our ... we have a huge job we got to keep the public safety and make them help them enjoy this island as much as as we all do yeah\nWell I wouldn't want to disappoint you so [laughter] I'm ...
