that's what we offer up today in our first segment we'll chat with got um rub on on what it's like to work inside the White House and in this case the Obama White house and then our second segment we'll hear from writer historian Elizabeth cat\nWho will give us her views on a much maligned region of the country we call Appalachia let's get moving here with goddamn gothic welcome to cross currents\nRamming me got to give us a sense\nOf what propelled you to write the book and in listening to support them Seventeen other imagine Seventeen other white house staffers who all came together to write their chapter and tell their stories what it was like inside the Obama White house give us a sense of how you put it all together\nAbsolutely and I'm Glad you mentioned the west wing since I grew up and had my political awakening show and\nYou know president Bartlett and that and you know in a lot of ways that show gotten the day to day details of like the White House wrong but it did get something right which was\nThat a sort of aspirational racial sensitive of the Bartlett fictional White House um which is very similar to what I found in my college than even the White House you know for us if\nYou ask any of us but we miss the most that work there will tell you people obviously a witness President Obama a geologist by these days ... ... but really\nI'm the most satisfying thing about working in that place where the wonderful people got to work with who came from every walk of life who worked her way up um and found themselves at estimating happening which is a surreal experience so for us really what what it came down to was a the end of the administration\nAs we were seeing the incoming administration the Trump Administration come together we felt a sense of urgency to put this book together um in part to sort of captured the tone of the former White House will realize that we're in a in a part of something really special and historic and wanted to find a way to tell those\nRealize that we had a part of something really special and historic and wanted to find a way to tell those stories of the people who work there where they came from what they experienced what they learn how they are witnessing history and in some cases helped shape history\nAnd in part a you know we could also saw that the incoming administration was just going to be different and so we wanted to find a way to celebrate uh the sense of public service and patriotism that we all found in our experience at the White House and make sure that future generations public servants Nevada to\nYeah they're really some good stories told here in the book is published by paying one just came out a few weeks ago\nIt's getting good reduced so I Do hope people will ah will pick it up to most Americans see the White House in the eyes of whoever the sitting president is where they see the White House press secretary do their daily briefings were the chief of staff whose usually you know a big name whether it's\nRound the manual or John Kelly or whomever it might be in in the Trump White house were inundated throughout the day by a president who does most of his communicating via Twitter and all his tweets become breaking news what is it been like for you and your colleagues two years later to witness the current operating style of the Trump team\nIs actually bigger than Alaska covers Thirteen states from New York state down to Mississippi was twenty five million people it may well be the most stereotyped section in the United states Elizabeth you have spent many years dissecting this region how would you best described it\nExactly how you just described that we have to start with an understanding\nOf the region that we're talking about whether it's a southern state like Tennessee or in northern states like New York [noise] um we have to understand who lives here and twenty five million people that's a huge number so we have to understand that there is population diversity there's wealth diversity\nGeographic and regional diversity I'm all in this kind of as you said a huge range and that takes a lot of grants from the rest of the country when things start to go wrong\nYeah because they kind of narrow cast it to you know this this element of that element and and really haven't shown to the broader picture\nSo you were propelled to write this book as a counter to what Vance presents a hillbilly elegy you claim that dance set out to remake the region in his own image as a place of quote alarming social declined misplaced resentment poor life choices elaborate a little bit on this\nSo I'm I think to understand hillbilly elegy you have to look at the books that title which is and then more family and culture in crisis and I think that if I'm good event had stopped it writing and then more family\nI wouldn't have had a desire to make any pushback on that whatsoever but it's more of a culture that really puzzles me and I set out to find\n'em what he was trying to do when he made all this generalization about the region that I think that he would probably say that\nIt's just one opinion it just says own take on the region or when she's entitled to make that ... that he you know into the present said as\nA place that poverty is kind of rooted into the individual failures of the people who live here yeah that it's naturally occurring and that you know the only people that can really change that\nAre the people who live here by modifying your own behavior and I think that that is not only in and help all these other region but it's also very a historical as well\nYeah I feel the same way I went when I read his book and it's been almost two years ago now when I read the book I felt I actually resented a lot of what I was reading because I felt like I could recall you know people in my community who might be like that but not everyone was like that and and he just lumped everything into one\nOne box and uh in there and in and said have added to Elizabeth ... shift a little bit I Want to talk about the Trump effect around Appalachia and West Virginia has been kind of ground zero for that sure he carried that state by more than forty points in twenty sixteen\nThat that state is now controlled by Republicans it's a state last week where US Senator Joe Manchin the highest ranking Democrat in the state succumb to further to the Trump effect he was the lone democratic vote in the Senate to elevate cabin all to the Supreme Court\nGive us your take on politics in West Virginia and the region as a whole and where you think it's going to go over the next couple of years\nI think looking at whether it's West Virginia or any other thing I watch that we have to be very clear eyed about what's going on on the west Virginia is the example absolutely everything that you just said is one hundred percent true but I also see a state that\nSince the new deal for example I think it's only elected to Republican governors this recent\nTurn to its politics is a relatively new phenomenon I think that the state particularly coal country which takes the brunt of um\nYou know being stereotypically truck country I'm One of the last democratic stronghold in Appalachia until two thousand and eight or two thousand and twelve said they they went for Obama and the two thousand and eight elections and so when we talk about politics in Appalachia we have to be careful I think to\nPluck presume that what's happening is inevitable is going to continue um we you know we have to have a little bit me personally um have to have a little bit of optimism that\nUm if things change so quickly things could change as well that might be a rose colored view\nOf our current political moment but I Am grounding that in the history of the state which was very democratic very pro labor um and very much propelled\nPro waiver 'em and very much propelled by kind of class tensions within the politics and I think the west Virginia teachers' strike might have given us a sense of how we can get back to that\nYeah and I guess we'll see how that plays out in a couple of weeks with the with the midterm elections and and I would remind folks in addition to Elizabeth spoke on Appalachia she also has a new book out on the west Virginia teachers' strike which is which is quite interesting\nElizabeth you live in the Shenandoah Valley Virginia which is also a part of Appalachia one of the neat part of your book is how you showcase the many vignettes of the region where progressive folks are standing up and being hurt whether it's on the environment education health el GB he women's issues\nAnd more share a few of the ... of some of the progressive things that you see going on and and how that kind of plays into the history of Appalachia\nIn my backyard as as you might know that there's a battle over two very unpopular natural gas pipeline yes\nPlaying out um these pipelines are supported by people on both sides of the political establishment Democrats and Republicans\nUm and the people who are challenging the pipelines or sometimes form unlikely coalition people you know it might be on the libertarian factor and believing in and private property but people who are quite a radical as well I don't think that private property or you know ownership should be abolished and so to a certain extent\nThese coalitions are working together to your point the pipeline on some times doing very\nDangerous for the civil disputes dangerous for themselves a civil disobedience like occupying trees that to halt construction or monitor pot or chained themselves to construction equipment and um people feel\nThat this is the only avenue that they have left 'em when they're representative is won't hear them and as you probably know in Appalachia opposition to environmental pillage\nThe coal companies are natural gas companies has an incredibly long history I mean what is really notable about these new meant as well is it that uh they're led by women\nYeah and so just as we've seen in the west Virginia teachers' strike I'm working class women are stepping forward to leave the ... that are helping to kind of creates a space\nBetween um the political establishment and people on the ground who don't think that they're being represented\nMhm what are your thoughts as we do get close to the mid term any thoughts on on some of the key races that are playing out I Know there's a there's a U.S house seat in southern West Virginia people are thinking it's could flip to the Democrats you've got the Georgia governor's race\nOr you've got to uh people looking at West Virginia North Carolina for some for maybe not a taking over the for Democrats taking over the legislature but making a lot of pickups in those states any thoughts on on how you see these races playing out\nAnd said that you're referring to in southern West Virginia will be an interesting one to watch um that is Richard OJ to write a seat or his you know his hopeful\nThe as soon as an individual who became the oil\nUnder West Virginia teachers um during the ... the two thousand eight till teachers' strike so it will be wanting to watch to see if teachers in our allies um repay that loyalty at the ballot box and I think they will but it you know it it might not be enough but\nUm it's exciting for many of the teachers to have someone who they represent their interests I'm so close to election\nSimilarly in Virginia I just mentioned the pipeline battles we have two candidates won in the sixth district one at a nice district\nThere in fact I find that parents and this makes them um different from the that's an iconic establishment that is enrichment so our governor or driving supports the pipelines so this is the first time in ... and and I think the\nThe nice district desert even been a primary for the Democrat\nNomination and I really long time so\nI don't think that all of those races will end in victory but it's been a big deal to people to see 'em candidates and parties that are closer to what they did and representation and I know people who are registering to vote for the first time so all those are good things\nYeah so it probably there'll be some victories that may not be what people might not be everyone's expectations but it's definitely been a kind of sparked a to get folks ah ah excited about things again I Want to St Elizabeth cap for coming on the show today I I think what she's been able to expose for us is that\nIt's not your grandmother your grandfather's Appalachian that you're looking at today it it's a new it's a new Appalachia it's and it's not JD Vance is Appalachia it's one more along the lines up with a what a loose with cat outlines in her book\nWhat you are getting wrong about Appalachia any closing comment so this was before we let you go\nTo a shame on Joe mansion\nRight will listen banks or you're you're doing the Lord's worked uh to dispel the myth about the region keep it up and we'll be back in touch again thank you for joining us from cross currents this is Scott with Meyer signing off for the weekend go out and make it a great day and don't forget if you still have time to register to vote yet registered\nThat's why I'm here and that's\nWhy you're there that's very cool and um and I know that you have thought about having other locations for doing like tell me about that process\nYeah I mean it's it's already kind of the gun and some circumstances that guy partnered with a hotel in Malibu, California for a year and a half and I did like a retail component and our lobby and then I fill out the space and the fact that was um\nA beautiful wellness center and so we did yoga and massage and re key and found healing and\nAll kinds of things um and then I did a pop up in um the canal street market which is in Manhattan It's right on ... street you know and it's like I'm In like a community retail space um\nAnd then I Do I Do partnership hop on like all over the place that we've done them with men rep Heller we've done them with\nUm Lulu lemon we've done them and sell how healthy peers anywhere I can continue to share you know the gifts of what happens in this place an outrage but that's the thing that has been very apparent as what happens in the\nDoor needs to spread and it needs to be\nUm accessible to more people\nAcross the world because it again it is like\nIt's a feeling it's when you come in here and you do the things you leave\nFeeling happier and better about life I mean it's almost unexplainable because I'm thinking you have to experience but I just I Know it's like my sole purpose to do this now\nYou know who you're on a mission\nOh yeah [laughter] so what so and it's go ahead\nWell I was just going to add you know I've also comes from a background of like working in corporate America and some of my design years\nAnd I see how business works and I see how I Do business that is different than the way other people do business which is person to person again and it you know it's for the betterment of a greater cause rather than a bottom line dollar I mean we all have to make money and there has to be you know\nFinancial purpose for what we do but it can't be what Dr ...\nRight right is that you know it's the triple bottom line people profit planet\nAnd ... you know\nI'm so in your store in Brooklyn which your favorite thing about it\nOh gosh it's so hard to pick one thing I'm\nInteresting well I mean I what I think that our products like ... Lindsey products are very special because again what I've done is partnered with our current vendors so say we had a candle maker and she is a local candle company\nAnd she started out selling here we were second store or something\nSo for me what's really exciting is to say hey candle maker friend we would love to do a collaboration can do with you the physically for our stores\nAnd stuff for her and not only from another business development but also we get another product that's\nIn line with what the growth of this brand is mhm so\nWe do candles reduced in care we jewelry we do have files and then personally under my label we still do apparel and clothes and home good so for me it's like sharing the experience which is\nFrom a business standpoint double the work because you have more cooks in the kitchen but from a story in a relationship perspective it's so important to be doing that for me\nThat's great that's ... that is really great congratulations\nThanks yeah it's been amazing 'cause even we've done amenities for hotels you know so then it's like we partner on bigger projects for other people as well right so it's like a little incubator lined up\nWith that has the impact of the ripple effect right you're rippling out into the world\nYeah exactly yeah so so what is next like what is next on your heroes and what's the next plan\nFor the next plan is\nSo after closing the ... space um\nThere was a bit of a temporary situation I absolutely know that we need a location in LA absolutely you know that when you look in the Midwest and in the Pacific northwest so it and it's you know at this point it's people reaching out to me and saying\nWe need what you do here and we need this here and I've got great practitioners over here and\nYou know it's it's the most heartwarming\nCommunication I can never received because it's now people understand it from a different perspective so I'm looking for\nThe you know financial partnership of how to take us to another level and really you know because I started the store with a tiny amount of money all by myself with a free and fair and for six months\nAnd have worked it and worked and worked at heart and soul and blood and sweat and tears to what it is now and you know now it's time\nWe've built to we know what it does we know what its capabilities doing an beyond so we just made that partnership to give it to get us to the next level\nSo it's time to ruin it\nYet [laughter] All right so I'm Tiffany Lee we need to put that sort of\nRequest out into the universe\nYeah yeah so um tell me about your life right like what are the things you do to stay inspired were be balanced or even to find the talent that you have in the store\nUm well I Love to travel first and foremost so any second I can like get away just to see a different part of the world or\nBe in a different culture like anything from that perspective gives me creativity and it gives me ideas for how we can do things better how we can make things better um\nYou know I Do I I still\nBelieve in doing fitness as much as possible and right now I'm into a rumble which is like a boxing cardio bank [laughter] so I exercise as much as like and um which is part of the gross because we have in our wellness center downstairs we do ... yoga classes\nUm and bar classes but we can if you know it's a small space\nUm and bar classes but we can if you know it's a small space so we can fit maximum eight people okay so you know rolling not out into a more holistic fitness base is the goal\nAnd then I it's just go I being out in the world and connecting with people and to me is the most inspiring and I love hearing people's stories I Love sharing in other people's services\nSo I was er or other you know wellness centers or stores or whatever it may be just to kind of spread the love\nYou and where do you think you know all these services in classes there in this constant evolution pattern as people find different healing move do these were they find things that appeal because I think it's human nature when you do things you know when you get when you do the same thing over and over again it can become more boring\nRight exactly so how do you see them ...\nWell this is really interesting because I was just having this conversation yesterday because um and I was learning about numerology yesterday and the woman I was speaking with said that\nI don't know eight years ago is when people started there was a shift in the way we were doing things and yoga got really big and everybody started being into yoga and\nWe all kind of shifted and said okay we need to start stretching and breathing so that's been an eight year process of us like opening up and ask for opening up it becomes this\nMore intense process because now you have to make the time do the yoga do the things and be prepared for what it means to be more open hearted and to live a life that in a more conscious way which is harder than going through life and just doing the things eating the food routine\nAnd so\nTo that point we have to find a place that\nPersonally what I think is allowing individuals' know their own balance and teaching people to trust what they want to do what they need for their bodies but they need for their cells\nWhat they mean to be happy in the world because it's not that's just not out there for people so if you can really take one on one\nYou know like if it's if it's a fitness class we're all going to go to the fitness class and like maybe if someone's going to tell great maybe if someone's gonna feel totally exhausted maybe they're gonna afterwards go eat like\nBut what region are two thirty in the um for less rated R. at four pm at five thirty pm\nSeven a simple favor reading or reading man about down

NPR station\nAnd on Sunday mornings six thirty Ninety seven Seventy C. K. F. M. and the show is also a podcast you can find it anytime it in Nantucket NPR dot O. R. G. the show was presented by the town of Nantucket I'm David Martin president of the nation tuck it chamber of commerce\nMy guests today Roberta Santa Maria he's the director of public health here on TALK it\nUm who came here from framing him and he has a bachelors degree from the University of central Florida a masters in public health from Boston University and also a masters in business administration you were pretty busy\nYeah in college my goodness um\nWe're in the business administration degree where where did you go there I got my MBA solving Regina were and that's in Newport Rhode Island okay and I'm I'm actually right now working on my doctorate\nThat are you ... seconds wow yeah OK I'm\nDefinitely has the education and place folks and a substantial experience and research and both environmental and community health management and use played a big role in increasing public health access through a lot of cool initiatives and partnerships that we'll talk about in the next\nIt's a real a lot of coal initiatives and partnerships that we'll talk about in the next uh in the next half hour so welcome to the show and a lot to be here so ah let's talk a little bit about your role within the town of Nantucket what does a director of public health do\nThe question right now is actually what the director of public health not do 'em there many times uh we have our fingers and a lot of things so [noise]\nThe primary function that you see as doing our the inspection we do the food inspections is septic system inspections is that the system plan reviews the well water inspections drinking water inspections tobacco inspections pool inspections and housing inspection out [noise]\nUm last year last fiscal year we did about sixteen hundred inspections and we only have a stop for\nA so that's a pretty substantial a burden right there\nBut on top of that we also we also had to do all the other things that are considered environmental and community health aspects\nSo environmental health are we're keeping an eye on things like what's running off into the harbor what's going on and to the rubber ... running into the aquifer\nUm we work with and it really closely with the natural resources department and then community health sides I monitor the infectious diseases on the island through the state uh epidemiologists office as well and then I also look at tick borne disease illnesses and things like that on the island low\nAnd we'll talk about all of that let's go to the public meeting that we have this special town meeting a couple of nights ago\nWe talked a lot about plastics single use plastics articles sixteen I Believe I'm In that a lot of talk about how that would affect the water supply the article for can you address that\nYes so simple use plastics are\nA real issue coming into into play right now so one of the things that we've been running into and people are finding now it's a modern part of research that plastics actually don't necessarily bio to grade and break down into its components what it does it actually breaks down into smaller molecules the plastic\nSo as they ended up in the sun as they end up in in the heat things like that they start releasing these little molecules into the water that end up migrating through the soil through our stormwater system that end up eventually will end up in the aquifer\nRiding our aquifer has been really safe because there is a nice clay layer protecting it um we are a glacial allowed fall which is basically what's saying as our island was built because of giant glacier X amount of million years ago came and drop off all the soil where we are now\nSo that's that's it's a tough one it's a tough situation or\nIs it on the landlord to prevent that kind of a housing situation you have a two bedroom apartment yeah twelve people in there in the summer is it on the landlord to police that and to report it\nYes it is it is on the landlord unfortunately the laws in the state of Massachusetts actually stacked against the landlord in many in many ways this came out over the years of slum lord and Boston and things like that it's the one that ruined for the many\nAh but the situation that we've been running into is that a landlord has to police their own property we won't know what's going on in that house and that somebody calls us calls in a complaint than we have to do an inspection so if they self police and they're taking care of their own property\nWe'll never see us when we show when we come knocking on your door to do an inspection that's not a good thing it's better if you reach out to us ahead of time to see how to get ahead of these sorts of situations than getting a letter from us with a three hundred dollar a day fine\nDuring the summer I Know the chamber we we get calls every day on on lack of housing business owners organization calling and saying do you have any idea of an idea for us we we we don't have a place for our employees or their sleeping in the back room [noise]\nAll temporary and you've you know these stories how frequent were overcrowding situations just this past summer\nThis summer has probably been the most frequent complaint summer that I've had since I started here in two thousand Fifteen well so in three years this has been the busiest inspection summer we've had a we received [noise]\nAt least ten or overcrowding complains okay all of which were confirmed mhm um some of them repeat offenders and we ended up having to take those landlords to court it's when\nYou allow so many people to live in your property and you know it's there and then you repeat the offended\nThat's considered negligence by the state law and you can actually get fined and actually get charged with a felony with that as a landlord for allowing this on your property it's real it's dangerous issues\nTo challenge for sure chicks who let's\n[laughter] wow\nWe've gone from plastics to marijuana to ah overcrowding now ticks\nDoesn't seem that bad that could just be my opinion for this summer but I didn't hear about it as much as I thought it was my first summer lived here about a year a lot of people warn me\nHurt all the warnings about you know aware of long pants and you know ... you know just check yourself\nIt's an issue all over the country\nYou know ... you know just check yourself it's an issue all over the country but here it didn't seem that bad or is that just me\nIt's definitely bad um but I just as as bad as overcrowding is this this summer tics were good this summer this\nYear we had a real ... in in tick borne illnesses I don't know if it's been a the increased information out there better education programs I like to take full credit on\nA ... asking and it could be that people are being more careful because nobody wants to tick bite nobody wants to deal with that yeah absolutely Lyme disease is nasty it's nasty and\nAnd what's interesting you know Lyme disease is the most pervasive illness so that's that's the one everyone knows of\nBut it's not the one that's going to kill you there are men there's pull off in their star either is Rocky Mountain spotted fever there is an easy on me I mean most of the list goes on your um so tick tick issues are real problem about what\nThe information we're putting out there and the information of federal government's been putting out there\nPeople are coming from Nantucket now with the knowledge they're not coming here blind and then we have to educate them at the time that they find a tick it's getting a lot easier on the prevention side and we really saw it this summer hits I'm really happy to say that the numbers are down knock on wood\nHow does the fall and winter season impact how many ticks are thriving on on the island when we get into the summer season and we've got you know people uh hiking and walking and enjoying the outdoors\nSo ticks are mostly active above the ... of forty degree march so when it's forty degrees or hotter outside um that's on takes really kind of start coming out of their hibernation they started coming out and start feeding\nRight now with the global warming issue we've had really warm ball a the ticks are going to be active well into the end of October um possibly in the November which is unusual\nAh usually by November the temperatures have dropped low enough that they're starting to become a little inactive they're looking for that last meal before they go into hibernation\nUm but right now it makes you make sure you still are spraying per meter and then that you're using your long pants and that you're talking to your parents into your shoes but if you have a cat do not spray per meter in on it a permit turns our legal to ticks and cat and a good tip\nSo now is not the time to let your guard down correct or do not let your guard down\nFlu season flu season almost I guess it is now yeah yeah and I got my flu shot yesterday actually yeah okay sure um we always we\nAlways request that people get flu shots um there's a lot of information out there and misinformation where people talk about\nUm the negatives of the flu and that it's only thirty percent effective things like that well thirty percent protection is still better than zero and even if in that thirty percent protection for the people who were protected a hundred percent\nJust because a hundred percent of the blue wasn't blocked doesn't mean that the vaccine isn't blocking the other different strains okay um they're always four or five strains and each one shot I'm so if it's protecting you and all of those different strains it's it's better for everybody and it creates what's called herd immunity\nSo if you and I are have flu vaccines and then there's a third person in the room who cannot get a flu vaccine because they're immuno compromised their and chemotherapy are having other illness things like that auto immune problems\nWell because of you and I are vaccinated and we he knows that person will no for sure that we don't have the flu and that person is safe because we have reached that herd immunity interesting but if you would have not had the flu vaccine it is possible that you would be carrying the flu virus with you and we can get that third person sick\nWent into the season do we know if this year's vaccine is going to be limited in as far as effectiveness or it's it's we are going to have a better year as far as how effective that vaccine is going to be\nThat's always tough because that follows what's called an ... an epidemiology curve and that'd be curve an epidemic curve\nSo with flu it um stay late in the stay dormant for about a week after you've been infected and then you start showing symptoms and then people start going to the doctor so we won't know until about\nTwo weeks after the peak\nWhether that that was really truly that active peak is when\nA usually the peak usually to peek in January or early February um but with the seasons being so out of whack sometimes the peak goes all the way through into march this last year the flu season lasted and lingered on your own time that's right now\nPlenty of places to get a flu shot I Would think yes um where should people look I'm actually look on the Nantucket caught us hospitals website there holds their hosting flu clinics the entire month of October I'm\nThere and they're walking or no appointment necessary um and then also the pharmacies are offering the flu shots as well and if you're off island there are plenty of walk and clinics and the pharmacies also offered the flu shot they're two\nAnd a final point I wanted to make before we wrap things up I read an article you were quoted in it and it was talking about the Nantucket effect and I found this fascinating because cancer rates on the island of Nantucket are extremely low do you want to take credit for that too I Would always love\nTo go for it but uh I I was a fascinating article and I I just wanted to get your insights on that because I didn't expect to find it but I couldn't stop reading it because I thought it was fascinating in\nWhen you're looking at the all cancer rates of all different types of cancer Nantucket is really low it really you've aggregated at its it's great and that's and a lot of it is because of\n... we're so small um it's when there's ever a change in somebody whenever there is an issue you're you're more likely to run into a doctor at the at the your specific doctor will have to stop and shop here\nSo in it they will notice that change and you and there'll be able to say you know why don't you come in and get this screening or things like that so that that small town effect is a big one\nBut also because we're a small a small town the ... the small amount of what we called incidents how many people get diagnosed\nWell that's just the awe of ovarian cyst artistic you know the smaller the amount that we have smaller population we have the more each incidences were\nSo when you because we do numbers based on hundreds of thousands of population so we call a standardized incidence um per hundred thousand people\nSo if we have zero of cases of will say throat cancer and we have zero cases here when you extrapolate that to a hundred thousand\nIt's still going to stay zero sure but if you have only one and when you extrapolate that two hundred thousand it's going to be ten because we have technically according to the census ten thousand people on there and that's the number they use 'em so it will be around ten\n\n\n\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nMm [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nWritten for Benny Goodman by Erin ... that was the clarinet concerto this time Janet Hilton pleaded
