wasn't making art in some form during my life I'm the urge to create things as solid me from a young age and art education was always provided for me by my generous and creative parents\nSo I think by the time I got to high school I realize that art and art history we're always going to be defining elements to my personal an academic life and when I took a print making workshop at mass College of art back in my twenties I knew I had found my medium\nThat's great so interesting now Molly you have a long history on Nantucket your grandmother Gwen guy yard owns the opera house restaurant so you must have had some very interesting visits to the island can you tell us what about the island inspires\nYou need it took it is really um a place that's endlessly inspiring to me that holds the place in my memory it's filled with a really rich history goes stories famous visitors\nAnd of course ... imagery to work with um kind of around every corner so I'm at the island culture and its community and the ecosystems here also fascinating places to study um and we're up to slow down a bit when we're here which allows for maybe more careful observation of our surroundings\nA well put so now Molly can you tell us about your work and your\nProcess so typically I consider myself a polygraph print maker which means they use the collage image honest if not bored to make prints from and then make multiples of an image and then I lay or other images on top of them for those who aren't familiar with the process I tell them it's like making a giant stamp on and after the prints are made\nI occasionally and now more often than not will paint on top of the prince to add to mention um and the majority of my work in recent years is centered around the way human memory processes imagery I create semi it's abstract shapes and forms a drop of memories of time spent near the ocean or on the beach wow\nWell I Can't wait to see or new work and congratulations on your solo show can you tell us a little about what we'll see in this show so this show\nIs I'm going to be a jumping off point a combination of some new collage work where I'm taking prints and papers and repurposed thing my material to form abstract the geographic points on Nantucket\nUm it's going to be a way that I'm sort of pushing my medium to make a change in my practice a because it's vital to to sort of keep that

weighed in on the lawsuits over the controversial citizenship question on the twenty twenty cents is the court has sided with the Trump Administration and temporarily blocked the questioning of commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nDozens of state cities and other groups are suing over Russia's decision to add the question which asks census takers if they are us citizens and here's how long has been reporting on these lawsuits he joined us now from New York morning on the\nMorning Noel so why did the Supreme Court temporarily block a lower order for the commerce secretary to testify for these lawsuits well\nIs a request from the Trump Administration which has been arguing that these lawsuits should be resolved based on internal documents emails memos they've already released for these lawsuits about the citizenship question and not on any questioning of commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nThe plaintiffs in these lawsuits really want to question commerce secretary Wilbur Ross because they think that these documents are not sufficient that there have been inconsistencies in a rough his testimony to Congress about why and when he added the citizenship question\nAnd the plaintiffs want to use a deposition uh questioning of Ross in order to get more evidence is all preparation for a trial\nThat is expected to begin on November fifth in New York could be the first trial of the six lawsuits around the country and at this point the troubling ministry nation could ask the Supreme Court to permanently block commerce secretary Wilbur Ross is deposition\nOregon even asked the Supreme Court to hear this case so we're not quite sure right now what will happen to this trial if that is the case\nThat's the Supreme Court to hear this case so we're not quite sure right now what will happen in the trial if that is the case well\nWhat is the Supreme Court order mean for the states and cities that are suing over the citizenship question\nIt means that the windows really closing take like additional evidence to support their claims in this lawsuit\nAnd it's important remember the Supreme Court did allow last night in this order the plaintiffs attorneys to question the Justice Department official John Gore he's the acting head of the civil rights division that the administration says needs this citizenship question to better enforce the voting rights act\nAnd the Supreme Court is allowing additional document requests but again we have to see what the ministry nation does next in their next expected requesting Supreme Court and what they asked the Supreme Court to do a before a trial starts\nAnd Hansi when can we expect to find out like the the final fate of the citizenship question\nUltimately these this legal battle is expected to be argued in front of the Supreme Court\nAnd so once this gets fully onto the Supreme Court docket we are likely not going to get any answer on whether or not this question stays or goes from the courts until
