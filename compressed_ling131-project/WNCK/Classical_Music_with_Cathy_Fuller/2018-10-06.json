to as he talks the realm of waning ourselves away from the twenty four seven digital invasion it tends to hold them many of the hostage work social situation\nWe have to fantastic gift for cross guard the day first up and good one author of the new book come to the lake I'm already relaxed same those forward\nAnd our second segment we'll welcome another amazing woman Ella wall Richard Lewis just out with her new book reclaiming joy\nA premiere for widows let's get the show moving with and good one and walk to cross currents and he's got and I got to say every single one of us would be well advised use your book as a recipe for re think how we live our lives\nA little background on that she's a true mid Westerner who has a young woman came to love her days long pleasant like he was caught and now she has the book out come to the lake\nAnd many of us have fond memories like you wile away days like whether it's in the Adirondack a where the blue ridge so\nTell us what the lakes they meant for you and how that worked decades later\nWell Scott I'm fortunate that a life on pleasant lake for me at is in a Nineteen twenties authentic lake ... now the title of my book is reflections on a cottage light so lake days for me literally is going back in time and\nAnd communicating and living a life\nLike we used in not all attached a gadget for only a to getting this legacy on on record for the future generation in our family thing we need to preserve this very special unique way of being which we've lost everywhere else in our lives\nAnd one of the things that you say in the book you say the right of passage is simple one simply truly love life have to lay out at you and still that when the Fifteen year old boys and girls come to the lake now they're part of your family or they're part of your friends family\nHow do you bring them into the fold that they really appreciate the great treasures of life along the lake yet so we\nAre in our fourth generation of family out in this cottage and it started in Nineteen fifty of late and I think that these and my husband's mother in law that there'll be no TV at the lake and that was a choice and we continue to make that choice now raising our children who are now\nYou continue to make that choice now raising our children who are now have children have their own it was easier because the the device we had to put away was simply a game boy or something now with our grandchildren it's getting harder and it's even harder for us adults because\nMy smartphone is also my camera that come out my kayak taking pictures\nI have to tell myself it is not at no time to exercise or call but it all starts with choice and also leading by example as parents so for that Fifteen year old if if it's just not an option then it's go jumping the lake\nYour husband was a very successful business person you know running a company\nFor decades and you were you at all of a sudden you were faced with with kind of taking over that company so I'm sure that applies to people that are listening today they've been in similar situations where their loved one has left us and and then they're left with trying to figure out where they go so how did you navigate all of that\nWell I'm fortunate not only our count since Nineteen Seventy ... mess was there every minute they kind of how why counting on\nBy where my husband's family had Nineteen twenty eight and ... ... ... that didn't work\nOut frankly but I did have the account and then I you know and that's sort of women being there as a professional at passers because just really don't want to be as people at all and that happens too often I'm told\nThat that was that was just a God that the children with me um they were just there for\nEvery business decision I had I had a friend who had been with us from many years not two weeks after my husband bad and it was just like I didn't know how to deal with and she gave me two pieces of the best advice I see\nOne wise you can't do this alone you're going to have to hire someone yeah how ... and she helped me as I say\nThis is the courts and everyone else the banks and everyone else who wants to death certificate probate all of those things they will not give you time to or you know and so my daughter helped me\nAnd a personal assistant at keeping it could go down to my husband's off a clean out I'll sort through records I had no choice under the circumstances I immediately to work\nLike you said very little time to agree one of the interesting points in your book and and I love how you weave through there is a lot of spiritual connections within the book and you leave biblical pieces into the book as well and particularly around Paul's letter to the Libyan tell us what drove you to think\nYou know how policy letter to the ... and we all hear about this when we're in church were reading the Bible\nTell us how that really drove your thinking in putting this book together because your book covers a lot from Paul letter\nI tell the family story and a half I quite an empty their entire life on a subsistence farm in rural Mississippi and when she died written in the ... for her five what was the first whatsoever said\nI Am with the content was a very very young child when she died so\nI heard this story from my mother my entire life and that's why I was very very ill you're just waiting for him I said we had ... points in my life when I have read Italy and depressed discouraged I have read it but as\nYou or I worked for choice or joy is watching that and when any place else that's old or did you test them and that that's what I read it and the way all morning hours after my husband and I just needed\nTo hear those words that courage\nOver and over again and so it was bad for your lighter walking down main street and pass it that I could actually happy I Can't believe they have you know and so it was natural for me to turn back to Libya\nTo use it as an yeah I can read it I guess the question because it has to be that the\nLibyans pride pride they approached I wrote it I think the practical ice is ... ...\nYeah in the book does not come across it all is a Christian book I mean there's obviously Christianity which through it but it's not a Christian book uh it's definitely a spiritual book so as much as the Libyans drove you I Do want to touch on this because our show originates on that\nSuch as the Libyans drove you\nI Do want to touch on this because our show originate from Nantucket\nObviously Nantucket played a big role in helping you move from a tragic place in your life to kind of a whole new life so talk about that I I I Do want to read one little passage or that you have in the book\nI'm not going to quote at all but just a very short court ended as we all need a place that gives us peace and federal happiness a place of both good memories and keen anticipation\nFor me that place with Nantucket\nAnd that really touched me because you know Nantucket as a whole is a special place in my life as well but tell us how Nantucket helps you really kind of turn the corner as well\nI was alone when I went there I was afraid to say a week I had never been in a place where I live in a while we're on right now you mentioned that in the book to pay\nA oh for a while at the sea ice ... mind boggling and ... every year with pack longer and longer right now for three and a house I'm All right now but that house\nNext summer spot right here on the tennis\nOr to combat guys that to me ... or so he said I think it's a place and he's absolutely right oh I have a place and talk it from me and as I sit here and I asked him looking over all painting the harbor\nThat I bought on Nantucket several years ago we\nHad a computer on I Would see rain I'll pick up the flowers in the ... yeah well actually passed out with memories and reminders and one thing I mean I get it to read to the\nQuaker history on men have you mentioned that yeah right and how\nIt is peaceful place and very far from the world or if there's a history Ron women were alone going back to that is right by Ellen cap I Love that I\nSee very competent women in leadership positions in Port institutions on the island\nI Do feel I feel ... and of course the flowers out there that we can we think about that time and not think about what Eric ...\nI Would highly recommend Dallas book reclaiming joy it brings reality the life and it gives all of us whether you're a widow or widower or just any one today who\nIs having trouble with the problems that we all face in our daily lives because this book\nGives you a path forward I Would remind folks the book is is on sale at local bookstores including bookstores on Nantucket in on the Cape and nationally\nAnd also an Amazon L I really thank you for being part of the show today it's really a bridging this is Scott with my I Want to sign off by wishing everyone a great holiday weekend and go out and enjoy the best that\nFall has to offer come back next week when we'll feature of the west wing or stories from inside the Obama White house will also take some time to counteract the stereotype of American Appalachian region that never a dull moment cross currents\nAgain Ella wall Pritchard thank you again and take good care and I look forward to seeing you on Nantucket thank you so much gotten\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nPlus currents which would Meyer on Nantucket ... NPR station WAMC Kaye doing it again next time for insightful commentary on topics that impacts every one's life cross currents which would mind [noise]\n\nThat's why you're there that's very cool and um and I know that you have thought about having other locations for doing like tell me about that process\nYeah I mean it's it's already kind of the gun and some circumstances that guy partnered with a hotel in Malibu, California for a year and a half and I did like a retail component and our lobby and then I fill out the space in the back that was um\nA beautiful wellness center and so we did yoga and massage and re key and found healing and all kinds of things um\nAnd then I did a pop up in um the canal street market which is in Manhattan It's right on ... street you know and it's like I'm In like a community retail space\nUm and then I Do I Do partnership pop up like all over the place that we've done them with men rep Heller we've done them with\nUm Lulu lemon we've done them with the whole house of tears so anywhere I can continue to share you know the gifts of what happens in this place an outrage but\nThat's the thing that has been very apparent as what happens in this door need just spread and it needs to be\nUm accessible to more people across the world because it again it is like it's a feeling so when you come in here and you do the things you leave\nFeeling happier and better about life I mean it's almost unexplainable because I'm thinking you have to experience but I just I Know it's like my sole purpose to do this now\nYou know who you're on a mission oh yeah [laughter] so what so and it's going\nWell I was just going to add you know I've also comes from a background of like working in corporate America and some of my design years and I see how business works and I see how I Do business that is different than the way other people do business which is person to person again and it's\nYou know it's for the betterment of a greater cause rather than a bottom line dollar I mean we all have to make money and there has to be you know\nFinancial purpose for what we do but it can't be what Dr ...\nRight right it's a you know it's the triple bottom line people profit planet\nAnd ... you know\nI'm so in your store in Brooklyn which your favorite thing about it\nOh gosh it's so hard to pick one thing I'm\nInteresting well I mean I what I think that our products\nLike ... Lindsey products are very special because again what I've done is partnered with our current vendors so say we had a candle maker and she is a local candle company and she started out selling here we were second store or something\nSo for me what's really exciting is to say hey candle maker friend we would love to do a collaboration can do with you the physically for our stores and support her not only from another business development but also we get another product that's\nIn line with what the growth of this brand is mhm so\nWe do candles reduced in care we jewelry we do have a child and then personally under my label we still do apparel and clothes and home good so for me it's like sharing the experience which is\nFrom a business standpoint double the work because you have more cooks in the kitchen but from a story in a relationship perspective it's so important to be doing that for me\nThat's great that's ... that is really great congratulations\nThanks yeah it's been amazing 'cause even we've done amenities for hotels you know so then it's like we partner on bigger projects for other people as well right so it's like a little incubator\nWith the has the impact of the ripple effect right you're rippling out into the world\nYeah exactly yeah\nSo so what is next like what is next on your heroes and what's the next plan\nFor the next plan is\nSo after closing the ... face um\nThere was a bit of a temporary situation I absolutely know that we need a location in LA absolutely you know that when you look in the Midwest and in the Pacific northwest so it and it's you know at this point it's people reaching out to\nMe and saying we need what you do here and we need this here and I've got great practitioners over here and\nYou know it's I it's the most heartwarming\nCommunication I can ever received because it's now people under stand it from a different perspective so I'm looking for\nThe you know financial partnership of how to take us to another level\nAnd really you know because I started the store with a\nTiny amount of money all by myself with a free and fair and for six months\nAnd have worked it and worked and worked at heart and soul and blood and sweat and tears to what it is now and you know\nNow it's time we've built it we know what it does we know it it's a symbol of doing an beyond so we just made that partnership to give it to get us to the next level so it was time to ruin it\nYet [laughter] All right so I'm definitely we need to put that sort of request out into the universe\nYeah yeah so um tell me about your life right like what are the things you do to stay inspired were be balanced or even to find the talent that you have in the store\nUm well I Love to travel first inform us so any second I can like get away just to be a different part of the world or\nBe in a different culture like anything from that perspective gives me creativity and it gives me ideas for how we can do things better how we can make things better um\nYou know I Do I I still believe in doing fitness as much as possible and right now I'm into rumble which is like a boxing cardio bank [laughter] so I exercise as much as I ... and um\nWhich is part of the gross because we have in our wellness center downstairs redo ... yoga classes\nUm and bar classes but we can if you know it's a small space so we can fit maximum eight people okay so you know rolling not out into a more\nMax and an eight people okay so you know rolling not out into a more holistic fitness base is the goal\nAnd then I it's just being out in the world and connecting with people and to me is the most inspiring\nAnd I love hearing people's stories I Love sharing in other people's services so I'll just or other you know wellness centers or stores or whatever it may be just to kind of spread the love\nYou and where do you think you know all these services and classes there in this constant evolution pattern as people find really moved into these were they find things that appeal because I think it's human nature when you do things you know when you get when you do the same thing over and over again it can become more boring\nRight exactly so how do you see ...\nWell this is really interesting because I was just having this conversation yesterday because um and I was learning about numerology yesterday and the woman I was speaking with said that\nI don't know eight years ago is when people started\nThere was a shift in the way we were doing things and yoga got really big\nAnd everybody started being into yoga and we all kind of shifted and said okay we need to start stretching and breathing so that's been an eight year process at us like opening up and ask for opening up it becomes this\nMore intense process because now you have to make the time to do the yoga do the things and be prepared for what it means to be more open hearted and to live a life that's in a more conscious way which is harder than going through life and just doing the things eating the food routine and so\nTo that point we have to find a place that\nPersonally what I think is allowing individuals know their own balance and teaching people to trust what they want to do what they need for their bodies but they need for their souls\nWhat they mean to be happy in the world because it's not that's just not out there for people so if you can really take one on one you know like if it's if it's a fitness class we're all going to go to the fitness class and like maybe someone's going to celebrate maybe if someone's gonna feel\nTotally exhausted maybe they're going to afterwards go eat like fast food or they're going to eat something really healthy like it's all people are still individual human and they need to find a way to be supported\n...\nW in the MORNING EDITION weekday mornings at six all things considered weekday afternoon at four we are eighty nine point five W.

morning in the rain I saw a man leaning against the cables he seemed to be waiting for a lift response of fresh rain on his shoulders he was carrying a cheap overnight bag and one hand he was then nondescript with a capital down over his eyes\nWould have forgotten him completely except that just an hour later well crossing the last the skyway over the Jersey flaps I saw him again\nAt least he looked like the same person he was standing now with one from pointing west I couldn't figure out how he got there but I thought probably one of those vast trucks picked him up beat me to the skyway and left him off\nI didn't stop for him then late that night I saw him again\nI was on the new Pennsylvania Turnpike between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh it's two hundred and sixty five miles long with very high speed limit I was just slowing down for one of the tunnels when I saw him standing on her an arc light by the side of the road\nCould seem quite distinctly the bag the cap even the spots of

feels round was the autumn stumbling dreaming and the golden light and I was\nDriving slowly drinking it in when the roads suddenly ended in a detour in front of the barrier he was standing\nPolice plane and go\nOn there was nothing sinister about him he was just drive as much sense what was his attitude menacing really stood there\nWaiting almost dripping little sheep overnight bag in his hand he looked as though he'd been waiting there for hours and he looked up he hailed me you started to walk forward\nOh\nNo\nNo no they're not just now sorry grown ... or\nA no no not today and the other way going to New York sorry\n[noise] after I got back in the car on the road again sort of\nPicking them up even having 'em sit beside me was somehow unbearable the same time I felt more than ever much ... alone ...\nHour after hour went by the fields the town's ticked off one by one the light changed\nThat I was going to see him again [noise] though I dreaded the site I caught myself searching the side of waiting for him to appear\nYeah what are they are you sell sandwiches and poppy or don't ya yeah we do in the daytime uh were closed up one of the night I Know but I was wondering if you could possibly let me have a cup of coffee like coffee oh not this time and I just sort of what the cookies and back\nNo no no don't shut the door please slip listen just a minute ago just a minute ago there was a man standing here right behind the standard suspicious looking man I I don't mean to disturb you see I was driving along I just happened to look in there he was\nAlready going well nothing you'll take it a net that what you owe on your way we're like oh sure oh\nYeah [noise]\nI got into the car give us a little more slowly I was beginning to hate the car I could have found a place to stop the rest of the little I was in the Ozark Mountains in Missouri now view resort places they were closed\nOnly an occasional log cabin seemingly deserted that's all they broke the monotony of the wild wooded landscape I had seen him at\nThat roadside stand I knew I see them again maybe at the next turn of the road I knew that when I saw him next I Would run them down but I didn't see him again I\nDidn't see him until late next afternoon [noise] accept the cars sleepy little junction just across the border in Oklahoma to let a train passed by when he appeared across the\nTracks leaning against a telephone pole [noise] perfectly airlift dry day the red clay of Oklahoma was speaking of the southwestern son yet there were [noise] spots of\nFresh rain on his shoulders couldn't stand that [noise] without thinking blindly I started the carnival among the tracks you didn't even look you're staring at the ground I stepped on the gas hard during we'll sharply told them I could hear the train the\n\nUm [noise]\nUm [noise]\n\nUm [noise]\nUm [noise]\nUm [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we're back hope everybody enjoyed this week's actors Coney presentation of the Lucille Fletcher classic the hitchhikers and now we're going to talk a little bit more about this particular play we're going to talk about hitchhikers as things like that since the or do you want to start us off\nThanks cats um yeah I was very fascinated by a Lucille Fletcher the author because actually I had never heard of her before only in connection with um these radio play your eyes yeah and she wrote the hitchhike her and she\nAlso wrote a sorry wrong number which worse than well said was the greatest radio script ever written and and I think he probably correct um her style of writing is amazing and I think as as you and I read through the hitchhikers\nWe were so impressed with the language and\nAnd the and the tightness of it over the years that feeling of dread that she managed to stay in a in a pretty short\nRadio and it and it just in an audio on medium yeah I mean it's amazing\nTo me like [noise]\nI agree and um it also turns out that she was married to\nBernard Herman probably one of the greatest composer for them\nOn the twentieth century and even on a long time ago yeah\nHe was kind of genius and you know and so often happens\nOne day you'll Fletcher\nMary [noise]\nRear [noise]\nLanguage\nThen later on when it's just interesting that\nSo many Greenville many women\nYeah so she is she in laughter is fabulous radio planes I machine\nAnd the more interesting work for television and film\nSeriously I mean based on the strength of those yeah thing yeah right there who knows what else you and and I just wanted to mention\nOn uh the or the other uh play sorry Ron number on it was a performed originally it's almost one person that radio play and re performed by Agnes Morehead for radio for suspense and it was so popular they kept\nBringing it back and bringing it back and bring it back that's right and then Barbara Stanley ... who is one of my absolute favorite a skill that you know of all John had amazing\nI'm a made the film version of it which is really stand right\nAnd I happen to know that the actress comedy is currently negotiating with Lois Lamont to star in the creation of that famous radio broadcast ... sorry Ron number that originally started acting us Morehead now that is a\nFascinating little nugget if everyone okay so if that happens that means we're going to be able to get to hear that their version of\nHad this Morehead her swelled grits regarding while going to use that so I'm very excited about well I'm excited\nAbout that too I Can't wait for that\nAnd just a couple of words about Bernard Herman I guess any film fan no ah the named Bernard tournament he um one several Academy Awards for scoring and most famously he works with Alfred Hitchcock psycho for which he created in all strings\nSoundtrack why do you think about that film and the amount of tension that that those strings\nCreate that movie it's pretty amazing he did north northwest the man who knew too much he did vertigo heated Citizen Kane the day the earth stood still and many more and his last film was taxi driver well\nAnd he he passed away shortly after that film was completed and he won the Academy Award for best film score posthumously\nAnd didn't you mentioned that he was rather young dish when\nHe died at age sixty four which which radio at home in an area that's too bad but he also this is just a funny little nugget ... he\nWrote the theme song for has gotten will travel [laughter]\nWhich is one of my favorite like western you can't call it a cowboy series but you know it was a TV Western\nStarring fabulous Richard Boon yes wire pallet in San Francisco and he wrote the theme song which I loan thing for you although I Do tend to\nGo to and I don't maybe on another you know I'm trying to deter you do that but yeah well maybe we don't want another show let me get an entire episode to all the songs we wanted to single yeah but we couldn't for maybe I should\nJust devoted to western style would regret anyway I Bernard Herman with an extraordinary a composer and snake collaborated on the hitchhikers\nSent us the okay great segue because what I was gonna say next was uh just talk about how the inspiration for this particular\nA radio play came to be and the uh the whole ... of it is is that a Lucille Fletcher married Bernard Herman and shortly after their marriage Nineteen thirty nine they left New York for Hollywood\nHe was starting to work on the score of Orson Welles Citizen Kane\nThey traveled across country many many times by air and by train but they're most memorable trip was in Nineteen forty where they decided to drive their Packer convertible across the country now Fletcher on the way out from New York saw quote an odd looking man on the Brooklyn Bridge and then on the Polanski skyway\nThey never saw him again however didn't quite know what to do with the idea of ... a year later they can see the idea of doing it as a ghost stories so\nI think it's fascinating that they it was based on a similar real incident or the inspiration for came came from a real instead I think that's very cool because it certainly back then before the interstates came around you know driving across country was\nIt would be I think it would be cool and it would be fun but it would be you know it would be a little scary there would be an element of danger there as well\nThat's right and it took a long time yeah I stay in the script eight days of drive it wasn't like a yeah they're they're the ... the interstate system which really be gun around that time or they're they're\nThey're worried a whole lot of roads that you could count on fashionable to be safe and speedy and yeah\nYou know the only right that's right\nI'm going to add one more little nugget that's very interesting about the seal Fletcher she also was inspired by real life incident when she wrote\nShe also was inspired by real life incident when she wrote sorry wrong number really yes and um the I ... she now even though it it that we can we could save it for 'em\nSay now will say it again later [noise]\nWe will do that um she was standing in line in the grocery store\nIn on the Upper East side of Manhattan and get her daughter was sick and she was buying special food for her and this very well dressed woman who lives in front of her would not let her cutting line\nEven um she asked if she could because her daughter was at home alone and she was ill right so Lucille said that she wrote sorry wrong number as a revenge play on that NASA ... on a ladder cut\nThat's interesting many great creative endeavors have happened because of things like that I was just talking about something like that the other day\nI'm the only oh that's fantastic and I I uh man I really hope that that whole thing with the actors colony works out they're able to do that particular uh production so do I yeah the last thing I Will say about the whole uh uh Fletcher a Bernard Herman thing and the inspiration for this story is that\nUh I think I saw one of the cool things about it was um\nShe said in an interview in Nineteen eighty eight quote we really share that story together he was very interested in that story so he had to write the music for it and I just think it was great that they were both in the car so they both had a\nVery personal vested connection to this uh this particular incident and and I think it just made it better yeah you know like exactly okay so moving right along\n\nThis is eighty nine point five WICK Nantucket Nantucket sold for NPR News in classical music on

sorry about\nThat I think about when I started going to ... my ... my favorite my favorite place for coffee so it's it's a thank you for being on the show it's good to it's good to see you know one of my favorite stories Jason is that uh\nWhen I was I'm kind of debating on whether I was going to move to the island or whether or not to move to Nantucket I remember I had to vote I had a ... at the time I had the vote the HGTV episode of you and your level\nSo I had a TiVo at the time I had TiVo the HDTV episode of you and your lovely wife Courtney house hunting on the island and I felt like I knew you because I was trying to decide whether or not to make the move I was trying to find out a little bit more about the island I Would watch that show over and over and I think what I've told people one of the unique experiences\nThat ah that I had is I moved here on a Sunday I moved in\nAnd have a got up in the morning on Monday got dressed out of boxes that I hadn't unpacked yet parked in the town lot\nWalking my way to the chamber office at zero main street and the very first person I saw was you and we don't hockey or on the phone you were outside of the handle bar but I I remember I remember looking at you and thinking oh my God there is and you know\nOr so and I've gotten to know you pretty well you're of course now the chair of the a\nTon of Nantucket select board and there's a big um special town meeting coming up that's Wednesday October tenth\nA and this is divided into two uh the segments then one at six\nAnd seven thirty correct yes yep what's the reason for that so by charter anybody can have their own special town meeting so you and I if we wanted to go out and get enough signatures ... we can have a special town meeting certain citizens went out and they wanted a warrants articles\nOn a special telling me and they timed it so we can have it at the same time versus having it a month later and having a town clerk's office set everything back up and having all of us come back and the other night and getting babysitters and taking off work to to to come here so they\nThey timed it so we have to so technically we have to say when does it start to people can show up maybe specifically for that one\nAnd so what will happen is will be going through our regular special town meeting in at seven thirty will have to\nOpen up the special special right that's the number two and then make a motion to go back to the first one and if there's just a little bit of time left OK finish it up and then get into the second one that it does that's kinda how that works\nA lot to talk about uh I Know the first number of articles are all have to do\nWith a marijuana and the and the legalization of marijuana or I Know from um my role as a regional tourism council representative on behalf of Nantucket with the state a tourism of dealing with um marijuana\nA a store front and and you you know you have the you have that that smell that everybody's associated with and it goes beyond just smoking it you've got beverages you've got edibles you've got a topical products you've got ... for for pain out of those types of products work into this\nProcess I think all of the the medical products were CBD and in those type of things I'm the medical side are we at nobody who has a problem with but the edibles like the you know the candies and that kind of stuff there's been a lot of concern on the ... how does this get in the hands of children right right that's why we're concerned so\nCannot control commission is concerned about this and they said no candies but they also\nCould while I'm reading as it could look like a cough drop is type of thing which to me that seems like candy but if it looked like it was in pill form this is what I'm advocating for right pill form in a little box that's you know child proof and it's in your area of your house\nThe other you know medications are than to me that makes sense and you're already taught your kids not to not such those things and if the edible as they get tricky so it's you know you can self regulated\nI mean most most people are pretty responsible they're not going to allow the ... round is to go to the kids right but that's the vision that like this is what's gonna happen if we have medical\n... use ... you know medical marijuana so we're a little skeptical on the edibles right now just we don't we we don't know what that looks like does it look like a gummy bear and we said no to that you know we we don't want any of those things starting off or or maybe never\nIt I mean that makes sense to me I I ... well you know what it does to me to as as a father I've seen those and a lot of times they're individually wrapped but it does look like a gummy bear it looks like a piece of candy you would buy in a in a candy store\nAnd uh it it can be very confusing there was the story a couple of months ago where a ... a youngster in elementary age a student I'm actually got his hands on one and and they made him quite ill and and I I Know that's a a a that's a ... that's something that everybody everybody worries about\nUm we're in island where surrounded by federal waters\nAre federal air this has been talked about it I I Know a few people have asked me about it that are confused about it how do we get around that has that been been talked about because it's a little hard to grow it here if you can't get illegally can't get the seats here\nI think the state is looking the other way on how the seeds are going to get her they're assuming that the seats are already here or every time I asked that question to the state because usually they say next question right because if not they would never be technically you would never start sure but I wanted a star\nWe'd never be technically you would never start sure but I once it does start and I I Know when you're the process of how to how to grow these plants but once you start to believe that you can continue to keep going you have to bring any more seeds over\nUm what we're trying to look down the road you know I've got conversations with other members of what happens when the if the feds open this up and it's and it's it's legal across our country then you can get here\nOne of the advantage of this now is can we keep\nCan we keep them the money on the island ... and ... you know so it's not so we're not just bringing in product from somewhere else we can grow it here which means jobs which means\nWe have to produce it here manufacture here if the tested here tested here I I like all those ideas right right I mean I'm always looking for any other smaller industry even as small as it can be\nFor this island because right now it's just ... tourism\nNot that we're going to get you know a thousand jobs from the marijuana industry but you know you could pick away at it whether you know whether I have these dreams of having to ship building complex is here and you know schools and that type of stuff just to add on to our economy so we're not dependent or eggs aren't one basket so this is a little one\nI liked that idea but if the feds open it up then what happens how do we stop big marijuana which is slowly happening\nFrom kind of affecting us in a negative way and it's hard to think down the road is something that's not happened yet how do we prepare for that I think that's why we're trying to start off slower and a little more restrictive\n... restrictive side it's everybody feels comfortable and it's safe but at the same time these businesses have to succeed as well are we can't we can't make it so restrictive that we all go out of business some people might want that\nNow you have to grow it here you have to test it here before you can sell it here is that economically feasible\nFor a a business so that's the question for article five do we limit\nThe adult use recreation licensed to that's the question so that passes\nThan the select ... can only give out to licenses okay right and if it doesn't pass then we can still only give out to licenses but then we have to we don't have a general via law to help us say sorry number three or four or five who want to come here you can't we only have to\nSort of general by law makes it much easier for like word to control it now we can still say no to three or four and five or six or nine or whoever is knocking on the door\nBut it's harder right without the general by law okay and so I've I've got a lot of people come to me saying you're limiting this what you're doing is you're making these two licenses really expensive\nRight so somebody can start it and they can sell their license because there is only too if you leave it to market conditions two or three oldest it'll it'll work itself out right and the best will survive right coffee shops there is not limit of two or ten or you wish that we're\nWe're in is not really actually right because that motivates me oh no it Saturday coffee in the best you can share and the best music in the best experience\nIn our shop yeah so there's some there's there's a legit debate there you're looking to the future\nA little bit you get through these these five articles things are approved everything is talked through where do you see this in six months where do you see this in a year as marijuana here and ah is it is successful thriving business on Nantucket\nBy next summer\nThere may be one possible you know there's there's one already\nGoing in the process already has a building in location that's already built they're just they're building already right right now that's more in the medical side right in the medical side if they have to go through and we've already given one applicant approve their host community agreement which they ... they would they have to have before\nThey can go to the next level next stage of the state process mhm so this is where it gets complicated so we limited to two does that mean we've already given out one licensing our only choosing one\nThat I mean that that's you know there's a lotta people who don't like that but we were Ninety five Ninety percent down the road with this one applicant before other applicants came in\nSo do we stop with this going forward with this one that we've been working with for a year 'cause we have these new people you know limits to to um I think every were holding off everything right now sure until after a special town meeting but what does look like next year\nOr I think there'll be maybe one open in a second one working to be open I mean it depends on how you build your facility or by next fall maybe they'll be right one one open it thriving I I think it's gonna be\nThe the people who are a little scared of it you know our our may be cautious are going to kind of drive by and go oh nothing's really nothing's really happened right\nWell it it's uh it it makes the Wednesday October tenth special town meeting even that much\nMore of an important get together for for everybody I Know a lot of people are concerned and uh I I appreciate you you are putting some clarity into this discussion because uh I think he would agree um if you could take a word it's confusing\nTo everybody here it is really as it has it been established yet and there's a lot of fear with this I mean this is a this is a drug we're talking about not trying to\nUh a license and to try something else back to the ship building the two more shipbuilders on that island right or this is a little scary to some unknowns or public safety issues\nJust anything are known as a little um there's reason to be cautious\nAppreciate you talking to us through you're going to come back next week 'cause we're gonna talk about a few other things are not related to marijuana that will come up with the town meeting and again that is happening Wednesday October tense at the Nantucket high school in the Walker auditorium special town meeting number one happens at
