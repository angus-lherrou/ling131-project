confidence and self esteem through stand up comedy and stories Andrew a grant from the community foundation for maintenance I could find\nSome really looking forward to this interview you know I've

getting these sitcoms that was Roseanne Barr ray Romano Tim Allen and it was like you've got to get an acting class well I did I was in an acting class\nBut I'd never been in the play so I got a chance to go to the summer to a place called Nantucket and they were doing a play called barefoot in the park so I ... for the role of Paul brighter and it was a place called theater workshop of Nantucket and I got there and there was this little\nMan who was into theater he looked like Mark Twain and he did everything he built to set the cast everyone he picked the place he was the artistic director and the executive director and his name was Richard carry so it worked for Richard carry\nThat first year and I noticed on Sunday Monday and Tuesday the theater was dark so I said to Richard carry\nCan I Do stand up comedy on one of those nights and he said sure you know theater is a little different we're getting about fifty sixty people a night for the play and I thought that was great\nBut when I posted a bunch of posters for stand up comedy on Monday nights put a price on there and had a couple of my friends come out I had a comedy show every Monday Night it was absolutely sold out\nA which was great for me and I got to do stand up as I was working on a you know sort of a theater career learning how to act a little bit but Richard Kerry had a son and he was supposedly

about you are quite a bit you're the boy was done well\nRight I feel like a at a comedy writer you don't have recognizable fame except in your home town and one other moment in my life where I did a bit on a show\nIn a T shirt and then in one market somebody recognize an airport I was like oh this is like what fame is the ... hours I've had that experience and then elsewhere on anti until Meghan Trainor showed up now now if you ... you wouldn't know if he's got a good person she's got a ...\nAll right so much of the last four years in high school was watching Letterman so part of my comedy

something about that so yeah so how do you\nGo from this little island younger you've got your passions you've got you things that you love to do how do you to New York city and you're getting pineapple for David Letterman\nRight so so ah when I was sixteen and it all goes\nBack to a Richard Gary theater actors theater he brought a heated we bought a dad my dad um he bought a dance troupe

car anyway you would drive the this dance troupe not to\nThe theater every night at six and I was just I was sixteen I was a good ball and he's cute girls on deck of cards the bunch dancers from New York I make them laugh I'd be at the theater for our and then I go out in my student type because it would get\nAccess to places like I talked to be aware\nUm interesting one of the actress is ah brought her husband down for a weekend\nOr and he was here and then he got bogged in I run this actually on my fiftieth birthday last week he actually said an extra day was ... to the five year old

I'm sixteen I may face money in in my mind I'm like it's just luck\nIn this lightning bolts yet you know do you know well and this is the advice I Would say yes you lightning bolts that once in a

bolt right and then she said\nOh don't to carry a little preparation meets opportunity luck hits so be prepared when it hits everybody or that's the other part one of my interview with Donna carry joined us next week on when comics for kids for part to\n\nKnow a quick clip from juicy top I'm from er stand up and learn program talking about opening Christmas presents\nTo the age understand the whole thing I didn't really understand [noise]\nI really think I read and [noise] when I\nLook\nLike a box you [noise] I get something inside [noise]\n\nMm\nMy father was exposed to ... he died twelve years ago so he died from mess up the ... so when I think about the location of where I live I think about the rolling hills of seamy valley and all the open spaces and then I look and I think about\nLos Angeles and the air pollution in Los Angeles and its marrying some air pollution in\nPlaces in China it's so bad right now and then I think about my father and the contaminants that he was working around and what eventually made him sick and\nMost people that know my story understand that when my father died that was the one thing that really jolted my life that changed me forever and had me ...\nAnd the thing that really jolted my life that changed me forever and had me focused on healthy living and how do I make my family healthy so that this thing doesn't happen to my family and the other thing that happened after my father died my uncle died and my aunt died and another uncle of my died\nAnd it just ripped my family apart from us being\nThis huge extended family and we were so close and there was like about thirty or forty of us together all the time to being everybody's scattering all over the United states because you know disgusted just rocks you know a family and that changed me\nBut I'm also grateful for it in the same sense because of that change I never would have worked on the issues that I work on today you know that really\nChanged my path so that I was looking into things that what causes cancer you know one of those things that causes cancer and then realizing well it's not just cancer that we have to worry about its all these other things that are just as bad and I wouldn't have had that understanding I wouldn't have that passion I wouldn't have had that charge\nHad all of this not happened to me and again it's all based on the location where I live and you know where our family is and just location location location you know\nBut it's that's how I come about it when I think of where I live and the location that I live and how that impacts who I Am and what I Do\nYeah I get it gave you the framework through which to explore all of this other work context it was not the answer I was expecting I actually was thinking about how close you moved to la Melinda and how Loma Linda is\nPart of the blue zones and and I was\nWondering like wishing involved in that to know about that [laughter] no I'm actually\nMore involved in rocket dying I don't know if you've ever heard of rocket dying there's the Santa Susanna field lab which is about four miles from my house and that's where a partial nuclear meltdown happened in Nineteen fifty nine\nAnd it was basically covered up for Thirty years the public didn't know about it until Nineteen eighty nine and that is an issue that I'm heavily involved and there's still a clean up their state agencies in California arguing with the public you know about to clean it up to not clean it up how much to clean up and that was\nOh jeez since Nineteen fifty nine so that's an issue that not everybody knows about that was the worst nuclear fallout we've ever had in the United states that no one ever knew about that happened right outside of Los Angeles that will blow your mind\nAnd not just Google rocket died they will I Will now\nAnd be ready to have your mind blowing yet I Do I Do a lot of work in the city I right now you know they they utilized ground water in the city of seamy valley and I really do not want them to utilize groundwater three miles from us\nYou know from that that's one of the local issues that I work on on for the city and I'm really happy to do that because I'm able to bring together my scientific advisors who\nOne of them is a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst right by you and um his name Dr Tom Zeller and he's one of the world authorities on perchlorate and that's one of the issues that we have\nUm that they're testing for Korean and the wells so you know it goes back to water and how you know water is life water is everything we can't do anything or live without it so\nI I think water and you know the air we breathe and and those types of issues are really important to me because at the end of the day what they do is they impact your family and your children\nPrimarily like if you're living in a more a heavily polluted area where you know poor air quality or poor drinking water what this really does is it impacts your children it you know it steals IQ points from them so it's like the difference between\nSomeone being able to go to UCLA but then you know they're going to see the sun just based on the testing you know they could have been smarter but they were exposed to all this stuff that a younger age\nSo you know those issues are really close to my heart because they go back to you know people don't know when they're exposed you know and I really feel like one of my jobs\nAs the dark than I Am [laughter] and it carries a lot about all these scientific things that other people are like ... I Can't hear you is to protect people even though they don't know what I'm there even though they don't know that I'm advocating for them I I really really and and the protector of families that's really how I look at it\nMhm yeah I get that and I love it I feel like you didn't have a superhero keep on there I think that's amazing um\nCan I keep the red and green and then not get up because it's Christmas because those are my favorite color is but I can never put them together [laughter]\nI'm sure we can arrange that many years\nSo there's three words that I think are really tied together that are important and I think that you know there are a lot of times the driving force behind people who are really connected to what motivates them to do good in the world yeah and their balance inspiration and gratitude um [noise] so\nHow how do you how you feel about those words and how did they in a fire or informed work you do\nWell I mean balance I Love that word and I hate that word at the same time I think it's a love hate relationship with balance\nUm balance is to me\nIt's important to have whereas when\nI hear the word balance I feel like it's a calming sensation where it takes you from\nGoing fifty miles an hour we're we're in this modern society where we're having so much thrown out as it such a fast pace it gives us the ability to come down to the ground and just get more grounded and I don't feel like your you know part of everything again excessive just flying away\nBut at the same time the flipside of that word is\nIt's like another word to worry about you know I'm not getting enough balance in my life by cheese where do I do that and how do I do that you know what I'm saying and so it goes from one sense where if we talk about it and then and it is something that is important and other sons\nThrowing something at women that they have to then again figure out okay what are the steps defining balance you know how do I do it and and then it just kind of like\nGives you that extra level of like anxiety of I'm not feeling balanced here I'm not feeling balance um I I've been I I don't know I'm a Libra I'm always balance you know I'm just I ... the way I see it is there are some days where I'm working a lot and there are some days when I'm playing a lot and there's some days where\nI spent all day cooking from my family and other days where I'm spending on you know spending with clients on the other side of the world and the way it works out for me is I just do what feels right in my heart at that moment\nAnd it's typically what I Need to be doing so that's that's how I deal with balance I'm also really fortunate to have\nA lot of help so people ask me how is it that you can work from home you know raise your three boys and have this huge career I have a lot of help I have my mother in law who lives\nYou know a three blocks from my house and I have my mom who live six miles from my house and I have so much help with the kids that it's it puts me in a unique situation to be able to do more right\nThan when it comes to inspiration\nInspiration is really easy for me inspiration I get that from everyday challenges that I have in my home because because I Know so much about a lot of these issues when I find something challenging for myself I Know that if I'm\nI've I Am getting aggravated by this\nIt must be the aggravation of every other woman in the world who's having to do a smidgen of what I'm doing and so I'm I'm inspired a lot by the challenges that I get in the world you know because I think\nChallenges or not they're they're not thinking that I don't really see them as bad I see challenges as opportunities and I really really do see challenges as opportunities and so I sit there and I'm like okay how do I\nHe's and I really really do see challenges as opportunities and so I sit there and I'm like okay how do I wrangled as beast didn't take him down to the ground and then interactions with the community the online community ... all of the women that um I have the the great honor to be able to help 'em in my life and in my in my personal life\nThose people inspire me the most because they remind me of why I'm doing what I'm doing so I Love being inspired by people around me and it's just again community community and myself you know my own challenges and then grateful and this\nI'm going to say I'm super grateful for my family obviously because I I Would be nothing without them\nBut but but I'm also really really grateful for challenges and and I'll go back to that because you know writing this book was basically me being challenged of\nYou know having to detox my home and having to figure this out and I interviewed spent hundreds of hours that kid you not hundreds of hours\nOn with experts are being able to do this and those are the scientists that focus on independent disruption pediatricians and public health experts and people that do this for a living so hundreds and hundreds of hours because I was challenged and they knew that if they helped me that I Would have\nObviously share it with the world and that's what I've done is they've taken my challenges\nAnd put them in a book and you can tell that they were challenges of mine because in my book there's a couple of four letter words and that is reflected when you have a real job and\nI'm One of those people that in real life does kind of like a sailor and you can I let it fly in my book but I Will say that I'm penguin Roosevelt put me back a little bit so what I wanted to say in here with a little bit just a little bit squeak your cleaner than what I actually wanted to say which they probably saved me by doing that [laughter]\nA five cent savings bank a local bank committed to

R. G.\nShow was presented by the town of ... I'm David Martin presidents have been in ...\nChamber of commerce and my guess today my new friend Jeff Carlson Nantucket natural resources coordinator how're you doing All right how're you doing wonderfully well I'm Glad to have you on the show\nLet's just start off for those who don't know and then we're just meeting for the first time as well talk a little bit about what Nantucket natural resources coordinator does wow\nA good question and of course in that I get from time to time um that explanation that I like to give my kids and my friends and family are fine with is\nThe natural resources department is kind of task with making sure that\nThe outside is nice for everybody can kind of more simplistic terms so that our water is swimming pool and you know and go fishing that you can find other outdoor experiences in our wetlands are protected and all of our habitats are are doing well because let's face it and then took it as\nYou talk it for for what's outside your window and when you get out of the car and get off the boat where you're going to go do and go fish and go see and bird watching ends with\nOur and get off the boat what you're going to go do and go fish and go see and bird watching and swimming and kayaking and all those wonderful things and\nUm the town is nice enough to employ us and tell us to try to keep it as nice as possible and that's what we try to do how long have you been on the job I've been with the town since two thousand and six um I started at the beach manager but\nThe natural resources department came to be in its first existence in late twenty eleven so of the town departments were one of the newer ones I'm as environmental issues have become more and more important than brought more to the forefront\nOur roles expanded more and more um sometimes it seems like it's kind of a never ex you know never ending expansion but um that have to it's awesome\nIt's one of the the the best jobs and and I love what I Do and I think our staff really love what they do and are passionate about it and I think you know I think all of us really at a base level just love being able to participate in the outdoors\nIt's a big responsibility how big of a staff do you have right now we have\nA full time employees were were filling a a vacancy our water quality specialist Caitlin Shaw who did an awesome job for us in helping develop our water quality program just laughed and more ah doing interviews to hopefully they'll her position starting next week um but besides her there are additional\nI'm including myself there eight of us total um that work fulltime and then we're we're blessed in the summer and a half three or four interns that that come in and they all do a really awesome job and kind of their own little specialty areas that we that we work in\nAnd I'm like I said we we we try to do our best\nDoes everyone have their own specialty within the department Oh absolutely as I\nProbably the most general we have every one from a terror Riley are shellfish biologist who runs the brand point shellfish hatchery\nAnd she's assisted there by the ... and Joe Miller\nWho I'm kind of run the day to day and do the oyster program and Joe is kind of the Jack of all trades to fix things and make things work and that he just came to us this year and has been really an awesome addition um we have our shellfish worn Jaycee Johnson and then are protected species and beach guy\nVinson Murphy and then a Joanne died in our office is really the person that makes it all go and make sure that we'll get the equipment that we need when we need it\nUm and kind of keeps everyone running and like I said we're looking to replace Caitlin and then our interns David and Allison and Katie and Catherine did an awesome job for us this\nSure so that's a new initiative from the board of selection and we're really excited to kind of get started and expand upon that and really excited for the level of commitment from the board I mean it's something that I'm select poured supporters always really critical for\nGetting funding and doing things so it's it's nice but what they've kind of asked us to do and it's it's great that they\nTook a more forty thousand foot view and said we know we have the staff that here was put together a water quality planned and let's figure out how we can best manage our surface water and hopefully we have positive effects on groundwater and\nHow can we do it and that's something where you know our staff is going to be working with the folks that want to kind of water and the health department and deep you W and sewer department\nTo be back quarterly in front of a select board to say this is where we are going and this is what we're working on and knowing that December twenty twenty when we have to have this plan done um\nIt's really close it's you know it seems like it's far away but it's really not for for looking at a major initiative where we're really talking about\nHow can we best deal with our controllable below so how we best dealing with our waste water source optics and sewers how we're dealing with storm water um you know we're kind of in the process of developing our first every storm water regulations so\nThe town have standards on itself but then also on you know subdivisions even more than the what the planning and zoning\nHas now in dealing you know providing some guidance to homeowners for how they can deal with their own you know their own gutters are there are some pumps or whatever they need to uh run their property to have that in place to continue our efforts on managing\nFertilizers and working with a a really engaged and passionate landscaping community who\nHave really bought into fertilizer management and really involved and you know kind of drive that process for the drone industry and the kind of make that better and then to encapsulate it into a a plan that really has measurable goals\nI Would think there are programs in existence now and maybe they're very effective maybe they could be more effective is that where you start this is starting with what you're doing now what's working and maybe what could be working better\nAnd it it's something that I Love the fact that the kind of the main goal is called environmental leadership because when we look at the steps we've taken where we have already probably the most aggressive fertilizer management program in the commonwealth where we already have Seward areas and we have\nAsked you or your plans for really all of our main surface water bodies is we're so far ahead of that you know so far ahead of the curve that'd really\nTo jump off from this point and kinda get I don't want to say carte blanche per se but\nTo jump off from this point and kinda get\nI don't want to say carte blanche per se but carte blanche to really take it and run with it is something that I think we're ready to do you know we've been kind of building just in our department when we first started and twenty eleven\nUm I was by myself for a little bit and then ... came over but since then you know we've added five employees\nIn the water quality specialist and we found a lot of one from groups like the land counsel in the harbor and shellfish advisory board to expand and bring people that are qualified people in the field to come in and really\nBe here all the time and not just rely on consultants and things to say we need this in real time all the time and that's the commitment that we've gotten to this point from the town and this\nTakes a step further to say we have you ready to do it now go do it and that's again it's an awesome opportunity\nAn awesome responsibility but I Know we have\nThe people in place and I'm hopefully a new water quality person knows what they're getting themselves into when they show up but I'm\nThe other staff and other departments are great to work with and I think we're we're ready to go to the next level and\nHopefully the you know the next time we talk about ... we're talking about populations that are starting to stabilize or even restoring hand you know expanding on some of the work doesn't lend counts just did to trans plenty of grass to jumpstart it again and really get more habitat for the shellfish hatchery to put out more shellfish that we're producing and really\nTurn the tide on you know in an environment that stable or degrading in some cases or going up slowly and maybe try to move it along even faster and\nGet to where we want to be in the end hopefully faster than we hope we can do it\nIt's been two weeks now since the special town meeting that we had in um a lot of things disgust transportation or a\nMarijuana was a big part of the evening long part of the yes it was a towards the end there and the second part um there was a I think a a quite a debate I'm\nOn single use plastics and I thought some some pretty good points made on both sides I think from a business standpoint there were some concerns\nStop and shop some of the hotels are people worrying about\nUm you know what voters you know the ideas of stop and shop downtown for instance a lot of the boats more and they'll buy four or five six cases of water so they have water on on the boat so that I hear all of that and then they some people that got up and talked on behalf of the landfill and I'm worrying about\nYou know and and worrying about the recycling that we're doing now and they made some great comments and arguments as well your thoughts\nAbsolutely and again I I think there's really dovetails nicely with the environmental leadership and I think really looking at our waste stream and looking at ... plastics in anything that goes to the landfill and find ways to reduce waste is always\nA really great idea to do I mean obviously we want to have is minimal footprint as possible on on our environment um\nI think there are probably some kinks to be worked out in it um you know at any citizen initiative that gets that kind of support and can go to town meeting is definitely you know in a part of an effort I'm no question I think they'll definitely like with anything any new by law that we've had there's always some growing pains and some implementation issues and things that are there\nThe good news is again like our water quality plan we have so twenty twenty to iron out the wrinkles and sometimes\nHaving an initiative like that or you know kind of staring a deadline like that in the face\nReally you know bites a fire under you know\nThe town and the citizens and people to kind of engage in a more active discussion to say\nWell what's really feasible and what's really feasible to do and I I think it's interesting that we had a vote last week and I know over in Europe\nThe the EU is talking now about single use plastic just as well so that yeah and it's something that is obviously a hot topic and it's something where hopefully manufacturers and distributors started listen up and say\nWe want to be part of the solution and provide options to take away those issues that we have so um I think it's a good start and needs some work and\nSome massaging but I I I think we'll get there and I think it will be a win win for everybody in the end\nI think in the long run it was a very positive debate because it's got everybody talking about it no matter what side they come down on everybody's talking about it and I think looking for a solution\nOh participation is always keep those for any any debate for for Tom policies in those things where um you need to be involved to get your voice heard and hopefully get the best results possible\nFrom a recycling standpoint are there better practices we can adopt right now on the island\nThat's a good question um I mean I Know there's the recycling on and talk it's definitely been a big part of our waste stream and how we deal with it you know obviously making choices to do things as simple as you know using reusable water bottles or um you know\nThis drop the stopped the truck campaign that the the town putting forward for awhile and fighting alternatives well well not perfect or adapting to those I think it really is\nAt the point where people understand what recycling is and understand that it's important but I think really from my end\nWe're really just like to see everyone commit to\nYou know given at the college try and try and some of these things that you know sound a little bit strange at first or a change from your normal pattern and giving it honest trying you know given that it's fair shake and see how it goes or if you have an idea that you think can can help with something that you personally don't like\nCome to meetings where we talk about it and suggest those things and you know participate and bring it to the table and I think that's a hopefully what this is all kind of kicked off and over the next year and a half as we refined those rules\nWe get that participation to get the best end result and get the best way street and that we can better manage our waste and I know it's I'm a huge issue for us and um I definitely think we'll get there\nAll the great thing about all these initiatives that means I can have you back on the show and weaken update all of this anytime in the very near future but a thank you that was that was fascinating and I appreciate the uh the update the or the island in the town or were very lucky to have such a talented team so thank you for all you do Oh thanks reminiscent of I'd love to be back\nAnd you've been listening to town
