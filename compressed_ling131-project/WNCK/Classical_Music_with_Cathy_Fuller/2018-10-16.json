tell us when you first started making art so I really can't remember a time when I wasn't making art in some form during my life\nI'm the urge to create things as solid me from a young age and art education was always provided for me by my generous and creative parents so I think by the time I got to high school I realized that art and art history we're always going to be defining elements to my personal an academic life and when I took a print making workshop at mass College of art back in my twenties I knew I had found my medium\nThat's great so interesting now Molly you have a long
