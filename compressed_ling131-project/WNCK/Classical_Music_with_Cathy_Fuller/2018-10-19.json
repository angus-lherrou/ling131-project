thank you for inviting me less excited to be here [noise] so now Molly can you tell us when you first started making art so I really\nCan't remember a time when I wasn't making art in some form during my life I'm the urge to create things as solid me from a young age and art education was always provided for me by my generous and creative parents\nSo I think by the time I got to high school I realize that art and art history we're always going to be defining elements to my personal an academic life and when I took a print making workshop at mass College of art back in my twenties I knew I had found my medium\nThat's great so interesting now Molly you have a long history on Nantucket your grandmother Gwen guy yard owns the opera house restaurant so you must have had some very interesting visits to the island can you tell us what about the island inspires you\nTook it is really um a place that's endlessly inspiring to me and one that holds the place in my memory it's filled with a really rich history goes stories famous visitors\nAnd of course spectacular imagery to work with um kind of around every corner so I'm at the island culture and its community and the ecosystems here also fascinating places to study um and we're up to slow down a bit when we're here which allows for maybe more careful observation of our surroundings\nA well put so now I'm only can you tell us about your work and your process\nSo typically I consider myself a polygraph print maker which means they use the collage image honest if not bored to make prints from and then make multiples of an image and then they layer other images on top of them for those who aren't familiar with the process they tell them it's like making a giant stamp on an after the prints are made\nI occasionally and now more often than not will paint on top of the prince tad dimension\nI'm In the majority of my work in recent years is centered around the way human memory processes imagery I create semi it's abstract shapes and forms a drop of memories of time spent near the ocean or\nOn the beach wow well I Can't wait to see or new work and congratulations on your solo show can you tell us a little about what we'll see in the show\nSo this show is I'm going to be a jumping off point a combination of some new collage work where I Am taking prints and papers and repurposed thing my material to form abstract a geographic points on Nantucket\nUm it's going to be a way that I'm sort of pushing my medium to make a change in my practice a because it's vital to to sort of keep that creative stamina

works at a pharmacy\nAnd sell their lives are in the ... and for me I go out in the world I experience racist that I Know what it feels like to be discriminate against I I think my parents haven't because really they have their lives or hear their communities here they go to the ... they go to their customers are meeting these are our ... our diverse\nNow I realize my experience as an American very different from my dad\nAnd these generational differences extend into politics older Vietnamese Americans have tended to vote Republican many of them fled communism and they see Republican presidents from Reagan on as being tougher on communist leaders some younger people like ten term trend has been leaning more democratic and that is one reason\nThe party believe they can unseat the Republican incumbent here\nSo when we went to visit the anthem train them we had heard there were some political differences in her family though I'm not ...\nThem we had heard there were some political differences in her family though I'm not sure she herself new quite how stark they were\nHigh high\nShe invited us into her parents' home her kids were playing around with eating snacks and they were orbiting around the grandfather [noise] how Tran is ... father he primarily speak Vietnamese and his everyday life including when he talks politics with his daughter [noise]\nHe's been backing Republicans since he first started voting in Nineteen Ninety two and he told me he was certainly no fan of president bronco bomber who he said just wasn't tough enough on the world stage\nWhom are like him very much\nAnd and then what now I guess we're today we have Trump what do you think of Trump so far sofa\nIn this country who do good uh what do you like what do you\nYou're unemployed rate the loan uh-huh and um stock markets in a row feet in Greece and so the economy is important to you yeah\nAnd that this is this is um\nI open it [laughter] [laughter] I didn't realize how he he thought of trying to see how they talked about that is the first time yeah I had a surprise because then I'll have a conversation about the other stuff that he does against the media\nAgainst like just civil society we grow up knowing how democratic Vietnam as the crackdowns on freedom of press on basic human rights women don't have the same right there and to see some of that happening now in America you know in some factions that government is scary because that was something that I never would imagine\nWe will be in a situation where we have a prize at basically calling to press the enemy that people like we hear that from communist Vietnam so we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that would be valid effect today\nCould you say that you're dead and yeah I'm just I just wonder why when Trump calls the media enemy of the people what your reaction to that\nMenu ally like I'll go call your doctor you know they're\nGoing to see them time to press talk about what the thing\nBut they don't care about it through a thing you did his city has CNN events drum riff off so both the same\nSo they're not there by us yeah Fox News clearly is by it and I don't know if that's\nNot the al ... I'm Trump boxes like trying to you know make a phone [laughter]\nYou think you think the media is too negative about Trump but it's not fair\nTo say that Russia interfered in through the election this country mhm\nBut when they know that why I said oh I shouldn't before the election [noise] the way until drum north elected and the Lakers issue\nSo if if they find out that Trump worked with the Russians where that would that bother you yeah you don't you don't believe that yeah\nThey do improve uh that I don't need to believe them\nYou know through the bet on either FBI then just don't know ... ... he believes\nThat the Mueller investigation should continue so that they have we have the facts I agree with that\nYeah to some degree on yeah\nThere are a lot of families who've been divided over\nTheir views of Trump what you hear like dinner conversations that yeah that go really badly in I mean people get it from the table yeah it I mean this is it doesn't seem to be happening in this\nNo because I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one person\nI clearly have strongly against you know what the president stands for\nBut I also believe it's important you know I mean I respect my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here say that we can have the freedom to have different views to have these kind of conversation said they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother and 'cause we have that freedom and that's why my parents let Vietnam to be here in the first place\nEverybody got devoted to vote yes you would fall toys and for future we thinking\nSo you think everybody should vote yeah\nAnd my father I didn't mention the any he ... after the war he was a political prisoner ... banging on the other\nTwo year three years he was held in a political concentration camp I Know they\nThey do a re education to get him yeah we're the communist try and stay there you know basically get him to change his thinking\nIt's powerful to hear you say that people should votes coming from mhm the history that you have\nYeah I just think we need a lot to protect our democracy\n... both we both drone right because the if we were wrong the next time we make it\nAnd how we have another hand we have a ...\nThat was ... and her father couch trend there to
