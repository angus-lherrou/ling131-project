check without counsel it's a chance again it's a search warrant process and unfortunately unless we have certain clear articulate facts are that\nWould be construed as a witch hunt so it's like you're going to stop and shop and [noise] you know we're we just want to see who was up to stop and shop at a certain time because somebody broke into a car it's a sexy\n\nThey did after next and thank you

a couple of additional conditions came up and I I only just got those in the last couple of days so\nOne of the next steps is and then some of the other conditions um there were recommended are listed here in the pack at\nThe ... the plan with town council is to\nPut together a supplemental comment letter from the board which will review with you probably at your October seventeenth meaning that will contain condition than any other findings at at that time do\nYou all know of anything that you want to try to work and we can get that reviewed and get it in in the draft letter for that meeting\n[noise] and I think that's\nYou have any questions questions\nLike who\n[noise] um oh yeah stomach\nThe finance team in town at men have prepared an overview of the fiscal twenty twenty general fund budget projections it's around this time of year when where we generally\nStart getting you to be thinking about the next upcoming years budget um the finance director is going to take us through I think he has a little bit of an introduction to make of the new staff number\nA thank you very much so before we get into one I'm sure everybody is waiting for a tonight\nWe were really happy and excited in the finance department to have have hired Alexandria ... who's here with us tonight I'm Alexander is taking over the finance and budget position which I'm Julia window recently vacated and\nShe comes to have some really great experience having worked in the secretary of energy to a office of the commonwealth doing budgets and for testing so we're really excited to have her here I'm jumping in it probably the most fun and busiest time of the year [noise]\n[noise] it's a great way to get acclimated very quickly\nSo as as uh the commenter mentioned we're here to kind of start to build the supplementary budget process\nAnd giving an overview where we think revenue may end up to start the year and a very pulmonary and as I always say please don't get married to any of the numbers in this in the streets because they will change very very many times over the next three or four months\n[noise]\nSo we typically always start with proposition two and a half which is the largest generator of a revenue for the general fund approximately eighty eight percent of all general fund revenue comes from real in her personal property taxes\nIn conjunction with ... every year we determine what the levee limited as to to begin the process to start I'm figuring out where revenue is going to be\n[noise] we're allowed under the statute to raise the amount raised in real and personal property taxes to point five percent\nWhich is why this is actually known as proposition two and a half [noise] through new growth and any overrides that we've added either permanent overrides or any temporary exclusions the debt exclusions as you may remember the this past year we did some capital exclusion which would be one time raises to the tax rate for capital\n[noise]\nSo [noise] starting with what we typically have to do is start with where we think a fiscal Nineteen the levee limit will be\nI'm On the left hand column I I Do have to tell you that physical nine teams actual love your limit to start calculating for fish for Tony is still not set because we're in the process of getting the values set by do you are in the new growth certified for fiscal Nineteen but we are projecting that the\nThe levee limit starting point for physical twenty will be Seventy four million four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nWhen we add two and a half percent as allowed by statute that's another one point eight million dollars\nWe are projecting about seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars in New growth or as most if you're aware we generally start a little bit on the lower side being conservative consistent with our forecast and as a year goes on and we we have been a we have made adjustments to that after discussions in discussions with the er the assessed her\nSo the allowable loving limit that we could raise is Seventy seven million thirty nine thousand dollars\nWhat we add to that then is ah any debt exclusions are projecting eight point seven million dollars in debt exclusions this year one of the reasons for the increase is the\nClean water trust borrowed a fourteen point nine million dollars on behalf of the town permanently for the Nantucket harbor shovel project and we now have a repayment scheduled starting I'm\nStarting in July that we will have to begin paying so we now have to account for that in in here as well so the maximum that we can raise in real and personal property taxes we're estimating for physical twenty to be eighty five million seven hundred and Ninety six thousand dollars\n[noise]\nNext you know slide on page five is essentially just showing what we've actually ...\n[noise] the next you know slide on page five is essentially just showing what we've actually received or taking in from two thousand fourteen to two thousand Eighteen to just give you a a brief glimpse of the growth from all over the last five years\nAnd all that this is a sheet everybody is always really excited to see is where we think expenditures are going to be [noise]\nPhysical twenty um we have taken into account in the general fund both town in school all impacts of all approved collective bargaining agreements um we've also added in the transfer to the community school to give us a project that salaries this includes no new positions on either side\nA forty five point one million dollars\nOperating expenses we have added um about just over two percent to both school in town projections on where it will be um we're still kind of going through that because we do back out any one time expense increased requests I Do believe they have most of them have been taken out but we do we're still continuing to review the\nHealth insurance we're budgeting about eight percent increase uh we're certainly hoping that trending is actually still favorable to us in may um be a little bit lower but that's kind of where our insurance consulting seeing that so medical insurance projected to be Thirteen point one million dollars on next year\nGeneral insurances I'm given some of the recent catastrophic events being floods in hurricanes ah her insurance consultants indicating that we probably will start to feel some of the effects of that through our property insurance is so they've suggested we increased by about ten percent\nWill continue to work through the years we always do to hold the line to the extent possible\nDebt service in here is um up as I did mention that there is um additional money for the SRS loans from the clean water transfer Nantucket ... ah we also have to begin paying back the part of the money that we had a more for the design of Arlen home I think it was in two thousand\nFor Thirteen or fourteen or Fifteen um because of the timing and where we're at we we actually have to start making pay downs on that and that's about another hundred and Seventy two thousand dollars within that there is also money for the a\nSolid waste for the landfill that was budgeted to come out of the general fund in there too that's why it's a nine point one here and not all of that was excluded which is where the primary differences between a slide one\nOther articles is down about three just under three hundred thousand dollars um we do have a slide and I'll take you through that the majority of that is um which is one of the influences the Affordable housing trust fund we have rejected the general fund subsidies we have held um\nThe or excuse me we've held our island home static and have made provisions for the increases within the others as well\nTo the solid waste at a press one we're projecting statutory expenses being cherry she offsets to remain at four four hundred and Ninety five thousand but that will be adjusted throughout the years we get more clarity on what\nThe budget for the the governor's budget is going to do so all told\nPulmonary expenses are Ninety nine million two hundred and forty two thousand with Ninety nine million nine hundred and eighty thousand dollars of revenue which leaves us access levy capacity starting today at seven hundred and thirty seven thousand\nTo fund all knew any new initiatives or um budgetary increase request\n[noise] as I mentioned the what the other articles is made up of is projection for any unpaid bills county assessment the human health and Human Services article\nReserve fund other post employment benefits and whether we not or whether or not we are going to add anything to Capitol stabilization and the minimum capital requirement as by the tax code which is one percent of prior year real and personal property tax collections as well as one percent of all local estimated receipts so that projects to be nine nine hundred and eleven thousand dollars\n\n[noise] just as we have typically done kind of just where the ... the ah\nArlene Holmes subsidy is as you can see in Eighteen and Nineteen it remained flat and we are projecting that same number for fiscal twenty other question\nOn I'm On the CPU payment you know I'm taught in the nursing home was closed and risk losing\nUm so our political leverage to maintain that may be a diminished especially given the um the condition of a community compared to Nantucket um are you confident that it's um\nYou know from a budgetary standpoint that we should maintain that and if we gotten any in in um and he read from the state about a continuation of that program\nUm well in some of the discussions that we've had 'em as we go through many of the internal discussions about Ireland home there has been indications that people are not entirely sure that it it's um\nThey don't feel that it's actually going to go away they they think it is something that will continue\nPartially because it's a very relatively small portion of the entire commonwealth budget so it's not something that's going to be highlighted very much we are running models in the event that it does go away one thing that we do based on our discussions with deal or is that we never budget for that in the operating budget whatsoever so it's not\nAt that meeting and then that's the point where we will I think had an idea of exactly what kind of funny will be looking for this year and we were ... they gather and exactly and and we were trying to keep in mind that timeline for\nUm town meeting this [noise]\n[noise]\nThank you bye Eli\nOkay then monthly tell management activity report I as you know I've been trying to revive a route sorted re format is a little bit so that is a bit more interactive that the board has questions or a bit of discussion about any of the item\nI Will try not to spend a lot of time on each one of these individually but ... crossing deserves some time here because that has taken quite a bit of staff time to work on with\nThe independent reviews the letter of concern that we sent to the division of fish and wildlife last week we're going to be working on the supplemental comment letter to the Z BA and then attendance at the hearing tomorrow\nIn concurrently and with that the October tenth special town meetings have than being worked on with the preparation of warrants motions all the

really good feedback about that\nAs you all know the Novak group was engaged recently to help us develop our strategic planning framework\nUm that connects our goals that were developed\nOver the last several months and in development bank developing this prioritized um work plan that operation allies as our goals I don't know if that's quite a word\nUm and I've talked with the consulting about she she is ready I think to meet with the board to to go over that framework and I was putting out a couple of dates um last week for you all we talked about it at the agenda meeting today and um send out some ... some additional dates tomorrow hopefully\n[noise] ah just a couple of comments I was going to bring it up under my comments but uh\nYou know I was very impressed with I was impressed with this group I'm certainly when they talked about the\nUm wages and salaries review um position control review but also um their experience with strategic planning\nFor towns and cities across the country is very I'm very in depth they've actually helped one municipality um achieved the bald richer ward which is the highest recognition of quality improvement in any industry\nI'm so I'd encourage us to obviously like to hear what other board members think but I think given the\nYou know some changes in our own stuff into support dysfunction um we do this you know talk about ... miles but I think\nThis is a resource that we spent a lot of time on a developing our strategic plan I think we need to have the resources to support it and I was very impressed with this group by hope we\nEngage them to have a more ah I'm I'm you know Boulder um participation with us going forward\n[noise]\nThank you very much um island home I think ... to report it out on this a little bit last

probably within the next couple of months on\nThe open meeting law\nFor just a comment I noticed is managers prerogative but I'm just gonna say by a couple of Sirte to such um I think there's some value in having a resource\nThat is because we all we know that we we all have a reluctance to add\nNew projects onto our busy a management team I'm In whatever area\nUm I think there's some benefit

we need to develop this costs monitoring protocol and according to state requirements so what we learn from town council is that towns are going to need to track what their various costs are\nAs they relate to managing monitoring is minutes during what's needed to address marijuana dispensary isn't there may be extra police calls or extra fire calls or\nAdditional abdomen time and you have to keep track of all of that and related back to what you are ultimately charging in the host community agreement\nWe also need to work out entirely how to license is you're going to be monitored if there's
