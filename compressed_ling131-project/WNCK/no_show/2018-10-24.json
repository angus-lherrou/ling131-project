was just in the meeting with ... um I can add to that later inflections or reports great\nYou know the public comments on on the agenda she none move on to a new business for ... [noise]\nA frugal\nA payroll Warren's treasury works as a written on the agenda move for approval or both\nOr second second all those in favor I huh pretty contracts any questions or comments livid you up so\nWanted to point out that the last one there is a ...\n...\nI just wanted to point out that the last one there is a design contract we've talked about this before it's for\nA more robust designed for ah the town pair for its restoration renovation and sort of like hardening of it um and the idea here is to just to remind do ... comes up every now and then is that the the floating docks\nAre going to be removed shortly there'll be repaired over the winter re installed in the spring concurrently\nThis design will lead us to bid specs we intend to put the project anticipate putting the project out to be before the twenty Nineteen annual town meeting so that we will have a big number to go to town meeting with for the full renovation and then that work would hopefully if all goes well start in about about a year from\nThat that was pushed through by prior board members I think it's been invaluable to us as a board and then the ... in of itself and I'm also I'm I really feels like we're starting to make progressing action item so I'm I'm really happy if moving forward\nHouse I thought thought the aspirational seen her really valuable\nIn terms of putting it in perspective [noise]\nThat that was important to me that's the why here's our goals but here's why we're doing it was a nice\nOne thing that came up and are meeting and I thought it was also I'm a good reminder the role of our board to be the forty thousand feet above and then building trust with our um the rest of town admitted our department hasn't actually implementing this and I think that again this process will be indelible for that and\nSo is there a consensus that we liked the kind of structure of that the document\nI think there is some maybe maybe it's appropriate to relieve a formal affirmation of it um and so I Would make the motion and the ugly formerly of ferment adopt 'em the strategic plan with the attendant or work\nPlans I'm In a committed our support 'em as leaders ah of the select four to six to success second could ... I\nUse like a gym\nCongratulations to you all McCain's I Do\nAnd will be available\nYeah this'll this'll be on the website you'll be able to pick up this document ... edits couple titles were fixing a in a new visitor services will have a lot of town hall it'll be on line as well to grow no ... no ... no strategic\nPlan after [noise] I'd commit [noise]\nThey remove onto continued review and potential adoption of revised sewer few waiver policy decision regarding safest path one to request for sure privilege the waivers discontinue from September Ninety in October seventies I'm\nGoing to I was happy with a sign which I think it reflected everything we talked about last week\nI'm I'm ready to move ahead with that I think maybe there were some tweets on the numbers that Tucker might want to talk about it\n[noise] I Can't hear me just go close with nothing hello I put it in my mouth [laughter] or project either way [laughter]\nYou want to say that again oh\nI'm I was happy with the language I think it was reflective of what we discussed last week um but I thought Tucker may want to clarify if you have the numbers\nWith with the addict sure thank you um ... housing specialist yes ah we took the direction I'm from the discussion at the last board meeting town council had a chance to review this\nAnd um I think the main elements that came out of the last meeting were eight here potentially tiered structure um choose the one\nHundred and one fifty level unit ... um [noise] where\nAt the one hundred level a Seventy five percent\nA waiver would apply and at one fifth the a fifty percent waiver would apply\nThere is a provision that in the case of a development where all units have any income restriction the board does have the option to wave a a hundred percent of the feed 'em and show those\nPrinciples were incorporated into the revised numbers that you all have um I guess I Would point out\nThat [noise] the\nThe impact that is included I should\nMention that there was some discussion at the very end up out\n\nWith respect to projects where significant public subsidy has gone in and that that may be a factor that the board considers whether or not to wave a hundred percent\nIn ... whether or not to wave a hundred percent in projects that do have all units income restricted if this is everyone's following me [laughter]\nSo in the numbers that you've received though the ah\nThe only project\nWhere\nThere is one hundred percent of the units\nThat have income restrictions as say gyms path so in the numbers that you received those are shown in the main part of the table right there at\nThe Seventy five percent waiver for the one hundred and fifty percent waiver for the one fifties of course it's a hundred percent for the eighties\nIf you were to elect to waive all up to be related to say ... that would have an additional impact of eighty seven thousand dollars just for your knowledge\nSo in effect the difference of the overall policy from the last one you looked at to this revised version\nAnd the changes are um [noise] it is\nReducing the amount of overall waivers by just under five hundred thousand dollars across the two types of waivers show you produce it with this policy you would have reduced the financial impact by about half a million from what previous day was under consideration\nIf he were elected to waive everything for say chimps you'd be adding eighty seven back in\n... I thought there was a direction we're going in to waive it all for her so she was so we want to add back beauty three\nWhat's that is that what I think that's a that's a point of discussion I might okay because they received such but they received a lot of subsidy in in future cases like this this case potentially or future cases we want to be able to weigh that that was my I I like what is written I think it's it's good\nI felt like it left leeway across the board for any development to just consider of various\nFinancial factors\nWe have to do those ... or a cat but it doesn't this doesn't give a hundred percent and I'm trying to understand what Tucker saying so this but we've been given a does does not use his influence the tear the tearing for surgeons path and not a hundred percent\nYes the the policy is written to give you the ability to wave a hundred percent as was disgusted the last meeting in the numbers\nAt the last meeting it was discussed that how much subject he has gone into something may be a factor\nSo we could have done it we could have included say terms that a hundred percent and noted that difference if you didn't decide to waive it or we included it at your tiered level and said if you decided to wave at all the additional impact would be eighty seven\nSo that's a discussion point for us for to dismantle\nWe need to discuss the policy first and then move on to what we want to do that selection that but I felt that also left us the leeway sort of on the other side as if they're going to be significant financial gain by market rate sales\nWe wouldn't necessarily have to have everything\nIn that you can consider the market right now\nIn a project where there are market rate unit she would not have the ability to wave a hundred percent on those other\nKnow Wade has the ... some discretion in how you grant waivers if the subsidy is being made up for by marketing right south\nKorea and yet correct\nSo to the policy I think a ... we ... we discussed last time and I'm like a a motion that where your proved to rip visions to the\nTo the policy second any discussion for take a vote\nThat's already voted Richard ... the ... I thought I\nShould passes news with um I don't know if I say to them\nHey I'd like to make us until ... grant a waiver on let's say to him for a hundred percent as set forth as an option in the power thing hundred percent of not on the air for a second\nAny discussion\n[noise]\nAlthough if ever I was both of us that passes for the one you're talking\nAnd and I'll just uh the reason I'm opposed as I think that this development it's it's tough when a lot of people come here and they want something to say no but I I think we've you know I think we made a good step but I think it was you know we could have you have to think of the other the next generation the next people\nAnd so it's eighty nine thousand we don't have ... for the next one but it's not upset without went but I think we have to be thing it's not just the people that are in front of you were representing everybody\nBest and crossing locations bicycle combinations is quite a few bicycle combinations out there um at each of these locations already today they were going to incorporate into our designs and um\nIt's actually reconstruct looking to to you know change the the the\nOverall design of these some of the share of your staff but work them into the design of the the intersections separate the traffic from the other users are the roadway the lakes in the classrooms um take away the conflict points which exists in these intersections today\nAnd then a great opportunity to improve the aesthetics of all three the three of these locations um by going with a roundabout option\nSort of quickly touch base in this I'm going to talk through the plans rather than the table but this is the alternative matrix that we put together with with Mike\nI'm this is the one for four corners it lays out the alternatives on each row in the criteria resource corruption advantages advantages and then the criteria um specific to the four corners um\nThe tree the cabinet and stuff that's out there and the impacts of the hospital properties and then we have a matrix for all three locations but I'll just start going through four corners first since there is the most to touch on there\nSo this is the mini round about it is a Seventy foot diameter circle roughly centered between sparks and south prospects um the\nRoundabout fits in fairly well with the existing properties at some real occasions necessary the um\nDisadvantages of this one are that you don't get a complete level of bathroom protection as little hard to see in this graphic but the split her islands that dislike the traffic approaching the intersection\nOf art that large because of the design sides of the circle being smaller and so you don't get a refugee area and the middle of the road for pedestrians to kind of have a safe zone and make a a Tuesdays crossing\nSo that's the case for the search site approach and the sparks approach and there's a little bit of a\nMedian islands I'm added in at the Atlantic in South prospect which does provide some protection but overall overlook into protects people throughout the whole intersection um another disadvantage of this option is that the size of it makes 'em the truck moving through the circle\nFairly slow speed or the ... to mount the um the center islands to get through and in doing that that will affect the capacity of the intersection itself you'll start to see some some backup from vehicles that needs to wait for that Chuck moves in to get through\nThese are some of the alternatives that a V. H. B. worked on in a within the past year um called this a sub alternative 'cause we eventually arrived at a more favorable alternative I just want to show 'em the board or the various options would look that we call us from the peanut because it looks like Tina\nI'm it has to many circles\nCentered around Atlanta gets a prospect in sparks at ...\nAnd it\nProtects the elm tree which is which is good\nIt doesn't quite get the full pedestrian protection and I'm similar to how many roundabout doesn't have those refugee areas\nYou don't have them here on science prospect in here on Atlantic and you have a smaller than than ideal refuge there at the parks and the ... movements are also just looking at it and obvious concerned going through here are going to have um\nSome potential for you know major crossover of trucks I'm operating against cars going through the intersection second settled turn of is the avocado um which basically has all the same um\nImpacts as the peanut just another shape they looked at and plenty in to see if we can find the best fit within this intersection\nThe boulevard is one of our um more recent alternatives and this one takes the center of the circle and puts it you know fifty feet or so down sparks out from the the main intersection itself a protects the tree and it creates this nice little green space um\nCreating the boulevard of sorts on on our side\nIt does get you plenty of judging refuge I'm a little bit less so here the downsides of this are that it appears it would require some relocation of the utility cabinets will have to look at it about here on the corner of the intersection which are trying to avoid and there's a\nProblematic um\nApproach from Atlantic into self prospect toward that Atlantic maneuver isn't able to get into the circle on its own legs yes the if the merging with the traffic on south prospects read\nThat let us away from that alternative\nUm this is our take on one of the um\nMore kind of extensive auctions or looked at why do you know the circle quite a bit to create a more kind of town common ask a round about with this is probably a two hundred foot diameter circle at the gas um\nThe main impact here is that the school property is pretty significantly impacted with the park and they have there and we shied away from that option because of those those impacts um\nThere's also some let's see protesting crossings are difficult you don't have a lot of wall defined spaces for people to cross it'd be a lot of standardized cross locks that exist today there's no real improvement um from that and for the classrooms\nAnd then four weeks off from troll this alternative involves ... have to um\nCenter the intersection more in line with the prospect street to create a bit more of a standard orientation to what's out there today\nThe um [noise] obvious downside of this was that you have no congestion or reduction benefits at the roundabout what provide everyone's operate as it were today\nUm the reliant on the intersection is nice but it also it doesn't get the main goal of reducing the traffic that we're looking to to hit on\nA for a pedestrian safety perspective you introduce a slipped right turn lane here which is one more crossing the street and seemed to deal with this really do their negative or no impact as far as a pastor and see if he goes\nI'm In our opinion\nWe arrive at our preferred alternative in in that matrix I'm this is a one hundred foot diameter round about\nSo it's larger than the mini option that we first looked at the hundred foot the kind of described outer diamond her\nAnd this is again center between sparks in South prospect street there's some impacts to the hospital properties\nOf the few of the ... of the intersection um\nWe are providing some good\nAnd um\nWe are providing some good last year in refuge\nWhere we utilized in some existing crossings locations\nAnd we're providing some additional sidewalk connections over some festering desire lines but a lot of space in this area a lot of opportunity to reclaim some of the roadway here and provide landscaping even outside of the the center circle so\nThis is that option in um the simulation that we put together you can see the elm tree\nWhere maintaining that eastern edge of 'em are side to rock protection found out for that on tree and not have any impact on that\nAre all three of these locations we're looking to install some split rail fence to separate the ... and the bikers from the right way traffic um an additional benefit of that is that you kind of you're able to channel asked people to get them to cross at the intended\nPoints um so it's a nice little benefits a look scientists function as well\nAnd then another perspective on four corners looking\nA tour itself prospects says sparks on the bottom of the street I'm ... utility cabinet is located in that Trump's and there should be able to safely to routines and then they got on the sidewalks that I mentioned\nJumping down to surf that have Bartlett\nSo here we looked at the um\nCondition to the roundabout option and looked at the traditional through a stop and the the the nothing alternative\nUm the three way stop doesn't accomplish the goal of reducing congestion um it's probably no impact on the pasture and safety um because as they exist today um you know ... or the vehicles are required to yield to restrooms and put a stop light and doesn't change that fact\nUm and do nothing doesn't hit on any of the goals\nSo there's just a quick just cookie touching on this is our concept plan of the preferred alternative for the roundabout\nIt centers around about on the southwest quadrant of the of the intersection so the Bartlett comes in and write about here since our side they'll just flashed right through that to get to the good stuff the\nUm 'cause you'll civilization shows sort of side running last the rate are coming in", "year":
