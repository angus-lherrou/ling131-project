took it for all sides of the roadway improvements associated with Richmond housing development off old down the road [noise]\nThere was quite a bit packets Italy's Richmond is here represented much when I Am not sure if you'd like to say anything you\nKnow any questions thoughts and the boy\nIn her mid ...\nJust to um what about you know what we're doing here just a tad there isn't a lot of information in the back but back in September [noise] then you all I think as a select board took up the issue of\nImprovements to public ways that it has been required by to play anymore as part of the permitting process for the Richmond development and\nYou can't the way it's actually a county way the recommendation was that I think you all in the endorsed the idea of all of the improvements to be made to public rather since you're the board in charge of roads and then county as well\nAnd that town counts as a device\nThat was to be followed by development and execution of a memorandum of agreement with Richmond\nRelating to the improvements who's going to do what that sort of thing so that is what is it for you to be approved tonight\nWhen\nDo I have a couple of questions I guess there's a section one six no additional costs fees are expenses does that refer adjust to this agreement or does that refer to anything\n[noise]\nSinus stuffy Andrew ... general counsel for the rich

and forth was there what staff was involved with this big center puts a bus or Libya that\nUh there was quite a bit of back and forth between town council and Richmond's council palm I was involved planning staff was involved to the extent that\nWe reviewed the means I don't know that a lot of staff was involved in this specific warning of this legal document but there were other staff involved in the review the improvements well db ... director was involved is to her after wasn't ball diets maybe that was a different\nI'm the I'm housing specialist I think\nWas involved a little bit with regard to some of the other\nOf the planning for special permits in the prior MIU that that that this port signed off on so I guess that they were comfortable with okay\nAnd those were all in the other the other we've asked this question the last time we met it was in our minutes those are all complied with I'm from both sides weaved and everything was was due lived on everything there\nAre some outstanding regulatory requirements from the November agreement but they they simply haven't progress not because people didn't do things they were supposed to do that because that's just where they are in the process I I guess I Would say\nAn accurate statement there are certain matters at somebody to comply with these are simply just aren't right for action at this point now learning center regulatory very much for the Affordable housing and related matters I Need to go to forty a CD for counting on trial is\nYeah I Would say um man we do have um a chart that I knew was finalized within the last couple of days which some would which we will get out to you all that that summarizes the requirements from at November gaming and and where they all stand\nAnd my my favorite question where we understand what the cost of the town and the cost of you know what we've given and what we've done before we have to do the negotiations for the other roads et cetera\nYes she will have that in your pocket when you have that on your executive session agenda\nThan I can accept thank you\nSame motion I made a mess or any of us are going to follow them to either side by\nThat just doesn't have clarification because I think there are some that I felt like I said and\nThat just to clarify Keisha because of the mass consumption and that can can you hear me just to point of clarification I feel like there's been a misinformation out there today everything that you've\nDealt has nothing to do with the development that includes the Affordable housing everything's in downtown commercial Crawford and\nWhat's what's your mind and they tried to tried for the clarify you mean the vertical construction you can see from the roadway sits on related to the housing but the subdivision roadway the fact is currently ongoing if you count that construction or building\nThat's ongoing at the time but no units are presently up and occupy was released to the Affordable housing in the workforce house country [noise]\n\nAnd moving on are there any commissioners report that comment and a is that notion to address some of it's not all of them favor I scratch\n[noise]\nThat you read a\nArticle musical called order the October Seventeen thousand Eighteen slug board meeting to order there's no changes to the gym as far as I Know and we will well she's talking is very public comment here\nToday it's not on the agenda\nRight see none there's no new business we'll get to announce are sort of a second I'm motion to approve the minutes and pay rewards and treasury wants a social statement agenda and the second oldest if ever I don't have any questions on the city contracts or [noise]\nOr child manager you\nOr town manager or any any thoughts none to me now okay listen to this second ... I Know it [noise]\nYeah my only the only comment a\nIs when you read the airport stuff\nFor Twenty one thousand for twenty six thousand we are basically saying that we have no control that property forever unless we go back to the ... whenever we sort of say let's do this at the airport let's do ball fields let's do whatever we always they always say well that's really hard\nAnd it's because of the airport and we all just we all read the documents it's because of the airport ah has to get permission from aeronautics and that is we sign that\nI think I'd want to make that point he was just take we asked him to take the ... extrapolate it just doesn't come in as a recommendation from ministry should okay [noise]\nUm can you just go again what does any of my head what would be a be a hundred and a hundred and twenty a hundred and fifty percent\n[noise] in in round numbers the uh area median income for Nantucket a family of four is\nNinety nine thousand five hundred or a hundred thousand and so you can in rough numbers one twenty a hundred and twenty thousand a year would be one twenty eighty percent is actually it's not a straight line calculation it's more like\nSeventy seven thousand five hundred\nOkay so in order of magnitude to eighty thousand a hundred thousand a hundred and twenty thousand and a hundred and fifty thousand desk arrests okay\n\nI read it yet and I just had a question of that I'm In a forty in the ... on the ... privilege is always a burden of the homeowner or whatever are absorbed by the developing\nThink it was\nUnusual that the developer in the case of like the friendly for he beat and sanctions path is would request\nThat connection be waiver and not the privilege waiver I I mean I\nI think that's unusual but maybe not unheard of\nAnd I'm a project like beach upon the the owners of the Affordable units one day they were responsible for this privilege these\nNo mine are standing with beach problem is that was all incorporated into the pricing to the to the to the buyer\nFor the men are weighing in in in ... a a um a contribution to improve\nThe sudden there was no there was nothing that the homeowner paid ...\nPost closing on their home\nSo if we did something like this then daily or lose the opportunity to use that isn't as negotiation essentially for something else from the developing as we said we would wave these then that scenario wouldn't happen that credit for a\nWhile my John ... to it but it isn't that you it's automatic and every case the your policy gives you the authority to do it but\nRight now our policy says that the shy Ellen ... right now our policy says that the ... billion at least with the fact that well you're a class that that's already our policy that said that wouldn't be a change to that ...\nOnly be in addition at our discussion is that we had this or threatened if they rest strapped\nPermanently things that like a hundred hundred and twenty a hundred and fifty [noise]\nBut that's it's out there selling some discussion okay so what are those\nThat sort of all the other so the ... the ones they're not permanently restricted\nIf they're not permanently Restrepo that I don't think we should be wasting any\nBut I'm just asking you or are they permanent restricted yeah now every everything of sanctions or even as a hundred and twenty as permanent restrict don't confuse I thought you said that if it's permanently restricted and it's on the shortlist we would automatically based on our current policy way of those fees and saying things\nEating when not on the left is already on her goals but permanently struck that\nNo one was so right I guess what I was understood I thought you said the one twenty and then one fifty would be within our policy now currently it's just a ... okay\nPoint on beach plum is that the uh we got the the numbers I think it was ... million to or something from David that was spent upgrading the town's ... ... the town sewer down to the corner here all the way from beach plum that far exceeded what would have\nBeen a collected in privilege trees so so in that case the town benefited much further than the privileged fees and the connection fees would've provided\nSo in fact that was paid the one thing I'll say about ... or is that they were some subsidized by the town and a very very high rate they we were subsidized free land and the amount of money the town put into that project is probably higher\nThe ice free land in the amount of money the town put into that project is probably higher than the average uh costs when they when people look at these projects it was at a very high rate so you know I've got a buddy or does it and he says hey per unit it's acts and I'm like well we subsidize freelance plus more than ...\nYou know in some of that's in Antakya factor and some of it's just the way the project was a handled performed however you want to say so I think there is a difference or the other point I think is if we continue to do you know the more we do this the wave of this the more this becomes a de facto policy\nSo that so I'm happy what these numbers but I you know one of the things we should be thinking about about policy wise and big picture is what is this going to do to the future and in every you know every million dollars we don't collect here is a million dollars\nThat you know there could be going to other housing so if we if we don't collect a million dollars a year a million dollars probably takes care of\nFifteen million dollars' worth the building if you're ... and get you know a million dollars a year advertising pay Fifteen million dollars worth of something else so you have to be thinking about it in sort of business terms in and how you know what the impact is so\nIt makes it makes me think of maybe this is Brian are living can answer this is so if we were to go for this and we weighed eight hundred\nThousand dollars over the next five ten years and all with all these projects come\nTo fruition where does that money come from a ... and taken out of the good of debt as a user fees though with the sewers let me see if we need to understand that yeah right\nAnd I talk about that before the meeting and he can answer\nTo the bar on longer you\nKnow the boiling has already done I'm so essentially when this was voted for the the sewage treatment plant it was thirty four percent of the tax base sixty six into the sewer enterprise fund which was split thirty three percent to the ... the rate\nAnd then the other percentage was split into the betterment um [noise]\nThere's a specific number of anticipated connections that was used to calculate that number of about Fifteen million dollars if you wave days we have no opportunity to get them back so the sewer rate will just have to us we'll assume whatever additional money is not able to be collected in the betterment so um\nIt would just eventually at some point as we look at the rate when we start if we do continue to waive fees I'm with the rate would have to assume that that that dollar value which is already doing in a way right now because we haven't hit all\nThe betterment or the sewer privileged nice to be issued so the rate is already covering it because of the way this was structured\nAnd eventually it'll catch it it will catch up with itself\nBut um waiving fees will just mean that the rate would assume the super user rate would assume that that difference and it goes up incrementally as the projects come along or um it goes well these were just not be building and then we would just eventually we'll get to the point where\nWe build everything under privileged fees except for what was waved and that's the amount that's automatically will have been paid by the rate payers all the way through the life of the debt and then and then build expire\nAnd I have a financial question we I think was I think Don you said it was was it thirty three dollars a month\nWas going to be the cost or something what we did that did anyone look at what they are the analysis of what the residents here in stations and pay if\nWe don't know if we don't waiver their fees and if we don't wave Richmond's and everybody else so they are we gonna you know we got a wave these fees and they're going to be happy and then we're going to turn around and increased the sewer fee over the next Fifteen or Twenty years it costs them even more\nWell has anyone done that analysis\nWe haven't looked at it from that perspective but I can tell you I mean we're doing a very comprehensive sewer rate analysis and the\nThe likelihood that the rate is going to start to increase at some point I I'm not going to give you a date certain at this point is pretty high given the fact that we have some substantial amount of infrastructure improvements that are being funded through the sewer rates so\nUm I Do and vision that increasing I Can't give you a time when things I don't even envision it in the next year but it or not you know we're still working through that\nJim I'm\nWhen folks from ... came I think we give ourselves a deadline to make some kind of ... and get back to them and the next couple of months I think\nUm it was either that evening or later another meeting we heard from this is a question for me we heard from our a sewer consultant engineer from the show\nUm project to hide I Believe was discussing the concept of a bunch of ... these two fees and coming up with another fee um and I remember the term the name of it and we're we're that\nWhat impact from the prospect of Libya should have on a ... an honest discussion now to make a change to our current policy as\nIt was more um bundling capacity utilization fee and the sewer privilege the into a new thing called the sewer capacity she and it would be approximately the same number as the current privilege the with\nAn additional amount depending on the number bedrooms\nBut\nSo that um I don't think we'll have much of an impact it at all because it's roughly the same ... bundle number and where we are with it by the way I'm Glad you mentioned as we actually had a meeting today with the can talk about that and they are working with town council to develop the language that will need to\nIs how I Would look at it and Jim wants a little more\nStructured Sylvia so I'll make a motion that we adopted U.S policy with the with the amendment that we give a hundred percent to\nUm [noise] um\nYou know how to proceed to a hundred percent shy list and then we hear the um\nSo I'm\nSean ... people and as outlined here I'm at the at the levels that a\nA dog I mentioned are not necessarily shy eligible just right right right right I\nCan say those teams again yes down the wealth was\nSent eighty a hundred and a hundred and fifty I had a hundred percent for eighty\nSeventy five percent for a hundred\nFifty percent for one day\nThe entire development and permanently\nRestaurant that so that's my motion\nSecond for discussion\nYeah and just to clarify that if it's a hundred percent a permanent restriction then it's a hundred percent land as far as their second for discussion and say that let's say a second okay I'll make sure we haven't got sorry no there so I think that\nI had to have a couple of questions [laughter] I'm sure you do one is how how were you proposing the one twenties and that\nI was going to save his clarify because as the ... the different\nYou would have to say that they train Haiti and a hundred and Seventy five in between a hundred a hundred and fifty and that ... right\nOr you just do the math for easiest straight line you do the math yeah\nOf course you know can we say up to do we need to say up to and so we can keep the discretionary\nI guess somebody town council so I just my motion I was trying to\nHave it be defined so that's why the three levels we can change it but that's what the motion says\nRight and I was just [noise] do\nYou want it to be a percentage in between or a flat it anywhere in between that number is that\nOn outcome uncomfortable to fifty for anything above a hundred\n... ... you know just clarify this bill it would be anything up ... percent it'd be a hundred percent waved anything between\nAny one person and a hundred\nWould be Seventy five percent wave anything between like a hundred and one in a hundred and fifty fifty percent yes\nUnless it was in less than ... was one hundred percent permanently restricted and then they would all the waves and a hundred percent\nYes and this is for both\nFees which may merge into one of the ones that cannot ignore the connection right and that's not going to be on capacity nothing can happen in our nation generally right\nSo if we vote this through just\nThe policies changed boom we're done or do we\nWant this is a draft and look at in ... in have Tucker look at the numbers\nWere ratify it I'm comfortable with voted on motion minute John\n... and you put it on gender\nOr\nWe don't have the on the agenda now to amend the policy I thought we did\nWe do on its own the waiver policy it's on it's in ... so where are the first they were also\nBringing down on a future I tend to silence their\n... you could do that tonight too I I have trouble sometimes sort of\nWith us doing this kind of work here with you know ... off the top of our heads I I think that that's not necessarily good government and not and the interest of the [noise] you know of\nThe people elect us sometimes because we're in I think it should I think it should be analyzed in them and try to poke holes in it staff to try to poke holes in it we should poke holes in it try to figure out what the unintended consequences are and then come back with and then get a recommendation and then make a vote on it I get worried\nYou know we got ourselves in trouble around got myself a blame me I've got myself in trouble sometimes when I was approved something big we understood it and I didn't so anyway that been poking holes that had the whole night I understand that this was a policy that was drafted by now it's on ... and I'm not I'm not sure what else we need to do that\nI Would I Would tend to think that's not where I agree with these changes in principle but I feel a little bit uncomfortable taking a stab at some of the numbers I feel like talk or what have\nA better idea of exactly how those would line up and that ultimately I Want a policy that is clear and consistent and I'm not exactly sure that's what we're doing um and I think that it could be worded well the sliding scale or that the um the tears could be possibly done in a way that is more clear\nI mean if it helps like you you know it'll take less than five minutes to read can figure the numbers but\nWith what you've talked about two hundred thousand of that eight hundred thousand dollar impact is related to say Thames which still wouldn't qualify under the new proposed policy\nSo you talked about marginally bringing down the rest which is roughly six hundred so you're in ... it's an order of magnitude you're talking about fiscal impact of three to four hundred thousand dollars roughly but I can get you the exact figures based on the assumptions and you\n\nCan I just clarify to that at the application of those terrorists is still at our discussion it it wouldn't be an actor that would just be when we have\nA correction not written that [noise]\n\nSo um I I I Would encourage the board to develop a policy that you intend to apply\nOr if you want to introduce some element of discretion I think you need to think about what the criteria would be for I'm applying it different um\nAmount depending upon the project I just think that's where you get into an issue with potentially arbitrary and capricious so I Would encourage you to spend the time come up with the policy\nWith the intent that that's what you how you're going to apply it you could always change the policy again in the future if something comes up\nThat we didn't anticipate just the way this happened was sage stations path\nSo that would be my recommendation\nSo do you recommend that we take out the ... the first line edits discretion\n[noise] yes [noise] yes [noise] well um\nIf you withdraw your second hour drama emotion because it seems\n[noise] well um\nIf you withdraw your second with her on my motion because it seems like there we've just with ... comment we've added some other changes we might want to make to the policy that I I certainly would like to look at one more time\nTo just make a motion to put this on the agenda\nYou know drafted that second the\nRecession with what is that enough time living just to read quickly to redo the numbers we write this book like book the holes in it ...\nYeah I I mean I I don't I don't know how much more holes were gonna poking at that never nerdy 'cause tonight\nBut we can at least for a ride that happened in front of you know\nSo in addition to the changes in the fees were going to delete edits discretion\nYes I ah [noise]\nThe adage discretion on isn't the existing policy and I think it's fine to keep keep that in but I Would I Would just take it out and I know but I didn't I didn't realize it was um\nIt's already in the policy now um\nI Would just encourage you to [noise] um\nApply the policy consistently now that at at its discretion language would be to address an extraordinary situation that was completely unanticipated which hopefully is not going to come up um I I Would I Would keep that language and then put in the tiered approach\nWith the intent that that's what you how you're going to apply the policy in the future\n[noise] and I and I liked the tiered approach I think that's great I think the discretion uh I I think part I think the criteria on the discretion should be a partly based or almost all based on how much we've sometimes said eyes that actual you know that ... that actual hundred percent\nIn a neighborhood if we subsidize it at a very high level we should be more careful if we have an apt to subsidize it we should we have everything but I think there should be some discretion there because you know there's a big difference if we give the land or we don't or you know there's some factors in there\nAnd so I just think if we want to be fair we have to actually look at everything it'd be fair\nYou want to make this policy written to where it stops the Serbian arbitrary or does it allows the arbitrary\nBut I don't want us to be arbitrary but I also want us to take into consideration how much the town has subsidized like that like one of the criteria of whether we wave it completely should be how much we've spent their how much all of us collectively all the tax payers and so we're users and everyone else has subsidize that actual project you know so", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Nantucket", "day": "17"}
