would be possible\nVigils are being held across the country for the victims of the mass shooting in Pittsburgh how much is a national climate of hate and division responsible for this attack words matter and rhetoric and kind of the climate of bigoted rhetoric matters that's tomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise]\nMm\nPresident Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and said the hatred stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership or here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country and she's she's basically arguing that\nThe president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents\nAre and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console learning cheap or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is a when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any of these laws I abhor does she does and I have none\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum call you must be without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that\nIs that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nIt's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nIt will you really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of courses that maybe some lukewarm ... supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White

border security is national security and the U.S military will ban CBGB's capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise so that something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\n[noise] it just goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duties which has transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing and the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities and these additional\nFive thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role of the new law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first fill a ... do do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas\n... a barrier is more razor wire fencing you're crossing points and they'll also transport border agents used more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter dissolves through a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all week old there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting\nAs law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nIt well ... that's with officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any

troops being used and former Confederate States in that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not are going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would it be carrying arms or of any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay [laughter] the precedent\nThe others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay what's the precedent for this job for sending five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border uh I don't recall the\nPresident for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past it again in a support role\nIn this case so you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who doing everything you'd get from constructing camps flying border patrol agents so yet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public affairs staff and a a good general are shown as he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the same

evidence low inflation and extremely low unemployment but the fed success has also undermine one of the basic theories that has relied on to understand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years the Phillips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heated up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the Philips gr\nIf you put it in a murder mystery framework who killed the Philips curve it was the fed the kill themselves to\nSome Federal Reserve humor from James Bullard president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and what was the murder weapon well Bullard says it was the feds long persist and focus on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\nSo Bullard says the Philips curve is working but rumors of its death maybe exaggerated it certainly still invoked during the debates within the fed about whether to raise interest rates some policymakers argue that with unemployment so low right now the\nFed should be raising interest rates are much more rapidly to head off inflation federal\nReserve chairman Jerome Powell is taking a gradual approach here he is earlier this month in an interview on the PBS NewsHour\nSo he ...\nA little more central bank humor this time in apparent reference to a classic Monty Python sketch a man walks into a pet shop with what appears to be a dead parity in a

physics curve could just be resting but with the help of his sleeping pill in the form of slow wage growth says former fed economist and no one\nTo two different ways in which low rates of unemployment lead to inflation is by increasing wages\nAnd wage growth in the U.S has been sluggish which is part of the reason inflation is staying low [noise]\nWhat is the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nUs economies extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response owing thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want low and stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that will confirm your beliefs about how the economy works I have to believe that most of the people at the fed would say gives me
