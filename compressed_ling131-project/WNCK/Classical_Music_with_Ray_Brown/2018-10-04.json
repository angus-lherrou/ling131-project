three weeks past the normal for the last five United States Supreme Court justice\nSenator rounds thanks so much you met Mike Rounds of South Dakota and we'll be speaking with a democratic senator elsewhere in the program I Want to bring in another voice now one of the people from Kavanaugh's past who has stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination Chad letting them went to Yale with Kavanaugh\nHe says they used to drink together that when Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive that he wants ... Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kavanaugh may have lied under oath chat letting and joins me now Hi there\nHow are you man I I'm All right thank you I your account has been widely reported since you came forward and released a statement this past Sunday I've just summarized it they're so let me straight to what you did with this information you ended your statement saying you would go to the FBI and tell them what you did you\nUh yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone the did than tell me what exactly to do first and entailed sending your request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact the former run this had been pre filled by the presumed reviewed and I spoke to a with my testimony unit that took up most of the three thousand a character spaces of bailout\nSo you feel that this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nUh last I did not I was never called Bucca we're by my food by my computer ah hoping to get an email ... nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI what did they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all one should learn from these so usually a committee or whether it's taken oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black you know I think Britain ... confused that was passing out but the blackmail cruise means doing things that you don't know you you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the speed of who's intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nLet me let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen

favorite indicator of dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit to voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work or in looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nA lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are

O. J. says its practice of naming and shaming does make a difference because it shows the hackers\nAmerica knows how to find them and describe what they did and sometimes other parts of the government impose sanctions on individual hackers or the people who fund them\nThe assistant attorney general for national security John ... told reporters that Russia launched the cyber effort because it would embarrass by allegations than it's athletes were invading drug\nTest embarrassed by that truth Russia fought back by retaliating against the truth tellers\nAnd against the truth itself\nNow Mary Louise the Justice Department says it's exposing those activities and that this indictment tells the real story\nI was asking you earlier about the timing of discharges carry and I have another question along those lines the U.S announced these charges just hours after Britain and the other one's announced their own accusations against Russian is that coincidence or coordinated\nVery much coordinated the Justice Department actually think it's international law enforcement partners for their help\nAt the press conference here in D.C today they highlighted how the Dutch were actually able to disrupt the hacking plot in April where for Russian men carrying diplomatic passport traveled to the Hague and rented a car and then fill it with electronic equipment they parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons\nThe goal was to penetrate the wife fi networks there but the Dutch we're on to them so the men abandoned the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the O P cw was examining substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. this year\n... exactly I\nMean here's here's my big question which is what to these charges tell us if anything about the ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this is all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and packs against democratic servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming midterms from further Russian interference\nVideotape wouldn't touch that question today but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which makes the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again\nAnd one unusual things stood out this morning the DOT actually have warning for news media both here and around the world be careful they said about using material that comes from these hacks it can be false are misleading or the hackers can have a sinister motive as the Russian government allegedly did in this\nCase [noise] NPR's Carrie Johnson thank you my pleasure\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court could come down to the

and and what does that have to do with our moon\nRock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes the gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that arm in grows within the rock paper of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock paper of the earth and that gives them in the same chemistry and see her\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust to themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust\nUh to trust to themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've done straight here actually\nIs real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] so of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince\nOurselves first how long did that take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the published paper with for years so I think we had a lot of internal debates\nA amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the men\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the man was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today\nUnderstanding how earth became the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event and its creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely\nHow'd you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation and in the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe've kind of kid who was always going in the backyard staring at the stars\n[noise] I had my nose in books imagining space travel I very much enjoyed science fiction\nSo for you is studying planets a fallback to actually traveling through space\nI might be too terrified to actually go up in space [laughter] exploration\nAnd our imagination and through the laws of physics has been exciting enough for me\n[noise] Sarah Stewart is a planetary scientist at the University of California Davis and two days she was named to the new class of MacArthur fellows

fourth straight year of low price\nIt says um what's going to make or break us and hopefully with this new trade at all not break us it will help us\nKeep engineering so I mean the average dairy farm has struggled to make a profit\nFor years the price farmers are paid for their milk drop from twenty six dollars for one hundred pounds of milk and twenty fourteen she just sixteen dollars now since ... and others here say the opportunity to some more Gary to Canada\nUnder the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement could help us farmers do marginally\nLast year in Wisconsin dozens of farmers were left without a milk buyer when a regional company suddenly lost sales to Canada that's because candidates dairy industry implemented a new pricing policy it called class seven\nThe goal was to boost domestic sales and that hurt competition from us imports well do sales only represented about one percent of Wisconsin's enroll milk production the shock of seeing farmers lose their buyers overnight sparked national efforts to oppose candidates move\nBy the time the Trump Administration open NAFTA negotiations fixing the dairy market was a top priority and it wasn't until Canada agreed to end the controversial policy the new trade agreement was reached\nMark Stephenson had steering policy analysis at the University of Wisconsin Madison he says the fight wasn't really about trade between the two countries it was about other markets to\nCanada began to produce more skim milk older under the last seven and sell that product overseas and that began to compete directly with us exports sales\nBut David ... with the group dairy farmers of Canada argues that over production by us theories is a bigger issue\nYeah Wisconsin usually more milk than them all out of the day and so whatever ... you know has given ... it ... it's not going to really change the circles milk situation where you are\nIn some American farmers are starting to question whether the new trade agreement will really be all that helpful Wisconsin dairy farmer ... lost his milk by her last year because the candidates move but he says fixing trade with Canada won't really helped make its financial situation better\nThere's some pretty major problems in the dairy industry and an agriculture and general right now so this is a certainly a band aid and not a fix\nHindsight's issues like the nonstop growth of us milk production and the disconnect between what farmers received for their milk and prices at the grocery store with the Trump Administration calling the new trade agreement a big win for
