are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should fall met\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossil a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures are really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better word they kind of look like Tobar on bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they used a proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life\nShe says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nPointing at a token pointing from the perspective of what it means a lot on non\nShe said that life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils\nSo far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means

destination for European expose so they will be a effect on all manner of European produces whether it's a new one produces in France coffee producers in Germany\nOr you name it they they will be affected because UK off to breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries\nBut the point is is a symmetric shock waltz it's true that the other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or is this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more of a lot to be honest I I mean we all questions why yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to a very divided policy back in London and I think she negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the pause it then negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think ... still despite all the negative noises around as a common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a

marijuana is legal throughout Canada which raises a question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint had smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use our our ground be found in the midst of all into the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis on which reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when soldiers walking to the program thank you for having me on who you listen to that whole\nConference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of candidates in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges and talk crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to persist shot there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was ... there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grounds for burning somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very

hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThe garage doors shaking it was like somebody's trying to get in and the inside door was shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought\nJust hang in there and I said everything was going to be okay\nFor when last doors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the same can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone the storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road high winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls\nQuite few gate is the former head of FEMA and a long time member urgency management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nI mean this is a part of Florida that's what I call the Florida it's not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all generational of Florida families many of them or just said that Trump folks that fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade and Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised it's state wide building code John ... to Reno a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state in some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand when speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Florida he's part of a team that's been the weekend on the panhandle gathering data on Michael's impact\nWhat we were damage to pretty much all types of construction all types of materials and all types of what was not damaged houses that were well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig view gate has long believed wind speed standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nIt yeah that store back in and out particularly yet Michael back in it's going to force a much higher in ... or the coast well inland based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now in the process of revising the state code and his awaiting recommendations from the University of Florida team led by David provide provide says understanding how to build resilience structures is just the first step\nWe know what can be proven suits you it is way the community is willing to adopt it or not\nRealtors homebuilders the insurance industry and many others will have a voice as Florida considers how to prepare the panhandle

has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she's a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nGreat thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see and missions policies change not to have race it\nNo Harvard says when they do consider race it's one of many factors that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from a list of factors that Harvard is considering one at assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard is saying that they don't do that but what ... has been showing in the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents donors missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of get this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal ratings artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of allege that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI Do think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\nI'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo I think\nThat a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important but I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at night in the context of race but again like I said\nMarried in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and\nThink chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks for having me she's a junior at Harvard and you are listening to all things considered from NPR News\nNext month's
