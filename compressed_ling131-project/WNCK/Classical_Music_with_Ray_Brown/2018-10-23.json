I mean the pressure is on them and even though the Dodgers haven't won a World Series in Thirty years in a Red Sox an ad that highly boxing is that a lot of reason to celebrate between the patriots and the red Sox but this is arguably one of the bat\nRegular season teams we have ever seen okay so they went and it was without a doubt they were the best team in baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when it all no one cares about hey you want to hide your making yeah you get an award you get a crowd\nYou don't get anything oh you get to you want a hundred and ... yeah they ... they are so good out of it as well you know in the postseason the best you can always when you got to go out and play\n[noise] All right I Want your crystal ball Jessica how do you see the world series playing out who do you think is going to win daughters\n... and that's going to shop a lot of people because of the Boston Red Sox are the best team on paper there is nobody better what I Love about the postseason transcend all of that talent pitching hitting I don't care for all the numbers out yet is redemption\nPassion its its fire the Dodgers had because they lost in game seven last year and I believe that's going to kill them to victory this year\nRight that was ESPN baseball analyst Jessica Mendoza she'll be on sports center covering the world series thanks so much that's again thank you out that [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nI'm running for governor\nVote with two weeks until the mid term Democrats are doubling down on state races in Nevada the party is pushing to elect the first democratic governor in Twenty years\nOld from overloaded with your own all the voters illegal identify with\nBut he's their candidate making a convincing case where somebody going how's it going tomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News\n[noise]\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should first said that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families\nBut it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in touch the\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification\nLike one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in captivity they're being held\nIn governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are ... I Would say over two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody into a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't vote the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed them killed and this was a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life\nShouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring jobs back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite fuzzy but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents do you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing or people not reunited because of disorderly conduct DUIs\nAllegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we are talking about four year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with\nThe ACLU has reported that five children have parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has new idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining thanks for having me\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered\nFrom NPR News that you couldn't see this next story coming it's about psychics who take advantage of the people who believe them from member station W.

Chang and I'm Audie Cornish\nStrict voting laws are putting some states in the headlines this election year in Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs and North Dakota law requiring voter id is to include street addresses has also gotten attention\n... considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities\nShe's the head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nCountry has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to but we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty times\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we say states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue I've been reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls up some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the role in some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person hasn't voted and to interview cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\n[noise] um we want\nElection administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late a critically were also saying that purging is happening\nThere's way too late a critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling his voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the\nStrictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet\nI I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that was a an acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nA many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed her very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't
