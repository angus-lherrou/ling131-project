assault President Trump's response has been relatively restraint that changed completely last night when President Trump mocked Ford at a rally in Mississippi\nHow did you get home I don't remember how'd you get or don't remember where was the place I don't remember I'm going to go on and today in\nThe White House briefing room press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello\nSo as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night sure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey\nFord voter testimony is very compelling and she was like a very fine woman\nNow he seemed to be sort of ... to the line that congressional Republicans seem to be healing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible but you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really the verging from that line and he was playing it to last and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today some of how the response\nHas been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing\nOn two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nRight well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her vote now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote you\nKnow one thing that has been swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nIn one of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice he likewise said that to a crowd the crowd likewise lasted cheered\nAnd you know he was really he really seem to be saying she's an attractive and that wouldn't have happened there for so the important thing that we're trying to get out here though is that we have a pet or not only of how Trump reacts to sexual misconduct allegations\nAnd it's seven pm just lemons will form in ... the

when people are looking to get rid of municipal waste a trash they would find a hole in the job somewhere in Philadelphia have we seemed like a good idea\nBut heavy metals and manmade toxins were

this put the public fears to rest then made news of the cancer cluster and twenty sixteen workers made an alarming discovery high levels of pee fast chemicals and surface waters around the landfill\nSince then traces of these industrial toxins have also turned up in nearby wells\nOfficials are still working to pinpoint where the chemicals come from and they may never be sure what caused the cancer cluster but pee fast chemicals have been linked to a wide range of health effects including cancer so neighbors like Julian Lane are still terrified\nRight and so were drinking the water

Mm\nThat is from a scathing report from the homeland security department internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the ... inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel\nHey also so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but what is new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary just in the ocean\nIt is important in it that these miners are very well taken care I don't believe that ... they are very well taken care\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da Jess held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and assistant after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent\nH H s by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time the age I said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nSince then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children in any way no risk bans and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that that authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nDa jazz does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to

rest of the Senate or waiting on the FBI to finish its investigation that sexual assault allegations against terminal\nThree Republicans who could determine the judges fate say they need to see that FBI report first before they make up their minds with us now to talk about the latest as NPR's Scott Detrow who joins us from Capitol Hill Hey Scott pay also\nSays that they're saying the FBI could complete this report and send it to them as soon as today which would be early because the FBI was given a full week to do this does this speed to give us any clues about the scope of the report\nWhat we got one clue on the scope just just a while earlier today we know now that the FBI has not yet talked to one key witness and that's Christine buzzy Ford\nHer lawyer say as of today she has not been contacted by the FBI a lot of top Republicans are fine with that I asked John Cornyn the number two Republican as he got into an elevator earlier today\nI don't know when we heard from ever says of course referring to last week public testimony a Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley has had something similar\nDemocrats say this makes no sense that the whole point of following up was to confirm or dispel what Ford and Kavanaugh said so the FBI should follow up here's Democrat Richard Blumenthal who's a former attorney general\nLeads are followed the interviews creates additional

responding to what the president said last night\nReally not well Arizona Senator Jeff flake said that what Trump said was kind of appalling\nOf course all along Senate Republicans have distanced themselves from Trump's comments and tweets and then back to his agenda is the question is whether this time will be any different Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski is one of those other key undecided

considered I Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro survivors of sexual assault are sharing their stories many for the first time Washington Post columnist Monica ... has been getting a steady stream of them in her inbox\nAnd her latest column has the headline your dad's your daughters told me about their assaults this is why they never told you how many people have been sharing the column on line that I spoke with Monica ... about it earlier today\nI like a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of survivors wanting to share their stories of sexual assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I've never told if my dad I don't think he could handle this\nAnd what did they tell you about the reasons they never told their father\n[noise] some women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail some women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him this would make him cry\nThe someone they did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect me and he would feel like he failed\nIt is it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well\n[noise] I did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of when and said I told my mother and learned that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world\nAs a young woman and so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of ... exist because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lady pain explain what you mean by that\n[noise] you know it just just thinking about tropes in sitcoms where\nThe dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery store that he can never make we do that with ... we do that with breast feeding\nAll of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on the spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on this spectrum of gross or uncomfortable things that happen to win and\n[noise] can you tell us about some of the responses that you've had to call them since it was published this week\n[noise] yeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll ...\nMore than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response yep please\nShare Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions\nI shared your call in with my wife of forty years and asked her head this ever happened to her and she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled I asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready I didn't answer but I'll do it soon\nNot today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be at some comfort semper fi while\nSo I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dads\nThey're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say\nI always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you on murder then and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send\nBecause what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone um so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nIs part of your argument also that it's important for daughters to tell her father's about this so that they have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first time\nBecause of what we're hearing into the cabin up for hearings because their fathers have said something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you\nSo if you were a father and you have a ... of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who have said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is why\nMonica ... Washington Post columnist and her new novel out this week is Cold War outside thanks so much for joining us today thank you for having me\nThousands of planets have been detected around far away stars in recent years and the scientists studying those planets may have found the first moon NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nEven in our own solar system some of the most intriguing places to hunt for life are moons like in sell it is and Europa around Saturn and Jupiter these moons seemed to have oceans of water beneath an icy crust\nIt's been hard enough to find planets around distant stars let alone moons still David chipping thinks he's finally found a really good evidence for one\n... some strange and it's the first of its time but demands a higher level of rigor and skepticism than you

three hundred planets for any weirdness that might mean a moon what popped out was a planet called Kepler sixteen twenty five feet in Jupiter sized world that orbits a star around eight thousand light years away\nThey followed up with the Hubble Space telescope and today in the journal science advances they say this gas giant appears to have a Neptune sized moon\nWe're still not under the ... that we think is the leading hypothesis the researchers have requested more time on Hubble to do more observations next may if this does pan out and turn into a true discovery it would be really revolutionary\nMegan ... the flat aren't Institute in New York she says moons are kind of the next frontier when it comes to understanding alien solar systems they capture imagination she says if this

times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that well\nWe think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about the transaction Trump Palace\nAnd then the cases where there were audits there is evidence that the Trump didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser grossly undervalued some of the properties\nRuss ... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today\nThanks for having me or the New York times story you just heard about says the trumps were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it\nAs NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do so real estate\nCompanies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax funding as usual is one thing to have kind of self serving valuations that are on the global side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades and simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been now with\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns has now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nThe fact is that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of revenue also to the extent the IRS has resources that are not going to be allocating ... tax enforcement\nThe same is true with the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nTheir peers to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a transaction some on the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years ProPublica has reported that President Trump's sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen but\nBecause Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Eric Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do\nBut the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore the question is what regulators can do about it and why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nBut severe us as the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on her return means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS finds evidence of wrongdoing severe says it can retroactively force Fred Trump's heirs to pay back taxes and they may have to pay civil fines\nAs well Jim Zarroli NPR News New

about eighty percent of the board seats of S. and P. five hundred companies but there are lots of reasons why other states might not follow California's lead cake you read these lily to Mali reports

standing at the communications consulting for the biotech industry\nI think I Want to clap because any movement towards gender equality and a great thing but on the other hand you want to cry because I Can't believe they'll pay twenty eight pain we need a bill and mandate gender equality\nLike California Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill into law he had knowledge it contains flaws that could quote proved fatal to enacting at\nThe main one it may be unconstitutional ... professor Kim ... says opponents could challenge the law on the grounds that it violates equal protection guarantees by discriminating against men and failing to address marginalized groups the signs women\nAfrican Americans uh but yeah and Latino candidate Asian American candidates are all under represented there are
