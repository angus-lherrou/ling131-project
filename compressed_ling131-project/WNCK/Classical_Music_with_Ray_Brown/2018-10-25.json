national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts it seems like today catch us up on where the investigation\nStands the FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious packages these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of\nPresident Trump may include former president Barack Obama former vice president Joe Biden former attorney\nThey include former president Barack Obama former vice president Joe Biden\nFormer attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan\nFormer secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned an actor and prominent Trump critic Robert De Niro had received one of the package at an address link to him in New York another common denominator is that these are people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation authorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded\nA or had the potential to explode here hills are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way\nThey're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA\nFor insights into how these devices were made\nAnd the FBI assistant director William Sweeney says the powder in at least some of these on bulbs does not appear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives who is reviewed some images of these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people and intimidate them and did that without happening\nFor political or personal reasons all of that is a big focus of this investigation All right so if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individual suspects here's what we do know\nInvestigators are focusing some resources on New York and some others in Florida\nRemember these packages had to return address in Florida specifically to the office of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz shelters not actually linked to these packages she didn't send them but whoever did made her part of the story\nAnd there's another reason why authorities are focused on Florida at least some of these homemade pipe bombs may have been mailed from Florida besides the FBI and the ATF\nPostal service investigators are involved here to trying to trace that and a postal service representative has just told us and the last eight hours or so they've seen no new packages run through the system and just briefly carry while this person or persons are still on those\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from love me and makers of go to meeting

we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you ... are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that we have created incentives in our immigration system and then she was partly because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and whether a bear consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as the so called caravan makes its way north\nMexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people but they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency is the president says it is\nBut I Am nobody called the national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a couple of children and ... units set of eyes by laws we passed by legal precedent in

is who sent them the head of the ... of the FBI is New York office William Sweeney gave an update on the investigation to reporters today\nThe FBI will continue to focus all of the resources at our disposal to identify and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible for these acts\nNPR's Hansi Lo Wang has been reporting on the investigation from New York City and ... where does the investigation stand at this point into these packages\nOr you have a really a full force of law enforcement trying to figure out why this happened who was behind this or this includes the FBI that might pd also the secret service and as you mentioned there are ten packages\nThey're found in New York Florida Delaware California, Maryland this is really sprawling and we're trying to put together all these different pieces that they've collected from these packages there either all center on their way to FBI's\nLab in Quantico, Virginia and they're trying to really look at the details here trying to figure out what they can figure out including looking at the powder that was found in the package that was sent to CNN the New York office\nOr the eyes Williams Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nThe powder in those particular envelopes did not present a biological ... other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nKnow at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about detached\nIs you know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices as quote suspected explosive devices\nAnd I know some batted away any questions that possibly any of these explosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intense they're focusing and investigation or asking for tips from the public\nAre there specific threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now\nWell one big question is were these packages sent through the poster system or some of them could they have been delivered by sure you're\nAnd also what were the materials used for these explosive devices I spoke with a former ATF agents out from the bureau of alcohol um [noise] uh firearms a division and he said that really they're looking at trying to find signatures that may be able to identify who who is the individual or individuals behind this\nAnd also they're looking at a closed circuit TV footage to see if they have any indication of who may be involved and you really can't rule out that there may be more packages out there and so that's something that a postal workers and law enforcement or on the lookout for\nIn the meantime what more is known about the packages that were found today in Delaware and New York\nWell the baggage his in New York as we mentioned earlier was were sent to vice president former vice

and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy including comments she made about black face justice week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nShow I'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's\nDavid Folkenflik is reporting her employment by NBC appears to be over they joined us from our studios in New York City hit or David ... so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our stage show she's had was having a chat a couple of days ago was that several panelists about Halloween costumes and talks about how she's not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\n[laughter] you do get in trouble if you are a white person who works on or a black person it puts on weight like that that was okay as long as you address the character\nAnd that of course at tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by whites\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply or is it notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story or both by a on the NBC nightly news\nUh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show or a two for African American colleagues really wait in that first let's hear from our broker a he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShe does a bigger apology to folks color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin uh depressed the newest co hosted today show he weighed in as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run a month so um that's silly and its mission junior ... it's just as ignorant and racist isn't statement itself\nOr NBC News Germany Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well\nThis isn't the first time they can Kelly is his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\n[noise] well I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to our own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host a much sharper edge parks and he's hosted she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ were white ... back in ...\nIt was Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ were white ... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show is been\nAiling a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings are and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who were teens his ties to the network\nWhat have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this source would direct knowledge of the matter says it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and a welcome from a employees that NBC as she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall\nAnd I ... at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of lot for it in addition she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for ah ah for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires that figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet\nBegging Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween now I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear would um we do every year in quotes which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface I've been an advocate Halloween is likely Christmas at all companies on this one day of the year when all the ... costuming comes out maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether a blackface is bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as\nWell walk us through some of the history of this when did we first started ... and America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds\nOn may become central to Mr all shows and which why people would dress up like black people are talking this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course these missile shows depicted black people with lazy as animal is to play caricatures played the caricatures of course and that fits next to obviously this broad the humidity shouldn't allow slavery to happen at the time um and so these caricatures linger in the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century algae Olsen\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow fever portrayals of Asian American the rate of ... character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it does mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy set against\nThat and to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nWhere the people who are caffeine caricatured ... often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people with mental shows who are not wearing black with because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\n... to track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history ...\nWhat do you make of that [noise] [noise] I mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel is all white Pena which is important\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time and have conversations about race in history and power they always become conversations about intent and not about sort of broader context we always start in a store vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when you controversy tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there is not a black person and attendance and no one at that party me about an eyelash but then a video from that party or picture from that party flips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and men that video has to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery and so maybe these conversations will be better served if we spent less time parsing go what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people are not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team ...\nThank you so much

sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSo if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to leave\nYes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places that people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S and what I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want\nThings to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our hemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to a home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is the the us has some responsibility for the problems in these countries and thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nTo Central America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aid the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now transnational in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here\nIn our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages are not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand and tell the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you\nTell them that you know I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it in the end\nIt is the responsibility of

pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico dose in boxes they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is

that seemed effortless\nMerrick says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work and make them perform better\nSo we think about the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but do some bucks as the finding published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nAlready thought that the cerebellum is cruel to most people thought but these results for re more exciting and cleared than I could have ever dreamt\nDoesn't bug says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much harder noticed that I think that's why scientists the

out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task\nWhat we now understand is that what ... does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as
