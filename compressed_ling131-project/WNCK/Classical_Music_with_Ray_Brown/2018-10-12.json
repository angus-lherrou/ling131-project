Chang\nAnd I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida we stir industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today well\nYou know these are the serious somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove into day might bruise your body solving I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees are mostly stayed standing with shows that they didn't receive the same high winds so there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees with students\nThere I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees were started\nUh here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble I'm somewhat already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as it were there before the storm will hold them people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday a trick you nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's affectionate runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns\nAnd it's been damaged in several places and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the Congress buckled under washed them and they happen out yeah yeah I watched the\nThere's also in that area there's a cause where the links apple electrical in East Point together that was damaged now just single lane but that said there is no a pass with through apple logical or going\nWest would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and people in a in a ... watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in apple at school no power no very limited cell service and no outside help you\nWhile and and I mentioned these two towns are the heart of the or Easter industry they've got fishing going on there are a lot of fishing and they they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them\nRight I mean ... there there are but they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf\nBut also you know shrimp and fishing or big hear many people moved their boats upriver to a secluded area Heidi hold they call it keep it out of harm's way and so most boats escape major damage that's good but some of the seafood restaurants and wholesalers worked with a lot of damage are working to rebuild and be back in business as soon as they can\nAs NPR's Greg Allen reporting for us from Florida Today and all this week

the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made pastor Brunson case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible he could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there I'm Mary Louise so we're my me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place in what exactly had been convicted up\nWell he's best or rent a small church in is near and western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had just failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and brunch and was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to the ... new turkey blamed for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses you adjust to fight against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways brunch was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric or to the ... who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to Walden reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get brunch released instead he was simply move\nAnd then reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get brunch released instead he was simply moved to house arrest then the U.S get tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case in those released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release a pastor Brunson or a good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering it thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extradite him declared for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing his doubles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDid you mark a showcase right and I think turkey will at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine he\nWas brought to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley he ask Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why ships getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one\nFritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes read it in fact the vending machines got use it in the White House is all Pepsi products and all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find\nOut things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a note left at the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted\nTo offset increases we have received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost of the free does have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things that are free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt well how naive to think that lesson of agra free to\nCarolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies\nShe says the price of a process food like Fritos has almost nothing to do with well food prices\nCounts as much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos ... and things like labor and rent and\nTransportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone

covers the athletic she industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why don't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a night to Ninety eight and it was very short list so I'm just one clear and a quarter\nAnd yoga broker after two years and so they put out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball\nBasketball though with the elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really hasn't so up with a big part of the appeal what's happening in with the players today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also I think for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark\nTheir basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how much pool do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James is who may even in a position\nAttract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James is to make even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any new cover\nYeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year like you had about ... percent of the week wearing the issue was loud oh okay step in combat that is pretty tough but okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget allowing for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSix of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with the darn ... cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they're looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like ... like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball shoe business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been not as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out there so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media she's gotten a chance to check up on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever ended up there on corporate life but I think people if they could do that in mid may kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue brand name what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stuff in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and there's the methods of highlights on his grandmother and like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys that pulled aside and\nThey have six and a half million followers on Instagram so that's wow this huge base as the brand of starting out you know I think the brand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand or so\nThey're really winning it on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their new is that\nThey don't want that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages so so that's going to

station\nIt's all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know that Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detail be abused more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases and abused like the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the mantra prepared that skating horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions you on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so am I ask you about your reaction to worlds recognition what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse\nI actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though is Nick knowledge meant by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think\nThat the people in Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop we're all played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them well and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nBut with respect to completely in limited eating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the cage becomes to prove\nIs it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet\nThe law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take\nThat much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes revising the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at these institutions\nWere you hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution\nIn the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to\nHold powerful institutions accountable\nAnd I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and\nLaw enforcement plays a unique in critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania\nAnd Joshua Shapiro is Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us thank you\n[noise] some of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed a federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigating the current administration NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nA few years after the resignation of Richard Nixon the special prosecutor who investigated him recalled a critical moment in that probe\nOne on last when we succeeded which was first in history to get the courts to promote the grand jury report to go to the house Judiciary Committee because the committee would have had real difficulty and doing its word are way behind it hadn't gotten all the brown\nLeon Jaworski told an interviewer in Nineteen Seventy seven the document contained in detail list of the evidence the Watergate prosecution team had gathered\nWay called the road map in our office because it was just that\nFor forty four years that road map remained a secret under ... by the federal district court in Washington on orders of the judge who presided over the Watergate cases\nThat secrecy persisted to protect the grand jury's work but not for lack of trying in Nineteen Ninety seven Stephen ... was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton base was looking for a precedent for how a special prosecutor might send an impeachment referral to Congress\nThe national archives let me see a lot of stuff from the water ... a year that was very interesting I when I asked you to load math was added up to the house I they ... they said no\nBates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry Schwartz stole\nIt's relevant historians it's relevant to the intrinsic ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public\nRecord urgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign and one of the big questions about the end of Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public John sale worked on Watergate as a young lawyer\nFrom twenty first century variation of the Silk Road is something that the Mueller team history likely considered\nSales spots on the Watergate team was James corals who now serves as mothers deputy\nBut he says unlike Richard Nixon Donald Trump's legal team is likely to object to any such material going to Congress\nTrump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has already signaled he would fight in court to stop lawmakers from seeing that document\nMeanwhile the battle over the Watergate roadmap could

... will keep you updated on storm recovery efforts plus the latest scenes tomorrow on all things considered from NPR News\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI think that it's gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also so how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its minister ration often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy that maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the fed from the president attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nOr with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president somehow sway the fed to slow down the rate hike\nOr no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis using them from\nUsing the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending or\nI think is very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up says attacks and others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests but you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the marriage that could could overtime German power ceases worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nAs well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation for the Federal Reserve\nFrom political pressure is understanding\nThat Donald ... the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today You're welcome also thank you for having me on [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered
