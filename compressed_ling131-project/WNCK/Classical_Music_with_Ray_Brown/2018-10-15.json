killers this is quite the turn of phrase do we know if the president has thought deeply on this to come up with it on the fly what\nWe're not sure about that but he certainly is offering an alternative theory of the case although he did not explain how road killers could have gotten into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and um\nKilled somebody in there but I think you see that his instinct is to deflect blame from the Saudi royal family he said several times that the king flatly denied it he firmly denied it and we've seen this pattern before when he took ... quote strong denials that Russia didn't interfere\nIn the twenty sixteen elections he even offered an alternative theory of the case back then when he said someone weighing four hundred pounds sitting on a bed might have hacked the Democrats emails so that's his instinct to basically two parts\nOr ... emails so that's his instinct to basically to protect defend dictators\nSo real killers is maybe the update on the four hundred pound guy yes say okay and I mentioned the president was on his way to Florida Today I it's very common of course for president to visit a disaster area but in Florida a few weeks before an election what are the politics of a presidential visit\nWell this was an official visit but it definitely had a political component because two of the most important races the cycle or in Florida the governor's race of course very important to Trump that a Republican remain governor there for twenty twenty for Trump's own reelection\nAnd also the current governor Rick Scott is the Republican nominee for Senate and if Democrats can keep the Senate seat in Florida they probably have no chance of taking over the majority there\nBut the president did meet with Governor Rick Scott he praised him normally natural disasters are a very positive political opportunity for incumbent governors because they have the resources and executive powers that non incumbent slack they can be a\nActing helping people really keeping in the spotlight\nThey ask you about one of the big issues in the Florida Senate race this is the red algae bloom the spin following the state's be choose and which is tied to warmer waters that come with climate change and the warmer waters which are of course also tied to the increasing intensity of hurricanes like hurricane Michael how is the president talking about that has Rick Scott talking about\nThat but what's so interesting about that is the president gave an interview to sixty minutes last night in which he said he thought the climate was changing but he wouldn't say that people are human activity was behind that change she even said well the climate is changing it could change back\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the

across the United states\nWomen are disciplined more frequently and often more harshly than men that's the finding of an investigation by NPR and the middle school of journalism at Northwestern university\nNPR's Joseph Shapiro and reporter Jessica papa that found that women are punished disproportionately for minor infractions those violations can have major repercussions like the loss of good conduct credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states in all but two women get this one of the higher rates than men what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison rules\nRates we estimated often two to three times higher for what prisons classify a smaller fraction\nPetty stuff you can get written up for a not closing your doors and get written up for jumping on the phone without permission or if you just want to just picture room up nice in just takes it too late indicted appeal the case you get written up for that\nThat's the tortilla Williams and it made up the central California women's facility inchoate show a California\nYou get written up for going out of bounds in somebody else's room\nAre out of bounds in the hallway is just basically everything you get written up for\nOur numbers showed that in California women compared to men get twice the disciplinary tickets for disobeying in order and more than twice as many for what's called disrespect\nIn Vermont we found women are more than three times as likely to get in trouble for making what's called derogatory comments in Rhode Island they get more than three times the tickets for disobedience\nThose tickets have consequences women lose good combat credits like I have time to to their stay in prison or boost phoning visitation privileges or go to solve their confinement in Rhode Island women were more than three times as likely as men to end up in solitary confinement for disobedience\n[noise] prisons were built for men and the rules for discipline was shut up to control those mass DMV ... says those rules don't\nWork very well with women you walk through a women's prison and it's a profoundly different experience we\nMet some of the day she was visiting Logan Correctional Center a women's prison in Illinois several years ago ... was a top official in the Illinois department of corrections now she works with prisons as a consultant she helps them address that problem of why women in prison get discipline more\nWomen are more communicative when you walk to a prison there more emotional they want to talk to you they want to talk about their children they want to talk about their experiences\nTwo years ago they notice help conduct an audit about women's prison in Illinois and found that women prisoners were just one almost twice as often as men for all offensive\nThis is big and small but almost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor insolence\nAnd they also really if they seen injustice with another woman in a prison or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix that problem\n... told us she likes it that women prisoners are this way but she said many corrections officers and often even in a women's prison most of them are men say they hate it\nThe first thing that they'll tell you is these women are so difficult gosh they're a pain I Would rather work anywhere but here they always want to talk to you they won't take no for an answer\nCorrections officers are trained to keep control they expect women to be compliant if the women push back that's where those disciplinary tickets for influence come in\nTo women we met in Illinois told us they'd been written up some years ago for an infraction called reckless I bowling\nWhile women get more tickets than men certain women get the most tickets of all women with mental illness those were a lesbian bisexual or transgender African American women especially for those lesser non violent offenses\nLike ... a guard out because they fast on that to me that I like or yeah stuff like that\nTitanic Williams was Nineteen when she went to prison in Illinois after repeatedly missing her court ordered nine pm curfew and our foster care facility in prison after a fight with an inmate Williams was charged with hitting an officer who tried to stop it or sentence was doubled from two years before\nBut most of her tickets were cursing and talking back to officers and\nThose kept her in prison for extra days and she lost privileges one time she says she got in trouble for cursing at a guard when her soul mate who had diabetes passed out we've solved the officer was too slow to help\nWilliams says the hardest thing was when she lost her phone privileges and she couldn't call her son he was a baby when she went to prison and he was growing up without her\nIt was sad because I'm Mr yeah I\nI miss her the polling\nHe's nine now but Titanic Williams says that time separated often not even able to talk to him on the phone makes it hard to be a parent now\nEven sitting there you got to do with the consequences are missing out ... years ago on this it is hard right now\nStill don't understand that there might not have the ball back door\nKnock down the aisle him like curvy current you're gone\nMore than half of women in prison or the mothers of children under the age of Eighteen one common punishment that Illinois prison was that women last good conduct credits in one year alone twenty Fifteen women most Ninety three years of those credits that's twenty extra days or prison time for each woman\nThat's an average many women had no days at it but some ended up with months even a year or more of your time [noise]\nA small number of states including Illinois or trying to change this\nThey're trained what's called gender response of corrections practices it's built around the idea that women are in prison for different reasons than men that they respond differently in prison and that prison rules need to recognize those differences in the last ...\nFound out she\nHad that prison in Illinois a trainer at the front of a classroom tells corrections officers to think through the different pressures in a woman's life\nAnd she needs to see what's going on with their Spanish she asked\nMe how to deal with this\nWith phone privileges revoked all she can do is write a letter home or to her son's school\nIt's reminder to the corrections officers that tickets even once for a lesser offenses can have significant consequences reporter Jessica ... meant officers that that training they didn't want to give their names they set the agenda response of approach makes sense to them but that many of their co workers are much more skeptical\nI was I heard a lot of things but\nWhich has been worthless what is going to work with a big\nHug a thug that's a derogatory way of saying to letting the inmates run the prison we wrote letters to some of the women at that Illinois prison\nOne woman who wrote back said that says the training started she's not seen much difference she said corrections officers both men and the women are disrespectful and cruel\nAnd this is a quote there on a power trip they cause bitches hose they tried to provoke you if you say anything back they send you the segregation for threats and intimidation\nThe number of women in prison is rising but still they're only about seven percent of the prison population nationwide so it's hard to get prison officials to make their problems are priority like the heavy punishment of women for those ... violations of prison rules\nJoseph Shapiro NPR News [noise]\n\n...
