is we all know focused on counter insurgency in Afghanistan but after Russia invaded crime you're in two thousand and fourteen data seems to be re focusing more on its roots back here in Europe\nNow the war games that they are staging right now has a NATO forces defend the country that's been attacked by an unnamed invader\nWas it really trying to emphasize here is a pillar of NATO which is if one country has attacked it's seen as as an attack on all NATO members now a most assume is fictitious invader is Russia earlier this fall Russia had massive war games in the eastern and now it seems to be NATO stir\nThese huge military maneuvers by NATO and the Russians makes it sound like we're returning to something like the Cold War is there talk of that they're in Norway where you are\nActually already they're very careful to say this is not a new Cold War but they also admit you know the global landscape has changed and NATO's showing strength I was on the ship today speaking

you know so we may be challenged and so uh if we're challenged or we will respond to that challenge\nTo whatever all focusing is anybody's thinking of challenging NATO they need they frankly they need to think twice\nAnd of course President Trump has not been for about the U.S commitment to NATO as some of his predecessors I mean he's publicly berated some NATO member countries for not spending enough on defense is that tension playing out as these exercises unfold\nNo certainly not on the surface and there's a real emphasis on unity here in the United states heavy commitment we have Seventy

I'm Ari Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means for the United states\nWe are the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is Mr President so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut the sizzling economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China in the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten you six point two you want in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim and economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen you're on fall if it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they selling it and buying dollars\nAnd ... says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand\nMeanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker the strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda that President placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe parish I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't ... well partly counteracted\nIs so far impose tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blunt their impact Lim says the falling you on may also have another impact foreign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and below product\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorb the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the credit scoring system we happen to U.S China scores use financial information\nBut China system also considers information like when you buy and how you treat your neighbors if you fail to pay your

is forty two he lives in ... province in China in one day he went online to book a high speed train ticket to Beijing\nYou put down his name and payment but right away this page popped up saying he could not complete the purchase\nOf it on on on these days than this person is on the uh untrustworthy list from the court\nLoved one was confused why couldn't he broke the strength to get you started looking into the situation and he quickly realized why this was happening loved one had landed himself on something known as the blacklist\nJulie ... one thing that comes along with the blacklist there on customers and live that uh you're fired from high end consumption which means that you can't take a speed train you can fly\nTrying to started to black with about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust into its banking and financial system and part of this has involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapsed\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near what it had been and he had all these loans you couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his bank she found out that all of his account and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town you discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the electronic billboards by the side of the road was his face like up on a big billboard\nAnother you're more than be electric screened by the side of the plaza\nThere are like huge screens and they're very eye catching you can really see them from afar and I saw my my pictures

went out whenever he'd chew the billboard she would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy waiting to see his face would come up but one day when he was doing that she saw the face of someone he knew her\nOut of my ... oh my God this or we used to be working in a semi industry as I did all now up their\nLoved one started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist he started calling him saying hey I'm On the list\nTo she started getting people together meeting up for dinner he says these are the only people that he can really be relaxed around\nBut what about what do you actually\nSee the widespread attitude toward the U.S is very resistant people will think why are you sure been happy why do you still have time to be happy or why do you not to go out and make money to pay back your loan\nSo far loud one said he was paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars to the originally owed still about one point two million to go\nBut even when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard\nWe talked to ... and trying to deal with this by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debts well it's technically possible but\nIt just never seems to happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court about this issue but they didn't respond to requests for comment\nLoud one says she will keep paying off his dad has to believe there's a way off this list Cardiff Garcia Stacey Vanek Smith NPR News\nSupport for
