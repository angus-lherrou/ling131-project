McAdams\nOr in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year of deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about president from how do you view of the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise]\nYou know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump pressure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he's a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be part of that\nThat's all no accident the county officials and former state senator notes that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district\nThe votes I Need to win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress and I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love a two term congresswoman who got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican love is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist\nGoing into Washington I Know exactly one morning when I build ... relationship on both sides of the aisle\nLove is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration\nAs a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something\nRight Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years and it's something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a boat for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact McAdams says he would not vote for below sea to be speaker\nNow my opponent may be naive and say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keep his independence and Washington when I see\nIs if the Democrats do take back the house is because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people for whom party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates likely Adams that many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey're calling for single payer health care or impeachment so if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderates shift party dynamics especially if they're the ones responsible for Democrats winning back tower got Detrow NPR News Salt Lake city [noise]\nAnd you're listening to all things considered
