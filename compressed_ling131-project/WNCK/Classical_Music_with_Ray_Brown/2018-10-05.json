year ago today with the New York times broke a bombshell story\nThe times headline on October fifth twenty Seventeen read Harvey Weinstein paid off sexual harassment accusers for decades or one of the

going to happen when we got out into the world\nWe didn't my partner Megan too and I we certainly felt the power of the story as we were reporting it and because of the times was doing bigger investigations sexual harassment me knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we were reporting on Bill O'Reilly we were reporting on Fort factory workers\nBut

massive debate about what this means for the me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which\nProbably have some validity I'll give you the ... the obvious one is that people will say this as a setback he was confirmed anyway uh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um women were\n... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of Anita Hill\nThe other argument however is that\nWhat especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country\nShe put high school on the
