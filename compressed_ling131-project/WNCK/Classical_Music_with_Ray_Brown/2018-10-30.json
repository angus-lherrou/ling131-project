Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just was an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose has all hey our first just fact check forest canned the president do this most constitutional\nScholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here's what the fourteenth amendment says quote all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jury\nQuote all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century\nAnd the children were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship they argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tells what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say that Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating look like this more than a decade and now they got a president in an office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House's critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWhile the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nThat is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico no question that this president was elected on a promise to get tough on immigration in this issue plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections\nUm although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that this issue will motivate voters on the other side as well\nOne more statement from the president on this what I'd like you to fact check Trump says the U.S is out of step with the rest of the world and that it is the only country to allow birthright citizenship is that true\nThis is eighty nine point five W.

cost of health care more than anything Rebekah Brooks resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara late right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd sort of black women have decided that you know no longer we're going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own pack\nWith the sleepy scene on is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CBC um directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a

reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either I first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter car says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the special ... special counsel's office was you know it's usually very tight lipped and what I did decide to speak about this\nUh and it says it immediately referred to matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purported plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of al ... earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars\nIn exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Mueller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in the scheme do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down an individual with an empty provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual working\nFrom the okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting timing here\nThe timing is indeed curious yeah the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV\nAh which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy Berkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember all around the

first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead right he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged game to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank\nYou but you Ebola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of

his team did manage to drive off in time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week [noise]\nPartly it's because many people in the

the country [noise] health workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and the CDC's Arthur says that's why despite the violence this outbreak is
