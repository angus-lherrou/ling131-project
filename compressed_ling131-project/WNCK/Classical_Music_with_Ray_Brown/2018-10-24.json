every Friday on prime video\nAnd from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\n[noise] this is all things considered from NPR News I'm Elsa Chang\nWe're going to go now to a region of the country that's been labeled tragically the suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said they said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life inside the Grand Junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hurt a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together and another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know ... by your bootstraps mentality and Kathy\nEvil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think\nOf [noise]\nIt's I think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver I think there's also\nThe issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program and she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble\nBut these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicide\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and\nKids how to respond and talk about mental health and starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in\nClassrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\n... middle school eighth grader ... and the lunchroom taping note cards to a wall\nOr all the kids in the school had to write positive messages about what a good friend\nOr how a friend is help them through tough times lily points up to her and the crowded wall\nSupporting them and positive\nBecause I feel like even if they're down you can like help them be positive and just the flight than what they're going through so they don't feel like giving up\nReally has brown hair and a ponytail she's wearing blue sources of strength ... with the words hope help strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others she says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad's suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's tough to share but like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people cope I don't mind sharing what's\nGoing on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking and the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid in for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines sound confident that this is going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is Carissa tool she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband to suicide\nThe idea of of having 'em up here or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad a competitive bike racer he was a community leader seen as a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes tools husband or ... dad and uncle and this ... a national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Morse is the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well you have a super powerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to creating social movement and changing social norms and changing the things that need to change\nKids are catalyst to change Morris says you start there and hopefully

been and will remain I think an important security partner of ours\nBut should President Trump had been so reticent to criticize Saudi Arabia at the beginning\nI think reticence when you're dealing with national security partners is probably a positive impulse but right now he's in a situation having together more facts are that we have just been experiencing the worst cover up ever and and so that's pretty strong language coming from the president of United States\nDoes it concern you the close ties the Trump Administration has with members of the royal family and Saudi Arabia specifically Jared Kushner the president's son in law has cultivated a very close relationship with the crown prince Mohammed bin some on does that concern you\nKnow we have had strong relationships with Saudi government's for generations and uh that's uh something that has continued with this administration recognizing that the Saudis have been in can continue to be very important security partners uh they provide us valuable intelligence\nBut I have to admit that relationship or gets undermined is the Saudis are Deceive Us and as they engage in a violation of our fundamental values as they strongly

dramatically this could be a sign that the housing market is finally cooling off and ... report\nThe Commerce Department says sales of new homes dropped more than five percent in September compared to the previous month and that's part of a larger trend sales of new and existing homes have been slumping for four straight months\nHow much has the market called commerce figures show that new home sales are down more than Thirteen percent compared to last fall back then the housing market was hot home sales and home prices were both rising\nMillennials all those young adults who are the way buying their first house starting families during the recession years they were on the markets buying their first off as they were driving a kind of a lot of demand\nErrands or as us as a senior economist at Zillow just a year ago interest rates are averaging under four percent houses were selling quickly and home values or rocketing up but now it's a very different picture the housing market is weakening\nHome sales have been falling prices are few appreciating but at a slower pace\nLawrence unit the chief economist for the national association of realtors he says this is not a mysterious situation the fed has been raising interest rates after a long stretch of low rates as the country recovered from the great recession\nThat means rates for thirty year fixed rate mortgage or now closing in on five percent for the first time in years and that makes it more expensive to buy a house so you would expect to see a drop in sales and that's the only reason sales could be slowing that sharp increase in home values it has consequences\nYou and says in the booming housing market prices were rising too much too fast\nAnd prices gain a century fifty percent over the past six years what people's income growth barely rose above ... percent\nThat mismatch was pricing new buyers out of the market with that in mind he says a slowdown in sales is not a bad thing if it leads to more
