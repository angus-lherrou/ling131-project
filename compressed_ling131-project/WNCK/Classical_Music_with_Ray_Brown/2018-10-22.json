are thought to be rare on college campuses but since the opioid epidemic young adults are now among those at high risk for overdose so some schools aren't taking chances NPR's Tovia Smith reports on the new effort to keep students safe\nOne of the first things colleges are doing is teaching students to recognize an opioid overdose and\nWhat to do things and you know what they learned\nOhio University is using this video dramatization you and I can to show\nHow ... can that drug known generically as a lock sound can reverse in overdose\n\nOhio University as one of many schools that make nor can available through health services and campus police several other schools are starting to distribute the dress more broadly [noise]\nAs you can see right at the main entrance we have the cabinet at\nBridgewater State University south of Boston campus police detective sergeant Robert McAvoy points out one at sixty simulator boxes on campus that are now also stocked with little bottles of ... oh clearly labeled and read is opioid overdose kits and all free for the taking\nWe felt that it was on the university to provide these because it's a life saving drugs and we're in the midst of an epidemic that affects everybody\nShortly after a student died of an overdose in two thousand sixteen police putting our canon every dorm in parking lot and trained more than a thousand people to administer it\nAll you do you feel those facts you would hold it like this put the tip into the patients natural\nAbout recording and it's down if the nasal passage they've just given once right\nAnd then you're done that's in junior Isaiah Rosemary one of the resident advisors who've been trained\nYeah I did bad I'm ready and I think personally I feel like it's my moral obligation to help someone who was overdose could I have another person's life I think it's good to make and arcane available but it's really tricky situation\nThis student from a different university says he spent about ten years battling addiction he asked not to be identified do avoid harming future job prospects\nDuring his college years he says he overdosed twice and kept failing classes but he says that was before schools are set up to recognize or support students with drug addictions\nThey didn't want to acknowledge the problem like everything's fine at our school but I mean it was probably blatantly obvious honestly I was it was pretty bad\nNow one and a half years sober he's back in a new school and works in a campus recovery center the likes of which barely existed even a few years ago his school is also just started giving ... students but only if they ask for it he worries many users or their friends would be too afraid to do that\nBut he says he also sees the downside to just leaving it out for people to take anonymously\nThe cons to that is ... you have no way of offering them further help the only way that we can help them is if we know who it is\nAs college has struggled to workout best practices some say parents can't afford to just stand by in weight\nUnfortunately our colleges haven't really caught up and I think parents need to get into their own hands\nJillian Bauer reached teaches at Temple University where two students died of overdoses last year she says when kids head off to college parents should send them within our can as well as fentanyl testing strips\nJust like they would send them on with condom cheer encourage them to see first acts um they can create like a fee for drug use cat for them and here\nShe dismisses concerns that it may actually encourage more drug use\nLike I don't think that if you're a student was planning on studying for their exam that having an old strips and their drawer is gonna be calling their name to go out and buy drugs and tried\nBut others question such broad based strategies especially for schools with scarce resources even with school discounts and arcane runs about Seventy five dollars for two doses emergency kits contain to just in case at Bridgewater State University none of the kids put out last year had been taken yet\nAnd in the two years since the University of Texas at Austin launched a similar initiatives several kids placed off campus have been successfully used the program director Lucas hill says all those on campus remain untouched\nThis is at least one data point that says that may not be cost effective and so we'll see maybe on campus is not the hot spot\nHills now considering placing kits instead at convenience stores in bars but he cautions no locks on alone is not the answer

lot of pop R. and B and hip hop\nProduction\nTo me auto tune sounds sort of like digital stretching are flexing your sharing a a senior kind of slide up and down the register\nIn a in a way that

algorithm and it might fetch around ten thousand dollars computer's making art is nothing new but a computer creating a portrait that's being auctioned by such a prestigious art house\nNow that is new art appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the bugs around the upcoming sale and she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this in welcome thank you a pleasure to be here also\nHow controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art\nYou can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine or by Marcel disarmed where he literally took and then hearing on hanging on a wall right and this completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what aren't actually is\nFor the twenty first century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen again and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of the human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of the piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply\nWell they still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or anywhere 'cause I really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process to roll out\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the voters who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artist ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the color is the collective and maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so\nI think in terms of art the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated art work hasn't gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is a first it is the absolute first time this has ever happened because this is a Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited in numbered edition after the sale\nI don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular one because this is the first\nAaron Murray Wallace is the c._e._o. of rare era appraisals just outside of
