says\nBecause I'd like to see some of the foreign do this\nAnd the ad got in national attention he later had a best selling book about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so really it seemed like a rising politician the Democratic party\nAnd his decision today to part of the race came as a surprise and it came with a very honest and emotional letter message or tell us about it\nRight it was just hours ago candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem\nOr that he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago\nUm he said that when he should have been celebrating for example a having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in ... in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line the Vietnam veterans crisis

thank you Ari\nNow we turn to Amazon which has become the largest company to commit to the minimum wage is Fifteen dollars an hour\nThe retail giant which is worth almost a trillion dollars faced a lot of criticism after disclosing earlier this here that means salary at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars that's just a little over the federal poverty level for a family of four NPR's Alina Selyukh reports\nAnd Amazon corporate executives stood today before and more than\nSeven hundred workers in California warehouse and told them they are getting a raise [noise]\nThe Dave Clark\nHe told me this was one of his best days at work and the Twenty years has been at Amazon I should note that Amazon is one of NPR sponsors I reached clerk at that California warehouse\nWhere we're announcing now is a Fifteen dollar minimum may\nBefore any other\nThe Fifteen dollar minimum kicks in on November first for all Amazon workers in the U.S fulltime part-time temps in seasonal Amazon says that's about three hundred and fifty thousand employees total I ask Clark how much a warehouse temp job might pay at Amazon now\nAre lower in a facility was just under eleven dollars and it ranges over Fifteen dollars\nThis already far above the federal minimum wage of seven dollars and twenty five cents but still Amazon's bay has been facing a lot of criticism as a company ballooned into a global giant with half a million employees many of whom are drivers and warehouse workers\nAmazon is the second most valuable American Company it's run by the wealthiest men in the world CEO Jeff Bezos [noise]\n\nTwo weeks ago a group demonstrated outside of be the speech and Washington protesting the wide gap between bases his wealth and the wages for his lowest paid employees\nInside basis spoke to several hundred Washington Power brokers and he was asked about the growing intention that Amazon was getting from critics who think it's become too big and too powerful\nThey just said scrutiny like that is good for society\nAll big institutions of any kind or going to be and should be examined scrutinized inspected\nToday in his statement about the Fifteen dollar minimum wage ... said the company listened to its critics one of the most high profile ones has been Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\nFor her to give credit where credit's due soon as a matter of fact I derive\nSanders has long been campaigning for better conditions and pay for minimum wage workers including at retail and fast food restaurants\nHe has introduced a bill called the ... act which stands for stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies the bill would tax large corporations whose workers rely on federal benefits like food stamps\nAnd our hope and believe but I'm a college will cause other companies like Wal Mart or food in the short reading that which was world so to a degree for American workers\nAmazon is not the first big retailer to make a public show of raising the minimum wage target plans to get to Fifteen dollars an hour by twenty twenty costs go hit fourteen dollars this summer but Amazon is now the country's second largest private employer\nI thought it was great news and see how could be other than good news\nIs the author is an economist at MIT and he says there are several ways to view Amazon's move skeptically won the unemployment rate is low and there is high demand for workers\nOne interpretation is look it was going to have to raise wages anyway Italy marketers tightening uh so it just you know decide to get some good publicity out of that\nAutor says no matter the reason it's important to remember that raises are good for the workers who get them tender local economies lower wage workers are so that they do tend to spend extra earnings\nAnd there's another kind of surprising way that Amazon made waste today it's saying that it will lobby Congress for an increase in the federal minimum wage however Amazon's Dave Clark told me the company does not plan to Bush for a federal minimum all the way up to Fifteen dollars\nWe think is the right number for a really been to the experts in Congress but\nSenator Sanders says he hopes the ... stamp of approval

killed a police officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection\nTwice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct the third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows a trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffers from severe vascular dementia and\nHis lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this crime or things of that the state to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing man so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the results of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia is so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself or his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely urinate on himself and ask the guards to take him to the toilet\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said it's not like the constitutions other amendments it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that executing cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I\nThink if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's schizophrenia or delusional lawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime\nAnd he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murder\nAfter the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder and at some point in time to say look forward to being able to obtain the punishment that the trial judge Lee was appropriate in this case\nA decision in the case is expected later in the term Nina Totenberg NPR News Washington\nYou're listening to all things
