station failed during and today\nAt liftoff had proceeded smoothly for about two minutes then came in real life drama\n[noise] up\nHere and I have five cats and my family was that\nThe crew American the Hague and Russian Alexei option in our space after an emergency landing in context on three other astronauts are currently on board the space station and now they're returned home might be delayed\nFor more on all of that we are joined by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield he served as commander of the international space station in twenty Thirteen and flew up there and back any Russian Soyuz capsule welcome\nThank you nice to be talking with you also\nDo this we're going to be American Nick Cage for time into the the second for like the ocean and what kind of training would they have had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them and training for decades Alexei as a cause but not for quite a while as you say with space flight experience Nick prior to being an astronaut was a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launched\nThey might working together for a couple of years we wring out every last thing that could possibly go wrong\nThe way that crew behave there were so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to all Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely actor\nWhen would be the next chance you could go on a mission like that again I mean I Can't imagine a psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused in professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be cut on that 'cause they didn't get to go to isn't based today you know kind of\nLike gosh all that preparation will have to read that but neither of them got hurt and there are back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again but I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a long time to figure out what went wrong\nAnd then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what skill sets should we need one is that going to be all of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of\nInformation people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem manufacturing problem who knows\nThat and once you know that you could fix it then you can set a timeline is that in three months from now then no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years\nThen we need other plants Boeing is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different Sawyers that's talked to the space station and sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want a fight if they on talking to come home and they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough ship\nThat after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them\nSo it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man so people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nChris Hadfield went the first Canadian commander of the
