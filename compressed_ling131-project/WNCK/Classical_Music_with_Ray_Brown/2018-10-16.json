we're seeing is that as we get broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an ... woman being a first generation American being a veteran I think you know in in so many of those identities\nI think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you\nStand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government\nUm we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated we're trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou have the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty

experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that it got you know some wonderful fellows and and turned on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so in so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my and I can tell you [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance and we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but\nWhen you consider where we were back then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term process\nThe Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do you think that in the Trump era is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. T. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we just have all the overall national landscape for future algae tiki candidates as well Gina\nYeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know that there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it merely discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and and none of that can I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is

violations of prison rolls NPR's investigative team has been digging into this disparity this week\nToday NPR's Joseph Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's presence here's a sound we associate with prison [noise]\nHeavy steel door hanging shot [noise]\nThese are the doors at the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women\nBut once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it\nThere are no more heavy steel doors for the women and that's not a family here\nBecause this prison is new and it's different inside the razor wire this place looks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from Don in town desk depending on what level there and that's the warden show Tom showing us around and do what we do that in the community is when I was parked outside and our yard with ... and I guess it's still a\nPrison the warned as the first the point that out and prisons are still harsh places in some ways women's prisons are specially harsh\nBecause across the country women get discipline that higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rules they're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch with NPR in ... school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infractions ... big consequences\nWomen get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges that matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today they could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had a copy stain I have one\nThe word and show dumb in two thousand six teams aren't data found women at this prison compared to men of other presidents were three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive now ... corrections officers to give out fewer tickets for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform\nIt was written for men's prison were assured inside out or squeeze rolled up might signal\nFor men's prison were assured inside out or sleeves rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it's just women want to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nNominate putting in place to practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison\nEvery corrections officers being trained that women take different pass the person they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing the rules so especially about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance Latin\nTell me about that one [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOn the mental health ward Stacey runner is in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with a slate gray coat wonders an

meant to be punished once\nShe was sick and statement or sell through breakfast another prisoner brought up and down up from the dining hall and put a fire pillow so is asleep when the crime happened [laughter]\n... got punished for that banana\nPossession of stolen item yeah that was pretty rough that wouldn't\nBe a violation today but back then wonder says she lost good conduct credits those were days taken off are sentenced for good behavior and she lost privileges she couldn't buy things from the commissary\nWonder a serving time per second degree murder now she says the change in the way women are treated here help to grow she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nI'm trying to contribute as much as I can see institution so I mean that's a shame you know and it has helped me with my own my own shame them I don't regret\nThe psychiatric unit and the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about the large common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV's a carton and lots of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now\nDr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nToo so they're forced those here and then friends\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's prisons several years ago he quit a psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chained for months at a time in the basement sold his property\nVictims of satanic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison that long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search\nWomen can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dump the warden\nLets say correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker at a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome to change and discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe Warren has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought for which some concerns and what she said is you know ordinary people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there is one of you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get the Ninety six cannot cash problems\nDom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down\nAnd it's the one other place in the prison with heavy metal doors\nThe building is dark and deserted now closed four years ago there are four parts of cells a guard would watch separated from a station above when women with mental illness lived here they would often yell into the night\nThis is what prison cells today across the country you really look like for women or men\nUD humanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into a room that [noise]\nStripped them of all\nTheir senses are dignity\nThat gets back to white giving up fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for western fractions often lead the ending up in the cell block like this one Joseph Shapiro\nNPR News\nLaura how women running prisons are making a

Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with my ...\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person or since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both\nBoth and very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first foreign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to Canada or Mexico first ah and he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech\nTo celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\n... it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of criminals portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east\nIt coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about Christmas role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared ... is such a hidden\nGenius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... and about Trump\nOr but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires a influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry and personality pretty much above all\nSo now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it and the secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the ground for us\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion or was one of the White House officials who is reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter could show gee went ... went missing the White House said he and other officials oppressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent uh but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience that it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house\nAnd he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel out to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security shame\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that is not clear as some of these dealings are are not transparent\nBut we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports that Kushner a cushion or a backed or associate it a firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a
