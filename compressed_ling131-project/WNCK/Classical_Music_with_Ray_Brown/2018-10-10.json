vehicles meet the same safety standards as other cars on the road and they never have NPR's Camila Domonoske reports\nAny ordinary passenger cars sold in the U.S has to meet federal safety requirements small buses have different safety rules here's where the limousine loophole comes in if you take a car and modify it stretching it out to fit as many people as a bus you don't have to prove it meets either set of standards\nLimousines are treated almost uniquely or we think about motor vehicles\nJason levine is the executive director of the center for auto safety he says the limos should have their own standards because they're neither ... nor buses\nWhen she started a gym in between the two of them have come up with that thing\nLimos are regulated by a patchwork of state and local rules for instance a largest came into effect in California it requires additional rear exits on stretch limousines a few years ago a bride and four of her friends died when they were trapped in the back of a limo that caught on fire\nThe local limo industry fought hard against the bill crews and find has the c._e._o. of dreading luck a limo company in Southern California he says the cost of the new law was difficult for operators especially those using older Lincoln town car stretches\nThe ritual of these modified Lindsey at the exit can be anywhere from a few thousand dollars up to ten twelve thousand dollars that amount and sometimes I'm the value of some of those lenders\nButtons on day also says he personally with support more safety regulation\nThere should be nationwide certain jumper regulations say make sure that these vehicles are up to date in a certain point\nSome stretch when those are safer than others he says companies can do whole test where a powerful machine ... seats to see if they budge\nIf you get something to force the impact in other words if not when we installed a certain place underneath the vehicle and on the interior of the vehicle\nBut not every company does those tests there are other risks safety experts say limos often lack side impact reinforcement and they don't always have to have enough seatbelts for every passenger you can look for a safe or a limo and find taste as\nSome of the public not share about safety trumps they seem to care about the price\nRose Mary Shay hand as the president of consumers for auto reliability and safety she says the owners shouldn't be on customers to figure out if a limo is safe\nI think it's really grossly unfair people say always care about safety I think most people assume that if there and the business that their minimum requirements that they have to me\nOn the federal level there's never been a major push toward regulating limos safety\nAnd twenty Fifteen there was a deadly limo crash on Long Island afterward Senator Chuck Schumer of New York issued a call for a federal agency to investigate such crashes the agency came up with recommendations but the national limousine association

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team at Fifteen Saudis flew into extent all last week drove to the Saudi consulate and then deported that same day on private planes headed for Cairo and goodbye\nAnd this is according to the Washington Post which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudis sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that feed is Fifteen people it's a lot to to to kill an individual and a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said it actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of her rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still\nDon't know but what we are understanding\nIs that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show you not clear whether they wanted to capture and prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way okay let's\nLet's unravel that a little bit the city's U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what what Saudi officials discussing ...\nCorrect is is us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on a show to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia and capture him there I\nThink probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening is stumble could be sort of plan B or for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe\nAt the consulate and then another group that came in after a he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these intercepts I eat it they weren't ... what\nMy sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person has a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis ineffective we said we know which are up to back off at\n... why do you think Shane Harris your source wants you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason\nYour source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I I think there's a real\nConcern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime in Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harmless come to him and there's a real concerned about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups in Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a who to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard of it he replaced the sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership in Saudi Arabia\nWhen you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely jerk ... have been some honor NBS says he sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other in a number of occasions and there's a personal bond there that is translating into policy\nAs the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks Brett\nKavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hoped for to weaken or overturn roe v Wade that's the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports\nThe Supreme Court can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade

swearing in we were talking about starting to get together and think about you know that the best cases and therefore I can sit in front of the court\nSeveral state laws severely restricting abortion are already making their way through the court system including one from Iowa that would ban the procedure as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected often before a woman do she's pregnant\nKavanaugh is replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy who was often the swing vote on abortion and other contentious issues\nSo advocates on both sides are watching to see how much the new court is willing to restrict abortion Planned Parenthood executive vice president Don McGahn says in some ways the last several years have been a training ground for what could be coming she says many states have passed laws that force women to go to great lengths to get abortions\nAlready women across this country half to access funding they have to access transportation they have to access housing that have to access support networks that is going to be a greater need\nIf they're further restrictions when row is attacked by this\nCourt those efforts will now be supersized ... says she says Planned Parenthood will lobbies state legislatures to strengthen protections for abortion rights and expand services in states with more liberal laws\nDr any Whittaker is medical director at Planned Parenthood of Illinois she's expecting to see more women coming from more restrictive states across the Midwest\nWe know that we're going to need an ironclad network estates and providers across the country or abortion will still illegal and accessible no matter what happens on the Supreme Court\nIn the past two years the organization has expanded surgical abortion services from two to five locations in Illinois nationwide Planned Parenthood also will work to increase access to medication abortion and use technology to connect women with information about where they can get the procedure\nBoth sides are also preparing for the midterm elections next month the abortion rights group ... pro Choice America has launched a million dollar ad by telling supporters to vote out Republican candidates this November this that opens with an image of Kavanaugh's face\nRight now women are wondering\nMay rallies also launching a separate campaign to educate suburban women in eight
