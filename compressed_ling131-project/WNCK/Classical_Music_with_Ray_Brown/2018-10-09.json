that goes well beyond sexual harassment you want it to cover discrimination and harassment based upon any protected category not just sexual harassment\nThe law does not require the state to monitor for compliance or for businesses to show that they've completed the employee training but ... says that does not mean employers won't face consequences if they don't follow through\nIf they do and the
