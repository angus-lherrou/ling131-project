national unemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge trend around here in Michigan the rate was close to a Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest land under one roof there was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nIt's emotional yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear it today\nA sick I get sick sick me just the word or just see it on a freeway on the way here and\nYeah it was a lot and it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of a local union chapter and that made him one of the last\nPeople to leave it was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a\nDark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way into\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall and\nNow at age sixty helps maintain a private\nIt took a buyout\nNow at age sixty helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in a suburb\nOf fall here yeah very elevated he writes a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry the days are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nI'm not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people always great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck [noise] current workplace policies at eighty so you're good today Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes\nLittle bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year the\n... after she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the healthcare field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant closed ... did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent used to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independents again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the word family that you had at willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position you're in today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\n[noise] I'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gives me kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when he retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that but I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and\nStuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot\nPeyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen do you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know I feel I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and doing all that you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but that was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were\nConcerts are running [laughter]\nThose are fireworks going off overhead at wired nights hair haunted thrill heart\nPeyton runs around in a full body costume all night with seaweed dripping off Nakhle to face [noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did at willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself of seems like a fantasy world or something in an area the current owners invited us into take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down this is his first time inside the gate since that day\n[noise] drugs they him six hurting the freeway we enter\nOur tour guide is Jeff Rupp he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility the site formerly known as willow run is now a place where people test autonomous vehicles driverless cars Don Skidmore seems shaken revisiting has passed\nI don't know if you remember this this little circle Dr ... office buildings right there yeah so we\nWe left it\nLike the trees like the leaves on the street\nIs kinda cool kind of eerie and go\nYou know I remember when it was real it's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up what used to be the front entrance to the plant it's now cut off from the public Skidmore gets out of the car he stands on the ground where he used to lead union members picketing\nTraffic jams fog in our in\nMouth cars are driving by themselves crazy
