Peter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nWe're going to be next to someone that skeptical of those Saudi and Turkish efforts to investigate ... death skeptical that the Saudis are likely to carry out a thorough and transparent investigation of themselves\nHe's David Cay he's the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion and expression\nWhich means he's tasked with protecting those rights around the world David Cay once the UN to launch an independent international investigation and he joins me now to talk about it David Cay welcome thank you it's good to be her\nWalk me through how this war to war court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate ... disappearance and perhaps murder\nYou know it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before\nWe've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts about maybe led by a former prosecutor\nAnd they could evaluate the evidence they should get access to the ... they should get access to whatever turkey has and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it\nPretty quickly I think and we're talking a team of what size roughly theoretically theoretically maximum five people [noise]\nI'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work 'cause she'll she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago we said the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's out the Saudi consulate\nAre you confident you would get access to the police as you need to go to people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation it's\nI mean it's a great question of course\nWith you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general the Saudi consul general's house getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access\nTo the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leading to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the Turks to hand over everything they say they have\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen and then\nWhat happens at the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever you find\nOf course they couldn't ignore it I think that would be um something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis\nAre there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think is a credible independent investigation something that the Saudis can't do because they can't investigate themselves the U.S\nEvidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting a the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible it'd be independent and then it would be up to states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with\nA simply reports in the press and ideas of the Saudis blaming somebody and and the government and it seems that\nThe U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not that's not a credible investigation\n[noise] so you say you can do this you say you want to do this why isn't happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question\nI mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around this the human rights

doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen they know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised a tour immigrants from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and the opportunity I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask Rivero if he thinks the Republican Party's position

want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now this\nSounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is that I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans were trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of or soda I Can't be in control of

if somebody's taking it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few

somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I mean there's so much more to what he's doing and being a champion from

cross the border and cross that bridge\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what they were requesting is from Mexico to let them and as asylum seekers in so many of them say we are not going to lead the Brits were going to block the bridge into Mexico\nLactose and given the clashes that Mexico has totally closed the border or you know I tried to get back into
