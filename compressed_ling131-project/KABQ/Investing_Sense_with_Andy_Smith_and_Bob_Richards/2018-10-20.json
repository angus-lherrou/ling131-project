Saudi Arabia has finally admitted that Washington Post columnist and Saudi Government critic ... was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey earlier this month\nAnd my mother didn't want to believe me um but that sat me down with the other now adult party who immediately started crying and had had to admit it and then\nUm I was an adult\nOnly to find out that the same thing had been happening to my little sister and I didn't know that until it was an adult\nAnd that's what I'm trying to when you hear these things or successive it's not just one victim it's many it's the the refrain I often use of what we allow will continue continues escalates they find new victims so when Dr Blass before I was speaking I knew there was a ...\nJulie sledding knew there was somebody else yeah\nBut you said was her period you said that they believed you but didn't believe that it was at a ... that it was\nThe other members of my family look me in the eye and said you know as an adult I remember everything I was ten I'm just like her I couldn't tell you what day it was given what Sam\nIf it was fall spring summer it was in a shed I can tell you what he was wearing blue jeans you know I can tell you what it looked like to see white substance on my stomach and think I'd broken something and I didn't know what that was you know as a ten year old girl and\nI can tell you the word you're a dirty girl you're a dirty girl in my ear over and over and what that stumped me for the rest of my life\nAnd when I told my other family members they said well I Believe your telling the truth but I don't believe it's him I Can't believe it's the person that I don't want to either hand yeah her saying that you're telling me because they can't handle that\nWell that's what this was so egregious people react in so much to this Catherine that you're just another layer of disgusting that it's a woman that it was Susan Collins who who gave cover to all these these men and the Republican Party when she said this\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh was her essay and one so I Do believe that she was assaulted I don't know by home and I'm not certain went but I Do not believe that he was the U.S and so\nOf course not because that's who you know happens to be your nominee for the Supreme Court so it couldn't have been him and his face is what\nFive inches seven inches from hers she knows exactly who that yeah it really does look at you and she knows all the obviously the friends and obviously when they're prosecutor was getting to July first the date on his stupid calendar that had all those names on it I mean\nThe fact that she would be mistaken when she told how many other people extend briefly before he was ever\nNominated I mean it's just I\nYeah I yeah I ... I couldn't watch her whole speech I was like ... it just all currently there's a lot of women who've been raped or attempted rape or molested but there's just no men that do this yeah that's that is the dividing line all the men are in a sense of this and this\nPart that she believes him about really he's port perjured himself how many times but she believes in about ...\nI Do not believe that threat Kavanaugh will overturn presidents are all the time\nThey aren't over turned off the tower there and listen to the Sanders said he put four at the end of his conversation with me and also I ... in the hearing he says for president along a tablet precedents like road to be overturned\nIt would have to have been gravy a slave wrong and deeply and consistent\n[noise] okay so uh we can by the way in a sort of the question can we stay mad for two years Oh yes we can she's not up to ... when he would obviously ambassador Susan Rice expressed in Twitter went crazy she expressed interest but\nUm it's an upgrade your upgrading your seasons right there yes exactly exactly\n\nYou're losing ...\nWe're\n\nWere talking last week I don't know if you saw you heard of ... go off on Kellyanne Conway but\nThere is something that you're right about whether to Susan Collins or the Kellyanne Conway the Sarah Huckabee Sanders that you go wow you are willing to really just this rate the sisterhood in the service of these awful men mhm\nRight I mean and and kind of like ... again I Know that it almost felt like a trap because you go oh you're supposed to believe women because Mika was kind of calling Kellyanne Conway out for just like sort of casually slipping in that she was a victim\nBut then like she's like no you have the courage to tell your story like Dr Ford did don't just throw that out is because now you can't be criticized because you're you know\nI mean she went on in the same sentence to say I was a victim women to blame women\nYou know you need to be responsible for their own blah blah blah well\nIt's something I tweeted recently it's Ninety to Ninety eight percent of all rapes accusations are claims are true it's the same statistic as any other time\nThere is no suddenly they're all mine and that's what they want you to believe so that means yeah if you're\nWhich by the way it look what's happened to these women who are obviously credible and have cooperates\nWhen does it have been treated and you know someone's tweeted never ask again why women don't report\nThat think that the truth of it is that we white women have to recognize as Trump wasn't an anomaly white women for decades have voted Republican and they're going to stand by a white man\nAnd go you're seeing that right now women of color a liberal feminists have always said this that the white women are first\nA a barrier to getting equality and ticketing fairness and being believe because they will stand by racism and white man's first degree of saying he's lying if not him that whole discuss things get Trump that you know about the\nMother or grandmother mother I'd been unfairly mom mom what am I going to do like you know just before\nAgain as you say this what is it two percent of it meant like there's some math you know rash of of men being accused unfairly I mean it's just it's a\nYeah okay so uh Kellyanne Conway\nThere are many people in this country who are thrilled that it's a President Trump and not president the person who lost the election last time putting these justices on the United States Supreme court so we can get back to the constitution\nAnd its four corners having said that and senator Collins again I go this in her speech justice Kavanaugh justice cabin all I Love that\nSaid during his testimony that he believes roe versus Wade is a federal law\nPlease write he wouldn't be on this list if ... if you was not going to overturn roe v Wade I mean it's just it's\nYou know what kills me is you don't like rich white Republicans know that they're still gonna be able to afford to get the oceans but their mistresses you know and it it it's poor women of course that will do that I had the hypotheses speak of is not going to and I think what people have to recognize as\nI keep hearing the system's broken this proves it I said the system was working exactly as it was designed by white right conservative met\nIt worked perfectly they got cabinet he will control women's bodies you will control whether Trump has brought down or not he will do exactly what they want it the system worked for them and I designed it to work that way um [noise]\nAre have been raised to believe is there's yeah take a woman they will take a seat and even the way he [noise]\nGreat he uh he drunk Donald who's a drunk TV what do you need ... ... talk about I mean again that people's lives are are being talked about is if it's a game ... level the playing field you know them talking about this like a like a when you know I'm curious\nWhat what was it they got you just have it from your worst strength about her and\nFight for Kavanaugh at that point\nWell there are a lot of things happening or correct they were true and there were a lot of like that were left unsaid and I thought I had to even the playing field because it was very unfair to\nJudge now I can you know very nicely said justice ... right it was a very unfair situation do I even the playing field at once that started this tale through it was very very unfairly didn't\n[noise] level the playing field [noise] end zone dance quite the clip on yeah I mean just [noise]\nThe way they talk about it just makes it even worse that when it pretty soon we're going to have to take selfies and then the lower attempted rape excuse me I just have to take a photo of second we need some ... here but this year but I don't mind yeah exactly Mike in Chicago real quick hello Mike\nHead on my good on ... ten seconds\nI Am working for a year old girl\nWould have to talk of so [noise]

album Egypt vision then of course some discussion about it a little band called the ... we were a few years when we were playing music or radio present in the studio check it out\nWhy a lot of people

other fantastic activists Jennifer ... Addison a president code executive director of the center for popular democracy she was there right at springboard are protesting right or a witness firsthand experience yeah\nI'm In God Bless all those women um and I love we can talk to Jen in just a second year but she said we were saying look us in the eyes actually have a conversation with us and that was so powerful about that uh that elevator tape when Jeff Flake and they don't look at the ground look at me you know I mean that that's\nThat's like this whole conversation stop averting your eyes from this it doesn't make it a go away or Jennifer s Edison joins us now hello Jen\nHello thank you so much for having me can I just say you would actually save my life many times when I was in law school I have to commute from Adam in Milwaukee or from Milwaukee about it\nAll all and I would listen to your show me away the key me awake during that drive so I have to say thank you for keeping me alive\nO fart jokes keeping you alive God Bless you ... ... you know you posted\nThis on Facebook which I Love you said oh no people who keep babies in cages\nA could care less when innocent black people are murdered in mock sexual assault survivors don't like our protest tactics I guess we should just smile and say please nicely maybe them they'll decide to overthrow patriarchy in white supremacy\nOr we must stop immediately because it turns out voters and Republican strongholds don't like it when we raise our voices Neal at sporting events tell our stories of survival are generally exist so we must stop doing all this immediately so it was not to offend said Republicans\nUm you're absolutely right I mean have they ever read a book about the history of protests [laughter] yeah in this country\nSometimes I Wonder if they have and then I have to remember that these are all kinds of little toxic to run by a and in theory there is evidence that a\nDemocrat doing the same thing as saying we're going to go after our base those who believe in a true democracy those who the the power and you know a truth right the multi racial society we're going to go after those boat\nFor some reason there are a number of Democrats who think our past that power is going to find people who have never vote for Democrats before or who only tried at one time instead of that can that be an energizing them that we know that actually went back to our country\nThis lifted infuriated you are even more than me listening to Mitch McConnell said this take\nA look I mean they have been a for all of us we should have been under assault and everybody decided to stand up to the mall you know that\nThey're not being terminated bothers people I'm just couldn't be prouder among members for refusing to roll over on her all of this shouldn't come shore pressure always loved\n[noise] um so this is they didn't they didn't call the people in Charlottesville a mob the angry Nazis with torches women trying to speak their truth and trying to be heard I mean you probably saw the tape of a Orrin Hatch like literally with his hand like chewing women away and saying you know grow up\nI mean it it's hard to imagine them making it worse but somehow they have on every level of ...\nMean like I was there [noise] you know George Wallace was set up protesters and history of thought to be completely on the wrong side and it will do that but he bought Connell and these\nTo Republicans as well but let's be clear that they are fundamentally lying these women are not us all take than it used that language about survivors of actual sexual assault is Scott Scott thing\nYeah they're they're ... they're rich white men to control all three branches of government but somehow there the the uh the aggrieved party here they're the victims\nAnd we you know this is what we want to encourage people to do I know the country with food when they saw on a Maria\nOdds and Maria Gallagher in that elevator talking to Jeff Flake but what folks who understand is that there were hundreds of other women who have taken that exact same type of action maybe not in an elevator and maybe in a stairwell in a hallway at an airport at a coffee shop in front of people's houses that\nHundreds of women had taken that accent a bird dog before it ever went viral with ana Maria Maria\nAnd so you know we are really encouraging people to make their voice heard that you know we made thousands of called people showed up at ... miles to try to have a meeting with their senator and they would not eat with us they would not answer calls they were giving their constituents to run around\nAnd that was a tactic in that they just life because it forces them to actually see their position\nWe'll turn their back on sexual assault survivors when Senator Purdue ran away from ... in an airport in winning hit it in a men's bathroom\nHe was probably sexual assault survivors that he didn't care about their assaults and that he would not pull this fan or any other man accountable for it so you know that's why they didn't like it that's why they try to discredit it because\nYou know they decided to be public servants and then they didn't like what the people in the public actually wanted them to be accountable for their accent\nYeah I mean ... ... they work for us and the fact that they don't even know how to just how the human conversation with someone and listen\nRight I mean just ... yeah I I mean we were talking about this clip did you see this clip of luring room in the southern ... bag on Fox News they're literally having beers and trying to take a selfie to celebrate you know getting the current attempted rape is on the on the Supreme Court and he falls on his house\nShe just completely doesn't acknowledge it",
