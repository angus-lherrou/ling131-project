toll from hurricane Michael has now reached Seventeen correspondent Omar humane as easy in Mexico Beach Florida but now wiped out town with a hurricane first made landfall on Wednesday\nAnd my mother didn't want to believe me um but that sat me down with the other now adult party who immediately started crying and had had to admit it and then um I was an adult\nOnly to find out that the same thing had been happening to my little sister and I didn't know that until it was an adult\nAnd that's what I'm trying when you hear these things or successive it's not just one victim it's many it's the refrain I often use of what we allow will continue might continue to escalate they find new victims that when Dr Blass before I was speaking I knew there was a ... or a\nJewish wedding knew there was somebody else yeah\nBut you said was her period you said that they believe you but didn't yet believe that it was at a ... that it was\nYet the other members of my family look me in the eye and said you know as an adult I remember everything I was ten I'm just like her I couldn't tell you what day it was even what them\nIf it was fall spring summer it was in a shed I can tell you what he was wearing blue jeans you know I can tell you what it looked like to see white that's been on my stomach and think I'd broken something and I didn't know what that was you know as a ten year old girl and\nI can tell you the word you're a dirty girl you're a dirty girl in my ear over and over and what that stuns me for the rest of my life and when I told my other family members they said well\nI Believe your telling the truth but I don't believe it's him I Can't believe it's the person that I don't want to be the one hand yeah her son that you're telling me because they can't\nHandle that well that's what this was so agree just people react to so much to this Catherine that it was just another layer of of disgusting that it's a woman that it was Susan Collins who who gave cover to all these these men and the Republican Party when she said this\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh was her assailant [noise] so I Do believe that she was assaulted I don't know by home and I'm not certain went but I Do not believe that he was the of\nCourse not because that's who you know happens to be your nominee for\nThe Supreme Court so it couldn't have been him and his face is what five inches seven inches from hers she knows exactly who that yeah he knows where I look at you and she knows all the obviously the friends and obviously when they're prosecutor was getting to July first date on his stupid calendar that had all those names on it I mean\nThe fact that she would be mistaken when she told how many other people extend briefly before he was ever nominated\nI mean it just I yeah I yeah I ... I couldn't watch her whole speech I was like ... it is apparently there's a lot of\nWomen who've been raped or attempted rape or molested but there's just no men that do this yeah that that is the dividing line all the men are innocent of this and this\nPart she believes him about really he's port perjured himself how many times but she believes in about ...\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh will overturn presidents ... are all the time\nThey aren't that overturned all the time or there and listen to the standards that he put forward getting his conversation with me and also a ... in the here and he says for president a long established precedent like road to be overturned\nIt would have to have been gravy ethically wrong and deeply and consistent\n[noise] okay so uh we can by the way in a sort of the question can we stay mad for two years Oh yes we can she's not up to twenty twenty would obviously ambassador Susan Rice expressed in Twitter went crazy she expressed interest but um\nIt's an upgrade your upgrading your seasons right there yes exactly exactly\n\n... we\n\nWere talking last week I don't know if you saw you heard me could present ski go off on Kellyanne Conway but\nThere was something but you're right about whether it's Susan Collins or the Kellyanne Conway or the Sarah Huckabee Sanders that you go wow you are willing to really just this rate the sisterhood in the service of these awful men mhm\nRight I mean and and kind of like ... again I Know that it almost felt like a trap because you go oh so you're supposed to believe women because Mika was kind of calling Kellyanne Conway out for just like sort of casually slipping in that she was a victim\nBut then like she's like no you have the courage to tell your story like Dr boarded don't just throw that out is because now you can't be criticized because you're you know\nI mean she went on in the same sentence to say I was a victim women to blame women you know you need to be responsible for their own\nBlah blah blah but\nIt's something I tweeted recently it's Ninety to Ninety eight percent of all rapes accusations are claims are true it's the same statistic as any other yeah right\nThere is no suddenly they're all mine and that's what they want you to believe so that means yeah if you're\nWhich by the way it look what's happened to these women right who are obviously credible and have cooperating witnesses they've been treated and you know someone's tweeted never ask again why women don't report that I think that the truth of it\nIs that we white women have to recognize as Trump wasn't an anomaly white women for decades have voted Republican and they're going to stand by a white man\nAnd go you're seeing that right now women of color a liberal feminists have always said this that the white women are first a a barrier to getting equality and ticketing fairness and being believe because they will stand by racism and white man's first degree of saying he's lying if not him that whole\nDiscuss things get Trump that you know about the mother or father or mother I'd been unfairly ... mom mom what am I going to do like you know just before again as you say this what is it two percent of it meant like there's some math you know rash of of men being accused unfairly I mean it's just it's a\nYeah okay so uh Kellyanne Conway\nOh there are many people in this country who are thrilled that it's a President Trump and not president the person who lost the election last time putting these justices on the United States Supreme court so we can get back to the constitution\nAnd its four corners having said that and senator Collins again after this and her speech justice Kavanaugh justice Cavanaugh I Love that\nSaid during his testimony that he believes roe versus Wade is a federal law\n[noise] please write he wouldn't be on this list if ... if he was not going to overturn roe v Wade I mean it's just it's [noise]\nYou know what kills me is you know like rich white Republicans know that they're still gonna be able to afford to get on the oceans but their mistresses you know and it ... it's poor women of course that will do that I had the hypotheses speak of is not going to and I think what people have to recognize as\nI keep hearing the system's broken this proves that I said the system was working exactly as it was designed by white right conservative men it worked perfectly\nThey got cabinet he will control women's bodies he will control whether Trump has brought down or not he will do exactly what they want it the system worked for them and I designed it to work that way um [noise]\nThis is what the rhetoric they always uses it stuff like this company that Conway said\nTo be pro choice in two thousand eight teams that your first sex selection abortion they refer late term abortion taxpayer funded abortion abortion after ... we're going to budge on account of course I they they can feel you were talking about is the issue here which that's way way will be over ... what I keep [noise]\nShe just filibusters over and over right it just I you know you're just lift all these things that are ... ... yeah not happening right extreme okay here we go\nPeople are going to look at state law the circuit law and they're not going to look at issues like late term abortion they're going to look at sex selection of Washington there's certainly going to look at abortion after a nonpartisan scientist Dr say a seniors can feel pain\nThis whole matter on the left of abortion anytime anyone anywhere on demand with absolutely no commonsense applied to it was\nRight that we were all four is just to drive through abortions under barely get them with fries yeah mhm\n[noise] what did you read that whole articles saying that\nAbortion is a hundred percent the males\nCaused by men it would allow you to flee written yeah yeah a hundred percent of abortions either cause or the fault of men yeah yeah All right well let's just all just\nYou know what let's just walk back and forth and we finally [noise] because I could write you know\nNo bouquet aren't a Ninety minutes after the hour Catholics UGA you

Edison joins us now hello Jen\nHello thank you so much for having me can I just say you would actually save my life\nMany times when I was in law school I have to commute from Adam in Milwaukee or from Milwaukee Nevada for school and I would listen to your show in the way they keep me awake during that drive so I have to say thank you for keeping me alive\nO fart jokes keeping you alive God Bless you [laughter] you on that you posted\nThis on Facebook which I Love you said oh no people who keep babies in cages\nOr could care less when innocent black people are murdered in mock sexual assault survivors don't like our protest tactics I guess we should just smile and say please nicely maybe them they'll decide to overthrow patriarchy in white supremacy\nOr we must stop immediately because it turns out voters and Republican strongholds don't like it when we raise our voices Neal at sporting events tell our stories of survival are generally exist so we must stop doing all this immediately so it was not to offend said Republicans um\nYou're absolutely right I mean have they ever read a book about the history of protest [laughter] yeah in this country\nSometimes I Wonder if they have and then I have to remember that these are all kinds of tactics to run by a in theory there is evidence that a\nDemocrat doing the same thing as saying we're going to go after our base those who believe that a true democracy those who the the power and you know a true the rise the multi racial society we're going to go after those boat\nFor some reason there are a number of Democrats who think our past the power is going to find people who have never vote for Democrats before or who only tried at one time and that is that could that faith and energizing them that we know that actually went back to our country\nThis must have infuriated you are even more than me listening to Mitch McConnell said this to take\nA look I mean they've been up for all of us who have been under assault and everybody just showed up to the mall be noted on\nBeing terminated bothers people I'm just couldn't be prouder among members for refusing to roll over on her all of the nation ... pressure always loved\n[noise] um so this is they didn't they didn't call the people in Charlottesville a mob the angry Nazis with torches women trying to speak their truth and trying to be heard I mean you probably saw the tape of a Orrin Hatch literally with his hand like chewing women away and saying you know grow up\nI mean it's hard to imagine them making it worse but somehow they have on every level have ...\nI mean like I was there [noise]\nYou know George Wallace was set up for protesters\nAnd history of thought to be completely on the wrong side and it will do it with a buck on oil and these cowardice Republicans as well but let's be clear that they are fundamentally like these women are not us all take that and use that lake with about survivors of sexual assault it's got this kind of thing\nYeah they're they're ... they're rich white men to control all three branches of government but somehow there the the uh the aggrieved party here they're the victims\nAnd we you know that's what we want to encourage people to do I know the country was ... when they saw on a Maria\nOdd and Maria Gallagher in that elevator talking to death lake but what folks under they are is that there were hundreds of other women who have taken that exact same type of accident maybe not in an elevator baby in a stairwell in a hallway at an airport at a coffee shop in front of people's houses that\nHundreds of women had taken that act a bird dog ate before it ever went viral with ana Maria Maria\nAnd so you know we're really encouraging people to make their voice heart you know we made thousands of called people showed up at least ... miles to try to have a meeting with their senator and they would not eat with us they would not answer calls they were giving their constituents to run around and that was a tactic in\nThey just life because it worth it to ... they are putting this\nWe turn their back on sexual assault survivors when Senator Purdue ran away from ... in an airport in winning it in a men's bathroom ... probably sexual assault survivors that he didn't care about their assaults and that he would not vote this ban or any other mad accountable for it so you know\nThat's why they didn't like it that's why they tried it and credit because\nYou know they fight it can be public servants and then they didn't like what the people in the public actually wanted them to be accountable for their act\nYeah I mean ... ... they work for us and the fact that they don't even know how to just have a human conversation with someone and listen\nRight I mean just yeah I I I mean we were talking about this clip did you see this clip Lauryn grim and the southern ... bag on Fox News they're literally having beers and trying to take a selfie to celebrate you know getting the current attempted rapist on the on the Supreme Court and he falls on his house\nShe just completely doesn't acknowledge it", "show_name": "Investing Sense with Andy Smith and Bob
