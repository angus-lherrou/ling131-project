back to the phones me go with Nick and Oakville, Washington editor Nick\nHow are you I'm good what's going on [noise]\nUm I've been looking into some a money making apples um the ones where you can earn money watching movies and TV shows or share your online shopping received so\nI'm Wondering if these are legitimate abs or if they are or you may be inviting trouble phone New Delhi and possibly viruses are now where\nAre you know it's all those are all really good question um how much money are you trying to make or would you like to make\nA statement you know on a book extra months\nHere it's it's not like you're like OK I Need to make a thousand dollars for two thousand dollars for anything that you know some of the ap she mentioned like swag bucks is one that led to watch TV Shop kick is the one that you know let you cumulative points for shopping\nUh there's I poll this way it's something that allows you to take surveys a Google also has their opinion out that will pay you one dollar per survey\nYou know if you wanted to make like\nA couple of hundred bucks a month that may be the way I was in costs go a couple of weeks ago and I had a put TaskRabbit on my phone 'cause

took a picture and sent it off through the ... and then I made like seven bucks my foot that's not bad I mean I'm already here anyway right\nAnd so you know so the way that the absolute illegitimate

card\nOr a gift card to Starbucks um there's also other ones like one's called folk\nF.

repairs finished\nWhat my question is this is my question why my inner part of the company filed a leading just like what I had my ... my attorney\nBecause your heart you know because they have because they have nothing to do is follow lean why the other it's bigger than they have nothing to do with the other insurance company that's paying you\nHad nothing to do with your insurance company not aware of what's happening is that your insurance company is fronting the money and the other side is going to pay and by the way your contract with yours yours companies will front the money up to thirty days\nRight right yeah so now there is no place you can go but the good news so you have to write a check or put it on your credit card but the good news is or the other side will pay for it if it's reasonable as I got two and a half months to repair my car\nUh yeah it took that long in a State Farm insurance which the other drivers are insurance companies they didn't quibble\nDidn't quibble I mean there are adjuster when I saw what was going on understood and uh just wrote the check\nAnd let me tell you it was not cheap ah repairing a a\nBeamer which is why I'm probably going to give up my neighbor ah because I just I mean everything costs a fortune on that core I mean crazy John Hi John welcome hey how you doing yes or on a good\nRestaurant from the older oh about six years ago in orange county and um\nI get up got going eventually you know war it's the best food in town and my next door neighbor want it to buy my restaurant so he gave the contract after about four years of being near the contract they gave me ten thousand dollars down they need a balanced meal within thirty days or you lose your deposit\nHe wanted to verify that I had the right to tell my interests\nUh four Plex and a strip mall okay and and\nHe called the older what you should have done any on a hill with no you can't tell you is the answer is I on the property\nYou know get you on hold on hold on that's that's a bunch of BS you can't sell your interests to someone else is there you have a lease correct\nYeah All right and it is there anything in the least that gives the owner of the property the right to deny new owners from coming in for example they have to well they have to okay you\nKnow then you're fine then this guy's crazy than if he went in and lock the door okay then I couldn't get out oh man do you have a lawsuit against these people\nCall but I I call the cops and they said it was beautiful it couldn't do anything\nYeah it is going to cut costs won't do anything ... there was a civil matter uh you needed a ... ...\n... my dilemma built this was in two thousand and fourteen when they ask me\nHow long were you know long how long were you locked out averages handles to someone else so and so who who sold who owns the restaurant now\nThe owner lived about our own\nHe pretty I understand but who owns the restaurant\nSome little another restaurant and who else in there okay and you never were paid no I never\nGot its time you you have a huge lawsuit interference with contract or wrongful conviction a retaliatory objection I Would go for yeah that's a big deal\nA you've got you've got a a Yeah John yet there's no question the owner to them any right to do that you should have gotten you should've gotten she should have gotten a lawyer the minute you were locked out the minute he said\nNo that moment that you know I don't think so\nUh so I mean there's going to be some argument as to uh you wave your rights you should have come in sooner so it's going to be the the issue is going to be damages a and you're going to argue two years' worth of loss of income and then ... it's a I I don't understand how an owner", "show_name": "Kim Komando Show",
