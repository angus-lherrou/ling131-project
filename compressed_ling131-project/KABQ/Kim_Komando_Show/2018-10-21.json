for keeping the company and my drive home from work you're ... a big question is what probably just went through a pretty nasty divorce and he's got a young son who has an Android throw my brother is an apple so he does a window Android\nAnd he asked for me to research a\nTractor so he knows where his son is when he doesn't have custody\n'cause he's each he's a little concerned that his wife might be ...\nI don't know do various ... okay I get what you want your website and there's a tracker on there it's a free one that ...\nAccording to website it up to ... hours and there was a notation saying that if you wanted to you know paper one there are the ones out there but I couldn't find the other ones that you might work meant well here's the good\nOh no I was gonna say you know so here's the deal is that you know he ... the the sun is going to know about the tracker okay\nAnd at twelve years old it's probably not a bad idea that the sun does know that there's a track or you know there's really no way to unless unless he could actually get the phone and install this tracker on and not have the kid no right\n[noise] I mean that's an issue okay alright that's sad when there's a a depending on the carriers of rising ... do you know who the carrier as\nA ... okay T Mobile has it to 'em\nBecause he's probably paying for the kids' cell phone plan right\nI'm Sorry if he paid for the kids phone okay\nIs that the carriers they also they have something like family located or packages and the ... and it's like ten dollars a month but what I like if it's from the carrier is that not only can he see where the boys that but the boy can see where he's at\n... okay and if the if\nHe had you know his grandparents where he won even in normally you can have up to ten people on a plan\nA a you know and you know there's also glimpse which is also something you might want to look at that but not through the carrier and that's G. L. Y. M. PSA glimpse\nAnd clear glimpse works a lot like find my friends but it works across platforms okay and so I Would look at the tea mobile website look at their family locate her like I said normally it's like ten dollars a month for up to ten phones or whatever\nAnd then you know the boy can also you know the sun can actually have a sense of security that he knows if something does happen with his mom\nThen everybody's close by and he can see exactly and paying somebody and if not look at that glimpse program that glimpse up rather because I think that'll do the trick to and thanks for your call Chris and\nI thanks for letting me keep company there on the way home they right where you are we going to talk about how you can get copies of all the data that apple and Google has on you you're on the ... commando show\nOver the years after that has earned my trust which is why I'm committed user and you'll see what I mean when you experienced the economical absent ego tank forty seven fifty this fantastic Warren was all in one printer it's my partner choice because it's cartridge free\nAnd comes with up to two years I think right in the box enough to print up to eleven thousand collar pages\nThat's the equivalent of thirty a cartridge set the bar in a run to the store and buy thirty cartridge sets it would cost me around Fifteen hundred dollars was ego tank you easily refill the printers ain't tanks and second ego tank is a Compaq space saving printer that's truly cartridge free that's available everywhere\nMore information at ... dot com slash eco tank camp and for a limited time through November first get free overnight shipping when you use to promote called eco tank came I check out when you buy any eco tank printer\nOffer valid within the forty a contiguous states exclusion supplies subject to availability\nSaturday October twenty four hours a day on the radio I check out our vodka I already over here in Studio ... during a brand new episode with the legendary\nOlive Garden me no I'm In ... top selling with Joe ... to talk about his new album angel fish and then of course some discussion about a little band called the ... we were furious when we're playing music or radio print that if I may be a second I don't know\nIt's radio only smart and Dave is Albuquerque progressive town cam Thirteen fifty [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nOr ask you about one of our great sponsors I'm Talking about be prepared dot com it's your one stop solution for emergency food water gear and resources be prepared dot com slash Kim you know what you're going to be ready for anything that's be prepared dot com slash Kim [noise]\nAlright apple has launched a privacy website this past week head over to privacy died apple dot com I Wonder there and get a copy and download that actually there and send you a copy of all the data that they track about you\nIf you use Google and you have the same thing that website is takeout dot Google dot com stay right where you are we have another jam packed fun filled our\nThat she's definitely don't want to miss or on the west are multimedia network\nOr at a start up with money from Tokyo showed off a robot that can pick up toys and can pick up close up the floor and put them in their proper places yes\nThey're going to sell these robots that could clean up put the dirty played\nFor the dishwasher sees objects through built in cameras overtime at wanders around the house takes an inventory of all the household possessions\nOr they say maybe all these robots could help keep the kids entertain so they wouldn't be on the X. box or the pet anymore and I know what you're thinking sure I mean I could totally arid without screen time I could also turned my own butter but let's not get crazier\n[noise] All right if you or someone you know as a reader there's a new kitten do paper white that's out of the big deals as you can now take your Kindle and you can read when you're taking a bath that's right so if you drop it in the water it still works Amazon says the new readers the fitness lightest Kendall paper way to ever\nSix inches three hundred and ... free display or the lighting now ten percent brighter than before and as I mentioned it's waterproof\nIt can be in water for up to an hour at six and a half feet deep it's I.

interesting story over at the wall Street Journal this past week and the title was you want twenty percent for handing me a muffin the awkward\nEtiquette of I had it and I don't know if you've noticed it but I certainly habit wherever you go where somebody choosing square and they're on their eye pad or on their phone is that they want to get tips for just about anything out there have you noticed that Andrew\nI'm so glad that you found this dinner bringing this up this is such a pet peeve for me it's on but I don't want to name a possible I don't out a possible sponsor a future sponsor so I'll just say there's a place it is called but narrow Brett\n[laughter] I'm Talking and code and they have their yesterday [laughter] have amazingly\nDelicious food yes get the Greek salad ... and it's the best out I've ever had but every single time they ask you if you would like to tip the person that is just standing there at the register\nSo because of an era I developed the seven foot ball with that if you have to go farther than seven feet I Will tip you\nWell if you don't [laughter] I Am probably not\nGoing to do that so if you're just taking my credit card right my apple pay my Samsung Pay a farmer's market I bought spinach pasta was twelve dollars for one thing of pasta and they asked they asked for a tip on the app that you tip of course not\nOkay so my hair stylist lovely lovely young woman named Nicole and you know like a lot of hair stylist\nShe she rents her station right\nAnd so this is pretty much her business well it is for this and what I Love about the call is she treats her\nStation like it is a business so she's professional she's on time if I say I need to get my hair done this afternoon show part the water or she'll make it happen in in for somebody her age to have this type of business that came in at something\nShe uses square and to you know when you pay and so you don't go to the front desk or anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent\nSo I told her I said you know I said you've got this all rock and she's like what do you mean and I said you know research has shown that whatever you put it in the middle that's what people are going to tap and\nThere'll be a certain percentage that will that you can guilt them into going to [laughter] you know the third call them which is really the goal of all businesses fail to have people out of more money Seinfeld explained to her I said so you know you're married\nYou got a two and a half year old and a ten month old little pictures up there the kids you know and they are in the rye and they need a new you know they're getting ready for college and their cheek bones we can really hungry or whatever it may be\nA said seriously research has shown so instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty percent or just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent\nSee if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I felt so out of work out she goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and\nSome people are gone like thirty percent\nBut the ... isn't that different though because that industry has a naturally of gratuity\nBut if the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on this great\nSo when you're a bone marrow do you tip yeah really I Do that they keep asking because people like you keep the okay but here's the reason\nWhy gay many many moons ago I worked at ... which is a bar like Houston right and and when\nYou wait tables and I also waited tables and when I was at a a shoe at a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at bat\nSo if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want but a bad but I put in there and drabs okay\nBut sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but

the company that had a and it's a company that is in it's in the spotlight I mean that people know about this company and there was an issue a day and African American who was working there\nAnd I was and it was very obvious that this is the one African American that was their out of two or three people\nWhat they did is they just shut down the entire division and that I literally and said everybody everybody in the division is a shutdown we decided to shut down the division and boom where are you going to go with that or you shut down the division because you are a bunch of racist I Know we\nShut down the division as a as a business decision you see that's the problem that uh you're up against\nAt my performance for better than the three parents but together but that's\nWhat you say that I have proof that okay\nBut he but even so as I say I division part is going to be horrible also because your performance used to be wonderful doesn't mean\nThat she's going to say that you were in subordinate I she doesn't judge said that it has changed I mean those are very very hard cases uh Laura how how's your Hebrew\n[laughter] horrible I see I work on that a lot truly [laughter] All right Laura\nThat yeah I mean it's it used to be where discrimination was\nIt was it was a dead bang when or if you could prove discrimination the court has actually gone the other way in California which was a shocker to me when I heard about the court and because I and also firing someone you can fire someone for any reason let's say you're employed and you're the best\nOne in the division by far proof period\nA you know what I learned when a fire you today I'm your boss I just don't like any more boom you're gone with no rights so uh it gets to be a problem to say the least
