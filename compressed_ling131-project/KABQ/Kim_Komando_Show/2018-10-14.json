advertising in communications professionals this year's event would be your friends like Mars National Geographic envy ... such as\nBox Daily Caller and CNN and speakers one agency such as overhead um in in whatever way if you're a member of the marketing and advertising community there's no better place to further your education and professor\nYou wait for the nation I mean I archive of thirty for thirty\nAre those uh why\n[noise]\nJohn thanks for being with us some real talk nine ten let's take a ride down there Ventura Highway [noise]\nThey normally you you know normally I Would not go down this road [laughter] that I'm about to 'em but I think there's a lesson here you go to a man\nI Know where you go ahead go ahead\nI Know I Know but the ... so I don't think of an elephant this is why would never do this are typically but the con man and Kanye match made in heaven\nNow the reason why I mean the first time that someone sending me messages you got to see this and I I didn't I wasn't near a TV I watch five minutes of the crap and it was five minutes I'll never get back in my life\nOut of the first thing I thought what norm and and and be ready what but one of us from Joe\nWell yeah yeah what the hell is this is a joke is is buried somewhere how about this or you're chipping I worked for you dirty who may get real nice deal wonderful deal I've been doing deal I got it\nWell but that was the thing is it it was so obvious and it was a rare thing actually that's why I'm only mentioning it and here's my um presentation [laughter]\nIt was rare that a youthful idiot used a youthful idiots trying to gain the headlines and and I think some of us felt for nine right now kind of fallen for it in the sense that I just wanted to spotlight fact but here's the thing by letting a racist\nUse a black man use you as a prop and then you know the race something's wrong with this guy\nThere is some of the road this guy is sick this guy is there something wrong with this guy\nYou know what else John this is ridiculous this is ridiculous you know you got a guy who founded for you see any well\nYou know I mean you can't make too strong\nShowing you can make this stuff I mean you can't make this stuff up however ... joking around the side I Do believe and and I'm not look I'm a white guy me and James Taylor I'm an old white guy so the world all of us there were all white guys now\nSo I'm an old white guy anyway to me when I'm observing is that the African American community kinda writ large uh has\nAlready largely discounted in deeply discounted con yang basically saying he's not real he's just you know whatever you do a part of what we got in mind they think they just kind of mentally separated from him he feels he seems to be you know\nI look I don't I don't follow this stuff I'm not target demo I don't have young kids like you do uh but I Know that he's kind\nOf had these breakdowns on stage where he's been supposedly doing a concert and all of us they start talking to change the years not than about his death situation or whatever I mean the guy obviously you know what this does something wrong with the guy he's\nThis guy is sick or something like this guy said\nThis about one more of the labels that needs to be put to rest norm Ninety nine percent of us now means almost all of this reality show people and and the news and all the uh the cable news networks do we use reality t._v. it's not reality to have a TV camera in your face\nEven if it's for a week for however long\nYou have it for the show that's not reality reality is we don't have that in our lives and so we got to stop that because that is a bad label and this guy isn't crazy he's just not\nBash right well John I guess everybody's allowed to live their lives the way they want to live their life within reasonable limits right I mean if you want to be an ax murderer you're not allowed to live your life the way you want to live your life right because we have laws against murder and stuff but if\nKanye West wants to act like a fool Kanye West has the right time like a food absolutely I mean they lie in her absolutely and the fact that Benedict was that like a full well look we we allowed him to be there\nIt if it were up to me and I have you know my little weight on Twitter has been hey why don't we just ignore Kanye and they'll go away and and obviously we can't ignore him and he's not going away because he's been invited to the White House by Benedict Donald and when you get invited to the White House by whoever's in the White House\nThat make the news and the media is going to retire in round so we're just stuck with this guy\nAnd that's the problem is with not guy this guy we're stuck with both of these guys are in a loving the one of those guys Sean does\nOur crime syndicate operate with generally do\nWe can just use them just used them just basically you know\nUse Tanya aid to say the guys obviously if you want to feel sympathy for 'em just ... you know there's something obviously there's something wrong with him or the fact that he has cast in his lot with someone who would ... and early ... send him to the nearest plantation for hard labor\nOr if he wants to act to fool the best and the only thing it seems to me that we can do is say hey everybody looking tiny he's a fool let's not you'll be like that what you and I'd be normal don't wash the stage and steal somebody's microphone away from them when they're experiencing a special moment in their life that's\nNot a nice thing to do don't make that don't do it right don't make that\nLeading to do anything anyway so look ... is I guess he's married to is a she married to Kim ... who's married to alright so that's going to get him in the news anyway I'm going back to ignoring

Tesla's nightmare scenario and announce it they were going to open source their security modules so that all the auto makers could work together for a safer self driving future\nAll right I just hope it when they open source of all they do a better job at that than actually building the cars so governments are trying to get involved to putting controls around these self driving cars or I the D O D can even change the default password on a computer controlling warheads and as far as Tesla's go\nI'd be shocked if they were in business just a few years from now\n[noise] boy I don't tell you there's a lot of self driving car news this past week and you may have heard of wave that is Google self driving taxis right\nAnd it's rolling out across the United states but how they plan to use it is very interesting and I bet nobody has told you this yet about way mo because let's do the math together\nHow does Google make its money anybody yes you and the Ford truck they make a huge chunk of change off of advertising right or companies buying advertising people seeing advertising so put us all together with the self driving taxi\nDo you see the future yet do you envision how it's going to we're All right let's say you go to Google and you search for I don't know fresh Christmas tree up pops in ad for a place five miles away too far to walk too far to carry a tree or on your back but

Microsoft because every day we hear about some crash crazy\nAnd finally as of July twenty ninth team in certain parts of the world all electric cars will need to make a low speed noise by law\nYou see these electric cars are just too quiet right now people can't hear the cars and they're just too many accidents\nAnd for um twenty twenty on they have to be retrofitted with sound generators if there

name\nIt's called the audible vehicle alert system now the sound can be heard and speeds up to twelve miles per hour\nThis before I play the north and tell you a little bit more about\nThe noise is four years in the making\nAnd it was designed specifically to be audible by pedestrians but not heard by anybody inside the car\nAnd this is funny that first the technicians developed a sound that was like they say a size five space craft but they had to shelve it because people when the car was driving by they would look up in the sky rather than at the road so back to the labs they when they came up with a brand new sound\nAnd at the MIT it from a speaker located behind the front and grilled since we heard in every direction so let's take a listen to the sound that the brand new electric jaguars going to make in your neighborhood [noise]\nOh that's it all\nAdds the electric cars going by that's the sound that that the that the researchers say that doesn't sound like a size five space craft or what do you think Andrea ready for that why don't they just make it sound like a car\nLike a V. eight [laughter] [laughter]\nThey can use that one yeah yeah you know what you just can't beat the sound of the eight or bigger race but I mean here we are we're it's still sounds like a spacecraft to make it look enough where's that where's each week I was like a shaver [laughter] I'm not sure

um well\nA little confused um we're traveling to Europe next month and my husband and I both have gone to identity theft so I'm very careful about what I Do and I was reading that I probably should have a\nG. P. N. app so and I'm using public why and I'm Wondering how important is that I researched telling Larry I dunno [laughter] there's good his fat differently is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on me that that's\nAll right well let's start at the very basic okay is that when you're on the public why everything that you do is like traveling right through the airwaves okay so if you are typing in your bank account and your password your Amazon dot com past whatever may be is that anybody can just pluck that out of the year\nSo and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network is going to use all this sophisticated encryption so it's going to scramble it all up to us is traveling in the airwaves you won't be able just pick it out OK okay and so the whole idea behind using the VP an app\nIs that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use\nWhen you are scouting around in Europe where you guys going\nUm we're getting um London, France Amsterdam and Germany oh how fun Oh yes can't wait\nI'm so excited for you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're ... this was like the coolest thing you're going to totally love this to buy when you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or pickled daily square or whatever it may be\nIs that you hold up your phone and augmented reality\nSo you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two\nOh my gosh oh it's so cool\nIt's so cool and then the other thing are ... are you went to like military stuff\nAh my husband is\nOkay there's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to go through them which means most most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had us take like the right cause songs and you know if you could do a food toward any of this has been great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your wine and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so uh so you're right there are all these different VPN those some of them I Can't say on the air 'cause it's like hide your\nWhatever uh then there's Nord VPN and then there's also freedom VPN which they were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of F secure\nAnd it's a public company and this is the VPN that I use than it is free or like for example when I was in London last month and so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a comment that show picks buttons you can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go tell your credit cards that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another app that you need to get its called mobile passport\nYou heard we talk about that I'm no okay you need this app okay just if you don't do anything else cut that out okay All right so you leave the United states you're on your way back okay there's four hundred and fifty people on the plane right right [noise]\nAnd they're all coming down this pipeline all go to go through homeland security\nOr a border patrol\nNow if you have mobile passport on your phone I guarantee you that four hundred and

got word at all and it's got like a couple of letters you know\nOr some some a haiku you know a gang symbol on most you know things like that and the and that's the deal but I think so many of us are

that promise and don't deliver is that what's happening\nAnd that's part of it yeah or I I ended up using a nap or using a program to accomplish the task I get done and I go visit their an easier way to do that\nBy having an example okay we babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday Spanish so I thought it would be cool to make a little book at the end of the summer that said here's what I did at grandma's house on Tuesday surf act\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in check it ended up being thirty five pages long and about ... to sixty photos but it was a short it was really hard isn't there a publishing program that maybe could help me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now\nThere it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nA there are sites like ours that will do round up some say you know here at ten great photo apps but we would only hit ten of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available\nI see if you're looking for a particular app you can always read the the reviews people are brutally honest about what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew a you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yes we're shuttle flight you shutter flies\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that they use these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nOne of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book no yes and we got it and cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word ... called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know and no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular apps that only does one task is that you might want to look at okay uh what is it is John right out of work and work with photos maybe the photo science will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form at those pages and getting that done\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kinda fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you created the animated book that that your kids really love yes\nAnd we I sent them real pictures may we communicated back and forth on five or ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the Web site called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to come to take months to make those animation\nAnd so so and so the next time you have a task put in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh call us okay\nOkay [laughter] okay I mean that's why we're here and or\nDrop me a note through the website and I know this sounds crazy and a lot of people don't believe me but I Do I read every single know that you send me through the website\nAnd I've got a system I've done it for many years and when you send me your question things that you want to accomplish we will use that as content\nAt for a tip or a cool site or an app review or whatever it may be over a commander dot com or you could just call it give us a call to the show and pure Kim's club member by the way you always get priority calling and you can join comes club right now\nOver at get Kim Dotcom stay right where you are big security alert I Need to tell you about what Web cams that's spreading like crazy across the United states you're on the came commando show [noise]\nWith more and more of our lives are moving on my intrusion into our privacy can have devastating consequences one great way to secure your privacy so you can have their freedom to be anonymous and on traceable online is to use what's called a VPN it stands for virtual private network\nWhen choosing a VPN you really need to trust the company running it\nAnd I recommend ... freedom VPN F secure as a publicly lifted company they have this Thirty Years' spotless track record of protecting its customer security and privacy it's so easy to use and it's really easy to set up you'll be up and running in just a few minutes\nF secure even let you try for free for five days no sign up no credit card details required\nYou can trust as the cure to protect your privacy and to keep you anonymous and untraceable online or to your freedom vps\nNow and get twenty percent off when you use discount go camp visit F dash secure dot com slash camp that's F dash secure dot com slash camp [laughter]\nSaturday I don't wear their pants wants new today on the radio a radio silver and fear and we've\nAnd like our our ... perfect for decorating the house or just studying the dairy mood our pumpkins by the pilot as Joe ... with the labor in my life and we've got about ... everyone's talking about like the fantasy football or soccer\nJak Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite station\nCompelling content on the\nAnd\nI are the worst thing shows and brought to buy be prepared dot com slash cam you're one step solution for emergency food water gear and resources\nThen be prepared dot com slash Kim and be ready for anything once again that's be prepared dot com slash Kim [noise] All right there about nine million Web cams and security cans that are just wide open to attack\nAnd I want you to make sure that yours is not on the list a there's a company called ... among guy that's the ... that\nThe company who makes all these Web devices and security cameras but guess what\nThat's not going to be the name on the Web cam or their security can because they make tons of Web cams for all kinds of companies but basically what's happening\nIs that these Web cams and security cams are so accessible that if you change into\nFall password somebody can still break in and if in case you want to see if you're a webcam security cameras on the list it over to commanded outcome of course that's K.

an hour now does it matter as a matter that a lawyer has absolutely no experience and doesn't even know how to spell elder law I don't you don't care for the lawyer has nowhere Marion son and I

know that Mary well why don't you can have a problem is I Would never I don't have the skills that to write an appeal\nI Would never dream of writing an appeal I just don't have that skill set\nThat's right I Want it so but you want someone with no skills said just because they are best square behind their name\nWell it's better than we are well no it's not better than you alone I'm telling you you are more invested in this you have more experience in this then that lawyer does or you want to press\nJust because someone has Esquire behind their name\nThat means nothing well maybe mean something\nBut uh not a whole lot so anyway it's fascinating how people are impressed with lawyers are never get that\nAll right I agree\nThere you go high ivory welcome to handle on law we're going to do for you\nAll right um I took out a two year warranty contract with the term my company and [noise]\nAnd and that was in two thousand six to ... thousand Seventeen I started noticing that my would wish tripping on the corner of my house yeah and I don't know what they were turned my findings I called the representative that initially treated my own and his dog for a couple of months\nI finally called the the main office and explain to them what was happening and that my front porch and my own\nThey sent their representative out exterminated again and did another aspects and told me that I now have subterranean termites\nSo he says you can get an extended warn the mind you I was still under the contract of the ... but he had seen what what's going on underneath my house and he had written which I didn't notice what repair excluded\nOr what do you mean in a way where you didn't notice say so you didn't read the document\nWe were talking that don't matter but you didn't read the document no I didn't okay oh I Know\nAll right so you now subterranean a termites I guess that were treated eyes so they did treat but it said would repair excluded and okay what's okay\nSo at this point I accepted another imitation from another company to come into an expectation that was in July now mind you march is when both term eyes were treated again the other company findings where I had major infestation of both\nI contacted the state of California pest control and they had no record whatsoever that this company had ever been to my own tree so they told me\nWhy would they why would they have a record of it\nBecause I was ... why would the state of California keep her record of maternal my company going to your house\nBecause by law they're supposed to submit a W T o form notify them\nReally okay I didn't know that so they have to be All right so I have to do it within ten days wow I didn't know that okay\nSo every time they ... they have to let the state no we just treated a home here's the address right right right okay new study\nThough they told me there in violation then that's an internal thing so I ended up filing a complaint with the state of California in the meantime the owner of the company wanted to give me seven hundred and fifty\nDollars I mean you know I was going on forever okay this is taking way too long so the bottom line is there in violation internally or you can sue them for all the damage or based on\nThe damaged subsequent to\nThey're coming in and treating and then you can argue that they had not had they had they treated correctly all the additional damage wouldn't have been done I don't think they can defend even based on the fact that they were violation of the law that's probably the violation of that\nUh that

the law marginal legal\n[noise]\nFrank [noise] yes or Europe [noise]\nAh yeah clear February ... regrets that does that mean however have a right to ask for up to a form of of course the prospective employee\nOkay I ... and it's All right you're you're saying uh before him he's asking you to fill out a W to form where are you talking about a previous W to form for a previous job\nA ... a previous that route to form a\nFor free from previous jobs yeah no it doesn't ... doesn't have the right to do that or because effectively what he's doing is asking for your salary and it's against the law to ask what your salary was it started because it's not his business how much money you earned it the previous in employment\nSo no because he doesn't have a right to say I need to see your previous W to form doesn't work that was\nBurger quicker arrive at five rap\nYeah there's a particular law that says you cannot ask for a how much money someone has made previously handler and it don't tell you to form a previous double your true form says exactly that also even if it wasn't the law I just say you can't do that you say no what are you doing\nYeah how about the color underwear I'm wearing a so uh no I don't think ah that works or John Hi John you're up\n[laughter] so I have a habit that rent but not on our um they pay 'em the amount that carried on that that they gave 'em 'cause they're claiming that there are no damage\nTo their car and so you're talking about [laughter] so you're talking about they moved out right John\nThey are in the process of memory now okay\nAnd what you're saying is that the damages are going to be greater than this you know or the rent is greater than the security deposit correct\nOr do they pay their rent but at the deposit that they\nGave yeah they do that all the time All right so what's your question\n[noise] [noise] so my question and I I brought it up to them and they are claiming that I'm Around you know I mean I called and emailed them well okay now what is going on right\nOn okay here is here's your your your choices and I'm going to tell you just suck it up and here's why I technically they have to pay you the rent there is no question about it and the security deposit is a separate issue and the security deposit is about\nProtecting you from damage\nA particularly protecting you from damage or to the property so I assuming that there is no damage or even if there is damage what happens is they are of course saying where to put the security posture towards the last month's rent and you're saying no you can't do that\nSo you have the right to sue them but but you have to offset the amount of money you have a security deposit as against three so it becomes a wash\nRight so what are you gonna do you're going to sue for a wash and then the issue is if there are damages beyond that then of course you sue them in small claims court\n[noise]\nAnd so then you so then you do then you do then you have a small claims shoe\nBut other than that no we had that before but don't they all the money yes but you have to offset so now what why even bother\nSteve hello Steve\nI Want to you sir yeah you know for some reason
