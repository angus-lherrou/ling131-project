Kayla\nKayla how can I serve you today\nLike Rachel Jang\n... get their fat one night and I'm One of the what we can get endless ... and that's the money for then and we want to be able to scale how and when we get ready for an ex by buying their first car or their first starting a family ...\nNo I said first of all I just did the math you have brilliant family planning\nOn him because he built in babysitter is right there [laughter] maybe six years apart each kid pretty good there [laughter]\nSo if the money's not for school it gets a little more complicated [noise] so how much money are you thinking of for each child\nWho was like ... I was like oh no I don't like any like well look twenty four hours and ... ...\nSo you got a Thirteen year old you would want to have that money at what age\n... by hand\nTen years from now [noise] okay so I'm going to give you some crazy suggestions okay Oklahoma you're ready for crazy ...\nI'm always nervous about putting money in a kid's name because as precious as our kids are when they're young we don't know exactly how mature they're going to be and responsible once legally they have access to money\nSo now is a Thirteen year old Seventy year old and one is going to be one soon you are in a position now with custodial accounts you get to make all decisions\nOne saying she was considered to be adulthood which is actually often before kids mature enough to make good decisions with money if they find out the money's there they have the ability to take control of it and spend it on things that you've worked hard to save you might not be able to control\nSo you're ready for my weird suggestion I recommend wall right you've heard me talk about Ross IRAs and found is that something that you and your husband do\nWe get out right now on hold out we didn't have any\nOn back at war and what's not back more than ... came back in the rye and like it now point where I'm an identical there for a house get clay and ...\nAll right so let me tell you the beauty of using the raw says the way the safe for your kids\nYou control what now and in the future and everything they accounts earn they are in tax free so your intention is to give a decent amount of money to each of your children are sounds like and maybe mid twenties\nOr I don't read lot red ball um well I feel like they're ready for it\nRight so you maintain a hundred percent control if you and your husband each fun Ross\nUp to age fifty or each allowed to put in up to fifty five hundred dollars a year into these after age fifty sixty five hundred each but anyway you can ... soccer way enough money over these years moving forward\nThat you can fully put money aside they will meet what your goal our goals are for these three kids but see here's the beauty\nYou can only give them what you've contributed to at the earnings stay behind\nWith you and stay there although now till you would need\nThe money and retirement so it becomes like a partial retirement account for you we've completely tax free growth you maintain complete control of the money\nAnd when you're ready for them to have the money you've contributed on their behalf you can give it to your Thirteen year old ten or so years from now and have it be a completely tax free event\nIf you don't think you're a Thirteen year olds mature enough at that point and you want to wait a couple more years you wait a couple more years but you completely are in charge because it's your account your money\nSo the loop hole with a Roth is the money that is our number off as being left decide to lays you're fifty nine and a half or older but the money you contribute to the raw you're free to use for any purpose at any time\nBomb often well now I'm going to let them of aren't we start off\nAnd on if you walk on Clark dot com I have a very

market\nA year or so I'm a college student and I had taken out some money from much alone let subsidized loans\nAnd the stock market and to some well known stocks and um he was wanting to use that money to um I guess have access to the dividends\nTo those games and so I Want to know what your thoughts on uh it's just too risky um you know for a college student and I would I Would there be a better place or for that money but to loan money so\nYou have the ability to borrow a under the federally subsidized loan program where there's no interest paid until six months after you graduate interest starts right that's correct\nSo this is free money but the question I Would ask you if we had a ... a tough spot in the stock market you've put this money into stocks you borrowed\nAre you prepared to deal with the consequences if that money is not there when you're out of school and you've got to pay it back\n[noise] uh yeah yeah it's it's not it's not too much to where I couldn't handle that I'm On my education right now I'm On expected in school for another uh two years\nIf you are comfortable with the risk and you wouldn't lose any sleep if you lost the money then this is essentially\nBorrowing money at no cost\nOkay but\nI've had this question and I should tell you over the years I've had this question at least half a dozen times from people who have borrowing authority that they don't need to use under the federal student loan program\nYou got to really do check with yourself that you're going to be OK if let's say you put a few thousand you do in a few thousand each year and the stock market\n[noise] right right like uh I've just started that um and I've ... I've I've I've bar lovely a four thousand dollars and have invested those and to um like I said there was well known stops\nAll right let's say let's just say we have a a real serious decline in the market and four thousand two years from now is worth only two\nAnd you're going to owe the four thousand are you going to hate yourself or you say oh well it's okay I knew what I was risking and I'm

Washington\nTo require drug manufacturers in these crazy TV ads say do or drug disclosed in the ads what prescription actually cost for the drugs and the pharmaceutical\nCompanies are going crazy like what in the world are you thinking why would we ever want to tell anybody\nThat those beautiful models running through a beautiful setting with the backdrop of magnificent mountains are lakes or oceans or whatever they're smiling year to year well their commentator says\nMay cause your right arm to fall off or may cause you to have really sad suicidal thoughts or whatever\nDavid Lazarus or the Los Angeles times\nHas written recently about the proposal from Washington that pharmaceutical companies post prices and what's your perspective on this\nAbout having to disclose that those smiling people are taking a drug that would cost you two thousand dollars a month or whatever\nWell first cargo let's get a little credit to the president for at least lighting high drug prices as something that he's concerned about and indeed since the campaign he has repeatedly return to this and even the drug companies are getting away with murder when it comes to pricing but that\nSaid he has offered no significant maneuver or or rule whatsoever to lean in drug pricing and what we got out of the administration last week was simply a proposal that along with all those crazy side effects ticket listed when we see ads for prescription Mets on TV\nThe drug company also has to include the list price of the drug in the intent here now the administration says is to shame of the companies to bring these prices down because so many of these places are in fact\nIndefensible oh there's a bunch of problems to this first of all what price would they put it in the list price which nobody pays the actual price of the wholesale price\nThat's a clear a but the bigger problem is the drug industry to look at that said you know we don't think so and then they turned out the first amendment and said you can't compel us to say things we don't want and I\nPut out so called to some constitutional lawyers to say what was that true I mean they've got a list all these side effects can't they also be forced to list the price and the lawyers say no it looks like you can make a case from the government's point of view to coerce speech if they were the public interest\nOr public health or safety involved and that's why you do get the requirement\nFor all the side effects but it would be very difficult for the government to argue that there is a public interest in simply shaming these guys\nWith the scarlet letter of having to publicize their prices and so the lawyers are saying you know what the drug industry is going to take this all the way to the Supreme Court where they will probably win in a Citizens United environment where ... where\nBusiness has never had more rights and more power and the upshot of this is first of all this is a fight there for the government isn't the way to win and second of all if the drug industry has forced to litigate yes what they'll just pass those costs on us\nAll right so let's go to the core or something and this is something I've heard from several doctors ... this is very frustrating to them with the with the ads for these pharmaceuticals on TV because they all have patients come in\nAnd they're already pre sold doc\nI Want you to write me a script for blah blah blah because I saw it it's going to do all these miraculous things and suddenly I'm going to look like those people on the TV and addition to curing what ails me and so the perspective I've gotten from physicians is that we're the problem\nMore than anything else and that we're allowing ourselves to be to influence by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but also it's important to remember that at this point in the U.S health care system it's all a turnover or Catholic patient in healthcare terms\nWhich means they've got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said I Want drug X Y Z and I'm not gonna take no for an answer a lot of doctors will simply

car about fourteen years that I've driven pretty much in to the ground [laughter]\nYou are a solar plants has sticking brilliant that [laughter] 'cause you know a there was a guy who used to do personal finance stuff who ran the numbers and figured out that if you will keep the cars that you drive the vehicles you drive\nOn average if you buy a new one keep it ten years or longer changing nothing else in your life that that one thing of of keeping vehicles a long time\nAllows you to retire five years sooner\n[noise] well I hadn't heard that that I Am I I'm not even close to the point I Believe [laughter] as far as saving and all that so [noise]\nBut think about the whole you would have buried yourself if you got new vehicles like so many people do every three or four or five years\nRight right I couldn't even fighting what little lie another now [laughter]\nAnd you said this one is Thirteen or fourteen years old right\nWow well you have you have earned the right if this one's breaking down to jump in and get something else [laughter] you don't feel about that I haven't\nHad it for my daughter but ... the transmission have gone and we replaced it with an older and a couple of years ago [noise] so I'm Wondering how we can still get any money out of it\nWithout putting another transmission on their chest to sell it\nSo what would it cost to replace the transmission\nOh who are figuring even for it with an old used on it would probably end up around Eighteen get kids out\nAnd do you know if you looked up to see approximately what the vehicles worth your was working on that one show\nUm I had thought about it but I have done it yet I thought maybe it might have spent might have great I'm poking around three thousand\nSo this is gonna sound weird to you but if you can fix the transmission for somewhere a little less around two thousand dollars and it truly would\nBe worth three thousand I Know this is nuts but the math says it would be worth fixing it and then having your daughter Dr\n... and maybe downloading it and getting are right on\nYeah I wouldn't do that and yet so little for it because the reason is is that and this is this is something I'll tell you my for me I'll tell you what Consumer Reports says my formulas been when the value of a vehicle\nIs such that the cost of a repair exceeds fifty percent of its remaining value so in the example you gave\nIf it really is worth three thousand dollars and it costs you more than Fifteen hundred to put a new transition transmission I'd say dumped but the Consumer Reports ran the numbers and they said that's ridiculous that if you can repair of vehicle\nAnd even adding and the cost the repair it's west of the remaining value say anything less than three thousand\nYou're better off repairing it and driving a you know even if you get just several months out of it you are still ahead of the game\nOkay\nNow as far as the way you would do for yourself whether you choose to repair it or not and there are two things you've got to find out before you do it first what would it really cost to replace that transmission\nAnd then second what's it really worth it you may decide even if those numbers still look like your shoe repair it you're just done with it after fourteen years that's fine\n... many times there will be a shop that will buy it from you because they're getting a vehicle for a deal and then they put in a transmission that their cost and then they've got instant transportation or good price\nWell that was my other question was you know would would there be a chance of dying at telling it on then courting\nYes certainly there are all somebody in the business because they wouldn't make sense for anybody other than somebody who knew how to do that kind of work and could do everything on the cheap\nYeah how do they if you were to sell it on repaired they may be your best potential customer it'd be worth much more than donating\nOK okay but as far as ... what are you thinking would you go brand new or would you buy a mid age used vehicle or what would you you think would be asked you said you're actually\nLooking at a at a ten year old upper level car that hasn't that life expectancy [laughter]\nSo you in my producer Joe or probably related and don't realize that [laughter] because that's how he buys vehicles\nWell it's out of necessity where it gets not in a position came much else but which\nIf you buy a vehicle that ten years old they are very little market value left but potentially have a great deal of mileage still to run\nFor her and so uh if you don't have mechanical knowledge yourself even though you have to lay out money to do it if you're looking at a vehicle ten years old try to keep it one that's got a hundred and twenty five thousand miles on it somewhere in that range\nEighty five eighty five thousand miles\nThat's wonderful as long as it checked out by a mechanic if you're choosing that sounds like a very smart use of your money\nOkay and I hope that it gives you many years of reliable transportation moving forward\nPete is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Pete call Eli I'm great thanks

about how many times over the years I've had the question for people how in the world did they stay in touch how do they communicate\nAnd now the answers are clearly emerging\nYou may have heard AT and T. did a joint venture with air stream their benefits both where you pay for unlimited Internet in the air stream she paid twenty five bucks a month paid a year in advance\nYou pay a three hundred and sixty bucks\nAnd you got the unlimited I'm Sorry that's thirty a month could I Do math oh it's pitiful\nI had to go back to the second grade third grade anyway so you pay three sixty here thirty dollars a month and you have unlimited data unlimited\nAnd this is something you're going to start to see for good or bad appearing and SEVs minivans ah hopefully not passenger cars where the driver is trying to surf the Web while he or she is driving down the road\nBut having hot spots on wheels\nWith unlimited data\nIs so part of our immediate future where you will always be connected so your

the car longer any more time with this\nBut I think about all these things are good and bad right the advantage for people on the go on the road to be able to stay connected if you're traveling is great I remember for ever ago\nWhen the first mobile unit came out for satellite t._v. from I don't remember his director dish came out with that first\nAnd it was on those moments that had real good

we'll have to let you see on each of the [laughter]\nSo do you think about this your baby you're bringing in this world will likely never learned to drive right\n'cause they'll just get in the pot and

policy\nIsn't that the truth [laughter]\nBut yeah I wanted to get your advice on savings options are we wanted to go ahead and get started on all that and when you Google it you get you know a good answers\nAs we were just hoping that you can provide us clarity on on may be the best way to start saving for college and uh things like that\nWill colleges really easy to say for because of something known as a five twenty nine plan which he won't be able to open the book cancer is told your babies born but that's actually not true I'll tell you a trick in a second\nBut a five twenty nine plan allows you to save tax free for your child's college and all the money that the plan earns over the years grows tax free and then if spent per eligible college expenses is spent tax free okay\nSo the five twenty nine are great\nAnd they vary in quality the plans do but most of the plans are decent now which is not something I Would have said even three years ago but there's some that are\nJust perfect great and I have a guide at Clark dot com to the five twenty nine plans okay then I've divided it dean's list high honors and an honor roll off your state plan is\nOn either of those lists grow into your state plan if it's not go pick one of mine on dean's list with high honors okay now let me tell you how you do this trick that that all the book answer is ... is impossible\nEven though your baby's not born doesn't have the name Clark or Europe yet you can go ahead and set up a plan\nFor either their paychecks to get larger or for home prices to become more reasonable for them to be able to buy versus their income it's not like a conspiracy or anything and I do want to point out and another thing this is nothing like two thousand seven\nAnd we are not on the edge\nOf a cliff were home prices will collapse this isn't bad at all this is where that was a fever pitch speculative era with too much money chasing\nThe marketplace this is really a fundamental thing we have not build enough housing units in recent years it cause supply and demand to get out of kilter and so the market is having to find a new record equilibrium\nAnd it will force the marketplace to deal with both the pricing side of the things and the supply side so if you want to stay on buyer strike for a while longer\nBut market may reward you but the big news is that the big run up and prices that we've seen\nThat is now a rearview mirror thing\nAmy's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Amy\nHow are you great thank you Amy you've got student loans that you're dealing with tell me about that I\nKnew and well I mean we face my first they didn't mind that I took out with her grad school it for a hundred thousand dollars\nThat title areas Awni isn't it [laughter] oh yeah ... [laughter] as the degree even worth a hundred thousand\nIt took me five years to find a job in my field oh so I'm not sure about it actually the work that out\nOkay do you think over a working lifetime cycle that it will end up having a good return on that hundred thousand or not even that\nI Am hoping it seemed like a good idea at a time when I first started school the market for that career was wide open lots of openings\nAnd then I was in school during the thousand eighty thousand nine and the market just close on that or it\nJust now starting to reopen and I'm I'm hoping that it will be something that will pay off in the long run unfortunately I've not been able to undo it so if I could get it on his head I might um but I Am stuck with this with this one\nWell what are you thinking of now what am I thinking of you know as far as handling the hundred thousand\nOkay so there I have a couple of options for one is to create I was on income based and it has a ... now to one hundred and twenty thousand dollars for the first five years in marketing class that was not able to make any Hanan so that's just been a critic on top of itself\nPretty left out of that by being and I'd be our income based repayment you were saying current\nYes I'm not in the fall right it's just sitting there payments are made\nI have an option to take money last my husband said take money out of his savings accounts to pay off the land and full however he has that money saved up for retirement and he's already retired so\nIf I refinance filled by right now at seven point nine nine percent interest at it if I refinance it down to like a six and a half percent\nIt's still about a thousand dollars a month so I was thinking as a twenty year fixed because a thousand is a ... all I can afford a new into the industry still earning and translate essentially so then we're looking at\nA hundred and forty thousand dollars just in interest over the lifetime of the line\nWell if your husband see if he were calling me I Would I Would be asking different questions but since you're calling me and he's volunteered to do it is less it's going to trigger a big tax do bill for him I
