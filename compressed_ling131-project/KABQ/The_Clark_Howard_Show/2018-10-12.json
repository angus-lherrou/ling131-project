down for next year not up you know during open enrollment you can shop around\nAnd see what's available but now insurers are more coming back into the marketplace\nAfter a number of years of having less and less competition on the exchanges there are more insurers offering plans and that creates competition not everywhere in the country are prices going down but the general trend around the country\nIs prices are actually declining\nAnd you ... if you do buy your own individual plan\nThe next open enrollment period starts November first and you have only a six week window to sign up for individual coverage\nFor twenty Nineteen and that's great news about premiums having not just moderated but started a trend line of declining we don't know if this is a one year thing who knows because nobody expected\nThis to be a release when the rates were released by the department of health and Human Services nobody expected their premiums around the country would decline and these are for a full ah\nObamacare compliant plans meaning no exclusion for pre existing coverage for ah oh illnesses coverage for pregnancies all that so it is\nAnother bit of good news on the healthcare front where the news historically has not been so good\nAndrew is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Andrew\n[noise] hey how are you great thank you Andrew you are moving towards the end up paying off your student loans is that right that is correct well what kind of journey if you've been on with that how ... then\nUm I Would I Would say it's been pretty rough of a stretch to focus pretty heavily on trying to get this paid off as soon as possible um but it has taken a lot of um a lot of work to do so and I had to make sacrifices but we're nearing the end so I'm pretty excited about it\nWell that is great news how much do you have left burdening you\n[noise] I got just over sixty one hundred at the moment\nOh that's fantastic\nBecause you know when I hear from people calling me about student loans usually it will be in the tens of thousands or or probably one in five times there will be more than a hundred thousand dollars in student loans that someone's asking me about\nYeah I started at the right at about thirty two I'm a couple of years ago and so of I'm nearing the end so it's a very great showing that\nWonderful well how can I be of service in this quest to be done with the student loan lenders\nSo the question I have is so I've got just over the sixty one hundred and student loan and it's a right at four percent four point zero one percent interest on that [noise]\nI have a a little bit over seven thousand built up and just individual savings and so I'm I'm just I'm questioning do I just go ahead and erase the student loan it'd be done with it\nOr just continue it out and I'm looking at potentially making your last payment and march or April next year\nSo that even if you did not um kill off your savings you'd still be done in another half here\nYes that's correct [noise]\nAll right so that means you're a very determined savor your very careful with your money I Would go ahead and blow out the student loans and extend in early Christmas gift to yourself [laughter] okay\nBecause you're on that kind of trend line where you're paying five hundred or so a month towards this balance you're going to replenish her savings pretty quickly\nAnd getting to that goal line of getting rid of the student loans is so worth it with the slog you've been through reward yourself and wipe it out\nOkay yeah I appreciate that 'cause I was the kind of the same thing same thought process I had as if I go at it and remove this now that just benefits me in the long term 'cause I can put all that extra money back into savings and the Cornish that and put it back up\nAnd pretty quickly to one thing though that I Want to make sure you're aware the record keeping by the student loan servicers is pitiful and you need to keep the documents showing that you have successfully paid off your student loans for guess how long\n[noise] forever that is right for the rest\nOf your life you need to keep the proof because over the years it's been so disturbing to me when I hear from someone who's being hassled by a student loan collector on loans they long sense paid off even decades before\nAnd they have no way of proving they actually pay them off and Congress and its wisdom gave student loan collectors extreme powers where they don't even have to prove the validity of a debt and that's why having your proof of pay off is so key\n[noise] yeah I I I appreciate you reminded me on that I'll definitely make sure I I get that um when I Do get this a clear it out\nAnd congratulations to you and your early Christmas gift to yourself\nThank you very much I I appreciative I\nCertainly and Sam is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Sam\nYes Hi how are you\nWonderful Sam how can I be of service to you\nI'm lucky I had a flush of all you are about

what's your instance name\nOr his name is Adam\nWell for Adam if Adam needs money for college then at least that are nearly a thousand\nThat people donated she's able to take it out and use it for college costs and it has no implications at all for financial aid for tax or anything\nYeah I I did want to mention that uh we do plan to keep that money for him if even if we use that and the raw or my wife or at least we will\nTake out whatever we contribute to set up and make sure that money goes to have a but I also read that or I could withdraw earning a penalty free as long as it's used for college\nNo no you can withdraw the um I don't want you to do that only pull out the contributions because then it can be done for any purpose we had to leave the earnings in there\nFor your wife's benefit for all through the decades and for Adam if let's say Eighteen years now and I'm going to college and you don't need to draw on the money from the raw better yeah\nWhy don't you consider

when the scary ride is down\nBut this is there's no way of predicting if this is the start of\nA bear market bear market is when the value of stocks overall drops twenty percent or more or even somebody was known as mild thing colder correction which has declined uh ten percent or more but we've had\nA nearly unprecedented run that started in late winter\nOf two thousand no early spring two thousand nine and it's gone on pretty much with just a few hiccups over\nAlmost ten years nine and a half years this is extremely unusual and values of a lot of stocks by historical measurements are too high nothing like a\nFoolish bubble territory anything like that but stocks do over shoot on the upside and over shoot as they come down\nIt's just part of the emotional factor involved with

a savings account for years and years you would earn nothing on your savings\nThis was all part of the process\nOf trying to keep\nCapitalism functioning in the U.S and so now is interest rates\nSteadily climbed towards real levels stocks don't look quite as good and that's part of the fact of getting back to a more normal\nEconomic environment and so as a stock investor I'm changing

because that money shouldn't be in stocks\nBut everything in life is about knowing the risk based on the time that you can afford to take risk\nSo money that you are putting in let's say is most

already do so but I I have a question for you I almost would like to play at the Joel role and do an ask Clark\nBut [laughter] Joe right ahead\nWell I was recently retired from a company I worked thirty five years for them and have substantial amount of money and my former companies for one case yesterday I was about to be retired they began to offer a\nRaw four one K. which I can obviously no longer contribute to [noise] but I learned today that they offer an option to transfer traditional four one K. money into their offer all one gay\nAnd obviously you have to pay taxes on that issue right as a regular income tax and uh and they will not tell you that it's got to be paid out of your own money rice your own responsibility [noise]\nSo you know my incomes last requirement obviously and the kind of the taxes would be a lot lower so I was thinking about perhaps and moving money like only a year to year basis over into that raw four one K. was kind of an eye on minimizing my out front axis\nAnd giving me greater flexibility and my airs greater flexibility in the long term now the downside is that out to using my non retirement income and other signs that tell you those taxes\nRight you know about it\nThat is the question if you in dribs and drabs each year move money from the traditional four one K. end of the raw and because your income slower you're lowering the tax\nAs long as it would not infringe on your lifestyle too much you could afford to do it with the funds you have and the money in the four one K. being money you may not need for a long time and retirement that is a very sound and wise strategy\nI appreciate that I I couldn't see any downside to but I thought maybe I was missing something and are measuring\nYou're missing nothing as long as you live a lifestyle where you you can afford the tax bill that would occur each year it's great because the flexibility it offers you when you turned Seventy and a half you have to start making mandatory withdrawals from that four one K.\nAnd as you have less and less money in it as you've been able to migrate money the Roth\nYou're reducing by a meaningful amount how much mandatory withdraw you'd have to make this is important in your case because I can tell talking to you the way you handle money you have been a good steward of your funds and you're in a position\nTo pay for your lifestyle without really needing all the money they would come from a mandatory withdraw from the four one K. each year\nThat actually ... the problem I see in the future and the higher tax rates that I think we're gonna have to we're going to see in the future as well\nSo I think that is because you've lived your wife in a way that you have that flexibility I can never remember where I recommend it to a retiree to move money steadily from a four one K. to a raw\nBut you're not everybody in your situation fits doing that perfectly Natalie with us on the Clark Howard show hello Natalie how are

bouncing around in the Congress to come up with a regulation of fees that the airlines charge and I was opposed to that I Want airlines to be able to charge whatever fees they wish\nThe only thing that I had called for and it landed up on deaf ears I remember talking with our congressmen about this and it just I was not penetrating the congressman skull at all but my idea was reciprocity\nThat if you cancel a flight and in and delta American a United and want to charge you two hundred dollars\nTo change that flight or cancel it that if the airline canceled a flight or it suffers a extreme delay they should pay you that same amount\nWas fair's fair\nBut the Congress chose to do nothing about fees and said silent on it another thing with a new change is women that are pregnant now we're going to have priority in boarding\nAnd so they're not jostled about or anything like that one thing Congress chose not to do and I discussed it recently on the air because the\nPrior law covered it\nAnd now it is no longer going to be part of the procedures going forward there is no requirement that airlines accommodate families are small children small children child not be separated from their parents on a flight\nI think that's outrageous in unconscionable unacceptable\nAnd the irony here is that even the hard discount airlines\nSpirit frontier in all Egypt specifically accommodate\nHaving families sit together southwest accommodate families sitting together the three full fare alliance American United and delta specifically don't and I think that's mean spirited and cruel\n\nOne thing that came up not too long ago American Airlines\nWas introducing the planes that had with some seepage of twenty eight inches which if you're not familiar with what that means it means that even someone shorter than five three\nWould have their knees knocking into the seat in front of them on a flight\nThere was a a mutiny\nFrom American Airlines employees and the public an American backed off that but there is now going to be an investigation on safety grounds of whether or not there should be minimum seat requirements on planes so that people can evacuate safely under the\nSafety requirement which is an empty a plane and Ninety seconds or less\nAnd then as you put more and more bodies on the plane what United does is called didn't suffocation where they're crowding more and more and more people in the same space or all those people going to be able to get out in time and that's why there's going to be an investigation of that\nBut here's one of the greatest weirdness as I can think of\nFrontier airlines one of the deep discount airlines has reduced its fee for changing cancellation and in fact if you book a ticket way ahead in you decide three months or more out that you're not going to go they charge you know the at all and give your money back\nSo\nIt's so weird that the three full affairs American United and delta\nCharge these massive change fees and even one of the hard discounters charges last or nothing\nYes she was going to do that as well so there's no surprises\nWell I Hope she has a great time is this like the typical American college
