procedure now being free\nThere is a much greater chance that someone who didn't do it because it was ten dollars to freeze in ten dollars every time you saw it and most states now that it's free there is a much greater likelihood that people will freeze their credit\nWhich is a good thing for you to do\nBecky with us on the Clark Howard show hello Becky how you doing\nVery well how are you a cleric great thank you Becky how can I be of service to you\nWell I Am in the process of purchasing a new home it's a little bit more expensive than the initial home that on the end and my family has some concerns as do lie on it\nSomething should happen to me\n... death because that would be covered by life insurance but if I become debilitated little counter at injury I'm\nEd can't make my payments what happens to my home and I was told that there is a mortgage protection insurance available but I talked to my insurance company and they said it that's not typically done anymore so I was wondering what your thoughts are and\nIf you look at it and that's because I'll keep this clean and I won't use the word they usually use and the industry but it's junk insurance\nOkay so let me tell you this the background in the industry they refer to this stuff is crow can choke\nSo croaking choke crow paying the if you die choke being you're disabled and so they ... talk about it behind our backs because it's an intensely profitable\nInsurance product like the mortgage life there's a there used to be a blended product mortgage life and disability but the thing is is that what's more important than you said it right yourself you said well I don't need mortgage life insurance for cause I have\nWhat'd you say you had life insurance\nExactly it's your insurance that you name a beneficiary for and that been a fishery can then use the money as they wish is would be the most appropriate which may not be paying off a mortgage\nBut the big thing is that the mortgage life insurance it's pedaled so heavily costs roughly ten times\nWhat a individually purchase life insurance policy would cost\nBut the life insurance has only good if I ...\nA let's say a word choke so which do\nYou have ... you should have more concerns then if if you became disabled and you were unable to work than just what's gonna happen with your mortgage because there are so many bills of life\nThat continue to go on if you're not able to work and that's why having your own disability insurance policy for disability insurance policy through where you work\nIs fantastic to have and it's something almost nobody buys\nBut is a very valuable piece because during someone's working lifetime there three times more likely to become disabled into die right but people will even though not enough people by life insurance almost nobody buys buys disability so\nI Do have short and long term disability for my work\nThen then you're good okay you're good and uh how how much would you say you're a wife or with where you're working\nA lot I think it's for three hundred\nNo no I mean how [laughter] I guess I didn't raise that in English so how likely you are you to stay at this place of employment for the rest of your working career\nI'd say it's highly likely that in the field that I mean it's also common that people do Lou from company to company\nSo if your health is really solid\nI think it'd be worth it you getting a quote owning your own disability policy [noise] okay rather than one through your employer because if you own one through an employer and you switch employers let's say you're not in health at that time to get the disability policy owning your own becomes portable just like\nHaving your own life insurance policy\nIs adding a term life insurance beneficial for me as well I mean I'm almost fifty so\nYeah so I Love the term life insurance and having that to provide for the remaining cycle of your working lifetime depending on your family circumstances like do you have minor children\nNo I'm Single\nOkay so the purpose of having that insurance is principal you to provide for survivors that depend on you for income if you don't have anyone that depends on you for income there's likely not a big reason for you to have\nMore life insurance with a disability that you would own would be very valuable\nOK okay very good thank you so

it will be to her advantage and you already gave the preamble that you would not be giving her the plastic and that's very important because relationships change and all that and you don't want the

looked at her credit report\nOr credit report I'm not sure I Know she's got credit karma so I Know she's monitoring it and trying to rebuild um so I don't know as far as your credit report that's a good a good idea to you with\nCredit ... on the credit card machines see her reports to and what she should look for is any items that are not what's called H. properly because of her problems with credit go back a decade\nThose things should not be present on her report so she should essentially have a no file almost versus a bad file for things from long ago\nIt's not unusual for a collection agency to do what's called refreshed the date\nTo try to keep something active in somebody's mix that shouldn't be\nAnd then what she would do is if something's on there that is too old she challenges it with a credit bureau notify us whoever has that it dated wrong\nThat she's challenged it needs to be removed and generally when somebody savvy enough to do that the collection agencies behave

how can I serve you today yeah\nWell the reason for my call though is about life insurance so uh I'm twenty four years old that I knew really what my mom and\nPaying a whole life insurance policy for me that she got her work and now she wants to turn it over to me that we pay the premiums that so it's only nine bucks a month\nAnd what's her face in front of the policy like what's the word\nIt's only Nineteen grand and I I Know that you prefer ... insurance and I do have I have a ... group life insurance like that as a benefit for work but I was just wondering I Know that like you know the answer is not a policy is there a couple of decision so I just wanted to consult with with you before I\nSaid the premiums are a little more than a hundred dollars a year buys you Nineteen thousand dollars in coverage and then at work you get it just for breathing or you pay a premium\nOh I just got a great\nSo you keep the one that you get just for breathing the policy that's worth a payout of Nineteen thousand that's not enough coverage to really be of value to you\nAnd thank\nYou so much better if you were to think about taking money and putting it every month towards a term life policy at twenty four years old you buy a let's say a thirty year level term\nYou're going to be able to get a massive policy\nFor not much more than what you're paying right now for Nineteen thousand dollar

tall currency and say well let me let me get in touch with ... and you know 'cause I I I'm I Know there's all kinds of schemes are there and I just wanted you know you get some information\nShe bitcoin is not as a team bitcoin is an alternative way of paying for things and is heavily used by people that are into illegal activities and people who are trying to move money from one country to another\nSo as a way to move money from one country to another it's a very efficient way to do it\nAnd it's also a very efficient way for people engaged in criminal activity to hide their their tracks by buying things and receiving funds through bitcoin 'cause it's virtually untraceable so that's why it's very popular with people that do illegal activity\nBut there's a third group of people that are into bitcoin Johnny and it may be what your friend is into their people believe they can make money just buying ... coins and\nHolding them right right right so let me tell you about that it goes up and down like a yoyo say bitcoin\nBeing used as a spec holding is not an investment it's those extremely high risk things for your friend he's got to be the kind of person who likes to go to Vegas and throw the dice 'cause that's what you do if you own bitcoin as a quote unquote investment\nFor the other activities while I'll leave that to people that want to use them to pay for things in

can save more and spend less and don't let anyone ever rip you off I Am just on a slow burn on a particular topic that is eating at me\nWe in the United states have an all volunteer military\nIf you're a longtime listener you know I Believe we should have mandatory national service that people have to do when they turn Eighteen\nEither in the U.S military or in some kind of public service for two years I think it's a something we're missing in society now is the sense of common purpose\nAnd I don't like the fact that military service is not a shared sacrifice in the United states anymore we have the same small number of people being called upon to deploy again and again and again\nA sacrifice potentially of loss of life\nHealth or family because the continuous separation is not something that's healthy for most marriages\nAnd we as a country of made certain promises to people who serve in the military one is that they have in return for the sacrifices they make that they have certain rights involved with doing business with banks that the rest of us don't have\nWent on active duty what can happen with interest rates whether you can be evicted whether you can be a foreclosed on whether your car can be repossessed there any of a number of protections under the law that are being ignored\nAnd when they're annoyed by banks rules aren't being enforced this is wrong wrong wrong\nI appreciate so much that when people see folks in uniform that they applaud that there thanks for their service but let's put more meat behind that and much really do things to serve the people who are serving us\nAnother example of this one came out of Georgia there's a there's a system set up in place there when the spouse of a military person\nIs transferred you know the military persons transferred to another state the spouse is then given a waiver of normal professional licensing boards in that state if they're in a profession that requires a state license\nRecently a lawyer in Georgia whose husband was transferred to the military post at Fort Benning was refused the right to practice law even though she was already a member of the bar\nNo doubt that this was all about simply\nProtecting the lawyers already in place and preventing someone from coming in as potential competition I have to say no doubt and guess because the legal board that supposed issue the waiver not only refused issue it didn't say why\nThat is completely outrageous and unacceptable\nNo we need to do more than talk of the game we need to support our military personnel and we as a country really need to think long and hard about what I Believe so strongly through and through\nThat all of us could benefit and our nation would benefit enormously if there was a shared sense of service in our country\nWith mandatory service as part of the game I Believe the strong division in public life in the United states is because very few people that serve\nIn elected office have any military background at all where you meet people from every walk of life and it doesn't matter who you are where you're from what your religion is what color you are\nIt's all about the one purpose of serving our nation\nAnd I think that's part of what we were missing and understanding how much we share in common versus the differences we have\nLearn the difference between term and whole life insurance

old the ... is a counterfeit and your dad is told to deposit wait for the check to clear\nAnd then he supposed to take that money and send a wire to British taxing authorities to pay that tax bill mhm but\nHe's actually taking real money that he's wiring to scammers and then the check that he's deposited\nWill balance as a counterfeit typically\nIt might take as long as six weeks a law\nSo and then

unnecessarily because you have chosen within your budget as a lifestyle choice to eat out pretty much all year meals but you're still saving Fifteen Percent of your pay four one K. that's correct\nAnd your husband is too yes\nAnd you each have a match yes wow what kind of match the each of you have\nUm I have a great match at six percent and he I Believe also has a six percent match\nSo you're saving effectively each of you more than twenty percent of your pet\nYeah so are all the ... my husband is a teacher so he has that for all three of the plants are hoping they get him out of ... all one K. this year so he can save even more in a better plan\nFor him so he you know that I never went to law school right right and one proof of that is no war you're ever asked the question that he or she doesn't already know the answer to\nSo I had jumped to a conclusion and when I heard that you ate out all your meals and we've been talking about this that you were one of these forty percent that wasn't saving any money at all and you're saving like a maniac\nI think what's important with studies like these is now it's given me I'm a reality check on that I Need to look at exactly how much we're spending but we are also saving for retirement so we're not the false it said to stick up millennials which\nNo no you're doing I mean if you're saving Fifteen Percent plus getting six percent employer match by the way for me you get seven percent not six oh so you're saving twenty fear for say your husband saving Twenty one percent but anyway it is it's great and uh I Apologize for it\nThinking that you were one of the stats and keep doing exactly what you're doing things\nBut I Want you to think about it now that Sally has made me look like a jerk I Want you to think about the the reality argue\nBudgeting if you will use that term like Sally did or you budgeting for retirement are you putting money aside\nTo build your future or you just living in the ...\nI mean the list of things in this survey of what people are spending money on not saving for retirement was quite interesting and a\nLot of the things that people are spending money on that just kind of fritter so way each week\nOr things that if somebody was asked well would it be better to spend money on this or put it towards retirement in isolation people would automatically save for retirement but and what people are actually doing their spending the money on various things\nThat are not going to matter to them after they\nThat day is passed\nBut retirement eventually comes\nDaniels with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Daniel\nAfternoon Clark how're you doing I'm doing fine how are you\nGreat thank you so you got something going on with your four one K. you wanted to run by me\nYeah so um my my employer I'm currently has a company that I really liked Farr following gay and day out of the blue 'cause I used to me they sent notification that their change ha you company that I never heard of before\nAnd uh I've got the option to just not nothing and let them all every day over or I can be cheap by current investments where they are by opening and individual ones\nAnd transferring or and and just do the stuff at the place I'm\nI wanted to get your take on it\nWell the company that they're moving you too has I'm not the greatest\nSatisfaction from people and they'd been sued a number of times according to trade journals for having massive fees and four one K. plans I'm Kerry is kind of\nImpression I had I'm curious whether your employer moving from a low cost provider to an ultra high cost provider are you in a very small employer\n[noise] no I ah we we have it's a big corporation with a lot of individual companies or I don't know several thousand employees\nSo somebody somebody may have made a mistake let's leave it at that because it makes no sense in many times smaller businesses won't know where to turn won't know exactly what to do and it's harder for small business to find a low cost plan anyway\nAnd so the small businesses face a herculean task but a big company it's very easy to provide employees with a low cost plan and this is a very odd curious switch what I Would recommend to you in this case\nIs for you to reduce your contribution to the employer four one K. to the point that you pull the full employer match if they're going to have what do they\nYeah yeah I'm currently doing that plus a little more\nSo I Would not do plus a little more anymore okay I Do only up to the match and then I Would set up your own IRA Roth IRA with one of the low cost companies why who I see used to handle your four one K. plan\nYeah hoping to max out or off and then maybe a little bit so any extra there would be too much for off just put it on the east it's more than a match or do something else\nBoy that's tough because you know if you're going to a a high cost provider\nIt it becomes somewhat troublesome to put money in the four o one K plan beyond what you need to to grab the full employer match so I'll look through the the uh plan documents for the new plan they now have to disclose the what the fees are\nAnd if there are any ultra low cost choices like any index funds that have really a low low fee which would be something an index fund should be below point two five of one percent\nOkay the ones he probably had with a large employer uh been less than one tenth of one percent but at least we can get them below point two five than any extra money put in an ultra low cost index funds\nNow they sent in the occupied the change over documents that they sent to have a list of six or seven sons that are available at both ill and that you and most of them have the name of the old provider on them um and supposedly they have a lower expense ratio with the provider\nOkay so that a deal with this company is what they charge and overall administrative fees okay that's the problem is it's not the funding fees it's what they're being sued about is that they're charging massive administration administrative costs\nOkay if you do it if you just Google them and put some unfriendly word by it just put the company name and say a scam or rip off or whatever or even just put their name you'll see endless things that people have said and great anger\nAre not the human body has billions of pain receptors block those
