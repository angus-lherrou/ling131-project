make his last payment\nAnd student loans have been enormous burden in this country total across the economy one and a half trillion dollars give you a perspective that's fifty percent higher\nThen the entire outstanding credit card debt in the country for\nStudent loans the good news is that\nPeople entering college now are much more wary about taking on student loans they're playing harder to get\nColleges are having a tougher time getting people to say yes and the result is that tuition costs after going up year after year or roughly three times the rate of inflation\nNow aren't going up generally at all\nThe list price may be going up but in order to more students into their classrooms colleges are having to offer deals\nPrivate colleges had become really aggressive at offering deals and the actual cost\nOf four year degrees is not going anywhere because their increases we've had over recent years have all been because the ease of borrowing money and people unfortunately not realizing\nWhat can be lifelong implications and burns from taking on those student loans so the marketplace is now working\nAnd it's working because people are making better decisions and a lot of private colleges if you're going private instead of a a government colleges state college\nA lot of private colleges now are short if students some of that just demographics playing into the equation

changed her mind\nAnd go to that place instead of the other one where she's actually attending and I was kind of hoping she'd say monster scholarship I'm going to take it but she didn't but it was out

K just wondering if that would be the right direction to go otherwise I was looking at opening my own independent on prior\nNormally if an employer offers the option of a raw four one K.\nThe younger you are the more it becomes automatic you want to do the raw four one K. the older you are the more it becomes a question mark and then if you make huge money\nIt gives a different answer potentially as well so can I ask you Andy where you are on the age spectrum\nI'm mid thirties\nMid thirties John you want to do the the raw four oh one K. unless you make a huge salary\nAnd the reason the reason you want to do that is the value to you of the current tax deductions for a pre tax dollars going into the\nTo the regular four one K. is not worth enough with the time you have in your mid thirties for that money to grow tax\nFree and then be spent tax free and so that's why the raw four one K. is such a superior choice for you\nToo would you recommend than that I kind of that I put more money in the ... and just but it's not just are not from the traditional just by a company match\nYour company match will happen even if you're doing the wrong their match goes in is a pre tax match and will ultimately be taxed\nYou know when you spend it down the road but you don't have to be in the traditional four one K. to trigger the company match it's the active putting money in the four oh one K. whether the Ross version of the regular that triggers the company match\nOkay well thank you very much\nAnd it's because of the patterns of when people\nFly now you have a lot of business travelers

figure out the ideal number of days before travel to buy a ticket for the lowest fare\nAnd I've never found one that truly convinces me but as a practical matter buying more than Twenty one days in

S. because more pavement\nNot going to happen and besides when we do more payment all would we get is more congestion so\nI don't know if you've ever seen the picture of the three wheeled vehicle one person vehicle that I used to ride around as my only transportation and the early eighties it was called the free way I think we've posted a picture on ...\nDot com awhile back but I was way ahead of time with that and I think that is where a lot of\nClose and transportation and the U.S is going to find a home Bobby is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Bobby\nClerk doing\nGreat thank you you're trying to get your first credit card is that true\nI Am indeed yeah so I've been eating a lot of money in the past ... years and I was looking great\nBut I don't have any credit history I applied for a a major credit card to a major bank but declined for that credit card that ball history so I've been getting a lot of different people and all different places saying a lot of different things\nLearn the difference between term and whole life insurance calculate how much coverage you need and be sure you're making the right decision so whether you know a lot about life insurance or nothing at all start your search that policy genius dot com and just two minutes you can compare quotes and make an informed decision for you and your loved ones\nPolicy genius the easiest way to compare and by life insurance\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender\nWe've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rate stays locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred clicking or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nApproval only about on certain three year fixed rate loan scholar costs information in conditions people having liquor license and all the states and I'm less number thirty thirty additional conditions are solutions may apply this is John Green and if your teeth or steamed from coffee tea or smoking power swabs is the answer in five minutes you'll see two shades wider teeth and in seven days six shades even\nBut are there is no messy strips are trees that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just wipe your teeth for five minutes and you're done to try parents rubs call one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night you're black or white smile will have your friends talking about how great you look try at risk free one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine that's\nOne eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine\nSleeping bowl chasing laid rubbing coach purring bed leap instead of costs companionship wonderful what breed would you say because I have to go with a ...

I'm okay with your three percent returns\nAnd then outside of that I take a take advantage of promotional ... with my credit union that you are part of um which can pay three to five percent so I take one out for each member to my family but the problem I have it on my wife is going to become a stay at home mom\nUm she has been in the workforce for ten years so she has a four O. one K. that we're going after all over I Know that\nYou don't have to run over by the way\nWell um I Would I Would like to I Am not a big fan of where it is and okay so I I you know I've been looking at one of your low cost providers and a target fun but the problem I have is um I Know you own locks index fine so how do you get over the fact that you indirectly own\nStock the companies that you do not like\nYou know I indirectly own shares and banks that I bash all the time and so in a sense I'm hurting my own investments I also am an indirect owner of companies I don't trust and don't respect\nAnd the way I look at it is that that is\nPassive investing I'm not making the decisions and not choosing to put money in and that or not it's just part of a basket of hundreds or thousands of companies that little teeny amounts of my money go into\nAnd I just accept that that is\nWhat is a tiny part of what I'm invested in there's an expression perfect is the enemy of the good that you end up if you keep trying to do everything perfectly you end up doing nothing\nAnd so the advantage to her on balance is so great being in that target retirement fund\nThat is essentially in large part of a variety of index funds that I think you just do it and then the way you balance it is the volunteer activities in the community activities\nYour wife's involved in and you were involved in or things that really mattered to you that you can make a direct impact an active difference on\nVersus the passive that your money's invested or her money's invested\nThat sounds good I I Know you said that when it rolls over not you invest all of it right away into incrementally invest but you still apply that\nThat would not be the case in her case because she's been invested in the four oh one K. so there's nothing no need really two dollar cost average she just throw all the money right into the diversified portfolio to target retirement fund is\nHolding the very much park your inspiration to me and hopefully many others out there thanks for your\nTime thank you and congratulations to the two of you on how you live on substantially less than what you may is the key to giving you the freedom of the choices

Howard show hello Peter\n... great thank you Peter you're thinking of doing a side gig correct what kind of thing is it that I can help you with with that do you already have the idea and the expertise and all that\nI Do and I've been going on and off for a family and friends I beat IT Services so fixing computers and networks and things like that and not a thing as a real demand for it in the area I think I could make it a profitable business\nFantastic I Love that I Love it when you take what you know and go out and owned the action how can I be of help with that\nUm I guess my question is really not where to start to make it official I I'm pretty handy and in video editing and and marketing half or so I could do all that but from a business standpoint I don't know where to start but I mean south for assault sole provider or I don't know where to start with that\nWell let's first look at this is going to be a full time profession for you now right\n[noise] it would start a hard time with the goal to be fulltime because I'm actually in college at\nOh well you have the option if you want ... of the easiest path that would allow it to grow with you and already be in a format that would work for growth is to lay out the cash to set up an El Al see fat\nAnd so if you set up an El Al see mhm you can use and online vendor set one up very cheaply you have some small nuisance\nFilings in most states each year but it's not a lot uh-huh and you have a corporate shield to protect you if somebody got really sore at you about the work you did and came after you sure\nDo that is\nProbably the ah the largest benefit\nOf doing the yellow sea because if you do have that grow on you you know grows for you it becomes\nSteadily more successful you'll already have\nThe yellow sea entity in place you won't have to do that later now the downside is if you later word to abandon it you've got a little bit of paperwork to do to abandon the El Al see shut it down at a later date that's not\nA major either okay so I mean that is the the\nLowest risk lowest cost way to have a business grow for you and with you is to do it by the route of an El Al see\nAnd do you have any suggestions wanted to start because I Know you mentioned there were a couple of places that can go\nYeah I really like legal zoom okay to set up an El Al see and we have a legal zoom it's incredibly easy they're competitor no low end O L o ... also offers a route to doing in El al see\nBut and you set it up on line I just really having done this before for corporate entities an for El Al sees I've been very happy with the process on legal system\nThat can I ask you one last short question yeah is there anything you think about tax standpoint that has to be aware of given that I mean I'm Still in school\nSo there's a direct benefit to you doing this the revenue that you have from this is self employment income\nCap and self employment taxes and ugly tax but you at the same time we'll have the benefit of being able to shelter roughly a fourth of the income if you wish\nInto a set up a simple find employee pension at it which requires virtually no paperwork and it's essential your own deferred compensation plan\nThat becomes an IRA okay and so it it it gives you the ability 'cause you know you're probably low overhead at this point in your life uh-huh the cash that it throws off I'm guessing you might not need it all\nAnd so you're able to do many great things at once by differing tax on it reducing your tax obligation and building up a real reserved for the future all at once and doing so when you're extra young like you are has enormous advantages down the road\n\nLinking him or you can do it so much simpler then I said I Want you can just do business as yourself Peter and they don't have to do in El al say you don't have to do any of that and you just have self employment income from a little side business\nAnd at no point where the IRS come after me\nAnd I don't know as long as you reported that's absolutely a valid things now and so you can you can just hit the easy button on it if you want [laughter] and\nWait and see over time if it does become\nA really solid ventured then you can look at things like doing the yellow sea but you'd still have the ability\nTo do the south I talked about even if you're just doing this as a side thing under no formal legal structure the biggest advantage that would make you want to do the yellow sea is if you're doing any work that leaves you liable potentially for a law suit her\nAnd if somebody suing you is almost nonexistent thought\nWith what you're doing then you could just keep doing it as just a little side informal thing and just make money\nSo you're a choice Tanya is with us

over two thousand dollars a year about yes if you can afford to take more out of your check take more out an increase or what you're doing and the raw\nBecause you're allowed to do up to a total of about fifty five hundred in a year [noise]\nAnd so whatever amount in over time if you can just keep stepping it up a little bit whatever amount you can put in with the great bass ... been building it will just help you build so much more financial security down the road\nYeah we've had that she raised ... work so I didn't think it as I cannot national ... day now I Need to watch um\nOh so you're doing this raw in addition to doing the four one K. yeah great\n[laughter] when I started my job I had an aunt tiny like every week he goes to go get a state that that I finally did it when I first started about Twenty years ago from\nTanya that makes me love your aunt forgetting you to do that because getting all of that time in putting money in the four one K. will pay off so well for you later\nAnd that is that is a real dilemma for the wallet if you're with a ... mutual or usa who were the two a wheat insurers for auto and homeowners in the United states he so\nThere was a study recently that found that what you pay with both of them is actually generally favorable to that because\nThey are there for the policy holders is mutual ... with the premiums are reasonable but the best part is here with the best company\nAnd so it's possible you could shop and you might find a premium lower somewhere than a Mika but would that be a smart move I Would say if you can afford the premiums this would be an exception to my shopping rule for auto when homeowners\nGreat that's what I Want it can make sure I can just stay with and they came\nOut many claims have you had over the
