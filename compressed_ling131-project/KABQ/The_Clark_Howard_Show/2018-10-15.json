story earlier in the week\nAbout this this note that someone found where a girl friend laid out a bunch of rules for her boyfriend and they were sort of nuts\nThat it was a lengthy contract the illness where where did this come from\nSo a guy had bought a used car and he looked in the glove compartment and he found this contract detailing twenty two requirements that this woman made for her\nDecided the boyfriend signed at the bottom so he posted at not thinking anything of it and it went viral it's been everywhere this week he wound up having to take it down because people thought it was his own girlfriend who made it and she was being harassed on social media\nBut it was and it was some other previous outweigh the car yeah previous owner and it looks to me I'm going to give you some of the road they looked to me that this woman was a little joke that I think the boyfriend may have cheated on her and these are the rules for them to stay together\nI'm One of the ... rules

where your money is really spread out\nAcross the country and across lots of different places and you can buy and sell those instantly and you can own it it almost no cost for the management of the real estate\nOh OK engaged and I get that answer some each month has so what\nHappens with depends on if you go in a retreat or wheat index fine so if you buy an actual publicly traded real estate investment trust they pay you back over time\nThe uh the money you've invested and potentially any earnings they're having\nIf you own I'm a ... index like I'm I just pulled one out while we're talking and like here's one that twelve percent of it is and medical buildings\nSix percent and hotels I'm six percent is an industrial buildings\nFourteen percent is in office buildings sixteen percent is in apartments I mean that's you know and that's what they do they divide out all different buildings all different types\nAnd that way you're not subject to the risk of any one industry\nOkay and\nThere are many of these available you can buy I mean it through another term as you besides ... which is Ari IT up all the other is ATF exchange traded fund\nThat's how you would buy one of these you can many I mean by for free you know no commission going in and no commission going out and then just very very low management expenses each and every month\nOkay and that kind of faith compare to stock market [laughter]\nWell it it is a just a different form of investment you know real estate if you ask somebody and oh five of real estate was safe everybody would tell you it was the greatest by oh nine people would say it's a nightmare right right and so it's all about diversifying what you do\nThe stock market is only risky in the short term not in the long term owning real estate is risky and the short term but not necessarily in the long term catch\nSo going into a private placement and you know a a private venture where you own different buildings that's a lot riskier than owning a wide real estate investment trust to read because the money is not is diversified and\nYou're stuck with them if light or you want to be done with them and that makes me very uncomfortable with the one that's not publicly traded\nMates with us on the Clark Howard show how are you doing Nate\nGood how are your car great thank you you want to talk about your child's what's the story\nYou know I sat on the other day after listening ear show and I was going to freeze my child's\nCredit but got the gears turning and wondered if it would be a good thing to open a credit card in their name before doing that and the reason that data a idea came up is when I was young and getting my first\nCar loan I had no credit just like everybody else does so I thought maybe I could use the credit card in their name responsibly so then when they got all the age to need credit it can sort of hit the ground running with already having a a good history\nSo I just kind of wondered what you thought about that\nWell I liked the idea especially if your kid doesn't have possession of the card how old is your child\nTo have a nine year old a seven year old a four year old so no they won't be using the card\nYeah I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about it yet they're too young to even to worry about establishing credit and the way this tablets and credit will work and let's say a decade\nCould be very different than it is today there's a lot of computer modeling that's being tested\nWhere the ability to grant credit will no longer necessarily be based on somebody having credit it can be based on things like how somebody does paying apartment rent\nOr like the cell phones we were just talking about how somebody does paying a cell phone bill that there's behavioral analysis that is far more sophisticated\nAnd is considered to be potentially a much better predictor of how people will handle debt than what we use right now with traditional credit scores so with your kids as young as they are\nI think it would be at this point over thinking at you know I thought you were going to tell me you have a child who was like sixteen\nAnd that way I see a good time to start something like that it under today I mean I Am not a yes around eight I just remember when I\nTried to tried to start this when I was young is you know you start with no credit and it was just kind of frustrating 'cause nobody would even look at you with\nExactly well that's why it just kinda and they told me back then the best way to get credit was to use a credit card responsibly and then go from there\nAnd that advice is still is sound when you were told it then is it is today but by the time your kids are older I'm not sure that will be the advice\nOh also freezing their credit today you've got a lot of paperwork to do to freeze a child's credit but it sure is peace of mind for them because children are so much more likely to have their identities stolen than an adult\nWall it never even crossed my mind until you said you know somebody could use it without even knowing it which is totally true I just thought well\nYou know they'll assume that it's a nine year old child they're down by a car but for the call so [laughter]\nWell I I'm Sorry about that I Wish that the credit reporting industry did a better job and didn't make it so easy for people to steal the identity of a child but it would cost the industry more money\nFor the software that would that would actually prevent all the children's in any theft incidents that doesn't really hurt them it just hurts you and your kids

where it's about you learning ways to keep more of what you make [noise]\nWe have a spot five family plan [noise]\nAnd so we pay if I remember right it's Fifteen dollars a month and all of his share the one spot a five membership I say all of us I don't really listen to music so\nWasted on me but it's something that we do as\nIndividuals and the family where each of us have our own playlists and it's all part of the one master subscription versus paying a typical one person membership for ten bucks same goes on with Netflix where we pay for being able to have multiple streams at a time\nAnd on YouTube TV we pay for the ability to have multiple streams at once each of us have our own unlimited DVR\nAnd spot if I\nGot all fired up that people were pretending to be family sharing a membership\nInstead of getting ten bucks a person a month they were getting three bucks a person among ... actually a little west and so spot if I started cracking down\nAnd using a location ability to figure out that one person was over here and somebody else was over there and they couldn't possibly both be living under the same roof so they were invited\nAnd there was a huge backlash and spot if I backed down\nThe reality is the right answer for all of this is how Netflix handles Netflix does not care who you consider to be part of your family they handle it by limiting how many streams you can have the time\nAnd part of their whole economic system is planning for that so to them it doesn't matter if one of us on the west coast is watching it and one of us on the east coast is watching it\nThat we're all part of the family membership Netflix offers a much cheaper membership if it's just one person\nSpot if I\nHas created part of its own problem by making a one person membership so much money more than three times what it is effectively per person on a family membership\nSo there's no way that companies are going to be able to please what an individual considers to be the members of their family group\nAnd one person is paying the bill\nSo know that most providers notice except it and that as a family group you should look to see is there a way for you to do this as a family membership and save money on whatever streaming service it is\nI think about though the difficulty for people who operate in the old media traditional pay TV packages wherever you get them\nThat required everyone being one physical location and obviously that business model is over\nKelly's with this on the Clark Howard show hello Kelly\nHi Kelly how may I be of service to you\nWell my dad listens to you all the times I think it is anyone can get any advice it would be hill I'm but I'm In my collection after college and I'm struggling to figure out how to handle it hey independents my bachelor's degree I think I tried to make every outlet and I just don't have any more options that you know it's like\nI Can't get any financial aid because my dad took out the lump sum when he retired and it looks like ... making more than he actually is and they refused to sign on the line with me and that they didn't give me any financial aid um they only offered me sixty five hundred dollars in student loans for the air\nUm and my tuition is twenty eight thousand dollars el\nAmrani I got there twenty eight is that a state school at twenty eight or is that a private university at twenty eight it's\nOut of state uh okay so are you thinking about dropping out or something\nAnd we had an office manager from a radiology practice who had posted when I was complaining about the medical collection items and what she said and our court stinks was that they don't even know\nHow to find the the person who has a bill for the radiology is reading and so they don't have any other way of getting their money other than turning it over to a collection agency then goes out and tries to find the person who I was the money\nSo I don't know why that is a cork stinks it's more like medical billing stinks right absolutely\nSo I appreciate what you're asking 'cause I'm sure it's frustrating for you over and over again trying to help a member secure that car loan or mortgage and then you run into a brick wall because of something they didn't even know was there\nYes they had me personally as well so am I empathize with\nWell I'm interested in your thought about a notification period before an item goes on collection I'd love to hear from others dog if they have an idea how the strategy your suggestion because the UFO\nKind of build that comes out of nowhere is even though medical may only be half of the collection items it seems the ones that just come out of nowhere that people don't know about it's virtually a hundred percent medical\nAnd we do need some procedure like you're suggesting so that people will know 'cause it's not a matter most of the time of somebody being able to pay a thirty eight dollar bill is they don't know that thirty eight dollar

idea of being a Mac saver is not about a magical date like eight thirty that you're able to just bag work forever and I that's an oversimplification\nOf what any financial independence movement should be about and so I Will make sure that I deal in the new ones that you address there\nGoing forward and the idea of people\nHitting aged thirty having a million dollars never working and the other day in their lives that's not really what this financial independence movement should be about and I will continue to deal with the layers involved in it\nBut as for click bait hey\nThat is so much part of how the Internet operates because you're dealing with people's very busy lives and you think about all the things that people post with the click bait kind of headlines in every topic area\nJust to try to get people to click on something so the FIRE movement is no more guilty of that than any other part of the Internet\nClark it sounds like you're when you're out shopping on Thanksgiving instead

Mobile and that is\nHow important it is with the changes they made in their network likely to have the new frequencies\nThat run at six hundred megahertz and seven hundred megahertz because the coverage you get now blankets the country T Mobile used to have sort of full coverage outside of core big metro areas\nAnd now they have fantastic coverage if you have the new frequencies there's not

advice is to log in and change the pen\nClearly Clark has not done this himself as is not possible experience offers no mechanism to reset at Penn or even contact them to reset a pen I even tried calling customer service but couldn't get past the robots so in the end I've had to file a complaint with the CFPB Phoebe to try and get experience it changed my PIN\nI Know this is more of an experience stinks but Clarke should have at least research the process before recommending resetting the Penn thanks Todd\nTried I appreciate that I'm really sorry about my lack of clarity with the Experian pen vulnerability and the problem with it is that even if you've gone through the process of freezing your credit\nThere is the potential that a criminal would be able to do all your credit behind your back without even realizing buying things as if they're you or getting credit as if they are you\nAnd experience process is trouble prone obviously you can't reach people they're the best thing to do this is the suggestion that has come from others in the identity protection or what do we call it advocacy\nArea is that you go ahead and actually kill\nYour credit freeze with Experian remove it you can do that on line then go back on line and start over and set up a new\nCredit freeze with Experian and then you won't have to worry about whether or not you can reach someone or get
