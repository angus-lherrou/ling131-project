synagogue shooting suspect powers that used to appear before a court hearing later today Steve cast inbound has more on the man accused of killing eleven people inside the house of worship\nGood how can I serve him\nWell thank you for taking my call I really think the show for a long time\nWell I'm Glad to have you here\nThink yeah I'm twenty four years old and\nI don't have any that are there and I'm like ... ... or ... and then make them batch forty five a year and my question in regards to my brother he is ... ...\n... ... out of ... going fine today the check I Can't I mean anything can happen at that and there's nothing that he could fall back on like they have that have paid off\nAnd said the only way thinking about possibly at least in the house and have to live off that in\n... when I my question is why it\nWow how interesting so if your parents were to pass away and they own a home free and clear and you're trying to come up with how are you going to have enough money to support your young brother\nYou are a real sweetheart to be more of trying to come up with the solutions for this good for you\nAnd so the idea of at time of your\nParents passing to turn the home into a rental property that I guess you would manage for the money hanging a benefit to your brother\nI think that that may be unduly complicating the situation where what I Would think would make more sense is to sell the home\nAt the time that your parents might pass away and besides we don't know unless your parents or an extreme failing health they can be with us for decades to come right\nRight so so that possibility of the home being a potential answer for your brother it's just too hard to say that right now\nSo I like the idea of better of your parents instructing in their will that if you are to be the executive tricks that the home be sold in the proceeds be put into a trust that you manage for the benefit of your brother well okay\nThat way you you have no idea what's going to be going on in your life all the years later hopefully your parents are going to live a long long time and who knows what circumstances will be at the time they would no longer occupy the house no longer be on this earth\nAnd so there there's more flexibility if you didn't have money that you then have available to see that the care of your brother\nOkay yeah I mean we think about that and you know like that that the you know it probably a ... that guy and I guess I can than it actually ... now I have that as an option that ... it into she chaired by you know\nYour parents can do some things right now potentially for the advantage of your brother they can set up what's known as a um five twenty nine ABLE account\nAb Ali this is an account for children or dependence have special needs of some kind of current and so it's an account that your parents can contribute fourteen thousand\nOurs maximum to each year and the money can then turn around and grow tax free for your brother's benefit and then when the money is spent on his needs and care than the money is spent what's in it and all its earnings tax free\nOh these are new accounts and if your parents have looked at this stuff before they may not even be aware that this is a new opportunity for people to put money aside for a child who has a you can be various types of special needs\nThat farm okay yeah we didn't know that that would that would make great\nDo you think you're a parent and afford to put aside that kind of money for your brother each year\nNow I Know I don't think they can\nOkay All right so let's talk about one other possibility either your mother your father or either both of them in good health\nYeah than acts not how\nSo another way that people find that needs for a child that they're worried about how when they're gone is to buy a life insurance policy where the proceeds are better paid into a trust for the benefit of your brother\nOkay\nAnd that is a relatively low cost way to take care of your brother's needs in the future\nAnd to keep it simple your parents would ah in the insurance policy that they would each by they would name you is the trustee\nAnd you would administer the trust because then it's a whole lot cheaper than if you hire a third party like a bank to handle it was for your brother\nAnd he said\nWell that sounds like a plan a Keystone line\nAnd if your parents are part of any association for autistic children if they are in any support group there'll be people in their who've done this stuff that we're talking about and we'll be able to be of some help to them likely\nOkay fine yeah they have to ... miles on it than that\nMaybe you got a lot going on in your own life but I'm so proud of you know that yeah you own your own home at twenty four yeah\nIt's great that is wonderful how you're handling your finances Robert's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Robert\nClark thanks for taking my call\nSure you want to talk about life insurance\nI Do I Do I'm I'm sixty one years old Clark I've been paying on this policy is so true which is roughly almost forty thousand dollars I'm\nAt the air we have longevity in my family which ah if I go to Ninety One I'll have a total of about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars at two hundred and fifty thousand dollar life I'll see\nExcept for you not in a participating one where the actual cash value will rise overtime above the stated amount\nNo it will not rise above the state or amount\nNo\nReally correct so you know hey over those decades a total it would equal roughly Seventy five percent of the face amount of the policy\nThat's correct that sounds like a pretty lousy policy yeah it [laughter] yes I Believe it is and that's really what I meant it now where\nYou know we want to meet those benefits we don't eat those benefits at this time with resources that are you know more than a substantial pay for any funeral expenses so\nMy question was does it come to the point where I cashed out to just get term insurance level term or just continue our\nI'm going to give you a process where you'll know exactly what to do with it exactly have enough money at stake you want to do what I'm about to tell you okay there's a nonprofit organization called the consumer federation of America\nHas a service that evaluates existing life insurance policies or they'll be able to tell you where the exact precision\nIf you should keep this policy dump it converted borrow against it cash it out what would be the right move for you\nAnd it's pretty involved what they do so it costs a hundred and twenty five dollars for them to do OK evaluation but compared to the money you have a stake that's laughing\nAgree I agree\nSo I'm going to give you a website you can go to that is a dedicated Web site to this from the consumer federation of America where you can see exactly what documentation you've got to get together for them to run the full analysis for you\nVery good\nAt the website is of value weight life insurance dot org okay and they're basically only charging you with their time costs is to do it because this is a non profit\nOn this story sound

don't live as well as their parents did\nAnd then where people in America are living as well or better than their parents did and I tell you particularly last decade when we had the banking scandals and the great recession immediately following when I Would give speeches I Would ask\nWho thinks their kids are going to have a better life and they had who thinks they're going to have a worse like well those were very pessimistic days but overwhelmingly people would say that their kids were going to have a worse life economical even they had and that is not how it's worked out overall in America\nKids continue generally better economic success than their parents have had\nBut there's a clear divide and it was also clear geographically generally in the south east\nKids or not doing as well as their parents\nIn the mid west kids are doing much better economically than their parents which is interesting if you think about the years that the mid west or suffered to as the rust belt and all that and the lack of jobs and everything\nBut what was clear looking around the country and I just gave two examples there the dividing line was absolutely education\nThat in areas of the country where there's a big emphasis on education kids do significantly better than their parents had done economically\nIn areas the U.S in the southeast more than most anywhere else\nEducation is not valued as much and going to college not nearly as valued and college participation rates in a number of southern states or some of the lowest in the United states\nKids do not have the economic mobility or economic success of their parents\nCollege is not for everybody and it's not even necessarily about college but it's about going on to technical school states for technical school trade school where you weren't skills that are in demand in the marketplace\nBut in an economy that now demands more and more knowledge and skill\nKids not getting the education\nIs what creates what's known by a condom is\nBy the awkward in terrible phrase downward mobility I don't want that phrase they have to be used I Want your kids to have upward mobility that's what you want them to have and so I encourage you to encourage your kids wherever you live in the country\nTo understand the importance of education and training\nTo get into a career and education and training threw out there

it wisely so she can live off the interest each month and not crack the golden egg\nConfusing since this seems contrary to your normal advice\nSo the reason I like for someone with a pension to not take the lump sum is that the biggest problem people face in retirement is that they outlived their money\nIn order to generate a kind of return that you suggested five to ten percent would require somebody to be way out on the risks meter in what they're choosing to invest in and many people tend to be\nOf such your mind that money would only go into CDs or savings accounts which will never generate the kind of money that you'll be able to generate from an ongoing payout\nFrom a pension rather than taking a lump sum all up front so it sounds incredibly conservative on my part but in

don't ask a collar some details that the rest of us would love to know it might be because you already know that is by the info that was given to you from your screener but we don't for example last week a woman called about buying a business franchise in a house at the same time\nYou advised her to wait on the house\nBut what was the franchise even just knowing that type of franchise if not the brand would be something it's like watching a suspenseful movie and having to cable having the cable cut out just before the mystery is solved thank you and you don't really stink\n[laughter] [laughter] well gosh I remember so many of the calls today usually it's like it's such a jumble so when I took that call\nUm I never asked what franchise because I Would have gone down a whole pretty quickly that I never would've addressed\nThe house and the franchise issue that I talked about because with franchises I so strongly recommend somebody go work in a business before they ever buy a franchise\n'cause it's not as important to me what the franchise was I didn't have that information\nAnd if I asked it and they said it then I Would have had to be careful how I Would have spoken about that specific company that specific enterprise and the advice may have sounded fuzzy at that point I made a decision\nNot to ask and maybe you're right maybe a lot of people were sitting there saying well what franchise what franchise\nAnd maybe I should have handled it differently\nClark love your advice keep it up I think you missed out on the tariffs issue I support free trade the problem is that China restricts access to their markets and requires offset\nYou gave an example of America strengthen the aircraft industry the fact is Boeing was only allowed to sell their aircraft in China after they agree to a technology transfer and to move the assembly the seven thirty seven to China you give an example of Google\nFact is Google was only allowed to enter the Chinese market after they agreed to filters that met\nChinese propaganda standards Google was given an ultimatum agreed the propaganda filters or China will steal their search technology build their own search

and time will tell if the tariffs which are taxes on the goods we buy are going to be effective as a way to deal with\nSome of the behavior of some of the practices in China there's no doubt that
