an inheritance and deciding what to do with it and now my daughter is not engaged but\nUh we like to ... away for some future wedding and she's in her mid thirties and and in my experience um\nIf she ... her own money she's very particular about what she does she's spending money it's\nShe wants to be real creative and I want to get on the same page as my wife and what I'd like to do is set it aside and the fun for a future date but one of the time comes\nActually a gift ... as a budget and say this is what have you determine lawyer trade offs are rather than getting in the middle of it or I really liked this five\nThousand dollar wedding yeah as opposed to a thousand dollars\nSo I I I'm I'm trying to convince my wife and she's kind of on board it's just our experience with her she's a very good money manager if it's her money ... money it's different\nYeah the sky's the limit well first of all I'm Sorry about your loss of a loved one that we're talking about it on Herod and oh I\nAppreciate that uh as far as your idea of course I'm going to love your idea because that's what I did with my oldest daughter oh really\nYeah I sat down her and her fiance when they got engaged and I said here's money for you for your wedding whatever you spend\nIs yours disband if you spend more that comes out of your pocket if you spend less you have the money for a down payment on the house the two of you want\nAnd guess what they say cut every corner and saved every dollar they could and spent substantially less than what I had given them and that was fine with me\nBecause they then all the decisions of what really mattered were decisions they made\nAnd and that's exactly or I'm going with it I Know she can manage it uh but it's just you know anything about a down payment on our house or something like that\nThat show shoes that rather than a destination weddings or something you see thanks you know it's unlimited ... I don't have unlimited funds\nAnd by the way on the stress something I talk about recently is that um women are now spending much less money\nOn wedding dresses and they used to a lot of wedding independent wedding shops are closing around the country because a lot of this generation uh brides don't believe in spending big money on address\nThat she may she may surprise you that way but again when you say it's almost like giving somebody a voucher and you say you stretch this voucher as much as you want\nAnd it's yours to stretches you wish and if you spend less than that voucher the tears to keep it changes the whole psychology and the economics I support your idea completely of just giving her a lump sum\nWell thanks very much that's what I Want to sit here\nAnd by the way if she chooses and whoever are intended would be they choose to go get married at the courthouse or do a simple quiet ceremony at their religious congregation and that's what they choose to do the rest of that money should still be there to do with what they want\nAnd I agree and I actually structure to make the decisions I just don't trust her if she thinks it's my money that she spent\nA hundred percent [laughter] we're talking the same thing here\n[laughter] okay All right well thank you very much for your call a year\nAnd John is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi John\n[noise] hey clerks crate you are the comedy I really appreciate you taking my call\nGreat to have you here you have a question that's been on a lot of inquiring minds about ways to watch TV hit me with it\nWell I'm I'm trying to save my parents a little bit of money on their TV bill ... upwards of two hundred dollars with all the bundling stuffed together here oh yeah with the with the bottling with the whole the whole phone and on the Internet it's it's it's over two hundred bucks so they're kind of on a fixed budget and I'm just trying to\nSee if I can help them out a little bit with that um I was looking at a a major carriers a plan of of of limited data I'm getting my parents to watch a lot of TV uh so I'm just wondering if it's something like that would work for them\nAs far as choosing the unlimited data on that kind of a plan for being able to watch a streaming streaming service\nYeah and a ... or either of your parents' past fifty five\nYes so they're eligible for the fifty five plus plans that both T Mobile and sprint offer that are Seventy dollars a month total with T Mobile I think it's a little higher was sprint and it's not just talk normally they all go ahead\n... all those the one that uh they were looking at yeah\nYeah so with T Mobile bay we're the pioneers even before on limited data that allowed unlimited streaming and so yeah the thing with the streaming though\nIs if they're going to project from their phone to their television it are only streams at standard definition\nA so if they gotten really into the high def pictures they're not going to have that unless they pay for a more premium plan with T Mobile right goes it if I remember right it streams that four eighty pee\nOn this standard fifty five plus unlimited plan was Seventy a month\nIs so cheap maybe they could get used to the pictures not being as good on the TV\n[noise] yeah that's the thing they do watch uh my dad has limited mobility each day so he watches a lot of TV so yeah I was just wondering how that worked at the end up watching a ton of it I myself I don't really show it it wouldn't really be an issue but ah yeah it kind it kind of got used to watching it\nHigh dash and they do watch a lot of it\nYou'd have to have them on a higher price plan with T Mobile they allow the streaming in high death and I am I think it's twenty dollars more a month a line so instead of being Seventy year would be one ten if I remember right\nOn Ken okay but then they're able to watch and high death\nAnd in order to to watch the high def on a TV from their phone there are these wireless devices you can buy now the cost I think about forty dollars that will project what's on your phone straight to your TV\nOh really yeah and another so a chrome cast which is the way most people would do that ... is going to require a home wife find network\nAnd I don't know if they're going to have any home Internet anymore when they make these changes\n[noise] yeah it's a typical thing where you

here in the United states rivals Sam song in overall market share\nAnd So Apple\nFiled a complaint with the Justice Department that I shared with you I think last year\nAbout any competitive moves of Eighteen ... and they were blocking the implementation of a much more efficient way for cell phones to operate known as ...\nAnd if you heard as part of the buzz about the new iPhones that they come with ease some capability everywhere else in the world except the United states people routinely switch cell phone carriers on a whim\nMost places people buy coverage for no more than a month sometimes even for a week at a time in other countries and in many places people will do a survey by service from more than one cell phone companies simultaneously\nIf somebody is even hard for us to fathom in the United states\nWith our behemoth cell phone carriers\nPeople tend to stay with year after year after year and therefore we pay generally much higher rates than people do elsewhere in the

right from your own phone on the go\nOr right from your own home or office whenever you want and then switch back whenever you want as well\nIt creates strikes fear and the hearts of cell phone carriers and that's why in the United states only is it this big push that you have this little plastic chip called the sim card put in your phone\nAnd it slows everything down with people feeling free to switch from one to another\nApple didn't feel like it could launch these phones\nAs each Sam only but they have any ... capability and also a place for chip\nBut the whole idea is that in the

financial independence retire early and so for anybody that wants to save a huge percentage of what they make it gives them a lot of options you know if they eventually decide that they don't want to

frugal from the point you were\nAnd usually as is so true with people and the FIRE movement it doesn't mean they never work again it just means they choose to work\nBecause they've achieved the

I don't have any business credit history um they have to collect personal credit\nWhen the gym I tell ya I Do that any way you could be in your own business for Fifteen Years and they all still pull your personal credit and they will also pierce what's known as the corporate veil and almost always require you to sign a personal guarantee\nSo what I Would recommend to you is don't borrow money as a business borrow money as an individual\nThat you use for the business purposes you'll still be able to deduct the interest as a business expense where you could not personally but it's money that you're using for operating capital for your business\nAnd the terms and conditions you're under let's say as an example you use a personal credit card\nTo buy things for your business\nYou just pay the bill through the business and you recognize the expense and the interest if you pay any interest on the cars as business expenses and that is a perfectly acceptable legitimate business purpose for you to do\nThe card that's good advice what what about um how our that they can generate business credit history\nWell okay so when you refer to business credit history people usually referring to a DMV report\nDone and Brad street and that's based on trade lines how you pay the bills you have if somebody or you buy a product or service and they send you a bill net tenor net thirty over time you may end up with a D and be and so ...\nThat is the business equivalent of something like a credit score for a business and so that's how\nPeople might decide let's say you're buying from a supplier and they're trying to decide if they should be a willing to extend your net net Fifteen that thirty whatever and they may in fact go look\nAt a DMV report those have become much less important generally than they used to be because until you get real size of your business\nPeople are generally expecting you to pay on delivery or pay at time or order\nSo I'm looking at those services as well you have any recommendations for Easter says\nYeah I'm packet eight is one that business owners are very happy with eight X. eight dot com\nIn addition to that that's that's strictly a business phone system that allows such flexibility it's mind blowing there's also whom for business\nWhich is a very popular business phone service now oh well we may have to go to a low in may dot com and then you go to their business service\nAnd I think those two are the ones that are best known as far as having a veal I. P. type business phone service\nGreat I appreciate your help\nOkay and best of luck to you with your business Sandra is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Sandra\nHello Clark how're you doing I'm great\nYou have a travel question that is one of the ones I loved that you're asking me before you try to do it\nYes [laughter] [noise] ah my question is I Would like to fly to Europe and the origin of flight is much cheaper from another town and that they have a stopover in my town so can I get on at the stopover\nYou cannot you can do half a loaf I'll tell you how to do half a loaf OK okay\nYou have to do a carry on and what you can do is you can split the fair difference if you buy the more expensive fair from your home town to Europe\nAnd then on the return you do what's known as an open jaw ... by the return that comes through your home city going back to where the fair is a lot cheaper\nWhen you get off the plane in your home city and go through immigration and customs you have to ... I actually don't even have to do a carry on because you you have to claim your bags go through immigration and customs and then re check your bag for the domestic flight you can keep going and go home\nSo let me explain how that works let's say the fair from your home city to Europe just argument's sake is seven hundred round trip and the special fair you see is four hundred round trip\n... if you'd do it the way I'm Talking about is an open jaw you would pay five fifty for your fair you wouldn't get the four hundred but you pay five Fifteen you wouldn't have to go through the inconvenience of going to the city and buying a ticket to the city where the cheapest fare actually starts from\nRight okay and what about the other way around like if you want to go and the direction of the cheaper city you can go\nThis how cheap is this cheap fair to Europe\nOr it's half\nOh it is how All right so in the range or like three fifty round trip let's say\nOr maybe five fifty\nFive fifty All right so you buy the five fifty\nAnd then you have to buy one way ticket\nFrom your home town to go to wear that five fifty starts from in domestic fares are so cheap ... save a substantial amount of money you get there you take the flight back right to where you started from connect to the flight to Europe\nWhen you come back you only needed a one way to go to the starting point because you can do what I said coming back you get to the city where you land back in the United states go through them and customs and instead of taking the connecting flight you go home\nRight okay\nSo you're not going to save the full five fifty but you'll say most of it because you might pay a hundred to get to the starting point right\nRight and so how do I do that like on line or do they call them how\nDo you know no no do you do all this on line so you buy one way ticket can be on anybody but you buy one way ticket best on the airline you're going to go international on right to where the cheap flights start is is one of the deals that's popping up out of Miami Fort Lauderdale are aware of it yes Miami\nAll right so there's so many cheap fares to Miami from all around the country and Fort Lauderdale she just by the one way down there then you start your international trip from Miami\nComeback doesn't even have to be going over through your home city just make sure the return is one that connects through your home city and you just get off the plane there and that's why you don't need light from Miami back to your home market\nRight okay that's that's that makes sense yeah thank you so much\nSure have a great day you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\nOnly Florida in Albuquerque rented a scam Thirteen fifty\nNine ... does not look like a number two I don't know

off\nThe wall Street Journal is doing a continuing\nSeries about how business is being disrupted by climate change regardless of where you are in the political spectrum wherever you however you think climate change is caused the reality is\nPeople and business in corporate America now calculate based on an increase in the possibility of floods storms natural disasters\nShortages of water and all the rest because of climate change and this whether you believe that it's caused by us as humans or do you believe it's a natural cycle of the planet\nWhatever it is you're comfortable believing about that the reality is it's happening and there are things you and I have to be prepared for\nIn order to protect our wallets and one of the things that I Want you to consider and it's been so clear with natural disasters leading to flooding\nIs that so many homes that have flooded and businesses that are flooded in recent years\nAre places that historically had not seen flooding or seen flooding to the degree that we have now\nWe have to think wider\nAbout decisions we make specifically with insurance one of the things the wall Street Journal's men writing about is that insurers light to be able to calculate risk and right now they're models\nAren't working and they're having a really hard time figuring out what is a reasonable calculation of risk and ultimately this is gonna sound weird but his interest rates rise\nInsurers are going to find that more and more of the cost of this uncertainty are gonna be baked into the premiums un I pay so when you're looking for a place to live or a place to locate your business\nHigher ground is an automatic better way to protect your wallet\nAnd is came up so recently in the tragedy that hit the Carolinas from the never ending rain from the hurricanes and tropical storm\nIs that only somewhere around two percent of dwellings had flood insurance if you are in a lower lying area even one that has not historically seen flooding\nYou should take this is an important lesson to protect your wallet by having a flood insurance policy if you were a small business owner\nBecause of the unpredictability of weather patterns if you don't have business interruption insurance it's something you should consider so many businesses and areas stricken by disaster\nClothes and never reopened because they're broken financially so think about like any good business person would do\nThink about how you prepare for the unexpected and the decisions you make where you live where you locate your business\nAnd then based on where you live or where you locate your business ensuring against disaster\nIs the kind of thing you need to do to protect yourself going forward do you know in Texas where people were so hard hit by Harvey last year is hardly the name of the storm yeah Harvey so many people\nWere under insured or uninsured for the flooding that occurred and they still have not been able to recover\nSo insurance is key and the federal flood insurance program is subsidized by your a fellow taxpayers you go to flood smart dot Gov you'll see how it works and remember higher ground is a better idea Susan is\nMost of the time

Clark that's where you post a question for me a car dot com and then Joel ask your question for you\nHave Joe ... got a question from Patrick he says what are the main differences between banks and credit unions what are the advantages or disadvantages of\nBoth so that's not a fair question to ask me 'cause I'm I Am frightfully biased on this one credit unions are co ops owned by their members\nSo there's no stockholders to pay dividends to there's no stockholders are trying to make a profit on the stock\nCredit unions are designed from the ground up to serve their membership so if\nThey are able to generate what is the equivalent in a co-op of for profit they can then use that to lower the cost for their members\nLower the interest rate on loans off or better deals on credit cards maybe um make it even easier for people to have\nFree checking accounts\nHigher rates on savings so credit unions because they serve a different purpose they are serving their members that own it\nIs entirely different experience than being at a bank\nBut credit unions aren't for everybody in many cases if you were a small business person you will be much better served by a very small bank in fact a very small bank for someone who owns his or her own business is vastly superior to a bank\nOf any size or you know a big bank or regional bank they both of those do a terrible job of serving a small business the same time credit unions generally are wired all about serving a consumer an individual with family\nAnd they're not really about serving a small business some are but that's generally not what their purpose is in their goal so I Would say the dividing line is consumers will be much better served by being at a credit union\nThe small business would probably be better served by going to a small local bank there aren't as\nMany of those as there used to be but they're still out there and you just got to hunt for them and you'll probably be very happy to

must be like a diplomatic pouch the size of a\nMack truck if it's all in cash that\nThat led to another person again with an African sounding accent who was going to be the diplomats agent in Atlanta
