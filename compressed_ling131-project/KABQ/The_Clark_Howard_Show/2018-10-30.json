Know a a ...\nStarted contributed and all there that I thought well wait to see how it's supposed to get the money [noise] well when I did that then is to ask me for my bank routing address and everything and I feel very uncomfortable with just with this situation especially with all the hacking that has taken place with Facebook and most recently as well\nYou know that sort of thing to do with ah with the bigger players go find me and the smaller imitate or the Facebook\nFinding option or you have to give your checking account so they have the place to put your money into\nIt and I did uh did go fund me as well as I said at one I haven't actually given any either one of 'em a banking information of course I was waiting to consult with you as a volunteer for years appreciate your it is\nAbsolutely so first things first I Hope that you get the insulin pump as quickly as possible\nAnd second with both of them go ahead and give them your checking account information 'cause that's how you're going to get money the way it works is you don't get the money minus their credit card merchant processing fees that bell charge right\nSo what happened was go find me used to their

and fundraising campaigns and all they do is charge you\nFor their costs with a credit card companies and that's exactly what Facebook is doing also\nDid look very similar there um when I looked into the details of the ... it was very compatible in what they were doing a most\nMore people like you said with the job I felt a lot more comfortable with that shot of ah do fun me or that it's just so many people are used that successfully but I could not get any feedback at the time from Facebook's for a fundraiser Programme I nut known anybody that had used it\nI'd never and the first person I've

other sources of income middle who the mole and I'm retired but I keep getting emails from an organization that uh\nIs is pushing something called an infinite banking concept and I can't find out anything about it except that it looks like it's tied to a [noise] a dividend paying whole life insurance\nYeah yeah but you got it and I was out\nFor a month that for a you don't want to learn that for insurance and that I just didn't know if it was a a viable thing for retirement income\nYou know I don't like this at all and it's something that has been patched so many different ways in recent years I've had a lot of calls recently that people have referred to it as a seven oh two Jay ... and things like that where\nWhere the people pitching this stuff make it sound like it's magical that it's like a loophole in the tax code or whatever and life insurance does have a in certain circumstances\nSome tax advantage to it but the problem with using whole life insurance\nAs a vehicle to find some amount of retirement is that the expenses and commissions involved with the whole life insurance policy or so gigantic\nThat and the fish and sea\nMoney is not very good there's such a focus on if you do this you're going to avoid tax that that's the whole big pitch but one thing you mentioned you said you were doing a regular IRA do you know what so superior\nTo this strategy that it's being pitched around whole life insurance and on any time somebody calls me and asked me about using whole life insurance as a way to pay for retirement and I'll ask for you fully finding a Roth IRA\nRoth IRA beats any life insurance policy three hundred and sixty five days this year because there is only three sixty five is not a leap year it was pure beat at three hundred and sixty six days\nSo your darling you're doing good strategies the only modification I Would make is instead of contributing to a regular IRA anymore I was instead contribute to a Roth IRA\nWell if if I only have like two years or so to retire lend is that going to pay off\nWell I don't know how much money you would put into a whole life insurance policy\nWell I'm not going to do that at all\nOkay but if you worry if you were considering and you were thinking of doing that whatever money you would have potentially put into that put that instead into a raw even put it aside up to your past age fifty\nThis

scroll down\nWould all at Clark dot com you'll see the phone number or an hours available for free off the air advice\nOn TALK about something that I had so many questions about\nDuring the great recession don't get as many questions about resumes is I used to and there's such a change and how particularly larger companies treat a resume\nCompared to how they were treated in the past also job applications that are filed electronically how they're treated by employers okay this is weird weird weird\nBigger companies that either except electronic applications written ones or resumes\nHave them scanned by software almost exclusively on at least the first round never reviewed by human\n'cause big companies that people know of and are aware of get zillions of applications\nAnd they don't want to spend the time or the labor looking through them so they have them scanned for key words based generally on the skill set of the job they're hiring for\nAnd so and you can find lots of this information online about how the key word should be position\nBut you want to make sure you're using industry terminology it relates to the job that you're applying for if you're doing something in the IT field or tax\nWhatever a\nCertification initials you have whatever skills you have whatever training you've had that's gotta be prominently and clearly written on an electronic application a written one or a resume to be picked up by the scan to get through the first cut\nBut here's a dirty little secret you need to know particularly with larger employers\nFixes in most jobs are what's called wired the applicant they intend to hire for that job is already known before their job is posted\nYou are given false hope in most cases they're actually interested in you even if you make it through the electronic cuts may be a human review somebody calls you for a phone interview recalls un for an in person interview and you think wow this is great I'm On my way to working here\nAnd all on\nTheir playing you because they're just trying to meet the requirements that HR is laid out for them at these big companies\nThat they show that they've had a diversity of applicants before they made their final hiring decision who's the person they intended to higher before the job was ever posted anyway\nThe key thing for you when you're looking for a job or a new opportunity people hire people\nForget the machines it is the rare exception that somebody makes it through that clutter to get a job when it was not a situation already wired you need to be the one that jobs wired for\nAnd\nThe most important thing when you're looking for work ignore the giant employers pay or slow growth entities many times actually reducing headcount overtime the larger company gets the less

yourself\nGood good you want to talk about your mom\nYes my mother is Ninety years young and she has decided to sell her home timely so\nShe has been living on her own up to Ninety years of age\nUh killed just about eight months ago yes wow very receptive\n[laughter] Ah yes very um so what she did with the proceeds from the house she's not going to purchase another home she's going to continue living with me\nAnd so the money will be for the purpose of living expenses for her\nA living expenses or on a Sunday Kay she does need a care in a rehab or hospital or nursing how\nOkay All right so ah and then ultimately when your mom does pass away what are her wishes with these proceeds if they're not needed for medical care or things like that\nTo be divided among her four children\nOkay All right so\nI Would say that at her age you've got to just play it as simple as possible because you don't know at what point she might need a some medical care and they need to be in assisted living or whatever and there's going to sound so unbelievably conservative\nBut I Would put the proceeds and to a simple savings account\nOr LA yeah because if you told me\nThat the proceeds from this she's really not going to need they're also going to be inherited by her children\nThan I Would recommend something completely different I Would recommend investing the money and letting it grow 'til the time of her passing that hopefully you'll still a long way from now maybe she'll break the century mark\nAnd ... and then you'd be able to whoever it would be the executor would be able to distribute those proceeds but in a case where you don't know if the money's going to be needed for her care you can't really invest it\nOK correct that that's what I was worried about and so that's why\nThe proceeds need to go into is simple savings but not at a traditional bank is should be at an online bank where right now you can earn about two and a quarter percent\nOkay and then the monies available as it's needed and if it's not needed then ultimately I it would be distributed per her wishes\nYet so I nothing exotic here no real way and if you go on\nOr give me a couple of sites you can see the

know how to shop for for one k.'s\nAnd they end up because of lack of knowledge with these ultra high costs for one case often offered by insurance companies big banks are full commission stock

the Clark Howard show Hi John\nHi Carl how are you so much for taking my call good thanks how are you great you want to talk about your daughter\nYes my daughter is a theater student and we were planning young are going to community college and that we sleep changes she wants to go to the in state college which costs about twelve thousand dollars a year\nWithout really bored\nSo twelve thousand dollar tuition used to be considered to be a giant amount for in state at a State University or flagship State University and today that's actually probably a little on the low side a lot of states for in state tuition\nYeah so that's all I Do and she got some wants to go to the state for the theater program and you know I've been listening to you for a while and my concern is is her getting into debt as we don't have enough to pay that every year for the next four years [noise]\nAnd it being theater and I'm more I my wife wants her to follow her dream and do whatever she wants and more and a conservative side not want to hear to getting gas and and so forth after you know I listen to you and that's a major concern for me\nSo my wife was a theater major in college\nYeah it is an actress and loves every minute of it except for the fact that your income is so we're regular and you never know when you're going to be working because actors live their lives being unemployed you know as soon as you want to get out when he does on the actress\nPart ... she wants me to the theater designed like ... design\nWhere you know that a lot that signers set designers if they break through actually have potentially more stable income than the actors were forming on stage but your concern is a valid one from a dollars and cents standpoint that if she borrows\nMoney for school let's just say she borrowed dress the tuition for getting room and board country live at home is the university near when I was\nLiving at home and we plan on ... you know playing among the majority of it but we won't be able to you know pay the whole thing\nSo in other words the worst case scenario ... per year how much per year\nAbout four to five thousand dollar sure year per year for her to borrow\nThen then I Would relaxes or father letter per se a dream\nToday that's not enough borrowing to be a crisis for her if she graduates with less than twenty thousand dollars in student loan debt or west\nThat will not be a problem for her even if she were to face periods of ... under employment unemployment she'll just have to hustle and ... and work part time doing other things but there could be a compromise as well I could throw out to you\nGot me more than ... [laughter]\nSo I Would say the compromise is that you ... pursue her dream she gets her major in theater designed but she also gets a minor in something that is a practical thing that could be a fallback kind of position for adults all we\nWe is Scott Scott so she said that she would go for communication is you know to make us happy so she will be getting a could double degree\nSo communications wouldn't make me happy because it's not something that specifically translates into some kind of clear career path or some way that she fall back on for income I Would like somebody who has a little meteor in terms of something very different\nThan the arts arts degree that she'd be getting from the theater department\nBut and then having even a minor in something that is that is a good thing to fall back on weather does she have any stem mind you know um computer technology data Cy ...\nToilet good with computers she's good at math but her passion has is theater so\nI got that is also so she had where he did that as her major and did some minor where she picks up enough hours in could be designing a Web design something like that she could that would also be a skill that would help her very much get into a theater\nBecause they need those skills to\nAnd K\nAnd so I I wouldn't want her to put her major energy into her passion and her minor in energy into something that would earn her some money and probably the two could work very well together\nJoe joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Joe\nPark how are you\nGreat thank you you're looking at becoming a landlord\nI too am first of all if you're driving their cars that lasts for school districts are on the service is a case of personal finals are now there is so much ...\nWhere you are nice to say that although there are lots of schools they keep experimenting with ways to teach personal finance to kids and it's hard because when I talked about it or have you heard me at the very beginning of

hear you talk often about the insurance and whether you know take it out when you rent a car and you're talking about your credit card having insurance through it and my question was is there a difference between what has offered through our debit card from the bank versus like a traditional charge card\nYes so do you not have any credit cards you only have a debit card\nWe do not we neither of us have credit cards we got rid of all\nSo if you are going to rent a car as a general rule you have to contact the car rental company in advance and they may have a special um former application you have to fill out in order to be able to rent a car with a debit card\nYeah when you get to any car rental counter they have what they call a debit card notice and uh they they are very nervous about renting cars to people with a debit card because there's been problems with auto theft rings\nThat will present false id and somebody rents the car and that's the last December seen again so you have to do paperwork before you even go usually to be able to use that debit card 'cause the enhanced risk\nOkay now they will tell you a usually if you don't take their semi insurances or whatever you call those things they offer\nIf you don't take those they'll put a big cold on your debit card so you'd have to have a very large balance in your checking\nKnow to avoid the taking out all the insurance otherwise you'll have to buy coverage from them if you're going to rent on the debit card\nOkay 'cause we're our honeymoon it coming up here ... year we're going to Florida and we want to

Theresa Murray the consumer writer when's the last remaining ones with a major city newspaper in the country somebody who's a consumer finance columnist\nWas exactly what I'm about to tell you about the two accounts something you may have heard me suggest for years\nThat if you do want to have a debit card you have your main account where your main money is where you pay your bills from where you pay your rent or mortgage from where you make your car payment from and then you have a separate account not at the same financial institution\nWhere you have\nThat with a debit card and you only have walking around money in that account\nOnly what you're going to need to be able to handle what you'd do day to day on a debit card so the real money you need to pay your real bills and all that is in

vehicles are so much more reliable than they used to be and they cost a fortune when you buy knew more about that in a second\nBut most of us dump a vehicle before it's anywhere near the end of its useful life\nOr car a sales manager at a car dealership was talking to me recently about the issue that he faces day after day with people coming in with the vehicle but it's just a few years old\nAnd they're upside down in their loan owing on the vehicle more than what it's worth\nAnd they're bored with it and they want new wheels\nAnd he was saying we have to do all kinds of things how do you

being upside down in the vehicle I Would tell them just to keep driving that vehicle\nAnd not make things worse on themselves financially by jumping a vehicle that they owe more on than what it's

it's all the costs added in together\nFor the average driver\nBy the way inquiring minds want to know how many miles is the average new vehicle driven in a year\nThis is and how many miles you may drive total one year because you may have more than one vehicle in our household or whatever but the average new vehicle is driven according to AAA ten thousand eight hundred and forty one miles\nEach year so like nine hundred nine hundred miles a month I guess\nSo what's it cost to operate that vehicle and the average place per year\nTen thousand forty nine dollars which is just a whisker under a dollar a mile now what's really interesting about that when consumer when I'm Sorry not Consumer Reports from Tripoli desert overall cost of vehicle ownership\nIt's more in the range of around sixty cents\nBut when they take new vehicles put that in the equation and every last expense involved with it even the parking you pay for various places over the course of a year if you have to go places you pay for parking you end up it over ten thousand dollars\nNew vehicles cost a fortune\nAnd think about it if you instead of driving a new vehicle that one that's out there that you're tired up but it still works just fine and you're treating it so bad\nWhy don't you go pay somebody to detail it make it look brand new again on the inside make it feel like a new vehicle to you again and keep driving that thing instead of spending all that money\nOn those new wheels because you know it's like being on a hamster wheel right because as soon as you get that new vehicle and just a few months
