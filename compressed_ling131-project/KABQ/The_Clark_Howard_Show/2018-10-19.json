Ah yes yes it was and so I thought you know what I'm just going to reach out to ... and get a feel for what he thinks about the concepts and principles behind\nWell I've called and it's not just a term that originated with me or before the concept of the FIRE movement came along I called it max savers\nAnd that and again that term didn't originate with me the idea that if you can live on half of what you make\nAnd coming right out of school if you learn to live on every other check\nIt changes the entire trajectory of your life\nAnd generally by your early forties if you live on half of what you make you will have saved enough money and lived a lifestyle that will make it possible for you at that point to be\nCompletely independent financially and if you don't want to work again you're likely won't have to but really it's more about you being totally in charge of the choices you make in your life you know somebody who works hard enough and sacrifices hard enough\nTo be able to um live on half of what they make isn't doing it so that they never have to work again it's usually so that they have the choice to do what they want to do the rest of their lives\nSo bad to have you been living on a fraction of what you make since you started listening or since you got out of school or what's your track record of Ben ...\nYeah I'd say since I've been out of school probably early on about a forty percent savings rate and right now probably more like sixty Seventy while oh wow I Would put myself definitely in the Mac savers category and and like you said it's for me it's not so much of\nA one on never work again in my life I mean I Want the option to do that but really I I see more of the road the freedom to do whatever you choose\nExactly exactly and you get there and ah you know the people who and I don't want to get into a tit for tat with Suzie Ormond but the ... she's not the only one who really has has been um\nNot supportive of what's now coined as the FIRE movement which is financial independence retire early and it's ... it's a cute\nPhrase a cute idea\nA but it's a real idea with real stuff behind it whatever you call it whether you call it max saver whether you call it fire or whether you just talk about the financial independence side of fire ... the idea is that instead of feeling a prisoner\nTo your bills and wherever you work you are in charge and you make the choices you choose to make and so are you by saving now sixty Seventy percent of what you may\nYou are in a position to be able to make the choices you're going to make in your life and his you pile up more and more money it gives you increasing amounts of freedom to make the decisions you want to make\nSo I'm totally supportive of you are you doing anything though that others would look at and say man bans having no fun in life because he won't even fill in the blank\nA no honestly I feel like I live a great life as it is over the years was\nWith my life as an ally probably four or five times [laughter] I'm not married and I hear so um we travel quite a bit and I definitely don't think we deprive ourselves\nAlthough we definitely could spend more money we could you know by the fancier house or cars but choose not to do them\nExactly and you know you mentioned the two areas\nThat end up eating up people's budgets more than any other than that housing and cars\nThat those two things are what become a brutal expenses and they're used to be a philosophy and the U.S that you wanted to reach on our house and by the biggest fanciest house you could qualify for\nI think now there's more of an understanding that that's not where it's at because that monthly payment the overhead of it the property taxes become an albatross instead of a benefit overtime so keep doing what you're doing real good job\nAnd I ask you can I ask you a related question of course\nOkay so a part of this idea is to be able to reduce your monthly expenses\nAnd right now I have a Fifteen here on line I how mortgage and I already know max out my four oh one K. and my wife's IRA my IRA things of that nature so we don't have more to go there\nAnd I know you you typically discourage people from ever came down there who are good but um at some point for me to to really at this level where\nI don't have to work anymore [laughter] um it would be awesome to have a mortgage young so that will point in your philosophy what'd you say yeah\nPaying down extra on your mortgage would get rid of that obligation use an okay thing to do\nNow you're talking to somebody who's mortgage debt free and despises mortgages and I carry that at all and you know if you looked at it strictly from\nPriorities there would be people particularly and financial planning that would say no you should actually put more money and investment accounts but let's talk about the practicality of having a roof over your head that you don't have a monthly mortgage for the value of that particularly as you hit that\nThreshold where you've saved enough money that you would not have to work again unless you wanted to\nIf you want to now that you've maxed out every form of savings that the tax codes favorable to if you want to just concentrate on zeroing out that mortgage go ahead\nAll right sounds great\nAnd be completely one hundred percent debt free which makes everything you've put before now\nEven easier to make work for you so uh I Know there are those listening to you and me Ben that are like these two men are crazy\nI mean I I'm having trouble just pay my bills every month and they're talking about saving fifty sixty Seventy percent of their pay\nAnd it's got to be something you do from the ground up\nAnd the decisions you make over time and there are people who make so little money that this is not a realistic conversation but if you're making a moderate salary to above\nYou can in many cases make financial independence part of your life you're listening to

number\nFor getting guidance from a member of team ...\nHave you seen that start picture was made the rounds on um\nSocial media on the Internet or one of the houses in the panhandle of Florida that got hit so badly by the hurricane recently that\nThere were there were there was like nothing left at all at this beach community and Mexico Beach Florida in one house was sitting there\nAlmost completely intact\nAnd it's so start well I Want to tell you that\nWe have the ability\nTo build tougher homes and the shocking thing isn't beach areas the real cost is not in the structure put on a property is the land that the property sits on that the structure sits on and\nThe cost of construction\nDoesn't have to be a huge amount higher I'm going to go way back in history to Nineteen Ninety two I guess it was\nWhen South Florida got hit very hard by Hurricane Andrew I'm testing my memory from way back but what I Want to talk about is something that shows how important are thought process about how we build is\nHow a house survives a storm of various types whether it's a tornado hurricane a earthquake standards there are so many different situations where how you choose to build\nMakes all the difference in doesn't necessarily have to cost a lot more because in Andrew\nThere was an area where the entire neighborhood was flat and just like the pictures\nThat you may have seen from Mexico beach and there were some homes there were sitting there looking absolutely fine and those homes happened to be habitat homes\nThat were built with volunteer labor built way beyond what was the building code at the time and employed technologies that costs virtually nothing like a little thing assignments technology so little thing called the hurricane clip\nThat a lot of habitat affiliates around the country and areas subject to tornadoes uh build with hurricane clips which helps support and reinforce the structure of a home and add to the cost of a home somewhere around a hundred and twenty dollars\nAnd make a home much more robust\nIn\nThe case in Florida we were you a part time and a beach community in Florida and our next door neighbor as well as about oh about a dozen homes in our area are built using a new construct\nShouldn't method where the homes are built like and I think this is the one in Mexico beach was the same kind of idea built with concrete and know sheet rocket\nAnd the homes are built to withstand a cat five hurricane plots\nAnd the windows may not survive they may blow out the home itself is a hundred percent structurally sound\nAnd all that has to be done is its host out there is no issue with mold and so the reason I bring this up is we in America face an increasing problem with flooding\nFrom population growth um increase rainfall it's we're in a cycle of that\nAnd much of the United states and there are so many techniques that can be used\nLife insurance long term care disability insurance and so this is an area that the feds need to be all over in the Congress\nAnd not permit genetic discrimination\nSo I don't know I don't know anybody doing it yet just like you were told by the person at the state insurance department emphasis on yet\nThat's what I was afraid of because of it and I had actually called the last ... said it was a note for for a genetic test for and I think the lab and stayed in the destruction to do that I think they would do if\nThey would not do that and you know there's there's a question so many of us like me are done twenty three and me and done ancestry dot com and there's so much information out there and their crimes being solved where people who haven't even participate in genetic testing\nAre being found by other people's results who've done genetic testing so this is a bit of a Pandora's box and the law is behind on it and and so far\nSo far don't worry that anybody is doing that diabolical early in the insurance industry\nSo basically I recommend in getting my insurance ASAP just in case to get genetic testing down the road they find something\nThat exactly [laughter] exactly right and see ... I Am in bad shape anyway because I've already disclosed that my genetic testing found that I have an increased risk of Alzheimer's\nSo if I was companies selling long term care my own words can be used against me and well my job to share with you what's going on in my life you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nHow the winter games have you seen ...\nDot com get find out more food cars close funded by and not so hard life insurance not so much having a good life insurance policy is super important but one third of people don't have it because it's really hard to buy you have to ... do some research finding quotes\nAnd hope you don't get swept along the way that is where policy genius made the whole process a lot simpler policy genius compares quotes from top life insurance companies to find the best policy for you and it takes just two minutes to get a quote if you don't know the first thing about insurance they've got all the tools to get you up to speed\nLearned the difference between term and whole life insurance calculate how much coverage you need and be sure you're making the right decision so whether you know a lot about life insurance or nothing at all start your search that policy genius dot com and just two minutes you can compare quotes and make an informed decision for you and your loved ones\nPolicy genius the easiest way to compare and by life insurance\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you were in the book and want to get it published page publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets they handle all aspects of the publishing process for you\nPrinting ... publicity copyright an editing got eight hundred times or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author ... should get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author certainly shouldn't get again eight hundred bonds or one thirty six eighty nine now\nBut no this month a two pack of napping night vision and lamb says up to ten dollars off because with ball comes longer nice pen\nVisibility luckily our head lamps up superior elimination which helps reduce the chance of an accident [noise] see better drive safer for the ten dollars off a superPAC Napa night vision had left\n... people that never no\nNo no\nDissipating all the stores for instance\n\nReading some in the new view streaming edition\nThis month has no shortage of Netflix Original to take over your TV\nDue out this week as part of making a murderer these three of Marvel's Daredevil mad Ron White new comedy special get expert advice on allergies sleep diet and more with the help from the new documentary series asking the Dodgers and illusions daring wound is back on Netflix with a new special called sacrifice\nSome slick getting out of the Amazon Prime this week include the claustrophobic horror movie that'll not young Jake Gyllenhaal and the weird but cool Donnie ...

T. people get the facts of beyond I Do that or to buy the guild foundation and the ad council\nIt only takes a minute to find out if you may have pre diabetes and you can do it and do I have pre diabetes that or if you're probably not going to argue kids were listening to the radio you're busy which is great because busy people can't get pre diabetes mine I read that runs [laughter]\nThey can set a foreign language so visit and do I have pre diabetes that Oregon take a short time\nBecause pre diabetes can be reverse\nAnd then that loan you have that you owe is immediately do almost nobody can then come up with a lump sum and that creates a premature withdraw from your four one K.\nThen will generate tax and penalties for the typical person somewhere between thirty five and forty five percent\nOf the money\nAnd think about if you don't have the money at that point you're going to have a big tax bill due to the IRS for fan of money you don't have\nAll right so can you tell\nWhen somebody calls and asked me about borrowing from a four one K. I. like tightened up when I'm answering the question 'cause I'm hoping there's no reason I'll ever green light them borrowing from the four one K. because the if then the consequences so the situation has to be completely desperate\nBefore I always say do this and why why am I talking about this again\nI got\nA email from a friend of my wife who was asking specifically about\nTaking money out of a four one K.\nTo pay off credit card debt which is probably the most common reason people do it\nAnd I was able to explain to a point that she was comfortable that she shouldn't do the money withdraw from the four oh one K. to pay off the credit card debt and you know the most important reason not to do that if you use\nMoney from a four O. one K. to pay off credit card debt in most situations people will end up having the credit cards charge backup within a year and a half of when that withdrawal is taking place so\nPlease I Know it's easy to do the ... four one K. borrowing but don't do it unless the situation is dire\nAmy is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Amy\nHi how are you great thank you you want to talk about hitting the bulls eye on the retirement\nTarget\nIdeal looking at the proper used or misused retirement and by and I mean how strong the forces that have been tricked out here and that's it and they would hire him at target retirement or yeah\n[laughter] well I wouldn't say a hundred percent or not and with the idea is that if you're let's say you're building a portfolio and a four one K. or you're building one and a Roth IRA or traditional i._r._a.\nThe idea is that if you're for people aren't aware of what we're talking about a target retirement fund is where you pick a year\nKind of in the ballpark of when you expect to retire and they tend to be an five year increments like you're twenty thirty twenty forty five whatever every five years\nThat you're messing up the whole purpose of the target retirement fund if you put money into it and then still put money into other things in your retirement plan a retirement account\n[noise]\nIt's not like it's something you shouldn't do it's just suggested that if the whole idea is to try to get the right mix of stuff that you're invested in\nThat it really is only effective if you go all in on the target retirement fund where are you in your head with this and how does it affect you\nWell I had that as a choice I'm In my legs but I have I'll say they will like ... and um I just had this at heart of it ... and I'm hearing that the rate of return\nThat I Would expect they are they on average about ... percent lash that if I work at all and that target retirement side\nYou know I I Can't speak to whether you would have an overall lower return over the years by diversifying out from it the idea that target retirement fund is really for a different purpose it's to put you in a position where you have the proper level of risk\nAt different stages of your work life and then as you get closer to retirement\nSo there's nothing that says the you taking some of your money in your four one K. and putting another choices is going to get you a lower return it's even possible that could get you a higher returns but it also might involve over the years potentially more risk to you\nIn law says you could suffer at various points of your work life\nShore okay if anybody says oh putting forty percent and the target retirement fund and putting the other sixty percent and other things is going to get you a lower return that's not an accurate statement\nOK information and I have a great day and can't tell\nWhat's amazing with the target retirement funds is that any of a number of providers of those in a higher re Ross IRA or four one K. are offering extremely low costs on them and others offering very high costs\nOn the target retirement fund portfolio vanguard which is generally considered to be the gold standard charges\nTypically like ... point one five of one percent to point to oh of one percent where other\nProviders may charges much is more than one percent for having money in a target retirement fund that difference decimate eventually how much money you'll have to live on in retirement those expenses really mad or overtime\nFred is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Fred\n... thanks for you do for us we get a lot of information from you sure do ... ah

and they're not register their safety and it looks like a ... game to me but I was wondering if you had any information regarding digital coin\nAll right so when people refer to digital coin that's generally a generic term for that one brand name that did establish itself in the marketplace called\nBitcoin and bitcoin is an alternative way for people to pay for things around the world\nAnd it is which generally referred to as a crypto currency it's not a government back money it is one is that is accepted based on a daily value\nThe people who are willing to buy and sell bitcoins are willing

supposedly don't have to do anything if you buy it in fact a certain amount of money anywhere from a hundred and fifty to I don't know\nFour five thousand dollars and then the coin is like is worth

runs counter to\nNot spending money I Love to travel and I'm an opportunistic traveler most of my travel is for work travel a lot on the road for work\nBut when I can I Love to go somewhere and the way I pick where I go and where we go as a family is based on what deals pop up\nLast because what you pay for travel particularly for airfare has no relationship to miles travel it's all about competition at the moment and in many cases in the United states with the three full fare alliance American United and delta\nThey do a lot of what are known is signaling fairs where they're mad at let's say Americans mad at delta for something and they don't like something delta did and wonder if there were no one is for ...\n... says their main ones Dallas and uh Charlotte is their most profitable for tourists and airlines have these kinds of things United in Chicago and San Francisco and stuff dealt in Atlanta Detroit Minneapolis oh Americans mad at delta\nThey may put an ultra cheap fare on route ...\nBeing out of Atlanta Detroit or Minneapolis to try to send a signal to delta you want to mess with us we're going to mess with you\nDelta wanting to send the signal to United might put an ultra special deal out of Chicago\nAnd so that will create these incredibly cheap fares\nIn addition to any of a number of reasons why airlines competing with each other will offer deal or\nSales seats will be softer or particular place and there'll be bargains and so I Try not to pick a destination ever for leisure travel so he's about letting the deal pick the destination\nSo how do you find those\nIn the past I've told you about Scott's cheap flights\nAnd next to bake hey these are both subscription services are Scott's works on a free Meehan business model with a certain amount of information for free more you have to pay for it and was Scott's and next ... years sent email alerts when there's a special deal\nAnd the deals can be unreal Scott's had won a recently that was a deal to Hong Kong from San Francisco for four hundred and Eighteen dollars round trip\nThat's like nothing to go to Hong Kong that would be like\nPaying Chicago to Miami paying twelve cents [laughter] if you think about the distance not quite that you get the idea [laughter] and now there's another choice that's a worldwide one\nCalled secret flying dot com that at least at this point is free\nNot a newsletter service it's a website you can go to and seeing what deals there are at the moment like here's one and a nice change by the day deals to uh Europe deals to Central America\nA deal's within the United states\nAnd from various spots in the United states to others in the U.S feels that the Caribbean to Asia are really all over the place and so you just when you go to\nSecret flying dot com when you get there you select that you're only interested in fares departing the United states or let's say a friend or family overseas and you want them to come visit you select whatever continent in the world they're from\nAnd you'll be able to see what deals there are from that continent to the United states\nSo this is just one other tool there is no one place to find all the deals out there but here's three sources if you're like me that the deal drives the destination\nOkay and you have some meaningful expense and drawing up the trust that the life insurance would find\nOkay but because the the financial need if you were to die much younger than normal and you have a larger number of years that the kids have to be taken care of you need to have a hefty term life insurance policy\n[noise] how is your\nPerfect perfect this is a great opportunity and I hate to ask another impolite question how old are you\nI'm fifty two\nRight so you would probably look at a twenty year level term policy\nOkay\nThat means that you are guaranteed that policy for the next Twenty years and that it would provide a benefit for that time now the question comes what happens after that time right so\nThat becomes more difficult because the alternative is to buy some of his whole life insurance policy\nThat we'd be was referred to many times in the insurance business as permanent insurance but the premiums on it might be cost prohibitive you can't insure against every possibility\nSo I don't know if buying a permanent policy would be possible within your budget\nBut I Would say that combination of insurance going into a trust for the benefit of each child would be really to insurance policies to dress potentially and doing the five twenty nine able would be the

well my dad and so they are very sorry and plus I'm a Mary Kay\nWell how may I mean a service to you at this tough time\nYeah my question is will the farmer and I'm taking over for him and I applied and dotted line of credit or whatever and all that but I was wondering if you would suggest getting credit cards and build up to credit [noise]\nWow so you were able to get a line of credit even though you have generally no credit or how much credit do you have\nI have no credit I had to go through that the banks know banquet lent to me so I had to go to the government and get that first time on my lonely\nOkay so you're starting to show some credit right there it's going to show up on your credit report typically within sixty days\nOkay and so do you have a credit union near where you have the farm\nI never actually really looked into it\nBecause the best place for you to establish traditional credit is going to be at a credit union\nAnd they they often have what are known as fresh start programs although because of the loan you now we're going to potentially show on your credit you may be able to jump right past a fresh start don't know\nBut I Would within the next month or so look for a credit union in your area you go to see you in a dot org\nThere's a function on there where you can find a credit union and you put in your ZIP Code and it'll show you what is near you and getting a generally what you want from the credit union is a visa and MasterCard\nOkay and under the ... system they may they may have you put a small amount of money in a savings account or CD at the credit union in order to issue you your initial fees or MasterCard\nBottles and and yeah I I Googled much credit cards for bad no credit and all of whom had thirty five percent interest and I'm like yeah I'm not going to do those\nWell you're very smart you know a lot of what you're going to find a bail herbal\nTo people that are looking for what's known as the security card normally are going to be cards with very ugly terms and conditions and that's why without even hesitation I always encourage people to go to a credit union is where you go to establish that\nFirst level of credit that you're going to need and once you get that established it becomes really easy after that as long as you keep your use of that credit card very low\nYou'll be fine and again I'm very sorry about the loss of your dad [noise] you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\n\n\nThey little every way you want to let them on our free I actually went down there now [noise]\nCaravan conference moving the FBI Hi Michael Toscano thousands of refugees from Honduras trucking in a caravan toward the U.S our Mexico southern border this morning secretary of state Mike Pompeo is about to meet with officials in Mexico's capital trying to find a way to stop the move north\nWell let's see if I can help with some of that\nNow if I use an office space and at the state action plan I exit my home our exit the business what happened what the consequences of doing that or is there one\nYes so when you exit the business there's really no consequences you just don't have the home office deduction in the years on your tax return after you exit the business on the other hand when you sell your home\nYou have a certain amount of recapture because what you're basically doing easier depreciating a certain percent of the square footage in your home\n[noise] so is it worth it oh yeah I think that we can say oh yeah\nYeah because because the way the the taxes work there is an advantage to you getting the current a deduction for the home office\nAnd then the recapture because it's down the road and you know in essence dollars' worth less overtime than they were and the current present time\nThere's an advantage to that and also the way the recapture works is more favorable formula generally for most taxpayers than the initial deduction so it does work out I mean is ... probably said that backwards the value of the initial deduction\nIs greater than the than the cost as a general rule on the recapture\nSo it is a worthwhile deduction\nIs it increased my chance of being on it\nIt used to do the greater chance of the issues with home office to doctrine after a lot of back and forth and hostility from the IRS tours small business owners doing the home office deduction you pretty much became a settled issue\nAnd so that's not really the concerning part what is usually the concerning part is the IRS is focused a lot on people who have their own business maybe playing games and putting personal expenses through as business expenses\nAnd so do the more accurate records you keep\nThe less of an issue it becomes and there are certain formulas\nAre that the IRS uses where they may say hey that's a that's a very large amount of travel expense against a business where the revenue so and so we're that's an outlandish amount of money for blah blah blah for a business that side so they're looking for is anomalies\nThat may trigger some level of an audit\nShut the home office in itself is not something that is the hassle factor that it was for a long long time\nAnd if they hid audit our credit card statement with the actions taken enough argue I Need on the flip paper and individual eight and then\nYou're going to ask me if I was a CPA or asked me as a fellow business owner okay so as a as a somebody who does this work as a CPA which I'm not but let's say I was for saying I'm putting on the CPA ...\nYes I Would tell you you wanna keep source documents you want to keep proof that that expensive it's on your credit card at let's say Office Depot was for\nA car in a paper yeah\nWho is it all depends on\nHow deep the dive is on and all that most of them are not order known this field audits there would have known this correspondence audit\nThey're just going to ask you to justify and and they may ask for some level of documentation but it is normal and common today that people would use a credit card receipt for a place that logically would be a place that you would buy\nEquipment or supplies for your business\nAs a proxy for the original receipt and paperwork if you want to if you want to have the best protection you have the original documentation\nFor how long well I say for in my case I keep it that the supporting documentation for seven years mhm the book answer is three years plus the currents of four years okay so you're not get\nLost money I don't care a lot of ... I don't care if you call it the people's money I don't care if you call it the U.S dollar they lost money and whatever currency you counted that\nWow it just it makes no sense\nYou know solve I'll give you another example you know I was talking about how we're getting all these less expensive cell phones and some of them coming to the United states or from Chinese companies and I noticed something on E. bay that I Can't place my finger on either that you can go buy\nA one of these phones from a Chinese seller haven't shipped all the way over here and buy it for at least a third less than it cost if you buy it from an American retailer that cells that Chinese branded phone\nIn a retail store on line\nSo it will hold a math equation\nI I Can't compete with what's going on from China shipping alone I Can't compete\nBut but the thing is it's not sustainable it's not sustainable and it's not going to last so people want to sell us goods below their cost I Know that's called\nStumping for but I Am in favor a dumb things because if they want to lose money to support us let them go for it but I'd much rather lob cellphone cases at a loss at us instead of nuclear

at the high end of the market in most of the United states most cities in the United states rents right now we're going down down down\nAnd that's because since twenty twelve\nApartments had been way over bill at the high end of the market I Know every apartment complex you ever look at it says it's luxury housing but I'm Talking about at the high end of the market\nThe construction has all been expensive apartments nobody's building a mid priced apartments at all\nAnd if you know classic a real estate\nOver time the over building of too many high end departments will create because of the excess supply will create lower rents overall but right now what's happened is the high end deals everywhere\nBut modestly priced departments and particularly lower price departments or an extreme shortage and in many cities those rents are rising\nSo people are desperately looking for affordable housing and that's caused a boom but in the scams where people pretend they're a landlord pretending to rent a place\nAnd you end up getting ripped off in the most common scam\nOr crook will duplicate a listing for real place\nAnd\nThey will show you what looks like a fantastic dwelling and they will show it available for rent just a little bit below the market\nThat's how they keep credibility because if they were that list it way below market you'd smell a rat but let's say the prevailing round I'm just going to use crazy numbers okay this may not be any relation to the rent price you're looking at but let's say\nThe rents generally on the apartments that you're looking at are in the range of twelve hundred they might listed at a thousand\nYou know like maybe Fifteen twenty percent below prevailing rats and\nSo it'll be these are nice pictures of a place and all that and remember it's a it's what's known as a stolen or hijacked listing most often called the hijacking listing where they uh post pictures they may have taken off of um\nA condo listing site may have been off of Brazil or whatever and they just take those pictures of a place typically a condo for sale\nMore often than a rental unit for rent and they'll duplicate the pictures do of listening is if it's a rental\nHave it available unfortunately most often on Craig's list\nAnd\nFor whatever reason they can't show you the place\nThey're happy to rent it to you as long as you fill out the rental application all that and they go through the whole protocol just like you would with any other place and the whole gimmick is just try to get a security deposit it out of you in first month's rent\nSo
