[laughter]\nAh\nThat is a definite a cow poop alert there [laughter] say on Showtime and I hate being this really clean as I Am I yeah I agree so when you get a pet\nIs right after you buy a home and start getting the pitches for the mortgage life insurance it's total trash insurance\nThe again I was listening to your podcast and it was saying too good to be true and you get back to back people and they happened to be positive and I was like well I have to give it as have to give it a go I had to ask Clark\nSo better than I did\nLet me tell you what's much more important than and I kind of cut you off there and I apologize you're getting the pitchers for the mortgage life you mentioned a mortgage disability policy is that right\nThat's correct\nAnd those are the two main areas that you've been getting the pitch is\nAbsolutely the thing is with that stuff\nIs that where the anybody's pitch for a mortgage life more huge disability one of the real guy chose is who you're insuring is the bank\nThe bank is essentially the beneficiary or maybe the name beneficiary of the policies so the bank with the mortgage life\nIt pays off the mortgage\nWith a disability it pays the monthly mortgage payment until and unless you're able to work again and so that is the idea of both of them is that you are in fact insuring the bank but ready for the punchline to that\nI Am\nThe premiums typically are as much as ten times what the premiums would be for the right kind of insurance which has insurance that you buy that is for the benefit of your survivors\nWho how many of you are there who is there that makes up your family group\nA total three\nOkay so do you have life insurance yet I Do All right so you're doing the right thing there and do you have disability insurance\nI Do through my through my work\nOkay and how long do you think you're going to stay at that employer hopefully they're not listening to hear the answer\n[laughter] um I I plan to stay for for for some time\nOkay then it's All right to have your disability insurance from your employer fury doing the right things and don't worry so much about the mortgage your survivors in the event of your untimely demise\nWill decide whether it makes sense to pay off the mortgage whether it makes sense to sell the house or whatever it makes sense to do with the proceeds from the life insurance mortgage life insurance on top of everything else is a straight jacket because\nIt's already decided who benefits the bank\nAnd it makes the decision for your survivors and that's a bad idea\nWell I I I thank you very much for your time I got the sense that it was this case and I just I had after you thank you very\nMuch sure have a great day you too and Cody is with us on the car coward show Hi Cody\nAcorn a

retire how how old are you Cody\nOh twenty eight\nSo twenty I Would say oh let's go oh we could go either to where he said the way to go to a twenty sixty or we can go to twenty fifty five either those were probably makes sense\nIs the target year and okay so how much money do you have in the Roth right now\nThat it open for six or seven along a lot about twenty ...\nOh yeah you're fine once you have a thousand you can go when the target retirement fund\nSo just call them up and ah at vanguard and tell them you don't know exactly how to make this change what you want the money to go and

don't have a um I'm married and we have a twenty year old son and we really don't have much of the city to speak of no no I get by suicide\nIt's something like that but but I'm I'm concerned about retirement\nFirst of all that you have four or five months save for a rainy day give yourself some props that's good that's a healthy chunk that very few Americans actually have but you said something else that I Would be more distressed about so you have no money right now save for retirement\nNo there is a good I was retired from the army for Twenty years Twenty years of service well thank\nYou for your service\nThank you and thank you for you what you do hurt anybody that listens [laughter] so I have that and that's a lifelong benefit for me or I work also has a retirement that will be

you're working now in a couple more years you'll be eligible for that I mean you've got much more going in your favor of the most people do\nSo that's why the one area that I Would work on is getting

in just want to know that the best option that I might be able to do\nMy employer automatically flies three percent to a four O. one K. rough account\nI'd like to save even more than that when the brain if I should add more to that same account if I should open a gift for her off or if there is another savings strategy that I should start to incorporate or or add too\nSo the three per se your employer throws in is that if you put in three percent or do you get it just for breathing\nThat for grieving well bats generous employer it yeah\nSo what percent of your pay you are you putting in that Ross four one K. right now\nRight now I'm ...\nAbout three percent as well and then the employer you know automatically put into the south\nSo you're saving essentially six cents on each dollar you make right\nYeah I got to get you to say more okay how old are you Travis thirty five or so have you prior to this point what have you done to save\n'em nothing really other than just the four one K. um through work\nAnd a prior to thirty five you've always been doing just the three percent on yes\nOkay so I'm going to put you on a treadmill here and you're not going to like my treadmill but I'm going to get you physically fit okay okay so what I'd like you to do is right away with the employer plan to raise it what you're contributing to four percent\nAnd some not asking a lot right now just go up one percent alright\nSure six months from now want you to go up another one percent\nAnd you know I'm going to go with the six months after that I Want you to go up another ... percent again\nOkay and being thirty five more money you can save today the more you create a path to financial comfort for you down the road\nBecause you've got roughly based on when people like to bag work you've got Thirty years to get this done so the more of your pay you can save and if you step it up bit by bit gradually you won't miss each traditional one percent you put in\nBut if I can get you to step it up one percent every six months\nIn five years time\nYou'll be saving effectively sixteen percent of your pay is right now you're at six three and three and if you can do it every six months\nYou'll end up eventually where you're putting a lot of money aside for retirement which it thirty five you really need to be somewhere around Fifteen cents on each dollar you make\nOkay and adding to the same Roth account would be a good use of that money and\nI think so because I mean not even asking you how expensive the Roth is in terms of management fees and all that because when I'm really into right now is getting you to save more money\nGotcha because if the employer automatically takes out of your check it eliminates you intending to do it it gets done\nSo how far into this would I really be putting a herd on your wallet\nOr know it'd be okay yep\nThan keep taking those little teeny bites a savings apple doing the one percent additional twice a year and you will really be so happy where that leads you down the road\nOkay great sounds great heart thank you\nWrite best to you and I'm so glad you're asking now most people don't focus on saving for retirement till after their fortieth birthday so we get it this way you're getting a five year head start on them Travis Nancy's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Nancy how are you doing\nOh I'm doing fine\nNancy you

when you get onto the sites that you have to give a lot of personal financial it's okay to do it on your financial computer because that's how I use that continue to find the ... food animal like banking say that\nThat is a great question and I do my credit karma I Do it on my regular computer I use my financial computer only for going to banking brokerage and bill pay\nOkay well that's kinda what I wanted to know 'cause I got to the computer and all that I was kind of about credit ... advertising felt like ... that credit ... that kind of wonder if it's like if ... if they get credit ... with a little ...\nNo I don't think so they are you an experience score well if you look ... sesame it says free credit score monthly it does not safe I go okay\nBut the point with any of these scores the credit card and my and the credit sesame is they're giving you a pretty good temperature of how you're doing you know I I look at is like almost like are you getting in a level and credit or B. or C. or D. or and a half that the it's not going to be\nThe same score likely that a lender will be using whether it'll give you a clear indication how you're doing paying your bills how you're doing with your um credit\nUtilization and credit sesame it is not actually a vantage score it's called the experience national equivalency score to yet another one that's not an actual psycho score\nOkay

[laughter] definitely exciting well how can I help with this upcoming wedding\nSo I was curious I'm I have a one bedroom condo that both the living together\nAnd we live from living there because it's not that expensive but with all the recent changes with insurance rates going up I'm Wondering if I might you better have anymore in the long term if we bought a home earlier or defined gets too we each day like you know you know what I mean\nPredicting interest rates has proven to be almost an impossible thing for people who do that kind of thing for a living\nThe economy stronger there's more inflation than we've had in a while and as interest rates go up the foreign ability homes does go down so here's the question I Would ask\nIf you after you get married if the two of you would really want\nTo live in the house that you would be buying for seven years or longer\nI Would go ahead and take the plunge now and by the house if it's uncertain that like a seven year window of ownership\nWould be unlikely or a real question mark\nI Would stay in the condo because the cost for you of buying a place and then later selling it is so high that would be a bigger concern of mine than the interest rate on the mortgage so that's the conversation the two of you need to have\nNow but I Will here shortly\nRight so go look at it and the first thing to do is the book yours that'll

don't have a complicated situation but you may have minor children even if some assets\nIn so doing a will doesn't have to be a major undertaking back now there's even a website to do your will for free\nWhich is funny because people have asked me over the years is there any place you can do your will for free and I always said no and now I have to say yes free will dot com\nAnd so this is an

hundred bucks to be able to do the will and be able to get advice from a lawyer as you prepare your own will or after the fact\nThe thing is you want to get that will done you want to get your will
