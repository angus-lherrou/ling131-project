lump sum\nA well what's it goes into bankruptcy I called the ... the capital ... ... ... to ... to look into this before or little to bankruptcy\nI guess there's some kind of federal program are so close that protects the employees was upstate her\nYeah so what happens there's a there's a ... a federal agency that as far as I'm concerned as federal agency called the pension benefit guarantee corporation and when a company goes bust that has pension obligations if they can't honor their obligations\n... common obligation of the pension benefit guarantee corporation if you are someone who is working at a moderate\nModerately paid job than the formula that the pension benefit guarantee corporation uses will usually give you a pretty much the same pension as you would have had from the former employer if they hadn't gone broke\nIf you on the other hand made big money there and that was the basis for your pension then usually the PG see will reduce your pension benefit\nBelow what it would have been otherwise were you making a moderate money or big money\nIt's six figure\nAll right so so I see why you're concerned because at the level of pension benefit you may well of iron they may um do what they are the terms terrible but crammed down your pension check to a smaller amount than it would have been other one is ...\nSure you've been told\nSo yeah so that's a check with a

that and this is when I talked to someone about their pension sprint and people will call me who were leaving a job and they'll ask me\nWhether they should take a lump sum or be paid out over time I say that normally you want to be paid out over time unless there's a reason that you're worried about the strength the how strong the employer is and the chances that they are not going to be\nSuccessful over the long term and that's like looking in a a crystal ball that may be cloudy and your case your past that and I'd love it if you let me know if you later are in fact\nIssued your

college\nSo\nRoughly Eighteen months\nI revise my guide to\nThe best five twenty nine plans and the country if you're not familiar with five twenty nine plans\nThey are the tax free plans that allow you to save in many states for private school before college and then for college itself tax free my general recommendation is even if your state allows you\nTo use five twenty nine plan money for private school\nUh up to twelfth grade that you're usually better off if you can afford to to pay for the private school out of your own funds\nAnd whatever scholarships your kid may earn in private school and then have more years of tax free grows for college\nBut the plans calm and multiple flavors and they can really overwhelm you and confused you with all the noise in life trying to pick a five twenty nine plant these\nI'm twenty nine plans are specifically\nGenerally approved by a state sponsored by a state to state wins its name to a private plan some states have multiple ones\nMany states have both an indirect plan where you go through a commission sales person an indirect plans where you invest directly there is never a circumstance and this is a never rule\nThat you should ever go through a commission sales person to put money in a five twenty nine plan\nWhat's the most important thing in saving particularly with the window you have from whatever point after childbirth you decided to start saving money for college ... child would enter college\nThe time period the horizon is relatively short\nIf you're paying massive commissions\nTo go into a plan you're going to a road the ability for your money to work for you and build up tax free to pay for a child's college the investment choices I recommend are so simple\nAnd a five twenty nine plan that there is absolutely no need for anyone even with minimal knowledge about investing to ever need a sales person help to do a five twenty nine plan\nIn fact the go to choice I recommend in any of the plans\nThat I like that I've talked about on my guide are for you to go in the age base portfolios based based portfolios\nOr where you put money on and based on your child's age or grand kids age or niece or nephew or whoever you're putting up the money for\nThat the mix of investments changes as the child gets closer and closer to entering college\nIt's too complicated to try to figure out your own investment in the mix unless you work as an investment professional as your day job\nYou how are you a member of Sam's or Costco\nNow bee Jay's me up no Cosco are Sam's where I\nK I don't know if BJ's

they're going to charge you for me like bringing in a car and where it's assessed on line and then they say oh you got a dent in the back end or we're going to charge you this much for it and then they make you a final offer\nAnd they just pay you for your home and you go and you're done\nThere whether any of these offers get you as good a price as you would get with the traditional agent\nThere is no free lunch here and I imagine if you're willing to do the traditional sales process you'll get more money selling through a traditional channel\nBut what you get with any of these

out of the ATM charge the west bank repay those but it's just three hundred dollars you know three hundred dollars hundred dollars that's really hard to do the outlook\nFor sure all looking at [noise] and there's several apps out there that offer op that same\nDay all require or or or account information\nYeah and they can't work without that I'm any in particular you've been looking at it I see if I have an opinion on an effort to that you're looking considering\nI looked at a to a budget and and I think is the way you are now\nDon't know good by ... but I did talk about envelopes awhile back and they operate they did operate on a premium business model let me see if they still do where you could have the basic version for\nFree yeah so you still have the basic version for free\nAnd then there's a a more expensive one that gives you some more capabilities but most people would be likely happy with what you get with the base free version\nThey have a really fancy one for people who feel out of control\nAnd it's where they coach you actively and how you're handling your money but if you're just trying to organize yourself and do it in an easier way electronically I think envelopes would be a good way to do it now so here's the thing with giving up the information you have to give up\nCharles any time you give a connection to your accounts to an app a website whatever there's always risk\nBut the risk level is a possibility where the benefit level is a certainty so I think in a case like this\nI feel comfortable with you using this and giving them the information that they have to have in order to help you actively on below pure life\nRight yeah that's what I Want to know it just scared when I'm giving out too much information on the Internet especially to something that the writer even you know just not that secure banking system that I'm used to\nWell the the banking system we hope is secure reality today is that the way the Internet is built and put together it's a constant\nCat and mouse game with people providing services of any kind\nWorking as hard as they can to keep their systems secure and then the the bad folks out there trying to hack in

in popularity and the idea is always the same it's a belief that this one's different this product line or service is the greatest and that is the fastest growing multi level since blah\nBlah blah so\nIf it is a legitimate multi level what are the chances you're going to make money well in a survey done by the website magnify money dot com\nThey talked with the survey over a thousand multi level marketing participants and when they computer the map the average participant was earning less than a dollar an hour working in a multi level not\nThousands and thousands and thousands of dollars and no free cars and all that\nAnd half of people earned less\nThan five hundred dollars and the last five years in the multi level\nThere are so many women who got into the leisure where a thing as multi level and are stuck now with massive inventories sitting in their garages or if they have a basement in their basement or the spare room\nGathering dust going on so\nThere are always in a multi level and that's why a lot of people confuse them with a different kind of activity in illegal pyramid but they're not there are lots of multi levels that are perfectly legal but they work like a pyramid and that there is a very small number of people\nWho hit it big and\nEverybody else earns basically nothing\nSo when somebody gives you the pitch please be wary be aware be careful because even though that person talking to you is so excited so enthusiastic\nKnow that the odds are very very much against you and the number one thing\nThat I Want to go back to something that

whole original idea multi levels which is your hard work and time and effort will pay off\nNot you having to be a merchant holding inventory\nWhole inventory side should be all about something that went and orders placed the inventory goes straight from a warehouse of the multi level to the individual by and by the way remember this\nThe way you get to that fuzzy area where it goes from being a multi level to an illegal pyramid\nIs if the big push the big pitch is about\nYou recruiting people into the organization instead of you selling a product or service to strangers you\nKnow not to walk

me now until a week after it happened to me\nWhen we did happen to you\nRight film that that's what was going on what happened was it was very fast so I really didn't have time to think much the phone rang I answered it and the voice said this is now on a job or something like that from customer service\nCan you hear me okay oh and I just you know you just\nKind of knee jerk I think yes and then I think as I recollect he went out and say something and I said I said something like\n... who are you or something like that and they were immediately something's wrong while he didn't hang up oh you did not hang I hung up on him okay\nGot it suddenly dawned on me I thought wait a minute customer service where and I just said yes and I thought of those years ago how they used to talk about elderly people getting taken from magazines and\nThings sure yet but I just thought oh well maybe I'm OK because he doesn't have my information I didn't talk to them but then I saw you know I heard your show and I thought ooh you know\nI said don't don't panic OK okay and and\nThere are three steps I'm recommending to people who have gotten hit by that a phony phone call\nOkay it was a recording your yes so they then can potentially proceed with buying things as if they're you mhm as an example or they may attempt to put false charges through on your phone bill\nFor your cell phone is an example mhm so we're very most important step there would be to your strong advantage for you to freeze your credit to\nDie already had thanks to you okay\nSo that's the most important thing so the next two steps are basically housekeeping\nMhm you want to watch your credit card statements either when they come in the mail or if you have online access and look for bogus charges okay I have a heightened risk of bogus charges\nMaybe for as much as the next six months okay and the other thing is the thing with your phone bills with weather noticed crayons where phony charges are put through on it\nAnd they will have a recording or you say yes that you want blah blah blah and you never heard that question but they have a yes to that question saying you wanted them to charge you know Nineteen Ninety five a month for horoscopes or whatever on your cell phone bill uh-huh so because your credit's frozen\nYou have much less to worry about than other people who say yes to that and then just watch closely or counts monitor and you'll be a okay\nOkay great thank you so much\nSugar and you know you gave an opportunity for people didn't hear about can you hear me now the scam to know that if somebody calls and ask you that you do not answer you do not say yes you do not say aha you say what are you calling about so you say\nNever say yes because they're recording that yes you're listening to the

front load money to a contractor when you front load money you stand the risk with that person abandons the job\nAnd when you give somebody money any large amount of money up front you may find that that's the last time you ever see\nThat contractor again are suppose a contractor at court dot com I have a lot more detail for you and how to go about hiring a contractor\nAnd hopefully you'll be able to find the right person they'll get the job done right and you'll be happy\nBut even with the most honest if contractors then we'll be issues that come up when I'm most concerned about though is when you get that contractor who either is completely incompetent or completely dishonest or both\nWho creates hardship in your life and lost your wallet be\nCareful Brian is with us on the Clark Howard show Brian how are you doing great thanks Clark\nBrian you were one of those lucky people who owns your own business it can run through an enormous amount of your expenses through rewards credit card is that right that's correct who you know that's really neat 'cause\nYou get all the spoils you got all the giant\nRewards that's right yeah it's great [laughter] so what kind of things excite you like what kind of rewards would really make you happy\nWell right now in the most most of the time I'm using a actually I use a a Costco was M. X. now Liza and run a you know on a lot of expenses on that so it's just cash back I'm In that case and so I was just wondering if you\nKnow ... miles in general you know I don't travel enough that I think it would be that exciting I mean generally I think cash back is probably the best option\nI Know some cards tend to give you credit on your bill which I don't know from like may not work as well from attacks purpose because essentially the creditors essentially reducing the liabilities this company\nA plum\nRight yes yeah exactly yeah\nYou know palm card for people who are not aware\nIt's a very popular American Express card for people who get the American express card for business called the plum and they give you if you meet certain jumped through the right hoops you get one and a half percent reduction essentially into your bill\nSo you know my favorite alternative is that you instead look at the fidelity investments reward cart okay and the reason I like that one is you get two percent cash back on everything\nWow in within the two percent can go into your own Roth IRA if you're Ross income eligible or it can go into an investment account that Fidel itty or it can go into if you have kids and to a five twenty nine college savings plans\nOh okay so you don't have the issue with the plum did you end up with increasing potential taxable income\nRight\nOkay wherever it is it is a true reward kind of rebate cart\n... one of the other things I deal with a lot is because of the fact that you know my businesses rather seasonal I wind up with expenses where I'm running so many transactions it's so much volumes on a credit card that I actually have to pay it down before the statement closes in order to not have it you know half of my\nCredit limit and you know being my credit I was wondering if the if there's any way around that or\nOr if you're doing you're managing the card exactly right okay now I add something recently where I made a big charitable contribution on a credit card and I did not send in a payment like you do\nOkay do you believe my credit score dropped eighty points and one mile wow fortunately I wasn't going out applying for any credit or anything but that was a big drop right yeah\nSo you know the shame of it people listening just are horrified that you don't want to use massive charge volume through a business to go see the world but you know you got to go after what you're interested in of cash is what you want\nTo deal with these where you want to be OK okay and they just revised who issues\nThat card for them and it's a program there they really are heavily invested in and so getting the two percent just no games no gimmicks straight cash for you over the course of a year would be a substantial amount of money\nFollowing me

Stevens or you have an unusual thing to ask me do you\nDo I am very fortunate in that I realized it but I Want to make sure because I'm young and my fiance very young that we don't make it a better word we weren't given it a little marriage whether they laid probably out if that's the Morgan State outlawed thankfully\nIt adds a wedding gift or whatever you and your fiance were given a house\nOr

so jihad and family deal we're there gifting it to you\nRetire from what they knew when federal property just kind of what they do than okay when things are going to order particular like so they gave it to her and my question however\nIt hadn't been making a while and we went down to go check it out today and um other than a small walk now Anton line that are like a minor disrepair determined not England and it's what looked like [noise]\nUm I was kinda my point with whether I Need to get home owners warning 'cause I heard you ... for\nNo forget a homeowner's warranty what I'm more interested in is has an appraisal been done the property there has not been an appraisal\nNo but I didn't know they have the pain and what they paid for it in Nineteen eighty five\nThat means nothing okay cool they need they need an appraisal guy and you need an appraisal down to the property which is for them potentially for tax purposes and for you do you have any sense what's the property's worth\n[laughter] I Know the next door and from talking to her grandparents or something like that anywhere between three hundred thousand and all that\nI see that's exactly the point you just hit me with this massive range of value and there's lots of reasons why that's important that be addressed and that they already done the work it's a lawyer and needed it to her or to both of you\nKnow and that's why I'm calling you just told us that they were gonna do this\nAll right and oh here's here's what I Want to do everything I should\nSay my number one in an appraisal should be done other property number two because of the value of this property there's a there's a some issues involved with that the paperwork should be done by a real estate lawyer\nWho practice is real estate law in the state where this property is okay and that is a huge gift\nThat we we we were founded I I can understand that and I I wouldn't\nTell you that if she were calling I Would say that this property should be needed to her only because she's ... and you're not to her family\nAnd I completely concur okay on the other thing because it's a grandparent same everything else we regulate that around the idea of its leading it and then there and and it would lead to more than a tennis clincher relationship without them even though they're getting it to us just wait for the pay for college\nThere actually is an advantage um in many cases if the grandparents are loaded if I Am just another a surplus property that's worth maybe six hundred thousand as much as six hundred thousand dollars they could potentially face some a state tax issues\nOf using them as a payment system but finding that you've charge too much the reality is with interest rates rising and there are many more interest rate rises it looks like in our future\nThe pain from having an unpaid balance on a credit card is moving up so what you need to be about if you know you're having trouble handling using credit cards
