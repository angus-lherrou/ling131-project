supporter at this point in time I was worried at the beginning when he first got voted I was actually scared that he was a Democrat in hiding\nNo I'm saying he has proven to me that he is not he actually is doing the things he said he would he's sticking to the conservative values that I like\nI don't like everything about the man I don't think he's doing everything right but he is sticking to the values that he said he would and that makes me happy and on the other side of the coin I cannot not vote for him because the Democrats are so far from what I Believe in\nThere so far to the left there's no way I could go for that so no matter what even though even if he did these things long ago [noise]\nI Would still have to vote for him [noise] so that makes sense yeah\nI get I mean yeah I told her I got I I think most Trump supporters are probably exactly where a leash is exactly and Alicia thanks for that call a three three\nBut she also said that she wasn't like totally sold

going it's going well how are you doing wonderful\nThank you which is very important that we are both doing well when you want to ask me about long term care insurance right\nExactly so what's your scoop\nWell I'm I Am sixty five my fiance is sixty seven we're both retired and we're getting married and congratulations\nThinking and we had a meeting last its financial planners to get help planning for our financial need during our retirement and to um [noise]\nWe're looking at ... state planning tax planning and that sort of thing and we want to make sure that you know either one of us at the net income in the end of our death and we don't want to leave in families and so\nOn and what are they for if you're not going to be a burden on your family is\nActually right [laughter] I'm a line that way you know we didn't pay with um [noise] you know the issue of long term care and insurance and it's it's really expensive um and so\nWe were just wondering if he might have any suggestions\nOr you\nKnow this is this a real problem because generally you have a segment of the population that doesn't need long term care and that's people who have\nA very large number of assets generally north of three million dollars okay and then people who don't need a long term care because they got nothing they don't own a home you know they're renters they have a very little\nMoney say they've got no investments so there's this group of people in the middle\nThat don't have millions of dollars and assets\nAnd to have some things like maybe owning a home and other accounts they don't want to be impoverished by long term care and you mentioned not a burden on the family so if you're in that middle section and would you say that you and your fiance are in that middle\nI Would say that we're in that middle\nYou you do have to think through what in the world are you going to do if one of you ended up needing assistance with what's known as life's daily activities needed long term care needed a assisted living for nurses skilled nursing home what do you do and [noise]\nThe market offers am perfect answers into the long term care insurance will generally pay for a three to five year period depending on what you buy\nIt will have an inflation adjustment to deal with medical cost inflation over the years the premiums are not guaranteed they can go up\nAnd even initially you're looking at several thousand dollars a year aren't you\nYeah so it is one of those\nThings there is no good answer\nOr their strategies people do where they go see an elder law attorney and title assets in a way that the assets are not at risk it's considered to be a um a a strategy that some people don't like the ethics of others are happy with\nFor you um you buy the long term care insurance\nOkay [noise] um I read online ad out an option uh regarding investing in community care um [noise] it's it I get the idea that it's basically investing in\nYou know I can ... care facility where\nThe the life stages ones yeah you go in and independent living\nAnd then as your needs change you move from place to place but they they don't provide the care for free I mean you go into a state a facility that deals with the stages of aging you're still going to have to pay for the care right\nSo it doesn't relieve the the cost burden so if you if the two of you want to make sure that you're not a burden to each other and you're not a burden to your kids and you're both healthy now\nAs much as it hurts to write a several thousand dollar check a year\nI Believe it or not I recommend it\nOkay\nBut I Want you to get a five year benefit if you can afford it and a decent inflation adjustment which would usually be minimum three percent per year\nCovering inflation over the years 'cause a benefit to you today is sixty five let's say you wouldn't need any kind of assistance to your eighty five\nRight if you don't if you don't have inflation adjustment of benefit that looks good today will be useless Twenty years now but I Do have one other alternative\nOkay going back to age eighty five you can buy something known as longevity insurance is anybody mentioned this\nNot at all generally nobody mentions it because the commissions on it or not very good okay\nSo you can buy a policy that only pays a benefit if you make it to age eighty five and then at age eighty five it pays a very generous monthly benefit for the rest of your life\nAnd so it's money you can live on in the event you need any kind of long term care is therefore you die before age eighty five poof it goes up and smoke okay but it's a very affordable way for you to find much later in life\nWhen the odds would be higher than you would need care\nAnd so I'm like the longevity policies as an alternative you'll have to look around on your own you probably want to look for a fee only financial\nPlanner because commission oriented sales people won't want to talk to you about it angel is with us on the Clark\nHoward show hello Angela Arielle good thank you you want to make sure that your kids\nIt knows how to handle a huge amount of money some day is that right\n[laughter] [laughter] what's his

early age and he said if certain amount each year and then by the time they were in the early twenties that they could potentially be an air I was hoping he did um a refresh my memory is so\nWell actually I'm going to burst your bubble if they can contribute when I talked about is that they if a young kid certainly H Fifteen starts cutting aside two thousand dollars each year they can do that until they're in their early twenties\nAnd never put in another penny and by old age there'll be a millionaire [noise]\nOkay okay well I Can't you can't aside money for a nine year old a little bit each year and then by early twenties that child's a millionaire that's not going to happen but the idea is that if you start saving young\nThat ultimately it makes later in life much easier\nSo our

and that is our food supplies come from everywhere\nThere's something out given ... example when I'm Talking to a school group something like that\nAs a way to really get their attention I say you know it was really easy when I was a kid not to have to eat vegetables all the time or eat fruit all the time because we only had fruits or vegetables when it was in season\nNow and they got really interested in that now because we live in a worldwide food market\nIt seems that things are in season all the time that whatever fruit or vegetable you want is pretty much available twelve months a year but that food chain we now have has come with the addict complexity that people can get sick\nWho source of the illness hard to track\nAnd keeping people safe has become so much more difficult so we'll have these outbreaks of of foodborne illness\nAnd you can have fatalities you can have illnesses that can go on for a significant period of time before the CDC or whoever else ... sleuth on the case can track down the source and shut it off\nYou'll hear from time to time happened with lettuce or spinach or whatever well\nThe nation's largest grocer Walmart\nIt will have a new system fully implemented in less than a year where with any food item sold in the store there will be full\nFarm to store tracking real time so if there's ever anything identified as a potential source of illness it will be able to be tracked down a whole lot quicker\nAnd the recall will happen a whole lot faster and the danger to people will be greatly reduced we cannot make a food supply a hundred percent safe\nBut what Wal Mart is doing is great and an even number of large players\nIn the food industry\nBoth manufacturers 'cause it can also be I mean people get sick from things other than produce you know give me actual um\nCanned food or a processed food they can make people sick as well\nAnd so food manufacturers are part of this process also and John who is part of our Clark dot com crew

can take a check\nWell actually missed at a point because of new information was presented to me after my sixty seconds or so okay let's see her\nYeah I'm about to go swim upstream against some of your advice I've listened to for a long long time and you've been really consistent about Social Security wait as long as you can until eight Seventy as possible and I made that decision sixty two now I made that decision five years ago that I was going to wait until Seventy\nBut I was reading something called the Sunday newspaper\nAnd in the business section there is a question to answer and there was something about Social Security and it\nAnd surprise me it basically said if you or a Social Security age with a minor child the child could get Social Security benefits so I was kind of started with that so I went to the essay dot Gov Web site and found\nSeveral scenarios where kids can get Social Security the parents died there disabled the child is disabled and then there's the one I was looking for it just simply said if you're simply old enough and your child is young enough and if they can qualify for Social Security of course they were more politically correct 'cause they said if you were Social Security age and they were a minor\nBut it didn't do anything to say what the amount would be so I made a phone call the Social Security and I said you know here's my scenario what do you think of is the end result of that conversation was they said yes there's no reason your son wouldn't get fifty percent of your benefit\nWell that sounded exciting but I've learned that you don't trust people on the first phone call or customer service kind of people I've done that before I've listened\nTo the advice made a decision turned out they gave me the wrong information and I made the wrong decision so I thought I better double check this I made another phone call different day got a different person they basically said the same thing they brought in this idea of a maximum family benefit\nBut she said yeah you get fifty percent of what your benefit is though she called me a number that was way lower so now I'm left with wondering well what do I do make a another phone call too\nI Know I'm Wondering is ... I Want you to spend some money to see if it's right for you to do this no cost to forty dollars to do what I'd like you to do\nTo ready ready\nThere's a website I'd like you to go to called maximize my Social Security dot com\nIt's the most if is Decatur tool that I've ever seen or heard of that allow you to run the exact scenario of your exact situation\nAnd figure out if your answer is different than the the general answer the back of the envelope answer is always wait as long as you possibly can preferably days Seventy to take Social Security even though nobody seems to do that but\nIf you run the analysis\nPutting in you have a minor child and all that at maximize my Social Security you will get the answer that will be definitive for your exact situation and you'll be able to see the numbers laid out for you it's a forty dollar license\nAnd it will buy you the guidance for a year or so you can Newt away you can run different analyses and figure out the exact right moment between you being passed sixty two and a Seventy when to take\nCan I add one thing in sure\nI did go down to Social Security office and I felt more comfortable Dale it's somebody face to face and they did verify that and they quantified the amount of money to get the thing that was surprising was they said it would be fifty percent of my full retirement age and\nWhich is when you think it's fair to say my six to sixty six years two months is that full retirement\nYes yeah and so when you compare that to what I'd be actually getting it's really a sixty four percent bump that he would get\nAnd in my calculations based on what they print it out and gave me it means er an accumulation of additional Ninety five thousand dollars in the first seven years of taking my benefit so really what my question and I will check that website as well the confirmed this but this is what Social Security told me\nWhat I'm Wondering is pushing let's break even point wears a Seventy is the winner\nIf I push this down the road a little bit basically the the break even point for me would be at age eighty where without the child benefit\nA sixty sits starts to win but by adding another Ninety five thousand dollars in that break even point goes out to my eighty eighth birthday your opinion is that far enough down the road kicked the can say yeah it's worth taking the money early on\nI mean by the scenario you painted yes you'd want to take the money early on rather than waiting but again we're we're still talking back in the envelope and that's why I Want you to go run this full analysis where you're putting in the variables\nAnd you see exactly what that precision moment would be for you ... dollars is worth it oh\nYeah I mean we're talking about money like this and the time you'll take 'cause you're a very careful man you talked to two different people you went down in person you want I can hear it through and through can you want to get this right\nAnd I know of no better way again the maximize my Social Security dot com forty bucks we'll get it done for you\nCourtney with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Courtney how are you in are you great coordinate you've got an a really great deal on your mortgage tell me about that\nYeah that we currently pay a ... and ... on our mortgage were pretty good at saving money and we put out a lot of money into investments\nThat were wondering if maybe we should make a really really large payment toward our home instead of putting it in fact and like I\nYou know when you have an interest rate of four percent over the long haul you're likely it out or in that in your investments\nSo I Would say that unless it say desire on your part specifically to be mortgage debt free your money is probably best put in to investments than being diverted to the mortgage do you have any other debts\nNot now\nIf you have no doubt that\nWill be done in June [laughter]\nLet's see if you have no doubts and you really would like to settle you pay down your mortgage\nIt's okay to do that you know it's not it four percent it's not highly advise but it wouldn't be an awful idea because the power of being completely debt free but how that feels\nIt's so great right\nSo I Would say that if you were just dollars and cents your best off continuing to be very very focused investors but if it would just make you feel\nThat special feeling of freedom paying off the mortgage if you want to do it go for it but I Would not re fi it\nOK okay fine\nWell best to you and a lot of mortgage outfits will send out solicitations to get you to try to get you to re fi and often there'll be a bait and switch to it offering you a rate that they just may even make up\nTo try to get the phone to ring or to get you to respond to an email and they're real rates are often quite different than what you get in those solicitations\nDavid's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi David\nHi car first of all thank you for

Clark how I Am great thank you Jennifer you have a question about adding onto your house\nA tail trying to build a garage apartment and it it actually it would be a standalone building and and that backyard\nAnd that costs to sell at a hundred and twenty thousand dollars is that I think my question is what am I financing optional\n... I don't want to refinance my home\nAnd I had already thought out a home equity line of credit on my home and\nAnd it turned out they valued my home forty thousand dollars less than what it had to pay for the year before and I went with it they bank I was surprised by that because I live in an area that is creating rapidly so it's certainly not dying and they're very um\nWell they the appraisers the way appraisals work especially if you went to a big bank and they had an appraisal that appraiser may not have ever come by your home even if they did they may not being local and know the area\nSo it's a big problem in how the appraisals are done the appraisals are almost like somebody is wearing um a blindfold and throwing darts and hoping there even throwing to the right part of the room where the dark for this\n[laughter] I think you're exactly right but at the top of\nK so first thing you don't want to even think today about going to a big bank for a mortgage they're not competitive in the market there not flexible they're not customer oriented\nSo let's talk first about the basics of your home tell me what what are you guess it's worth for getting this lower price all you got this time\nFor I don't say it's worth at least five fifty\nAnd how much do you owe on the existing mortgage\nAbout three Seventy five\nOkay so that's not going to be any kind of regular normal alone you're going to try to do against the house because\nYou're going to take your indebtedness up to a nearly five hundred thousand dollars that's before the possibility of any cost overruns on the dish and you're going to do to your home does owning permit what you want to build\nThe wanting a term that day and it it also allows me to treat it as well\nOkay great so you are gonna be what the real estate investors referred to as a mezzanine borrower\nYou're going to need some specialized to help to do this alone and that's because what you're trying to do is although it's not like it's never been done before it doesn't fit the normal boxes\nAnd you don't want to re fi your existing mortgages that cause the rates so low on a track\nSo the lender that will end up doing a deal like this will have wanted to have read on the whole thing into a new loan but if you're gonna have to talk to people and come up with an option so I got a couple of pounds for you\nOkay one is you want a mortgage broker who was an experience mortgage broker\nAnd the second mortgage you're going to be doing will carry an interest rate that may make you rethink not doing a refinance\nBut anyway 'cause it's a higher risk mortgages second position you are going to increase the over a value of your property when you add on to it but you are creating an enhanced risk here\nRight so then that's number one and it's got to be an experience mortgage broker who knows how to do more unusual deals you'll never be able to get a deal like this done it a big bank never [noise]\nThe other place to go is a small local bank and you go in and meet with the chief loan officer or you meet with the president of the bank and lay out for that individual what it is you're trying to do and what your current situation is\nAnd those are the two areas the reason they call this a mezzanine alone is because it doesn't fit any normal Wendy and so they're doing a specialized deals specifically for you\nYou'll get a better deal on it if a local bank will will do it because they'll hold it what they call in portfolio they will hold it is alone on the books of that bank\nOkay eat our recommendations for experience minors or small local banks that we\nCall a what I Would do is I'd call the agent who was involved in the purchase of your home and ask him or her for referrals to who they feel or their most knowledgeable most experienced brokers\nOkay for the local bank you want to look around you and look for those banks you drive by all the time\nAnd you don't even notice that there 'cause they're not well known and recognized brands and if\nThey are truly a small local bank you will have access to their chief loan officer\nOr the bank president and that's what you want to get to know and that so you go in and talk to about what you're trying to do and they're experienced and they're the ones that will know how to get it done movie is with us on the Clark Howard show ...\nYes I Want to talk
