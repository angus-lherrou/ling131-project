show oh Albert how you doing\nHi Clark pleasure to talk to I've been a fan for many years\nWell great to have you here\nWell thank you [noise] um I've got a a high end luxury automobile that\nI've had for twenty four years and ah I watched it appreciate down to about Eighteen thousand five hundred dollars but there's been a real collector craze for this car even though it's a Nineteen eighty eight in the cars now valued at forty thousand dollars and I'm I'm\nLiterally wait wait what did that luxury vehicle costs to buy new in Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Nineteen eighty eight I bought it for for I'm Sorry in Ninety three I bought it for thirty five I understand in eighty eight fifty thousand\n[noise] so now you fast forward the clock and now it's getting back to what it originally cost all those decades ago\nIt's it actually it it hit a low of Eighteen five\nAnd then about three or four years ago that went crazy and\nPeople started collecting a light nuts and I I think it's actually worth like forty six but I'm just going to sell it for forty but I'm looking at offers from a New York and North Carolina and a here locally\nUm but I don't know how what is a safe way to get payments from these people\nLive wire transfer\nJust wire transfer\nYeah cashier's check means nothing\nOkay and so we have two sides of this let's say you were calling me as the buyer in New York and you're trying to uh ... you're trying to buy the vehicle and I'd say well\nYou got to be really careful buying cars how do you know it's really on the condition\nThe sellers telling you how do you know Albert's not playing games with you I you know he really even own one and all that\nSo this is an area where when people buy [noise] I'm old collectors cars from across the country it's a very difficult process to protect yourself a lot of people do it by going through the ... motors platform\nAnd I I actually sold\nA vehicle that was in high demand several years ago through ... motors and this guy bought it from me from Fifteen hundred miles away sight unseen\nPaid me through a the ... platform which ultimately will pay pal got my money they showed up with a with a car transfer service and my vehicle went on its way\nAnd say okay it is it is one of those things where there's a level of trust that needs to be involved with anybody who says cashier's check\nWhere cashier checks used to be the gold standard now they're fool's gold\n[noise] my wife was concerned that if I have these people routing numbers in my account numbers and stuff so that there might be some way to reach back into account and hurt us later I guess that's not an issue\nThat is possible that is possible but with a wire ... that's if you do a C H\n[laughter] okay if you do a wire transfer the wire transfers operate that would be much more difficult thing for somebody to the U.S move on and try to get the money but it is true with a C H\nOh I see I didn't know there was a different\nYeah I totally so with a automated clearing house at all the AC eight system is one that it has risk [noise] all the way around and those risks are greatly reduced where the wire transfer\n[laughter] okay and if if the local people some of them were talking about that we had the same back and we could go into the back together and do that is that a lot of good idea\nThough that actually can be just fine so if you were to ah meet someone at their bank branch you sit down with one of those people those overpriced s and ran right and they witness you doing the bell a sale ship to copy says bills sail\nAnd they issue you hey\nCashier's check on site at the bank and it's one of the bank officers doing it that's money you can trust [laughter]\nOkay so that's a that's a good point I\nI Can't just signed a title and handed to him I Need to make up a bill of sail two bills sail\nYeah so with a bill a sale they're they don't have to be anything ah of ultra formal but the way you do a bill a sale is that what is your name as seller the name and address and the name and address the buyer\nThe Vin number of this luxury vehicle and a description you know miles that kinda thing purchase price and then you eat signed both copies and knew each keep one copy the reason that's important for you it wouldn't be with the type of vehicle you're selling\nBut often with the run of the males used vehicle if it's later used in a crime or the person who buys it never registers at their own name then and everybody's coming to you saying hey wait wait\nYou're the one responsible for this this vehicle still shows registered to you right and that's where the bill of sale is an important piece of evidence it's not foolproof protection in a situation like that but it is a layer of protection\nOkay well that's that's wonderful advice Clarke I I appreciate you taking the time to us Jeremy in the right direction\nAnd I'm so impressed that you held on long enough that you went from having your money trapped in half the now a doubling from the low points above what you pay\nI thought you'd like to twenty four years than\nI Do like the twenty four years that's really great [laughter] All right thanks again

hundreds of stores possibly before they're done in the thousands of stores\nAs the way people by a mattress is going through such a massive change\nOne of our staffers bought a a I guess you'd call Linus the ion us mattress that or heavy sellers on Walmart dot com and Amazon dot com and\nHe said it's it's just the great is that the mattress is fantastic queen size on Amazon today it's two hundred twenty eight dollars\nOn Walmart one hundred Ninety nine dollars yeah and I'm so these things move around in price ... all the time but the point is what Casper started\nThe idea of ... pressing a mattress so could fit in a smaller box\nThat you could have delivered right to your door by\nA traditional delivery service like fed ex or UPS instead of waiting for some mattress company to come with the big truck and deliver your mattress the ability for you to go into\nCostco wholesaler Sam's Club and buy a mattress and a box that you could just put in the back they're all designed this is so funny they're all designed to be able to fit on the back seat of a Honda Civic\nThat's like the classic example of the size they have to be\nIn order for you to be able to get these things home they're special instructions with all these competitors about how you open\nThe box and how you release the mattress and then it takes shape and it kind of blows up right before your eyes\nAnd the all these mattresses although the exact policy may vary company to company but typical policy whether you buy from a direct seller you buy from one of the big boxes you buy from a any third party\nGenerally you have usually a three month period to reject the mattress for any reason\nAnd get a full refund\nAnd the mattress business is one that had really been stuck\nIn a very uh sleazy era for a long time the mattress business often referred to as a step worse than buying a used car\nAnd the reason is is it there was very high pressure you could never figure out the models you could never figure out the quality the pricing a it was a terribly difficult thing to buy one then you'd spend\nA huge amount of money on something and if you hated it you are stuck with it so then this business model a buying one sight unseen but with a unconditional right for\nA period of time to return it is taking more and more market share by the week\nAnd the traditional way of buying mattresses will not become irrelevant but it will become only one possibility out of many ironically enough Casper\nIs now opening actual physical stores\nSo that people who want to go see one in person before they buy it can do that just a small number of them very much like ... Parker is done with high glasses or ... Parker first was only on line and now has physical stores\nAre but not a lot of those either but for people who want to go see frames and get a sense in person they can go do that and so this idea just like Harry's the the razors\nIs possible somebody could get rock and you went through steps to make sure you were dealing with the actual real people and you got the vehicles sold and I really appreciate you sharing the odyssey with us You're listening to the Clark Howard show\nOn the air and maybe you Tom Daschle Tom this is a B.

I'm married with no kids um my husband and I have just separate towns that's just what what for us um\nWe have sold our house and right now currently living in an apartment I have some kind of that I have an a checking account um that is literally not doing anything\nOn together we have the money market account again it just became dollars at the end of next year and having that money for their side so it's not your on them you my personal savings upwards of let's say it's twelve thousand dollars to settle on a checking account\nI Know that I can find something different I'm just asking check there\nSo I just don't know with the fact that a potential eyeing house within the next year a cable and potentially than building a home I don't want to put too much and the fat and if I thought I Will have access to it for a potential ...\nAll right that's that's some priorities conflicting there because you have the need to putting money into a new house at some point\nMaybe in relatively soon and then you've got the far far later that you're sitting there saying clock ticks I have no money saved for that that's pretty much yet right\n... thanks yes I mean it's not something that as this my shift at ... at this stage okay um I don't know if you lay utilize that for the country on a down payment I start to find a different investment avenue on top of the four one K. right ... and why what my company\nOh you didn't even say that how much have you been able to save and the four oh one K.\nI've only started that two hundred dollars a month on naval for it in and they knocked me twenty percent at this age I have about a Fifteen thousand right now\nOkay and how much more can you put in that they'll still match with the twenty percent\nThat's going to be more apt to sit down and actually chat with the company about that on the contract that paycheck I Am a Laker so that's what I felt comfortable having fifty dollars a week getting taken out of the guarantee I cover that\nThat's wonderful that's great that you're doing that so the area if there's more match money available the area that you'd want to step it up just a little bit even is putting them more money into that four one K. where you work\nBecause the advantage of that the other things you might have read about you probably read about something called the raw the Roth IRA\nMhm that's generally just about the best place to put money aside for the long term\nBut when you have an employer match that the higher priority\nBecause that is a free money they're throwing in on the money that you sacrifice and you put in a you know if you can pick up more free money you talked about your savings that are like nothing and all those years think about if you were to\nPinch your check a little bit more even if it meant you had to pull some money out of the savings and every dollar you put in the four o one K through work you're getting a dollar twenty because the employer match\nThat's a twenty percent instant return on the money that you put in their versus the money you have idled discerning basically zero point zero\nRight\nIn your situation go talk to human resources or whoever personnel or whoever it is you talked to and that really gold at target should be to as you can afford to overtime\nTo increase the savings and that four one K. up to where you grab all the match money they'll throw your way\nOkay\nI'd start in there and if you find out you've already ceiling during the match that you've gotten all the money that you could then that would be where you start looking at with some of the savings you have opening your own Roth IRA\nOkay\nWho's the Roth IRA would be the opposite of that four one K. that four one K. you're getting a tax break up front but everything in that account will be taxed ultimately when you spend it in retirement\nWith the rock is the opposite you get no tax break now but whatever money you put in it will be yours to spend tax free later on and

Hi ... nice to talk to you for great to have you ever hear\nThank you um I Know it ain't you are really enjoying your updates on the driverless car and how that's progressing and as I listen to you I think outside the bar you think about other industry that there's going to an impact\nAnd one of them I guess I'm Wondering how the shirts doesn't want to be because I Would like once your car never makes a mistake and never had that what the need for insurance\nWell even more keeping insurers up at night is the idea that cars in the future going to be something we only use per use and we will not owned them\nAnd there's a lot of belief by people who follow the automobile industry and the insurance industry\nThat the insurance industry for autos is going to go into steady decline and that it's not going to happen all one a day but that there will be a gradual reduction in the role of auto insurance in any of our lives so you take a combination\nOf cars is we hit a tipping point where\nThe majority of cars will be self driving which is probably about eight to twelve years away based on vehicle replacement cycles\nIs the majority of cars are not going to get an accidents anymore unless there's a computer malfunction\nThen the claims last from accidents is going to go way down and the whole role in place of insurance in our lives will be reduced as well\nAnd this is not some kind of pipe dream this is gonna happen\nPlease don't tell me you sell auto insurance that just ruins your day\nOh no not at all I like that or myself a little bit your future is and I like ... and ... that will be attacked\nOr they're not easy thing you know\nAnd the idea of having a vehicle that you're sitting in your driveway or garage or whatever that is so going to fade and the twenties you know not this decade but next decade because do you know how long the average car sits idle\n... twenty four hours\nOh I Can't imagine most of it I'm sure\nSo the numbers vary depending on whose stating it but generally it's somewhere between Ninety three Ninety seven percent of the time out of each twenty four hours a car is sitting unused on the left\nSo when vehicles become totally autonomous vehicle will come pick you up when you need a ride\nAnd just drop you off and when you need to go back to wherever you are you'll ... another vehicle that will come and get you and you'll pay per ride by an autonomous vehicle or subscribe to an autonomous vehicles service instead of having traditional vehicle ownership [noise]\nAnd I can tell you this is a possibility [noise] is likely beyond a probability almost to the point that it's something I could guarantee [noise] you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\n[noise]\nHi heart radio fantasy sports news updates [noise]\nOnce again as the Jimmy butler turns according to a dream or ... you have ESPN dot com Jimmy Butler returns in Minnesota wall scientist on Wednesday according to reports on sources ... suffered dominated practice won't even yelling\nAt the general manager more to come there for a short in the NFL Evan Ingram is alpha we fix against the eagles anger maternal practice this week to week but the Thursday night game wasn't enough time for him to return from his brain and C L Buffalo Bills that go Sean McDermott did not totally shut down the possibility of training the Sean McCoy\nWhen asked if it was in the offing McDermott disliked it sank boats are just looking forward to the east and Texans are showing his valuable member of a football team only been out that ... has been rumored to go to the eagles before the trade then by the NFL\nAdditional warranty from the manufacturer and that has value\nBut you've got to have that vehicle inspected as a condition to purchase just like any other vehicle\nBecause remember the first part of this is it is a meaningless term it's just for marketing purposes that tends to boost the cost of a vehicle you're buying\nC. P. O. versus one next to this Nazi PO it can make a two thousand dollar difference right then and there\nSo\nBe aware that this is a gimmick a gimmick that may have some value but there's nothing that says that it does\nAnd you gotta do truth serum which is you want to see the vehicle title history you want and have that vehicle checked out because just because they say they've done all that doesn't mean they have\nIs that portrayed on television somebody bought a very expensive luxury car that was certified that has not been in Iraq\nThat it had not had any problems of note and that has been through the whole thing and that individual had run a vehicle title history and found out guess what the vehicle and been in a major accident\nAnd if they could do that on title history so could the manufacturer that luxury brand so could the dealer selling it under the manufacturers own program\nDon't trust the term\nSam is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Sam\nHow are you great thank you Sam so you're selling one of your investment properties tell me about those\nAre so yeah I have a a rental property I owned for five years and ah this past year unfortunately had two of ... ah and I've my circumstances change I've got two kids now don't really want to manage it so I'm selling it and I'm just trying to figure out what the best use of the proceeds will be\nWell I'm I'm so sorry that having a rental property was not a good experience for you and how hard was it just so that other would be ... you can hear how hard did you find the process to do the eviction\nOr I got my last lent payment in March and a and it was not until August of last year that a ... I was able to get them addicted so [laughter] uh you know it's good for much period without without getting any money on so that was stuff\nThat is terrible and you know that varies by state depending on line or tenet laws\nAn estate how quick or slow it is to get a nonpaying tenant out of a property but that we believe a terrible taste in anyone's mouth [laughter] so yeah you got the buyer you're going to be done you're going to be out of this deal\nI've officially accepted an offer and so again my net for seats will be about twenty thousand dollars and uh you know looking at my portfolio of of things to\nCut off a idle about ten thousand dollars on my life scar on that's a three percent a I've got a S H a mortgage loan or which I'm about six thousand dollars from having a S H J mortgage insurance dropping off that ah and then I've got\nAbout ... laid out again you're F. A. J. mortgage insurance is going to drop off\nWalks I reached the Seventy nine percent loan to value\nOkay All right\nSo and that's with I have five thousand more dollars I'll be at that Seventy nine percent loan to value alone is six years old or so the mortgage insurance premium which is about a hundred and twenty five dollars a month full drop off\nBy and then my third soft fickle that I'm working with the drought got about Eighteen thousand in credit card debt\nFrom the medical bills and a failed business idea or most of the zero interest thought you know which those dates are varying day so that he'll come do uh but you know just show I figure out what the best way to a ...\nWell number one leave the car alone [laughter] okay you know the ten thousand out on the car there's no net advantage to you dealing with\nThat [noise] so I'm On the\nMortgage that historically half ha loans you could not remove the insurance premium do you have something in writing that you will be able to remove it once you have an L. T. V. is Seventy nine percent or lower\nSo yeah that's what a it it's prior to\nEleven and I guess the the the terms that I mean so once I reached Seventy nine percent loan to value\nThan alone is five years old days you know well started as a share of me that the mortgage insurance premium falls off that point right I Want that and writing [noise] okay [noise]\nDo you want that you want that clear as could be and if you can see it in your loan documents even better\nOkay yeah I think I have that Dr ... All right\nGood All right so that is a potential great priority you said you have to pay how much to bring that down\nSo it's not about six thousand dollars\nSo if you did a six on that and fourteen on the credit cards that would be a good combo\nAlright that's or you would would go ahead and just pay off some of the zero interest starts you know a ... and just need a car loan as it is\nYes because the car loan you know pays off at a reasonable schedule the zero percent as you said they're going to expire one by one and then the interest rates boomerang really high on those\nSure so I I think to be rid of that debt okay\nBecause you're only talking about zero to three the difference between those in the car loan Carlin's going to say it's three the cards as the holidays expire are going to go up to typically the zero percent go up to upper high teens\nYeah that sounds about right\nSo I Would get rid of the ... am I Am I'm Sorry is not P. M. I. the insurance premium\nOn the F ha if in fact you really can and wipe out two thirds of the credit card debt or more than two thirds of credit card debt and I'm really sorry you had such a rotten experience with that tenet\nNever know Joe joins us on the Clark Howard show how I'm Joe\nHow are you\nGreat thank you Joe you got a five twenty nine question for me\nYes sir thank you so much for all your advice on these five twenty nine planets been invaluable to me\nOh I'm Glad I wasn't able to help\nYeah absolutely so my question in my daughter's Fifteen and entering her sophomore year of high school [noise] um so he said that you know five twenty nine planets kind of at someone like you know is approaching retirement at what point would you want to sweat your investments from start type choices to more bond are safe conservative choices\nSure so vines are not the safest thing right now which is historical allocation stock and bond mix and the difference between your situation let's say approaching retirement\nAnd your child situation approaching college\nIs retirement once you hit it it can go on decade after decade after decade depending on lifespan where colleges a known quantity is coming at a certain point hopefully finished in four or five years so it's even a higher priority to be conservative with money\nWhen a child's just a few years out from college than with retirement money\nSo in the five twenty nine plan and you're in there should be an age based option\nTen and if there's one that that fits you said your daughter Yes sir fits her age than than just go into that and they automatically will re allocate\nTo protect from the downside without getting too conservative at the same time\nOkay and I'm a British fan I'm a big thing\nOh I see\nSome of them [laughter]\n\n[noise]\nVideo I'm anything scaring me good\nVampires where walls children\nNot one bit but you know it does scare me down time inefficiency scares the living daylights out of me that's why use Granger are America's number one source for industrial supplies\nPlus they've got the inventory management solutions to keep us running so we've got up time we've got efficiency we got productivity when it comes to keeping your facility running ... got your back\nOr number is one of the ones who are compromised in this and are they may tell you that your card was used at a place that was subject to a breach but many times\nThe first you'll know that ah credit or debit card has been used is when activity occurs on your account\nThis may end up even being more widespread than Fifteen million plus your key assignment is to work through your statements very closely over the next few months to see if any funny stuff is on and then\nContact your bank or credit card company immediately [noise] you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nAnd\nHe's from them [laughter]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nFor the you know this is John Green and if your teeth are staying from coffee tea or smoking\nPower swabs is the answer in five minutes you'll see two shades wider teeth and in seven days six shapes even better there is no messy strips are trays that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just wipe your teeth for five minutes and you're done to try and power swabs call one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night you're white white smile will have your friends talking about how great you look\nTry at risk free one eight hundred six seven\nNine o nine six night that's\nOne eight hundred six seven nine o nine six night\n\nFor a while for better or read by members of the law\nAllows more\nNow's the time to take a stand involved to make a change the way\nDoing something like ... the time to health habitat for humanity build hope\nAnd change lives with a family in your community\n...
