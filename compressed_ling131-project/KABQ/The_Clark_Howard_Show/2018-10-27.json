Ah yes yes it was and so I thought\nYou know what I'm just going to reach out the clock and and get a feel for what he thinks I'm about the concepts and principles behind it\nWell I've called and it's not just a term that originated with me or before the concept of the FIRE movement came along I called it max savers and that's and again that term didn't originate with me the idea that if you can live on half of what you make\nAnd coming right out of school if you learn to live on every other check\nIt changes the entire trajectory of your life\nAnd generally by your early forties if you live on half of what you make you will have saved enough money and lived a lifestyle that will make it possible for you at that point to be\nCompletely independent financially and if you don't want to work again you're likely won't have to but really it's more about you being totally in charge of the choices you make in your life you know somebody who works hard enough and sacrifices hard enough\nTo be able to um live on half of what they make isn't doing it so that they never have to work again it's usually so that they have the choice to do what they want to do the rest of their lives\nSo bad and have you been living on a fraction of what you make since you started listening or since you got out of school or what's your track record of Ben ...\nYeah I'd say since I've been out of school probably early on about a forty percent savings rate and right now probably more up to like sixty Seventy\nWhile oh wow I Would put myself\nDefinitely in the Mac savers category and and like you said it's for me it's not so much of a one on never work again in my life I mean I Want the option to do that but really I I see it more of the road the freedom to do whatever you choose\nExactly exactly and you get there and ah you know the people who and I don't want to get into a tit for tat with Suzie Orman but the pie but she's not the only one who really has has been um\nNot supportive of what south coin just FIRE movement which is financial independence retire early and it's ... and it's a cute\nPhrase a cute idea\nA but it's a real idea with real stuff behind it whatever you call it whether you call it ... savor whether you call it fire or whether you just talked about the financial independence side of fire that the idea is that instead of feeling a prisoner\nTo your bills and wherever you work you're in charge and you make the choices you choose to make and so you by saving now sixty Seventy percent of what you may\nYou are in a position to be able to make the choice is you're going to make in your life and is he pile up more and more money it gives you increasing amounts of freedom to make the decisions you want to make\nSo I'm totally supportive of you are you doing anything though that others would look at it and say man bans having no fun in life because he won't even fill in the blank\nA no honestly I feel like I was a great life as it is over the years was\nWith my wife has been Hawaii probably four or five times [laughter] I'm not married nine years so\nUm we travel quite a bit and we definitely don't think we deprive ourselves although we definitely could spend more money we could you know by the fans to your house or cars but choose not to do that\nExactly and you know you mentioned the two areas\nThat end up eating up people's budgets more than any other and that housing and cars\nThat those two things are what become a brutal expenses and they're used to be a philosophy and the U.S that you wanted to reach on a house and by the biggest fanciest house you could qualify for\nI think now there's more of an understanding that that's not where it's at because that monthly payment the overhead of it the property taxes become an albatross instead of a benefit overtime so keep doing what you're doing feel\nGood to have and I ask you can I ask you a related question of course\nOkay so a part of this idea is to be able to reduce your monthly expenses and right now I have a Fifteen year on line I'll mortgage\nAnd I already you know max out my four oh one K. and my wife's IRA my IRA things of that nature so we we don't have more to go there\nAnd I know you you typically discourage people from ever paying down there who work at it but um at some point for me to to really at this level where\nI don't have to work anymore I'm it would be awesome to have a mortgage yawn so at what point in your philosophy what'd you say yeah\nPaying down extra on your mortgage would get rid of that obligation use an okay thing to do\nNow you're talking to somebody who's mortgage debt free and despises mortgages and I carry that at all\nAnd you know if you looked at it strictly from\nPriorities there would be people particularly in financial planning it would say no you should actually put more money in investment accounts but let's talk about the practicality of having a roof over your head that you don't have a monthly mortgage for the value of that particularly as you hit that\nThreshold where you've saved enough money that you would not have to work again unless you wanted to\nIf you want to now that you've maxed out every form of savings that the tax codes favorable to if you want to just concentrate on zeroing out that mortgage go ahead\nAll right sounds great\nAnd be completely one hundred percent debt free which makes everything you've put before now\nEven easier to make work for you so uh I Know there are those listening to you and me Ben that are like these two men are crazy\nI mean I I'm having trouble just pay my bills every month and they're talking about saving fifty sixty Seventy percent of their pay\nAnd it's got to be something you do from the ground up and the decisions you make overtime and there are people who make so little money that this is not a realistic conversation but if you're making a moderate salary to above\nYou can in many cases make financial independence part of your life\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise] see I didn't think they'd have you seen\nThe access to online and secure loans from two thousand dollars to a thirty

the Internet or one of the houses in the panhandle of Florida that got hit so badly by the hurricane recently that\nThere were there were there was like nothing left at all at this beach community in Mexico Beach Florida in one house was sitting there\nAlmost completely intact\nAnd it's so start well I Want to tell you that\nWe have the ability\nTo build tougher homes and the shocking thing isn't beach areas the real cost is not in the structure put on a property is the land that the property sits on that the structure sits on and\nThe cost of construction\nDoesn't have to be a huge amount higher I'm going to go way back in history to Nineteen Ninety two I guess it was\nWhen South Florida got hit very hard by Hurricane Andrew I'm testing my memory from way back but what I Want to talk about is something that shows how important are thought process about how we build is\nTo how uh how survives a storm of various types whether it's a tornado hurricane a earthquake standards there are so many different situations where how you choose to build\nMakes all the difference in doesn't necessarily have to cost a lot more because in Andrew\nThere was an area where the entire neighborhood was flat and just like the pictures\nThat you may have seen from Mexico beach and there were some homes there were sitting there looking absolutely fine and those homes happened to be habitat homes\nThat were built with volunteer labor built way beyond what was the building code at the time and employed technologies that costs virtually nothing like a little thing assignments technology so little thing called the hurricane clip\nThat a lot of habitat affiliates around the country and areas subject to tornadoes uh build with hurricane clips which helps support and reinforce the structure of a home and add to the cost of a home somewhere around a hundred and twenty dollars\nAnd make a home much more robust\nIn the case in Florida we we live part time and a beach community in Florida and our next door neighbor as well as about oh about a dozen homes in our area are built using a new construction method\nWhere the homes are built like and I think this is the one in Mexico beach was the same kind of idea built with concrete and know sheet rocket\nAnd homes are built to withstand a cat five hurricane plots\nAnd the windows may not survive they may blow out the home itself is a hundred percent structurally sound\nAnd all that has to be done is supposed out there is no issue with mold and so the reason I bring this up is we in America face an increasing problem with

and they are executing day by day step by step and every day the the\nThe heat gets a little bit hotter and our site are we\nNow yeah so and not come as you pointed out and about the Saudi thing\nHe has been line from day one what did they just asked him yesterday as he daddy's like well it certainly looks that way he knows he's dead\nYeah she wouldn't believe any U.S intelligence until my palm hail came back and told\nAnd look listen we are talking about this yesterday or the day before we are out just standing in technical intelligence yeah I mean let me tell you if we didn't have a copy of that than we certainly had a description\nOf it from first to your sources yeah uh uh well before it got into the media we're a very good but Mike Pompeo Donald Trump they've got this little game going on there you know or and they are providing cover for the Saudi Government and now once Pompeo came back and reported this stuff is real\nYou know all the reporter you've been seeing from the CIA out knowing for the last two weeks it's real only than Donald Trump says okay well we'll see if we can do with it you know what's going to happen nothing they are going to allow them to investigate\n... express a deep disappointment knock on oh no we did it was at a company with thoughts and prayers but yeah yeah yeah and it's great yeah they've cut off or intelligence right he did they canceled a meeting to share intelligence of the Senate of course because he said it's not a pretty picture you know Saudi Arabia\nStuff and it's interesting because this little this deliberate piece of performance art keeps unraveling because sources keep undermining the position what's reported yesterday they paint late for him he played for him right when he was out there the actual audio of the murder and the torture taking place of the show\nYeah yes knock on my knees are stronger stomach having been\nIn the intelligence business but uh this is horrifying I mean it's just the more details that come out I mean not only about\n... you know being tortured with the you know defected basically while he was alive for seven minutes then beheaded ... you know the detail yesterday was when he was sedated at a certain point so that he could still be conscious drought but not scream\nI'm sure that they should uh you know I ran the terrorism hostage survival school yeah uh for four years of this uh dated them in the first moments just to get them compliant\nWith where and ah then at that point they wanted him to suffer it and they ended it most likely ended it with a ritual is the ceremonial beheading which is what they do but none of this is not sanctioned by the crown\nPrince it cannot happen all of those aircraft that flew there were from the oil flight yeah okay that's like the air force one stable all the people who were there were the equivalent of his immediate Secret Service detail you know they had the guy um\nYou know that one guy is the key ... he's the Saudi Keith Schiller to Saudi\nKeith Schiller only more importantly he would be the equivalent of the supervisor of the oval office security and uh and special forces pilots and then this guy was a famous\nFamous forensic pathologist in Saudi Arabia who is known for his for processing the dead were killed at mecca\nJoins stampede Z and and you know in in incidents where people die by the hundreds sometimes during the hostage\nAnd this guy created a mobile forensics laboratory a multi million dollar mobile forensics laboratory in mecca there's documentaries showing this bad yeah discuss how he has bought forensic science back there he's on the plane with these special forces and oil guard guys\nAnd he's in the room with bones saw yeah\nAs you do when you go to a interrogation\nI'm at work in our front Trump is complicit in assassination think about that he's helping the Saudis cover up the assassination of a U.S resident resident ... show the he's known 'cause you'll be was dead since the story broke lied to the world about Trump is the biggest threat to our national security um because someone else wrote that Malcolm is like\nWhat is this open the door to now what next because they've ... obviously the world knows you can a buy off Donald Trump that he has you know no moral core of any kind\nOf oh I've been saying that for for a long time that the Saudis when he went to his trip to Saudi Arabia uh up until this point us presidents were immune\nImmune to their charms over there\nAnd they're ... the way that they do businesses they offer you cut they offer you a deal or they offer you a straight up Dr I had that happened to me or Iraq yeah it was standard practice you got ten percent\nKicked back to you on any deal and when I didn't do

minutes a maximum of ten minutes from the moment of recognition yeah show on the day that ... a disappeared in that embassy that would not have been that level of reporting but that moment\nThat the

billion dollar deal right now it stands at fourteen point five billion\nA while he is personally ... millions of dollars in Saudi business where am I reading from um he's exaggerating by seven hundred percent the value of us the weapons sale to Saudi Arabia um he said a hundred and\nTen billion with the military the biggest ordering these three of the world like\nEverything's what he has to lie

kill said Walter shop the autocrats of the world are watching what the United States does nest next to nothing happens what's next in American citizen gets murder broad dissidents in exile get killed on American soil\nYes and that happened a lot under Moammar Gadhafi he would send out hit teams to murder his dissidents overseas and I think the Saudis just thought hey we can do that now\nDonald Trump is not going to do anything Donald Trump himself set this the other day\nI Believe he's the Saudis citizen\nNo I Believe he's a permanent us residents bumper Jean yeah yeah who works in washing machine can probably eat reporter yeah we usually an American citizens by the way we dispatch ... we dispatch cheer one special operations people to rescue people of that status roaming will allow him to be murdered\nYeah when they first asked me 'cause I don't believe US citizen like it doesn't matter that is a guy just got killed with the bones to offer ... ... okay I just did okay I Max Boot ... former life long Republican of course I'm Talking about this\nIt's going to be a long wait if they're looking for a serious investigation I'm asking the Saudis to investigate to mark a shortage murder\nIs kind of like asking Donald Trump junior to investigate the ties between the Trump campaign on the Russians the only way you're going to get a fair and impartial investigation as to how it'd be done from the outside I mean the Saudis are not going to implicate the crown prince who's in charge of the entire state\nWhich by the way he went on to say that someone after\nI got to look for somebody to take the fall and it's very disturbing when the Washington Post is reporting that the Trump Administration seems to be colluding with the Saudis and trying to come up with a cover story for this murder instead of trying to get out the truth\nSo that's the latest theory right knock them is that they're going to try to pin this on I forget his name but there's name is colonel in the major general off Medellin sorry right and so they're going to say that he could have ordered he's high up and nothing could have ordered this without the print knowing ...\nYeah he's deputy he's deputy commander of Saudi intelligence uh he was the person who reportedly had proposed\nThe or the away teams that tiger teams which we're supposed to track down dissidents against the regime particularly ... that according to the Washington Post which were forty U.S intelligence\nFound that information out and none of that could have been done without the crown prince is personal authorization again they were using aircraft from the royal light that is like the air force one last week maybe you said a lot of that you ...\nAbout a picture of this guy you said he's the Saudi keeps Schiller reason for the camera images show him at\nYou know we have to cram prints I mean almost that's my that's my that's my ability with three and he is the guy who goes around with him he appears to be the supervisor of the crown prince is personal security detail yeah uh he stands in the\nDisadvantage images at the in Turkey is what I'm saying\nWell yeah and you know comes down to the point where he's the leader of this this is that nations yeah um which tells you it's personal\nWe talked about this whole family I mean how disgusting is this reporting on Jared Kushner urging the president stick by the Saudi princes bud and he said a cushion or argue that the outrage over a ... show these disappearance unless they keep calling it a disappearance\nAnd possible killing will pass just as it did after other Saudi errors like the kidnapping of the prime minister of Lebanon in the killing of a busload of children in Yemen I'm really you know there's all this will blow over word
