hours each week your card dot com scroll down a little you'll see the phone number or an hour's that off the air advice is available to you\nSo I Want to talk to you about something that I've been getting a steady number of questions about on the air and ask Clark says well parents trying to figure out how to do allowance to school age kids\nOr how to pay school age kids for chores whatever's required in your family in order to get allowance and how to do that because how did you used to do that you gay people cash but now\nMore and more\nThe parents have young children don't carry cash themselves I mean why our ATM's disappearing all over the place because caches use so much less than it used to be\nParents using plastic that's all the kids ever see 'em do and the kids plastic is cash so that's led to a bunch of products that it's been a steady stream of product introductions where\nYou have remote double cards you as a parent can monitor on an app on your phone or on a website and you can even with some of these cars you can control where your kids spend money\nYou know the downside with these card programs is usually you have to pay fees to be part of these programs so you're paying money to be able to give money to your kids which I've never a fan of\nOne in particular though has been really intriguing to people and that's green light\nWhich allows you to use green light as a way to try to encourage your kid to save you know I'm so into the daddy match on retirement plans where\nMy kids is teens as they are the two older ones raging out of this but as they would save money from jobs\nI'm ... dollar for dollar\nGoing into a Ross IRA to encourage saving not spending\nBut we're talking about with green light having one of those cards it costs you sixty bucks a year to have the card\nSixty so that's a lot of money to pay to then have the ability to encourage kids say within the card plan so this is going to be weird\nI Want you to turn back the clock\nAnd what I'd like you to do instead\nIs allowing to your kids were that archaic thing called money give him money you won't have to pay any fees for it kids get the finite and is with the actual money in their hands that they don't get with a plastic card\nAnd if you can afford to do a match\nLike greenlight does when you allowance a kid if they're willing to save money that they then turned over to you periodically for you to put it in a savings account or put an investment account or something like that you tell them the incentive is\nEvery dollar they don't spend you're going to match with the dollar to create that concept\nSo somebody comes up with a free card like usa\nNow my kids grew up with usa spending cards or whatever they call them where you have parental control and all that and it's all free\nI get free I don't get paying for these things but ultimately I can tell you with my kids even usa spending card was not nearly as effective teaching the finite has the money as cash\nAnd be sure you're making the right decision so whether you know a lot about life insurance or nothing at all star chart surge policy genius dot com and just two minutes you can compare

with a couple of clicks\nTo have it removed from the Internet in Europe across the entire European Union there is a law called the right to be forgotten\nSo if let's say somebody who's been subject to

anything like that in Europe somebody who's a a it doesn't even have to be for a reason that you fear for your wife you were allowed to put in a request\nTo have information about you suppressed and

and he answered the phone\nWow and we had a grey I'm catching\nUp and so this is this is a two sided coin but I Do feel that what the Europeans have done\nIs the right thing because of the number of instances where people faced danger is you have the ability to suppress information about themselves and we ... we just don't have any such thing\nWell you hear these ads on the radio you know where

you CDs\nBut I remember that the call that prompted the stink and I remember wondering why clocked in bringing up copyright issues at the time\nAs I recall the car said he wanted to sell his CDs because he'd already made digital copies of the content and didn't need the originals any more if you buy a CD you have the right to make your personal copies for your own use if you transfer ownership of the CD give up the right to keep those personal copies\nNobody's ever likely to be prosecuted for it but legally ethically it's a copyright violation\nThank you for posting that and let me tell you an annex to it that stunned me\nI had no idea until I read two reports recently that the music industry is still having an enormous problem with pirating\nWhere people are stealing music they're not paying for and that was a problem but I thought was gone because of Pandora spot by apple music and the rest where you have for\nEither for free with commercials with some of them or\nWith you paying a monthly fee you have a essentially an unlimited library of music and if you pay a fee of some kind you're both online and off line ability to play music I didn't know people still stole music\nClarke you recently stated that money in your retirement account should be well diversified quoting you verbatim well diversified what that means and simple English is that having money in a variety of stocks not your employers own in fact ... percent I like to have an employer's own stock in a four one K. is zero percent\nThis is good advice until the part about not having any four one K. money and employers on stock\nThere's nothing wrong with having some money and an employer's in stock especially if you worked for a stable company or a blue chip company listed on the S. and P. or Dow Jones they're present is actually too conservative eliminating any risk when especially young workers should be taking on some limited risk\nThank you and let me respond to that so I'm really strident about not having employers stock in your retirement plan because a lot of people I\nHave um an issue with investing where if employers stock has offered\nIn a four one K. people go way too much all in with the employer stock I have to be really really stark in stride and with that\nTo get people's attention because people feel like oh I work here I Know everything's great it's going to be wonderful to have my retirement and my employer ... too many eggs in one basket 'cause you're also getting a paycheck from that employer\nAnd you never know when a company\nFinds it's lost its way look at one of the blue is to blue chips General Electric\nThat isn't so much financial trouble now and if people working for the very heavily put jeeze stuck in their retirement plan they have way too much risk involved I'll say this\nIf you really feel a strong sense of loyalty to where you work\nAnd company stock is one of the options you can put in up to ten percent of your four one K. and company stock just so you feel like you're showing that loyalty but no more than that but my preference still remains zero\nYour advice was less than stellar and certainly not complete about building a home and I needed to head up wind as a result\nI had a great experience building a home although I hired a general contractor my brother is an architect and designed the home provided excellent blueprints from just a few photos I've provided asked him to act as a general contractor and he immediately declined\nHe said it would be impossible for him to get the best subcontractors since he lives in another state\nAnd one bad subcontractor can be a huge headache for homeowner he suggested identify a locally owned an independent lumber yard and construction supply store not one of the chain stores that had been around for a long time\nHe said call them and ask for the general manager or even better the owner for reference for a good GCE\nHe said they will know who pays their bills on time who does good work who buys the cheap supplies for the good stuff\nWho has a good crew who has a good reputation etcetera I got a reference there and my general contractor did a great job\nThat is a fantastic posted in thank you for sharing it it's funny when I talk to people who have actually built their own home\nUsually when I asked people if they would do it again the answer is flat out no in your case it worked out very well and I love the methodical process that you're a brother the architect recommended\nRecently had an article on on a clock dot com called why you should be aware of sharing a bank account with an elderly\nParents and is posted about that I shared checking account with my elderly father why I collect S.

flying\nThe airlines try and fee you for everything especially for bags and you can have a bag that is a fraction of an inch larger than what an airline allows and they're gonna tear your wallet apart charge you all kinds of fees so\nAs I shared with you a few months ago when my daughter was headed off to college we flew on southwest 'cause bags are free you can check to bags each person free and so we were able to car dollar stuff off to college\nAnd so I was meticulously using a tape measure to make sure we met total inches and for each dimension and all that and gosh it was\nReally kind of a pain to make sure that the bags were okay and would carry ons you have to deal with that was spirit frontier in a legion if you go I just in the end of an inch over suddenly they charge you a hundred bucks potentially at the gate\nFor your micro carry on being too large\nSo now kayak\nHas a new feature that will actually figure out if your bag is A L K for whoever it is you're fly\nAnd it only works right now for certain iPhones know Android version yet but with it you can just with your iPhone\nTake the camera or whether kayak out and it takes a digital image of the luggage calculates the dimensions and then we'll be able to tell you yes or no you're okay with that bag\nNow I Know this drives people crazy but whenever there's an issue on when I fly a legion frontier spirit\nI always take a black trash bag with me so if they were jak my carry on\nI Will abandon the carry on suitcase and put my possessions and the black trash bag and that was not original with me I saw it happen at a spirit gate\nWhere somebody was prepared and put their things into the trash bag avoided the hundred dollar gate checked the\nAnd just carried their stuff and the black trash bag and so I'm always prepared you know Boy Scout motto will always be prepared right so I'm prepared and isn't it funny that that's where we are the strangest thing though\nIs it's hard to tell who's a full for airline who's a discount airline anymore and how they treat you with the baggage\n'cause he denied it does that same junk with most of their coach passengers\nThat you aren't allowed to put something in the overhead bin anymore\nOn what they called basic economy and\nSo the all the baggage fees are huge revenue for all the airlines except southwest and so it's all about you buy the ticket and that only buys you the privilege to be charged fees for anything else you want to do seed assignments whatever\nBut at least you don't want to get to the airport and find out your bag is too big\nAnd I got to say the kayak\nMost people aren't androids come up with a version that works for Android\nCharlie's with us on the car coward show Hi Charlene\nHow clock Charlie and you've got a question for your

getting ready to purchase a home that is absolutely going to require that I get flood insurance and I thought that the only option available was government flood insurance that um\nInsurance carrier that and getting insurance um from gave me the option of private flood insurance and I didn't know how that can care and achieve governmental insurance or something I shouldn't even consider\nSo private flood insurance is only a backstop if you're buying a very expensive dwelling ... to backstop beyond the federal flood insurance program the federal flood insurance program is subsidized by your fellow tax payers\nAnd so the first dollar loss you want to go against the federal flood insurance program and uh it's really simple to buy it it there's a website that explains everything about the federal program it floods smart dot Gov\nAnd a kind of homes that the structure itself you know native land you don't consider the land\nThat have um\nA value of a quarter million dollars or less okay you're fully covered by the federal flood insurance policy how much is this home you're buying likely words\nOn I ... it will be covered for like three hundred thousand dollars\nOkay so you could I mean you got [noise] you have a situation you stack additional private what insurance on top in the in the situation where this house is that you're buying\nWould a flood create a total loss of the houses are multi story like what's it look like\nIt is a one story house is a second home at the beach\nOkay so do I have under\nI'm saying anyway says you Susan okay I have a second home at the beach and I have a homeowner's policy\nI have a wind storm policy and those are both private [noise] I have the federal flood insurance for the two fifty and then I have private flood insurance for the excess\nOkay so much more complicated and with the second home I should tell you you and I don't get the same subsidy that people do with the primary residence\nAnd I think that's just as it should be I mean why should why should our fellow taxpayers be subsidizing us to the hill when it's okay uh you know is a second home but it is generally cheaper\nTo have the first quarter million under the federal program and in your case you'd have potentially a little supplement of our private policy\nAnd ... the question is there any um [noise] ... it for education from having a separate wind power the from the ... versus a combined policy or is it just\nWould generally what they do is uh is it would be from the same ensure but ...\nCharge you a premium separate for the winds storm without really call when storm okay All right that's great\nAnd one thing you should know get ready for the joys of having a place on the water which is great but know that there will often be a larger deductible on that policy when it's a name storm\nOkay yes yep okay All right thank you very much for the information I really appreciate\nHer and let's hope no floods no hurricanes nothing come near

today\nYes sir I've actually got anything there about two years old does that end up from a previous\nMarriage and divorce is that I've just whenever paid and frequently I park at the house two years ago with an ethics a loan and I'm\nTrying to get my credit cleaned up black I go into a more conventional loan and get out of that in my better better than my question as I've read some conflicting information bars when it comes to paying off those collections account\nAnd that if I go and negotiate a lower rate that I had to pay it off that it could actually hurt my credit versus just happened to the right balance\nThan I think that I read was to probably try to negotiate with the creditors prior to paying them that far as what they call a ... and actually I tried that with one of them and with that ... that kind of get your your thoughts on and\nSo I've never heard of that show that really referred to as pay for delete but I've I've recommended that process for many years in some collection agencies will agree to it others will not but the idea is what the collection agency wants the money\nAnd uh I don't know if it's many or most will agree that if you pay it that they will remove the item for you to report so it's just like it was never there right exactly and so\nI think ... that they are so far neither one of them of am I saying they have the ability to date at all\nOh they absolutely have the ability to do that is just a matter if they are going to do that but they can\nWrite up on commission law it is the way that it should be able to take it off right\nWell you know in some collection agencies may not give the people the authority that are calling\nYou the power to do just that but as far as going into a conventional loan\nThe items that are on your credit report ... many times they will not allow you to re fi if the items are open items but ... if they're paid off but what you won't get as you won't get a big booster shot to your credit score by paying all the items\nAnd so if you're talking about the conflicting information that's where it gets confusing is that by paying it off and by the way even if you reach a deal and their later reporting zero balance\nThat's the same effect for you when you go to re fi because there will be a zero balance that's what the mortgage lenders looking for\nI say okay but\nLet's go back to the F ha versus what you're looking at going into a conventional what is your interest rate on the F ha loan\nI have a three point eight Seventy five right now\nBecause even with the M. I. P. added in you may be in the best position to be in which is a great position with a fixed rate\nMortgage that starts in the three's Justin joins us on the Clark Howard show Justin I'm Sorry to hear your wife was in a car wreck is she okay\nAh yeah she's fine it was a very very minor standard bitter fender bender so to speak English here in line at a red light and the tractor trailer needed to turn it in and she is I get enough or oh says she put it in reversed and it looked at them they're an aide back\nAnd hold our cautious too hot and it was a black other car under there and she barely cracked from law for the car\nNo car that she is\nOn a good day my brain ... thousand dollars and I told my wife just ... to go in and ask let little sandwiches and then look forward to start if we want to send it to the insurance company or not a lady goes and senator insurance as she comes back with a quote of seven hundred dollars\nAnd the question was should uh you know run up to ensure actual would I be better off paying it out of pocket\nSo the legal answer the book answer\nIs you always tell your insurer even though it'll kill you on your insurance rates\nRight the reason that you're supposed to do that is because if this person suddenly decides that from the tap on our bumper she has soft tissue injuries she's watched too much bad late night TV\nAnd decides to call all twelve of the lawyers that she saw in one thirty minute show offering to make her rich like she won the lottery\nIf um if you're worried about that then\nGo through insurance if you're not worried about that if you have a sense of the individual and all that you're willing to take the risk right or a seven hundred dollar check can be done with it\nOkay and how would that affect our race but we haven't had we've never fall to climb never had\nIt well that's why I'm saying if if you're not worried that this individual will decide that this is a bonanza than just pay them and don't have a claim because the problem is\nThe insurers typically with any even minor thing we'll hitch up pretty hard unless you have a policy that has a one time accident forgiveness\nOkay so if you ... and I'm going to ask you to do some homework who's very dull homework okay but if you get out your um your policy\nHere I'm going to tell you whether or not you have something akin to accent forgiveness\nIf it's just such a rare event that you would ever need to call on your insurance company then you can call them\nOn the other hand if you don't have accent forgiveness you have to make a judgment about that individual and if they're if they're just going to be happy to have the money and go on with their lives then you just do that and they go on with their lives\nOf ... she was I asked her to email us pitcher to let me go get another quote and she got\nKind of like you say you know there's just too weird you're expecting too much and this that and the other and you know when she started that I told my wife actually earlier today though is she going to act like they're probably just going out to the insurance that way we are covered all the way around\nWell that is that judgment piece I was talking about ah so ah you have your best answer based on how she's reacted\nOkay and you'll have to let things fall where they might with your insurance premium\n... I'm I'm hoping we do have the wrong kind of accident forgiveness and I did the math or even if they did knock off ... percent it will take a long time for it to match you know like a couple of years of paying ... percent lower for like seven hundred dollar mark so\nGot it got so the good news is it's one of those minor minor things nobody got hurt you just a hope that they know accidents happen in a good long time from here and then that record goes completely clean again Susan's with us on the Clark Howard\nShow Hi Susan how are you a car I'm having a\nGreat day Susan how can I serve you\nWell thank you for taking my call I'm sure he had the situation with our daughter who worked for\nA while now and restaurant chain and she worked for a local franchisee and we received a letter from the local franchisee cut office that said\nThat there was I mean I Try to access to an employee data style that was stored at the national restaurant chains server so that their server was breached I guess and um\nThey indicate if the files on the server were encrypted or an encrypted\nThey did not indicate that asked her if\nThey didn't know that that means they weren't encrypted pass through his if they if they had\nTo disclose and the files were encrypted they would have told you that kind of get more peace of mind so if they were silent on that that means that the people I have a pure raw data that easy for them to digest\nAnd they indicated that first last name and Social Security number could have won easily with and included in the information that we had that unauthorized access\nAnd Susan how old's your daughter\nRight now currently she's twenty\nOkay that that was important because at twenty she can do the most important thing following this breach protect herself I imagine that the restaurant chain sent one of those useless standard letters saying that they\nWere offering her a year of courtesy monitoring of our credit or something like that\nActually the opposite is now saying\nOh [laughter] well I'll tell you nothing is about\nEqual to the meaningless credit monitoring that seems to be standard corporate procedure today after a breach\nWell they did give us a credit monitoring ... and the first they said she couldn't get it placing an initial fraught alert on her credit filed that was option number one on a PIN number two if she could also price has already free which my question at the same that credit ...\n... security freezer credit freeze is the absolute right choice for your twenty year old\nGreat OK Now let's make matters worse because she thought that the country can we do it by proxy for her\nAll right so I'm going to give you the real answer not the book answer okay if you pretend to be her and you go on line as her mom but pretending to be her right you can easily set it up for her okay if you\nOverseas right so I Would just do a little here and set 'em up as if you're her got it and I can get online I take it yes 'cause you'd never be able to do it ... if you're her if you didn't do it on line actually\nOkay and this that they are in her report and her she determined that should be removed\nWell actually it's better than that the way of credit freeze works is when she needs access to credit\nApply for new credit she just temporarily does a thaw okay and then it automatically she said how much time or or which credit grant or gets to check her credit and then it goes back into the deep freeze again okay it is like are the best strategy any of us have\nFor shutting down any possibility of credit based entity that\nAnd my last question for you is what recourse rehab should potentially anything disastrous or yeah financially ruin it happened because of this\nIn the meantime between when you knew and before now\nAnd then you have your phone service for the wife of whom had been around a long time hopefully they'll stay around for a long time it works off the backbone of the Internet

know if they were looking down or whatever they jammed on the brakes to white and fortunately there wasn't too much damage but they ran in the car by the ... in front of the Mets I mean that's something that we see all the time right\nYou're on the roads alive in an urban or suburban area you're going to see that\nWere those collisions occur and most of the time is fortunately a situation and nobody's hurt\nBut you got all the property damage\nWell there's a technology that started off on rich people's cars kind of work kind of didn't and then spread to more models and twenty Seventeen model year\nBut this is the year with the twenty ninth teams coming out that the vehicles doing the automatic emergency braking is very very common and let me tell you something\nIt works and not a hundred percent of the time or prevent an accident but it will definitely less than the severity of an accident because the car senses\nYour closing distance on a vehicle in front of you\nAnd before you can even react is already breaking the car\nSome of the systems kind of word shoe forward yeah I mean you you've appreciably feel yourself a tightening against the seatbelt others do it amazingly gradually\nThe way they do it and my car has adaptive cruise control where it will automatically come to a stop on its own if traffic has come to a stop in front of me and his traffic slows down and always keeping\nA theoretical safe distance from the vehicle in front of it and it it is an amazing technology once you have a lot of times I first was introduced to it and a rental car and people who travel enough that you're a variety rental cars\nYou gauge the cruise control you'll experience\nWhat a difference it makes and so adaptive cruise control and the automatic emergency braking when you're looking for a new vehicle\nYou want at least one of those two things a lot of people don't use cruise control except on over the road trips the new adaptive cruise control systems are designed to be used\nIn everyday slow and go stop and go driving and we'll make a big difference for you in terms of your safety another feature that is some people have a very hard time adapting to or blind spot cameras\nWhere the car is equipped with the cameras that is designed to be used instead of the mirrors and so where you will always have blind spots in a car with a car is you're going to change lanes\nThe blind spot cameras prevent that problem by giving you a complete view\nOf where you're trying to head\nAnd although they won't prevent you from making the lane change if you still want to
