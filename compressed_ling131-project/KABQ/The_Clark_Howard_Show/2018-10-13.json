Sunday Herald Monday 'cause my wife shot the dummy had Anita Tony a real quick with a a Texas report um guess where the uh get my ... already a registry young people registrations were up the most because it\nTell us what the Texas\nHa ha Ted Cruz\nI just wanted to say something about the polling that they're doing the joint uh Ted Cruz slightly ahead uh-huh but their polling likely voters likely voters or people who voted in the last two elections right these kids are new are just now getting registered I doubt daughter goes to Texas state\nAnd she said every time she turned around and registering voters they've been doing that for the past few weeks\nI Love the fact that the combination Taylor Swift and Willie Nelson is making lose their collective shes all\nJoy ... right so the parents and the kids you know yes Willie Taylor let's do this Taylor yeah I mean I Do do do it all you do it [noise]\nEveryone has to be there most annoying with everyone they know about voted [noise] do you watch as my daughter you ready to do it\nI Can't name one song otherwise I'd do it oh really I Can't I get off she could come about well let's take it all on all\nWhen you walked in we're never ever that are getting back to ... yeah All right pat\nYou know I bet ... every single terrorist list song\nAnd the man and I and why Manchester joins us now we're running around the bringing them back to your keys then let me just got boring\nI'm from Washington\nGood morning my good morning ... am perjury or a previous caller I just read yesterday but David Ogden\nAnd then our guns all of us are planning a walkout for election day where they're gonna where students are going to leave their schools and they're going to march on down to their local precinct and vote good these are things that we're not hearing about in terms of young voters and I I'm skeptical just as much as anyone else\nTerms of the young voters turning out but that bad in particular is good news\nYeah well I mean just by you treated among other people you said there is an exodus women from the Republican Party Trump always makes things worse for Trump um and again yeah the matter how they try to keep spending this cabinet stuff and Trump's ego\nWomen loved in women as there every angry about the Democrat hoax it's like yeah no no\nYeah yeah I mean right now I think fifty eight percent of all women all of a women registered voters in this country are voting for Democrats this time around and that's a big deal\nYeah this has seen his new generic ballot pool has women opting for democratic candidates sixty three to thirty three gender gap as a net\nThirty five percent I mean I've been saying this for a long time about this blue wave is going to be female but I also say well you see every day don't get happy don't focus on any polls don't because there was one showing democratic enthusiasm way down after the Kavanaugh thing for a day and everybody freaked out right\nYeah well it's really sad that we have to worry about so much complacency on the left but the fact of the reality is is that we kinda are in that place where we have to scare our own people into voting yeah you know like I I literally we got to get a Malcolm adds to go door to door just stare people\nVote out as just knock knock knock chow chow chow okay\n[laughter] ... meter right you won't even\nGo just stand on their front doorstep and just start yelling at the door\nUntil they come down\nYou know scared enough to vote but I mean it's it's true but I think we're underestimating the number of voters that are going to turn out on election day I think there are a lot of people and especially especially women and rightfully so who are fed up and and now's the time to rise up\nBecause again if only women voted weed out of the most progressive country in the world if only men voted the Republican Party would be the left wing party\nYeah this is so important for for women especially to get out and and change the tide of this uh this disaster\nYeah well you know and Bob I think I'm like I was saying it is an interesting I mean Ted Lieu tweeted yes the electorate has was transformed this November we experienced in Nineteen Ninety two years a woman times a hundred um but again I\nOnly if we turn out tonight we keep talking about all these various voter suppression you know a ... that they're trying around the country so you know voting early as ... keeps saying voting by mail once a lot of ways to avoid you know meddling on election day right\nOr own a lot of these voting machines grow who sell well\nYeah and and you know as much as we're concerned about things like voter suppression\nVoter id and gerrymandering and all of the shenanigans the Republicans why I mean we've got so many impediments that are passed ultimately in terms of winning back at least one chamber of Congress and you know we've got all these things voter id as I said and and gerrymandering and the Russians and so on\nStaring down the barrel of a possible a Republican a constitutional convention where they start proposing there liberty amendments\nNo event than we're ... yeah a couple of great points on Twitter you made more damage courtesy of the Trump crisis any Republican doesn't screech bitch and wine in public is considered moderate regardless of policy positions and this one aboard warning shot across Carlos those rocky style\nTrump does a lot more skits and wacky voices during his rallies he used to I blame the brain brain worms\nSeries message Andy Kaufman who's still alive please rip off the orange latex disguise and let us off the hook already president Tony Clifton isn't funny thank you yeah yeah yeah\nYeah it's Tony Clifton to me last night Donald Trump is Tony Clifton\nOne of them one of the horrible carnage is of the president's either lowering the bar and humor right I mean I blame the people that laugh at him and encourage and you're like what that's not even vaguely funny whatever he's doing\nWell for God's sake I mean last night he was mocking Dianne Feinstein even doing his little Dianne Feinstein voice which he does a lot now this is again the United states the leader of the free world the person who's supposed to be the president of all of us\nIs mocking half of us and in particular Dianne Feinstein one of the only woman in the United States Senate yeah he's doing this all the same time where there\nIs his red hats stooges are chanting lock her up and this is three or four days after Donald Trump stood up and lectured us about due process not presuming someone was guilty before they're proven innocent you know it's just like\nThis would be a journal\nNow I Know of all the of all the Nikki Haley theories it in her resignation letter was written the day he started mocking Dr Ford [laughter] yeah yeah maybe she's just ... yeah\nYeah it's I mean Nikki Haley Nikki Haley's leaving because of cabinet oh I think Nikki Haley is going to run for president I think all of the platitudes issue was delivering yesterday were\nDrip rush to assuage Donald Trump I mean we all the time and time again people kissing\nIs right but we have not they have not invented the glasses yeah that can see a Jared Kushner's hidden genius that she's\n[laughter] right well let me shift this day and in in that pose to the end of the year so she has to make nice with the clown
