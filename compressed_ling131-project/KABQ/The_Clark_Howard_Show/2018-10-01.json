seven percent at the moment [noise] um and we're going to be here at least exercising more here if we can find it for a living and I my question why should I we've finance but maybe they're Fifteen and then got fined him he said oh no way they get along\nAnd leave it alone there's no necessary move you got seven years left you're going to be completely mortgage debt free and a seven year cycle you're building up at this point you're building up enormous equity every single month\nAnd it would take you into reverse and eight years back into the loan okay you're going to have closing costs\nTo be at the same rate you're already at\n... and so you are or think of it this way you are investing in your future with every single monthly payment you make\nYour ... okay I just thought about this do you know the fastest growing part of the car market or people taking out seven year car loans oh why you are now and a mortgage that basically a seven year Carla\n[laughter] so I Would just pay is agreed and know that that you are absolutely doing a great thing for your long term financial security\nThan I Believe in their\nBest to you and again\nIt is such a neat thing if you're in a position when you re fi\nIf you can go into a ten year loan that some and credit unions specialize then you get extraordinarily great rates and such a quick pay down the debt on a straight trend line to being completely that free Peter is\nWith us on the Clark Howard show Peter ... to have you here you want to talk about a potential benefit of the Cosco visa card and what is it\nYeah ... good afternoon I'm I it is the price rewind feature and it is kind of hidden under the shopping benefits\nBut it's somewhat amazing um I bought a refrigerator for about eleven hundred dollars and it basically it's retroactive cash Christ match up price guarantee and they gave me a hundred dollars cash on it\nAnd as long as you register or purchase how long does it take for you to register a purchase\nAbout a minute all you have to do is you have to um\nYou know in a mere item you know by UPC code name they have a database it'll find the item and then you upload the receipt as an image file Ajay pay or something and they don't do this for perishable food and medicine personal care products that has to be you know something durable\nAnd ah you know I bought a Christmas present for my daughter and I saw it on sale somewhere else for Fifteen dollars later and I was sort of you know\nCrime is sad cry but then I thought hey I'll just price rewind it and I got the Fifteen dollars so so I shop for quality now and I worry about the price later\nHow about you and so I have a brother who uses this with a different credit card and he remembers to register them and all that I Am too flaky to do that but if you are like you are my brother\nAnd you'll take the time to register or if you don't register you can check you see a lower price within two months\nYou can apply submit to prove and they just give you the money back\nExactly cash or or the same thing or a credit to your credit card\nWell I Love that you mentioned this again uh this is not just the Costco city visa card although it is one of their benefits several card issuers do the same kind of price match thing bill is with us on the Clark Howard show hello bill\nCollector to talk to you\nWell good to have you here you've got a question for me about your your wheels what do you drive\n... right now I'm driving a an older ... and it does not get the gas mileage that I Need out of it so I've been looking at a moving into hybrids\nAs you've seen over the years gas prices go up down up down up down when it does if you do buy a hybrid when nobody wants them when they're completely ion loved is you get a great deal buying it and then you spend like nothing to run it\nYeah and I'm I'm definitely looking at\nYou know moving into a hybrid for the gas savings but I'm also looking at some of the older hybrid that maybe are coming off of lease or got some more miles on them but one thing that I'm a little bit worried about is that replacement costs for the battery\nAnd I know you said in the past that the war in like a third party warranty extension on a car is not a good deal but there's that battery changed the equation does an extended warfare hybrid makes sense\nNo because the battery pack for a hybrid ... used to be a real big expense and now they're not\nYou know the battery packs on a hybrid if they went out at one time I think it was as much as ten thousand dollars to replace the battery pack and now it is really not a major expense any more typical hybrid battery pack replacement\nWould be somewhere I think about twelve hundred Fifteen hundred dollars\nYou know you're going to have a transmission go out in the car and spend a lot more than that oh definitely\nThe other thing is if you buy a hybrid\nIt's a model that spin out for a long time they've got the reliability down pretty well on the batteries I made a mistake I did something you're never supposed to do in two thousand three I bought a first year version of the Honda Civic ...\nAnd they just didn't have it right yet on the battery and the battery ended up failing white prematurely\nAnd so you know they say first year of any car you never want to buy first year like if you were looking at a used hybrid you'd never want to buy one of the original purchaser bought it the first year they made that model\nYes yes yeah you don't want to be the guinea pig\nRight and so as far as the extended warranty I'm neutral on car Warren ... you know I I don't really like warranty is because\nThe money is always not near favor the difference with an automobile is the cost of repairing an automobile may be a back breaker which would often will be for someone and that's why even though they're not a good deal you may feel you need to have one\nBut if you do decide to buy whatever model you buy\nYou want to buy the manufacturers owned extended warranty if you choose to buy one where you can also buy one time use access to Consumer Reports database on line and if you look at the record or repair\nFor the make model in year that you're considering for that hybrid if it's got a great record of repair\nYou're better off not even considering buying the extended warranty\nOkay\nSo I guess I Am confused people would this like you're looking at appliances electronics anything like that\nNever ever ever not ever laptop never never never not ever\nDo not by any kind of extended service contractor warranty or car\nRemember the math is just is lousy buying that extended warranty or service contract the difference being\nWell if you can't come up with the money it's different than if your TV crooks you can still get to work with your car but if you're ... and you can't afford to repair it and you can't get to work\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy one rod Stewart started a five week run it number one on

somewhere with a lower cost of living you're gonna live better right but how much better in which places really are going to help you stretch your buck\nI shared an example with you ... months ago about how a lot of the New York banking centers\nHave moved a lot of their employment to Jacksonville, Florida somehow Jacksonville is become a big banking center and typically people are offered to transfer to Jacksonville from the tri state area in New York New Jersey Connecticut\nBeing paid only Seventy percent of their prior paycheck for the same job that they have had in the tri state area and people jump at the chance to take the big pay cuts\nWhy because the cost of living and the relative quality of life\nIs so much better in northeast Florida than it is in the tri state area people don't have to pay state income taxes which can be pretty significant or New York city a city income tax\nPeople face a much lower\nTax burden much lower housing cost a lot of people who could never afford to own a house can own one and so even though they have to do something and it seems like going backwards take a significant pay cut\nTheir living a better life overall what if you could earn

you can see based on your income\nWhere that puts you versus other people in the metro area you live in would you be considered to be upper income middle income lower income as a general rule\nA nationally twenty percent of people\nMaking income that's considered to be upper income and half of people make middle income and roughly about thirty percent of people are low income earners so you have twenty percent high income earners thirty percent low income earners the other half in the middle\nBut the income you have if you can duplicate it somewhere else where would that put you what kind of comfort level would you have\nObviously people who live in a high cost area on the west coast or the northeast the income you have good movie you up an entire income level\nJust by going to a

need to pay any money out people use the four giant monster mega banks out of convenience and the bank stick it to you on the other hand\nIf you shop around for where to put your idol cash if you have idle cash\nIn savings or CDs there's an enormous difference by going with a credit union or especially right now with an online bank\nThe online banks the CD rates on one year CDs are now topping two and a half percent\nAnd on savings accounts topping two percent so a big shift where again with the four giant monster mega banks money in savings with them is still earning basically zero point zero percent\nIf you go with an online bank you're going to earn a couple of percent not a lot of money on your money but you'll learn some in his Federal Reserve continues its process of raising rates the online banks will continue to raise the interest rates they pay you\nMoney is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how are you\nSo you don't you want to do some fun travel huh\nI did yeah we had been

how old are you what Sarah and whether it\nHad power faith are fight or anything like that\nAnd I'm like what kind of a charge volume are you looking at\nHighly about twenty five hundred a month\nOkay thirty thousand a year that's a pretty substantial amount so there's a card right now that is by far the most popular card with people who love to travel and it has a norm is an annual fee that will frightened new\nBut give us by far the greatest bang for your travel buck in terms of rewards and it is called the chase sapphire reserve have you heard of it\n[noise] I I right about that and I'm ... and the and the all\nWell but the advantage of it is the amount of ah the equivalent in value you'll get according to the calculator that credit card tune up\nFor your dollar volume in charging a twenty five hundred a month you will burn right at minus the annual fee this net of the annual the yarn roughly two thousand dollars in rewards\nOkay and it's it's not for everybody to lay out that kind of money but the way it works they rebate a lot of the four fifty two you back on travel you book using the card\nOkay now I don't have the\nChase sapphire reserve but I can tell you that it's the buzz on all the travel message boards is the greatest travel reward card that's ever been offered\n... and now if that is to a that's a bridge too far to look at four fifty [laughter] yeah the card that um are you interested in international travel or domestic\nOn high for that matter of fact ... found very little international travel\nOkay so the card that is the second most often sought after is for international travel is the British Airways visa adorable skip that one\nAnd then the one that depending on how much bonus they're giving up the time is considered to be the best for domestic travel is the Barclay card Barclay Carter rival plus I don't know if you've ever heard\nOf that one now so what I Would\nLike you to do there's a list and you can see the rewards for each and you can put in your anticipated travel a charge volume\nAnd it will pop up for you in order the rewards that you're going to receive even accounting for the annual the net for caring that card and again that website is credit card tune up\nOkay Craig and the more precise you can be with the charge volume you were going to have in different categories the better more complete result it'll give you a K that's often\nNow if you just do we're interested in domestic travel one that that I Believe offers a great reward program is the Southwest Airlines visa card but the southwest visa especially if you get a nice sign up bonus\nYou'll get as many as three free round trip tickets\nWith the sign up bonus okay\nAnd then the thing that's great about them there's never a blackout and the points that you need for a trip or variable and it's just a plain and simple easy to use reward card for domestic\nTravel okay so check out the list and I bet you'll find something that works just right for you I think if I'm not\nSure the one bad part though when ... is that with all these reward cards for travel I think a hundred percent of them have an annual fee so you need to be doing a meaningful charge volume to make that annual fee worth paying\nRobert's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Robert\n[noise] hey Claudia thanks for taking my call certain much around\nRecords that I Need to

same issues that they were fighting about in the Nineteen sixties but it just keeps going on and on and on with both parties looking back instead of four and I want to give an example\nOf that that the arguments in Washington not being particularly relevant to how we live our lives around the country\nThere's a big fuss right now about fuel economy standards there was a law agreed to years ago that would lead to steadily increasing fuel economy for trucks SUVs and cars\nAnd that the standards were keep bumping up through mid next decade\nWell the Trump Administration announced proposed rules that would roll back\nThose increases in fuel economy and they're all arguing in an incremental way and what they're missing and what I'm really worried about the American auto makers who seem to always be digging when the rest of the world is lagging\nIs that this is\nA foolish fight that has no basis and what's really going on while we're not paying attention particularly the European auto makers are getting ready to launch a new generation of vehicles particularly focused on SUVs\nThat will get fuel economy in the range of eighty to a hundred and ten miles per gallon equivalent what the Europeans are spending billions on\nWell we're having our intramural squabble among the political parties is they're focusing\nOn how to use electrification in vehicles to dramatically increase the fuel economy now we've had one American Company an upstart Tesla\nThat now cells or car the model three that average isn't equivalent when you convert the energy without electric vehicle runs on versus the gasoline vehicle gets an energy equivalent of a hundred and thirty three miles per gallon\nAnd this is exactly what the Europeans are doing so you know we worry about as we drive down the road what the cost is per gallon of gasoline\nAnd the reality is that the new wave of technology\nThat in order to keep America's industrial might\nEnd to keep a strong automotive sector in the United states we're gonna have to get with it and get with the changes that are roaring towards us from the European auto makers if we don't we're gonna be also rans\nIn the automotive sector so\nSquabble all you want Democrats and Republicans you worry about what incremental number we're going to have is an average fuel economy was known as cafe corporate average fuel economy in the U.S\nWhere we should be focusing on industrial might and how we're going to compete with new technologies you know history is littered\nWith examples when people kept doing what they were doing\nAnd ignored technological waves and into nor the one that's coming\nWith the way vehicles are going to run\nWe do so at our economic peril\nJust wanted you imagine if you're driving an SUV or a pickup truck where you're hoping to get somewhere close to twenty miles per gallon just remember\nThe Europeans are getting ready to deliver SUVs into our market that will average better than the equivalent of a hundred miles per gallon\nKelvin is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi\nCalvin Hi how are you great thank you you have one of those questions that makes me do nothing but smile", "year": "2018",
