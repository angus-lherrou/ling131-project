ago late twenties Fifteen looking to move in about two years from this coming January she went to my best options might be ... selling or renting out or what I can do\nWhat you are as serious advance planner here asking me about and about likely to happen in your life two years from now how do you know that that's the window when you're going to move for you in the military or something\nI was in the military and I'm currently a police officer so telling are looking to move to Texas up the Tennessee\nOkay so that you say you have a clear path and and I want to tell you I appreciate your double service\nTo our country I mean your a picture of life in danger for us as a soldier now you're putting your life in danger as a police officer and I'm grateful to you for that thank you um so\nYou bought a house at a time you got a exceptionally low interest rate on the house I'm assuming\nCorrect there was about ... percent\nAlright and rates have moved up roughly two point since then\n... and so are you planning to move in two years I don't have a specific a strategy for you that you should sell now rent a home for a while then look for a home when you get to Tennessee because who knows what's going to happen with economic conditions\nAnd prices a couple of years from now the house market has slowed down\nAnd people are not able to sell houses in most markets with the ease they were before so what would you do today different than just no you're planning to move in a couple of years and you're going to have the benefit of that low\nInterest rate for at least the next couple of years\nBut you know pretty much I'm looking to utilize the VA building low and when we get up the policy and similar there after\nSome of the biggest issue with three ten in the house and renting it out the most companies are quite two years of rental income or else it counts against me as far as that ... she'll right um so that's kind of where I Am is I Want to just take some laws if it might be worth it initially\nJust to get that mortgage ditty I out of there\nWell again that is a fascinating scenario you're painting to me and one that that no one has ever opposed to me like you did because you're talking about um your family having to uproot twice\nAnd a couple of years but if you wanted more certainty that is what you can do you could keep this property\nYou move somewhere else as a renter you lock in that ultra low interest rate you have at three in a corner my only real concern with that scenario\nIs that you then are in a position where you're going to be living in Tennessee with a rental property in Texas and that is very difficult to manage from so many miles away\nI really do you have any experience with the only ones that are the rental property agencies or whatever they might be called off of it easily put it in\nWith what was that expression use I'm Sorry\nA busy property management\nOh yeah property man I use a property manager to manage a rental property for me that I have that's three hundred miles away that I just could not adequately properly manage it and so it depends on local conditions but in my case I pay half\nOf the first month's rent is commission and then after that I pay a much lower commission re moving forward so I tend to attract long term tenants\nAnd so I've got a big hit up front and then small were after that the disadvantage to me is that anytime something breaks when I'm build for it for repair maintenance something like that seems like it's not the most generous bill ever\nBefore I tend to be fairly high because I mean they are providing a service to me overseeing the property and managing it so you have a significant rake off in your net revenue for\nCause of the commission's you're having to pay and the ongoing expenses you pay\nSo I I don't know even with that very attractive mortgage rate\nI don't know that you fit the scenario somebody who would keep that\nProperty as a rental going forward and so in that case I Would say why don't you keep it simple for you and your family lived there until a it looks like you're ready to move to Tennessee\nAnd then put it on the market at that time you don't have the benefit of maybe a couple more years of your mortgage based on that three in a corner\nAnd then at that time you sell it and you move on there are no perfect crystal ball but that's what I Would do\nJudy joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Judy\nClarke how you doing I'm good I've\nBeen a big fan of your show for so many years and now we're retired in Daytona Beach\nWell how do you like living at the beach\nOh love it love it I live in paradise oh that's great\n[laughter] and Clark my questions about auto insurance [noise] ah we have a what a major company is calling in non castle policy I learned exactly what does that mean a no matter how many\nUh wrecks or accidents I have that are my fall\nWell I still the towers but at what a at what cost\nYou you just laid out better than I ever could [laughter] you know this is a gimmick with the non ... auto insurance policies because unless it also includes a cap on how much your premiums can rise overtime\nUh-huh then I don't see any great virtue and somebody saying\nNo matter what you can be the wars driver and the world\nWe're still going to insure you but if it doesn't say at what cost that promise means nothing\nOkay at you know I've been talking to some other companies and I'm thinking gosh do I want to lose that and that's it but um you just to sell my problem\nHow long have you been with this ensure\nOh gosh forty years\nAll right so let me tell you something about your insurer they are one of the ones that uses what's known as loyalty index scoring\nIs and you would definitely be high on the loyalty index score having been with them more than forty years\nPaid a charge you higher rates because you've shown yourself to be so extremely loyal and they know that a certain percent of their customers tend not to comparison shop tend to just remain intensely oil and so your reward for that is higher rates\nUh-huh\nSo you're finding a significant difference and what they quote you and what others are quoting you that's why they're charging you above general market rates what kind of difference have you found so far\nOh not a not a huge amount a a like an old are and not so I'm not carrying a lot of the coverage on it um you know like God is for every six months probably a couple of hundred dollars\nWell you know a couple of hundred is less than I Would expect you to tell me is the difference\nI and uh make sure the coverage is you're getting quoted are the same and they and you can make a call whether in your life for five hundred dollars a year\nIs money really a better in your pocket or if you prefer since you've shown yourself to be such a royal kind of person if you'd rather pay them more money and stay with who you're with\nBut as far as that guarantee from them

of what you may [noise]\nThere is a shift going on in the vehicle market that I Want to make sure you're attuned to several factors coming together all at once\nIt mean that if you were interested in a vehicle [noise] your timing right now is very favorable [noise] so let me hit you with the factors affecting the\nMarketplace number one\nWe've got a situation where we've had record or near record vehicle sales for the last half dozen years\nWe've reached a point where we're way past people who needed new wheels and we've covered a lot of people who wanted new wheels and so now the dealers the manufacturers are running out of the people need and want\nSo we're playing much harder to get\nBecause their replacement market for old worn out vehicles is not that large right now and the number of people who have vehicles that are older not as many because so many people have gotten newer vehicles of light\nAnd then you add in higher interest rates interest rates on car loans have gone up quite a bit as interest rates and the general economy of risen car loans reflect the increases immediately\nSo now people are looking at higher monthly payments\nThe third factor is something I shared with you about six weeks ago and that is that after years of an under supply of SUVs and crossover utility vehicles why things we call SUVs are actually see these just seeing what the difference is\nA true SUV is built on a truck platform very few in the United states are built on a truck platform almost all of them\nAre built on a car platform just with the body put on top of them that looks like an ... it's a little higher like you think of as an SUV\nSo manufacturers were caught flat footed\nSeveral years ago when people shifted from wanting passenger cars to warning these crossovers so there was a continual shortage\nBelow what demand was now the vehicle makers of caught up the auto makers are making plenty of those SUVs and crossovers so now we've got supply and demand imbalance at a time that the markets soften dealers all over the country reporting\nA more or fewer and fewer people coming into showrooms fewer and fewer deals closing and depending on where you are in the country a lot are noticing a double digit declines in sales so this is a\nGreat opportunity for you\nIf you were actually someone who's in the market for a vehicle it means that you're in a position to have far more negotiating power especially if you're interested in their crossover or an SUV you're much more negotiating power then you've had in recent years\nSo yeah you will face potentially higher interest rates but you can dial back the clock if you historically have gotten your vehicle alone at the car dealer\nAnd instead this time you get it at a credit union you will likely drive the interest rate back to below\nWhat it would have been at a car dealer before interest rates rose cause the interest rate differences so gigantic between a credit union and a car dealer and significant between a credit union and the bank\nThe other thing is as you are\nShopping around for a vehicle I Want you to use the on line methods to shop for a vehicle if you're a member of one of the big

[noise] yeah\nYeah I got married recently uh before that though I Do have to embarrass you a little bit I I only found your broadcast the last few months but the reason that the\nUs all around and I noticed your name I recognize that goes I'm living in a New Orleans right now grew up watching the TV on the news all the time I got on a Christmas recommendations for us for a while you're getting ... recommendations for much stuff on the news so that was a relief on that I got an idea yet\nWell that's great to have you I Hope you enjoy our podcast\nAnd yeah it's been great so far you up and learn a lot for sure\nThank you so just got married\nYes yes so we got married um and we're the processes to learning all of our finances all that kinda stuff and so I was just got to wonder and\nUm we're both on the same financial standing uh she's got a little bit of a school that I've got a little bit of credit card that we both like salmon a lot of money I'm so as far as combining finances go as water or you know there's a lot of best practices stuff like that because I was trying to read on the line and there's all sorts of information all over the place\nWhere one of the factors I look at is how well both of you are\nOkay uh we're both in our mid thirties\nSo at that point when you get married after you've lived independently for a long time don't rush combining everything\nIs okay because you each develop your own habits no matter how much it feels like you're on the same way when you're not going to be exactly on the same wavelength having been in a position where each have you had made all the decisions with everything involved with money\nAnd it can cause tension specially I'm In the first couple of years of a marriage if you just all of a sudden combine everything\nSo a joke or it's different for people who get married in their early twenties which not as many people do any more but getting married in your mid thirties which is more common now I like for you to have his money her money their money\nAnd by that I mean having a joint household account that both of you share and you have money that you eat to contribute to that\nEach month for rent slash mortgage other household expenses that you figure out and then you still have some money that's years in an account and she has money that's hers and account ... and then we have credit cards\nI don't want you to combine those for a a few years\nAll right so credit cards for a few years yeah that was actually going to be my next question because as far as you know combining it to a joint account that's a checking account I Know you don't like debit cards\nUh so I was reading you know there's a thing like with credit cards especially for a joint groceries things like that I can make her like a cup holder a under my credit card or I'm a joint credit card something like that is there anything as far as that goes with the credit cards\nSo for spending that you're going to do that fits under the house account category like groceries you're going to both eat 'em your cell phone bills have you combine a cell phone plan any of the stuff you're doing is a combined activity\nIt's great for you to have like a house account credit card that you pay in full each month that has some kind of rewards attached to it\nThat is your first joint credit account but for things like when she's going to buy clothes or you are she's going to get her hair done or whatever\nBecause you're each approaching it from years of making individual decisions those things are best at least for now left as individual charges on eat on individual cards rather than on one that's joy\nOkay and so we can do like a joint credit card to realize that was the thing\nYeah you can be co owners of a cart\nOr she can add you for a house account she can add you as an authorized user you can add her isn't authorize user to wonder if yours for the things that fit under house expenditures the concept is that you know over time you'll find how best you're spending merges as your life\nOr goes on together\nBy doing it all at once can cause tension that you didn't even know could be there and that's why\nThe

money withdraw from the four oh one K. to pay off the credit card debt and you know the most important reason not to do that if you use\nMoney from a four one K. to pay off credit card debt in most situations people will end up having the credit cards charge backup within a year and a half of when that withdrawal is taking place so\nPlease I Know it's easy to do the ... four one K. borrowing but don't do it unless the situation is dire\nAmy is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Amy\nHi how are you\nGreat thank you you want to talk about hitting the bulls eye on the retirement target\nHigh looking at the proper used or misused retirement and by and I'm being how strong the forces that have ... percent here it ethnic and retirement fund target retire at night or [laughter] yeah\n[laughter] well I wouldn't say a hundred percent or not and but the idea is that if let's say you're building a portfolio and a four one K. or you're building one and a Roth IRA or traditional i._r._a.\nThe idea is that if you're if people aren't aware of what we're talking about a target retirement fund is where you pick a year\nKind of in the ballpark of when you expect to retire and they tend to be and five year increments like year twenty thirty twenty forty five whatever every five years\nThat you're messing up the whole purpose of the target retirement fund if you put money into it and then still put money into other things in your retirement plan a retirement account\nYeah ...\nIt's not like it's something you shouldn't do it's just suggested that if the whole idea is to try to get the right mix of stuff that you're invested in\nThat it really is only effective if you go all in on the target retirement fund where are you and your head with this and how does it affect you\nWell I had that and they actually I'm In my legs\nI have also kicked in and they will play ... and um I just had this as part of it ... and I'm hearing that ... or a every turn that I Would expect they are they\nOn average about ... percent will last cat if I work at all and that target retirement side\nYou know I I Can't speak to whether you would have an overall lower return over the years by diversifying out from it the idea that target retirement fund is really for a different purpose it's to put you in a position where you have the proper level of risk\nAt different stages of your work life and then as you get closer to retirement\nSo there's nothing that says the you taking some of your money in your four one K. and putting another choices is going to get you a lower return it's even possible that could get you a higher returns but it also might involve over the years potentially more risk to you\nIn law says you could suffer at various points of your work life sure okay if anybody says oh putting forty percent and the target retirement fund and putting the other sixty percent and other things is going to get you a lower return that's not an accurate statement\nOkay I Am from I think I have a great day and can't entail\nWhat's amazing with the target retirement funds is that any of a number of providers of those in a IRA Ross IRA or four one K. are offering extremely low costs on them and others offering very high costs\nOn the target retirement fund portfolio vanguard which is generally considered to be the gold standard\nCharges typically like point one five of one percent\nTo point to oh of one percent where other providers may charges much is more than one percent\nFor having money in a target retirement fund that difference decimate eventually how much money you'll have to live on in retirement those expenses really mad or overtime\nFred is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Fred\n... thanks for you do for us we get a lot of information from you they're sure do ... ah I've been contacted by Fran regarding a multi level marketing company that are promoting a digital coin and I'm not really familiar with what digital coins are\nAnd they're talking about going public and they're not register with their safety and it looks like a Ponzi scheme to me but I was wondering if you had any information regarding digital coin\nAll right so when people refer to digital coin that's generally a generic term for that one brand name that did establish itself in the marketplace called bitcoin\nAnd bitcoin is an alternative way for people to pay for things around the world\nAnd it is what's generally referred to as a crypto currency is not a government back money it is one is that is accepted based on a daily value\nThe people who are willing to buy and sell bitcoins are willing to take that value what you're calling about is not bitcoin somebody who's trying to trade on that basically what is it that you would do\nIf you were to get involved in this coin business\nAre supposedly don't have to do anything it just your diet investor a certain amount of money anywhere from a hundred and fifty to I don't know\nFour five thousand dollars and then the coin is like is worth like two or three cents now and it keeps the opposing to rise supposedly gonna rise and they're going to start a company where you can use your calling\nOkay so I Would not go anywhere close to that because first of all when somebody any of us could say today we're going to have Fred money are we going to have Clark money\nIf your car many of

show Hi how are you today [noise] that I don't I'm great thank you you want to talk about\nHow good or bad an idea that has to pay all your bills by credit card is that right\nYeah I Believe it's ... and I'm thinking maybe I could pay all my bills off and then every week you know pay a large amount on credit card when I get paid\nSo this is if you pay credit card balances and fall is a great idea\nBecause with the fights going on among the banks for market share with credit cards there are so many reward cars out there every single bill that I can pay by credit card I pay by credit card and then get the rewards for having done so\nSo I think it's a great idea as long as you'd never run a balance on the cards\nAnd what do you mean I'm like hey it off before the end of the month\nWe'll just when the outcome so that you're never paying interest\n'cause you know credit cards all operate based on people who pay balances for called behind our backs by the banks deadbeats\nBecause we're getting free ride on the credit cards money\nAnd right now not only are they giving us the grace period where we can pay our bills\nIn full you know they give us the typically three weeks to pay our bills and fall but then they're rewarding us with cash back or free gasoline or free hotel stays or free travel or whatever it is\nAnd it's a deal for people who pay in full\nOh I guess listening to you was\nUh it it works you know but the thing is we get the deal McGill because of the people who don't pay in full\nGetting clobbered you know for the banks they lend money at an average rate of Seventeen percent on credit cards and the cost of the money to the bank tends to be about one half a percent to one and a half percent so that's quite a spread they're making\nAnd so it's a great deal\nFor us if we pay balance system full but it's a horrible deal for anybody who's running a balance who is making\nA massive profit for the bank\nAnd they're also subsidizing all the deals and

I Am come with that and I'm with this new career came four one K. and other other a retirement or investment options are to generate some income\nWell I Am so glad that things are turning up for you and now you're ready to save how many employees do you have\nI don't have any employees now the business that I have that was once employed several people now is just a small consulting business but I just run and work by myself\nWhile I got ya ya that gives you such flexible low cost options for you to do exactly what you said and save for retirement right and I'm going to give you two options to look at one of them as something known as the self employed or solo four one K.\nAnd you can put a huge amount of money into one\nAnd the administrative costs to have one there is zero\nYou can go to any of the low cost companies I have on my investment guide and openness so low or self employed four one K.\nAnd go into the really really low cost choices to invest in in it and you can do either\nA solo Ross four O. one K. is so low traditional four one K. so either pre tax where you get a tax deduction up front with taxes to\nWhen you ... do retire down the road or you can pay the tax headed up front and have the money flow to you and all its earnings tax free and retirement that's option one\nLet me interject okay I I actually have a ... another full time job that I own company yeah All right I\nThe the consulting businesses is simply on the side as as I Need to or whatnot\nSo then I got the answer for that okay I've got one K. at the other company\nRight handed to keep slapping money as much as you can into that four one K. would that employer and if you have auction of a raw four one K. do that because the second thing you can do with your self employed income is you can do is set up a simple find employee pension\nRight that allows you to put roughly one fourth of your earnings from your self employed work\nInto a pre tax basically regular IRA but it's called is set up again they're free to set up the paperwork to open one takes about a minute and a half\nAnd the same low cost companies on my investment guide you can use to open the south\nAnd between the four oh one K. at the employer and the sap you do with your self employed income you will be able to roll huge amounts of money in to catch up\nFor retirement and I'm so glad you're back on your feet for zeal

don't let anyone ever were the well off and you can follow me Facebook dot com slash Clark Howard [noise]\nThere is so simple opportunity to save money [noise]\nThat most people don't know about and don't take advantage of [noise]\nIs explained in the past almost everybody buying a newer used car finances it if they're taking out alone at the car dealer\n... percent that are financing at the dealer is north of eighty percent and car dealers are offering a service they should get paid for like Mark up the loan depending on who the lender is from a couple of extra points to his highest the sky\nA lot of people whose credit is kind of in the fuzzy middle\nLet's say in the six hundred ... end up paying very high interest rates for their vehicle loans\nIn fact it's a huge source of profit for the car dealers because they may be able to wholesale the money that are very most single digit interest rate but retail the loan to you in double digits\nAnd so it creates an enormous opportunity for you even after the fact to save money\nThinking about if you're a member of a credit union\nAnd you don't really think about all the things that credit union can do for you one of the things that credit union can do that's fantastic as ... your car loan and credit unions do a big ... business and it's all sliding scale interest rates based on your credit score\nBut it's not at all unusual for you to be able to save a lot of money here's an example from the Detroit Free press\nAbout a credit union\nVivid does a big refinance thing for its members ... members come in with an average loan interest rate of fourteen and a half percent\nWho's a credit union serving people who have that fuzzy middle kind of credit scores they refinanced them at an average interest rate of six point seven five percent\nSo think about that they come in the door paying fourteen and a half percent they walk out the door paying six point seven five percent\nNow that is a huge difference in what happens with your monthly bills each and every month going forward for people who have talked to your credit scores\nYou would be shocked at how low the interest rates can go even with the increases in interest rates we've seen from the Federal Reserve it may even be possible for you to re fi into an interest rate and the two or three ...\nSo what does it cost ... by a car loan knocked unusually\nAnd so if you are a member of a credit union and you never really thought about the whole car loan thing and you're carrying alone go check and see if there is a deal they can make for you it'll just save your money the worst that happens is they say no it's not going to be a deal for you the best\nAnd it happens as you're saving money each and every month Jeremy is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Jeremy\nHi Clark thanks for taking my question\nWell I'm Glad to do so you want to talk credit cards\nI knew so my question actually ah pertains to uh we use credit cards is a a payment system especially ones that give us good cash back towards that are on rotating categories and a\nWhile you have more ... than I Do I gotta tell ya Jeremy I can't my brain cannot process rotating categories of rewards\n[laughter] it's getting used to and I will say that I think you refer to them as back in the wallet cards I call it a couch cards because we use this one card a long time ago to
