I ... I went off and we're not supposed to find out or not for a financial advisor she had an incident I eat loudly are talking about stuff like that and it's a little Kearns that I've never heard of that fact was that was worth getting\nNicer we're talking about an index universal life policy is that what you mean I ... yes\nOkay so I Am not an unbiased person to ask okay I Need to lay that out for you I hate universal life policies of all flavors\nI hate that so it's going to be hard for me to give you a balanced answer here so why did I tell you why I hate them and wild love Ross and just take it as one piece of information that you can use to make a decision okay\nOkay so we're the Roth IRA let me first say why I Love it and we'll compare back and forth so with a Roth\nWith money that it earns is tax free\nIt's not some kind of odd ball way to maybe get a tax advantages tax free Ross IRAs if you go with a low cost company will have an all an expense often about or less than one tenth of one percent per year for the money you have in a raw\nOkay the universal life products will tend to have an annual expense of one and a half to two and a half percent so\nThey will be many many times more expensive and over the years the difference between\nThose expense ratios is a difference between you going to work for years more or being retired because you end up with a incredibly larger amount of money\nIn a low cost investment versus a moderate or in the case of a universal life policies are considered to be a a high to ultra high cost investment\nNow as far as the universe ally products like an index wins or they're promising is that you earn a percent of the gain of the stock market and years of gains but that you don't suffer a loss in the years that it has losses\nRight so do you know that's a complete and total why\nNow are\nTotally it's it is\nI mean it's like if I were to tell you the moon is made a Swiss cheese I mean it it really is and it's really yummy and nutritious as better tasting than the Swiss cheese on earth I mean that's about as equally true is somebody telling you that that's what an index universal\nThe policy does that you get the upside no downside right okay\nLet me tell you why that's a big fat lie\nRight first you're only given a tiny portion of the actual gained the stock market has a year and you don't get what in most years is the most important part of gains in stocks which is the evidence the insurance company doesn't give you any of those\nAnd then the downside protection so remember you only get a little portion of the up the downside protection requires that you meet dozens of pages of conditions in the index universal like policy before you\nAre able to have what what would be referred to as the safe harbor of no loss on your money\nBut it gets worse than that with the universal like policy if they failed or perform as the illustration you're given says\nYou can get hit with what's known as the capital call where in order to keep the policy from exploding and being hit with a massive tax bill you have to put more money at a time in your life you may not be able to\nOK okay the only\nPeople who ever make out from any universal life policy is the agent who sells it and the company that agent works for\nOkay I I mean I mean I get upset when I talk about universal life insurance because I Need to tell you Katie I've had so many people call me over the years who bought one and they get one of those capital call noticed is there like what do I do\nWant another like fourteen thousand dollars I mean I have to pay it wow within thirty days or else I mean it's just writing\nNarrow oh gosh\nBy so then I'll tell you the last worst part of it ... the illustration that the insurance agent shows you telling me showing you how the money is going to grow and not just this guy is going to grow through the galaxy and you're gonna have wealth beyond your wildest dreams\nThey're allowed to make up the numbers on there in both states so they can sit down at the computer and put in what ever rosy scenario they want and then it'll say at the bottom in mice type for illustration purposes only\nOther than that you can tell I Love them right [laughter]\nRoth I always on the other hand are very simple product you can buy them commission free\nAnd I've got a list of companies that sell commission free Ross but money grows tax free spent tax free they're ultra simple to set up ultra simple to have an ultra simple to spend the money from\nOkay\nAnd I think that I explained to me as a long term insurance that\nYeah the insurance and them as a joke okay because when the capital calls come if you can't pay them you not only lose the policy have a big tax bill but there is no insurance either\nDidn't Arabs to protect your loved ones will buy something that agents not going to tell you about and its level term insurance we're all it does is pay to your survivors than the event you die it costs like nothing\nAt age ... can't pay the gasoline to come to see you to sell you one of those for the commission they returned from it so they're never going to talk about it\nAnd know that whoever you decide to do it too if they let you down\nYou're the one who stuck with the bill you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\n\n\nThe national debt is

learn ideas to me so you can keep more of what you make there was a study done by professor at the University of Texas Arlington\nAnd was reported on and one of those ... had a journals about public health ... found that when you live in a suburban sprawl county that you are going to ...\nJust under three years less than somebody who lives in a crowded urban core\nI this is something doesn't surprise me at all I always thought it was\nBecause of the time people spend commuting at that time when you're sitting on your rear end in a car going back and forth being sedentary is what leads to the shorter lifespan that turned out to be only one\nOf the three factors that lead to a shorter life\nAnd that is a significant thing though is that is your commute is a time suck\nYou have cut out of your life for each time that you might have used to walk or bike or go to the gym or whatever and so again that's one factor another\nIs that if you're doing a lot of suburban driving\nAnd you're more likely to be in an accident 'cause you're driving more miles but your accent is likely to be at higher speed than someone who's in an accident and of course urban area and vest the chance of injury or fatality is significantly higher\nAnd then the third factor blows my mind I remember this one research study\nSo there'll probably be another one later the disagrees with some of the conclusions of the author of this but the third factor is that because of all the driving in a sprawling suburban area\nThere's higher pollution than there isn't a core of a metro area\nI always thought that the corps was where the air was really dirty but it turns out that that's not the case and the dirty air is what can lead to shorter life spans as well so\nThat long commute can be costing your health and costing you three years of your life Larry's with\nUs on the Clark Howard show hello Larry how are you doing\nHi Clark thanks for taking my call\nSure you got a credit freeze question for me\nI Do I took care of five to help protect from identity theft and froze my credit and I'm In the process of thinking about applying for another credit card and before I started off all my credit I wondered if if I just need to fall\nUm just for one credit angels faded or do I need to solve all three\nThis is a frustration of mind because you should only have to thaw one\nAnd generally when a financial institution is pulling a ... a credit report to decide whether to grant your credit card or not they are pulling from a single bureau because they have to pay for every time they tap into one\nAnd I have repeatedly when I've had to sell on my credit for an application for a new credit card or because I'm getting a new cell phone service or whatever\nI have never\nEver been able to get someone at customer service to tell me what bureau they draw from and which one that I Need to thaw\nAnd so I've had to thaw all three when I open an account for somewhere where they want to pull your credit or done an application for credit and that's that's silly\nYeah 'cause what the credit freeze does is even if these crooks have all kinds of personal information from your tax return they aren't going to be able to apply for credited as if they're you because your credit's frozen\nRight what about the anti theft aspect of it I mean is there something else that because\nWell I mean that's the principal reason people do a density theft is to apply for credit but with taxes you know there's the potential that someone will file a return is if they're you with the information\nThey garnered and get a false refund they would hold up your refund if you are expecting one and do you usually get a tax refund each year from the feds or your state\nWe do uh my my life as long as it is sort of home and she follows you know so you have to check that if this from the moaning all so usually do that will be fun\nSo what will happen is if that is what the crux after is filing false tax returns then and they successfully do so then what that does that slows down your refund\nAnd the IRS does so used to this and the state taxing authority so used to it they they all have procedures where if somebody does file a return is if they're you and gets a fake refund there ... there are things you do in order to process your return later manually\nBut your refund is months delayed by the fact that somebody filed a return is if they are you\nOkay so you've prevented the first the most common problem simply by having credit freeze and that's what I Would strongly advise you to recommend your neighbor to your neighbors and they do freeze their credit for it but the second part the tax thing you just gotta wait and see and what I Would do is\nDo you work at a traditional job even though your wife is self employed I Would reduce your withholding at work so that you're more likely not to get a refund next year\nOkay that's the most important thing to do because then if somebody does file a return as if they're you and it slows down your paperwork process like if you're not waiting for any meaningful refund who cares if it takes months and months and months to generate it you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise] and on the air and heavy Utah this is a beat you am Thirteen messaging ...\nBurning your degree from one of the top business

close a month from today\nIn where in the country you're buying a home in Denver, Colorado\nOh could you find it more difficult market to find a deal on a home in the United states right now in Denver\nYeah it has been very tough and I think we finally found the right place\nWhile I Am so glad because people complain constantly in Denver about the difficulty of finding affordable homes\nYeah that's right prices have been skyrocketing [laughter]\nHow can I be of help to you in this quest for this home you love\nSo part of this process um our builder has given us a five thousand dollar incentive if we use their preferred lender to get our national mortgage with them\nAnd the court they gave us a little bit higher it's not outrageously high so I'm just doing some quick math kinda guessing on what closing costs would be I figured that at our break even point\nFor the five thousand dollars would be about four years now which quiet might make sense to have taken a deal\nAnd over the life it alone if we go it's a lower age I think in the end it would save us around forty thousand dollars which sounds great to me so\nI hung out or they want half a point more than market potentially so the only way you really know though is that half a point would really come your way is to go to a mortgage broker and you have the mortgage broker shop you\nAnd who knows then you may be able to go back to the builders preferred lender and say hey I got this offer here\nAnd what can you do for me\nLike I Know we've already spoken with him and it doesn't sound like has rate as a negotiable at all [noise]\nSo my question becomes well the plan I mean when I'm planning on doing is taking out the loans through him to get a deal closed because I don't think I'll ever\nSay five thousand dollars and certainly like this again sure and then at some point in the near future shop around to refinance because I imagine closing costs are going to be about two thousand twenty five hundred to refinance\nDownloading costs all depend on it varies so much from lender to lend or you can even set a target of doing a was I was a no closing costs ... where you then in turn to take a

the danger\nFrom the weight and size of trucks on the road and the speed involved is why I Believe in adopting the system used in so many other places in the world of highly restricted speeds on trucks and drivers being paid per hour they work\nRather than being paid for quick delivery that we've created unsafe conditions were drivers are pushed\nTo go too fast and create dangerous situations and I know most of the problems on the road are caused by people in passenger cars not truckers I accept that automation I Believe though we'll save a lot of lives\nClarke you don't think that you missed giving a caller who was unhappy with the Amazon a possible shipping option each of the three big shippers UPS us PS instead acts have options to hold items at the local delivery point\nAmazon always gets tracking numbers with that in hand you can go on line and he's a delayed divert or hold if you have your address registered with UPS for example you can even does do so through their app\nJust something to think about love your show David and union Kentucky\nDavid thank you and this is the service we avail ourselves of\nConstantly with all packaged deliveries is where we divert them to either a FedEx where they calling FedEx Office locations or a UPS Store and there are certain circumstances with the UPS where they will charge you five dollars for a diversion\nBut if you do it right it'll cost you nothing and they don't have to worry about being there to sign for anything don't have to worry about somebody being stolen and you just go pick it up at a staff location and most of them are pretty convenient to us\nIn response to ask Clark you said that cell phone monitoring apps were pretty involved and didn't come cheap\nWell Clark I've got some for briefs for you

hotels in hotel rooms were originally referred to by some as cookie cutter and by others as something they really love no surprises\nEntire hotel chains were born more than a generation ago all about sameness\nAnd\nCourtyard by Mary I was the one that really kick this off in the Nineteen eighties I think it was\nIn a courtyard room the design of a courtyard by Mary ... was a den a cool place to place there actually was a central courtyard\nEvery ... room you stayed and had the same ... no matter where in the United states you were saying that courtyard there was the same\nAnd that's what people wanted they wanted to know that things were going to be routine in uniform and at the hotel would be justice comfortable\nAnd just as clean and one city as it would be any other and you would be comfortable knowing the experience he would have before you ever walked in the door\nThat was and this is now and there's a big revolt against the uniformity of hotel chains and now people are looking for experiences\nAnd\nWith the reality is this has really been popularized because of a or B and B that air being be\nTaught people there could be a different way and I have traveled in so many different era being bees around the world the R B Yo's or you know and I've stayed in all these and there are certain circumstances where it's been great\nHaving that versus a traditional hotel so now the hotel industry is like wait wait wait what about us and one of the things that's happening now\nIs hotels are responding to the fact there are people who want a more affordable 'cause there are people going in there being be because they wanted to be cute or different or whatever and not cookie cutter but a lot of people go there being because they wanted to be cheaper so the hotel business\nIs putting up more and more properties that have smaller rooms\nBit they're able to sell at a cheaper price\nAnd I mentioned a couple of the chains in the past\nThat are coming into the marketplace but first one but I think came in the U.S was moxie which was a brand from Europe\nI think is owned by Mary ... and now I saw an item in the New York times about how many hotels are popping up around the United states with an emphasis on more affordable rooms and hotel rooms used to be\nAt one time of standard three hundred and twenty square feet\nWas hotel room now a lot of these rooms\nFrom the new cheaper hotels or as little as a hundred and twenty square feet\nThinking about that that's a ten by twelve which is a relatively small\nBedroom and then there you got to get

be on your show were great to have you here [laughter] I had a question\nToday about 'em long term care insurance um I guess my wife and I took your advice over the years and it's done well with savings and investing and now we're looking a little bit older and how to protect that than\nJust getting into looking into a long term care insurance and see what advice you might have\nI'll tell you it's changed so much that was for many years I had a long term care insurance buying guy and I had six steps that you would follow to compare companies and get the best quote and all that but the market for a long term care insurance has a mostly disintegrated\nAnd we've gone from where there were perhaps a over a thousand companies selling long term care so almost all of it being sold is now being sold by less than ten\nWell and so it's much less competitive market than it was before and also one that people have found out through a experience moaning policies the premiums are not guaranteed\nSo you could start off at a premium level David and then a five years down the road ten years down the road could even be as I had a caller recently Twenty years down the road your premiums go up\nSo it is kind of a messy purchase okay um tell me some about your age and your health\nOkay I'm I'm forty eight and my wife is that the so\nDon't buy it now now now because in the in the best of times I used to recommend buying it from your late fifties early sixties and the market because the market is not truly a functioning market right now\nI Would recommend that you hold off for another decade\nOkay and since there is a potential for insurers to make money\nIn a market places just after price it right I think given enough years between now and when it becomes more critical time for you and your wife to buy it that there will be a products that would make sense to purchase today\nNot so much if you were told me you were um let's say sixty years old\nAnd we were talking about the alternatives to what you should buy there's there's a limited number of options I might recommend but because you have the advantage of time on your side I Would give it a decade\nOK okay we we did we were introduced to a product that has both a long term care insurance in a life insurance combined is is that a smart move I mean once we\nGo I Would say that today that may be the least bad option but I Would definitely not put it in the smart move category\nOkay so and especially because you're so yeah I Know you may not feel young but in the world um insurance and the type of insurance we're talking about you were very young\nWhen when one last question what would be the latest you wouldn't want to hurt just this kind of insurance\nI Would say somewhere around sixty three sixty four years old\nVery good\nSo you've got a I think how much time you got that's great [laughter] you got\nTo have to worry about a lot of other things in that in fact the top priority I Would say you said you're forty eight and fifty right correct the top priority I Would say today is for you to be stashing as much cash as you can and Ross IRAs\nAnd you're allowed the fifty year olds allowed to put sixty five hundred and forty eight you're allowed to put fifty five hundred in that that's where the priority should be is\nPutting that twelve grand aside each year will come way before worrying about the life insurance\nOkay we've taken your eyes and or or doing that from thankful for that\nThat's great and do you have term life insurance in case one of you were to die prematurely\nYes for dinner yes\nThen you're doing everything you should be doing Tim is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Tim Hi how are you great thank you tell them you are using Wells Fargo for investing that right that is correct and you're a little nervous right now aren't you\nWell I had a four one K. with the previous company and when I left they you know they actually tested every move it and put in my own private investment firm and I had some ... at a large bank and I then moved over to there\nAnd it's about it when I first opened up the ... the company original company put money in and it was about eighty six thousand that was in there\nAnd then when I moved to the the economy style and then when I moved to ... it was somewhere in the range around sixty eight thousand [noise] and then\nIn the eight backwards then\nYeah kind of went backwards pretty fast is a [laughter] and then when what ended up happening was in the last probably seven years the company that I have it when they charged twelve hundred dollars a year in fees\nWell I already said is Wells Fargo so you don't have to say the company\nOkay okay um I I ... what it is a high paying twelve hundred dollars a fees ... a year and I make about eight hundred dollars by the time I'm done but it's supposed to be managed to count but I haven't heard from anybody in six years\nYeah I I guess we're getting forgetting the scandals that Wells Fargo and it's like how much ride cultural rot and ethical and moral and legal issues are their Wells Fargo and all those elements but you are with an ultra high cost provider\nFor that money for that IRA and I would ditch them and go to a low cost provider\nWell and that's why I'm calling is what would you recommend that you ... it's in retirement brokerage account statement and like I said you make up about two thousand a year they take\nTwice yeah so that's not working for you at all no snow from do you do you want to make your own investment decisions or you want somebody to do that for you\nYou know I I Would prefer that so many new new which for me um\nSo I'm getting a little tiny ... now you can give you a few options All right\nWell I've just

so let's say you're of a mind to do that [noise] and you know that part of what you should be doing\nSaving for your future investing but the industry conspire against you by making it seem that you are a hundred percent incapable\nOf getting started doing your own investing and you just hire somebody\nWho is no way you could do it yourself and they'll throw a lot of lingo at you and give you all of the reasons why they're geniuses and you need to be a little puppy dog that you do whatever you're told by them\nAnd if you do it they'll give you a ... right know investing does not have to be complicated when you're starting out\nI call it a success tax that if you accumulate a lot of money you make a lot of money over the years then you need professional help but not even necessarily with picking the investments but with your overall financial picture your goals and all that but if you're at ground zero\nAnd you're trying to figure out what to do\nYou can do it I Want to give you three scenarios one if you're a regular listener you've heard me talk about before and that is if you go in you have a four one K. where you work or are you going to open your own Roth IRA\nOdds are with the four oh one K. and absolutely you can do it with a Roth IRA you're going to have a choice of a target retirement fund you don't have to choose among the dozen or Fifteen or twenty choices the fines if all that just as high regard fix to you\nJust put your money in the target retirement fund for the year closest to when you're going to retire and you're done and all your money in that Roth IRA or in that four one K. goes in that target retirement fund and then the company that provides that target retirement fund\nGets the mix of investments hopefully right\nBased on how far are you are from that target year when you're going to use your money and the closer you get to the target year the more over all conservative the investment choices become\nSo the only thing you have to do then is you just got to live on less than what you make and put the money and the fine and the four oh one K. or the Roth IRA\nRight let's say you're doing something where you're putting money aside and its money not for retirement necessarily it's money you may need and the next let's say I'm five to ten years I'll use that as a window\nThere's something you can buy that people in the investment community are always making fun of\nBut it works it's a very simple thing called a balanced fun\nAnd most balance funds you just buy the one fund and it's really good for that period of time that's west than ultra long term investing more than ten years but longer than when your money should be in savings somewhere between five and ten years a balance fun\nAnd everybody sells them it's generally sixty percent in stock type choices forty percent in bonds bonds or where your lending money to people kind of like being a bank lending money to\nSixty percent stocks forty percent and bonds you just buy the one fund and you're set the reason that such a good choice for an investment window of five to ten years is that\nA balance fun doesn't go up as much as a pure stock fund in good years but it loses a whole lot less in bad years for the stock market and so when you move beyond a five year window\nYour odds of it performing overall well for you\nOver five six seven eight nine ten years is very good and again all you've got to know if you buy the balance fun and hopefully you buy an ultra low cost one from one of my low cost providers just like with the stuff I talked about what the target retirement fund", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "08"}
