perceptive bowl flaws to the human eye\nAnd it eliminates the health problems and there's many aspects of what we fear and that's the advancement of technology that actually creates a safer environment a better environment for us as humans and other jobs follow\nYou know the United states\nTo here three years ago hit an all time record\nFor manufacturing did it with fewer people but much safer environments you know we have a big problem in the United states or the number of people die on the job he was a dangerous and job place job sites\nAnd the about housing where there's so much danger for workers on a site and as we automate and use robotics and an industry that faces intense labor shortages\nIt will lower the cost of housing and improve the quality of that housing as well\nAnd other jobs appear\nIf you're a longtime listener you've heard me give the example from agriculture then when agriculture started what was then called mechanization recognizing when that started there was great fear across the land\nSince Ninety seven percent of people are in their livelihood on the farm that they would be massive unemployment\nDidn't happen and today a tiny fraction of people produce more food on American farms than ever before\nThe nature of jobs change\nDon't fear the technology that comes along that creates a lot of that change even though crazy mind in on my says we have to fear artificial intelligence becoming the machines like in Terminator\nI don't share those fears Kevin's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Kevin\n[noise] what's going on Kevin\nUh you know I just have a quick question for you I listen to your show off then and I hear you talk about Iraq is a way to start in investing and then um you know I Am self employed and then I hear you talk about\nSex so I guess my question is um do I start with Iraq and then moved to south or do I just I'm fully Fonda or not focused on but just start us off or off\nHow many employees do you have\nA you know I'm self employed I just work on myself that's it\nHuh how about we're going to split this baby ... there is something else you can do see Mike Solomon and the Bible here there's somebody out and do that is called a solo four O. one\nK. so far as anybody mentioned that to you\nYou know it I find that were just talk about it before but you know not not often I think a lot of times I hear more about ... or so\nSo yeah and that's true you hear both of those for me it was so are self employed four one K. is something that you're able to do with any of the low cost companies\nAnd you pay a no set up fees it's kind of like setting up a set up just a little more upfront paperwork and it gives you more flexibility because you can do the raw four one K. for the traditional four one K.\nAnd as the solar self employed and so you have access to the same low cost funds so you'd have with a Roth\nIRA with us up and with the self employed four one K. but it gives you more of the flexibility of contribution limits\nSignificantly beyond what you can do just in a raw so instead of having to open Roth IRA so instead of having to open a Roth IRA openness that say okay I'm going to put this much and the Roth IRA this much in the south instead you can have the self employed four one K.\nAnd based on how well you're doing self employed you choose than a year how much you're going to put in it\nOkay\nNow when you go if you decide to go the self employed four one K. route when you talk to any of the low cost companies you've got to make sure you talk to a retirement specialists\nBecause I mean he's not a retirement specialist they're not going to be knowledgeable on the so low or self employed four one K. is actually the same thing people just call it both of those times\nOkay and then if you have a year you make huge profits and you're facing a giant tax bill\nThat's a year you might choose to do the traditional four one K. contribution in a year where your tax brackets more reasonable\nOr maybe he didn't make a huge amount of money but you make a decent living and you have money you can put a sign that year you might want to do the Roth four one Kay\nHagan flex back and forth you're there all\nHands on the uh in ministry whichever organization go way but yes usually you could choose our this much I'm doing traditional this much I'm doing\nRoth solo four oh one K.\nAnd when you're ... if you're talking to somebody one of these are companies whether it's finality Schwab vanguard T Rowe price of the big for low cost when you're talking with somebody if it sounds like they're kind of faking it like they really don't know that product\nAsk if there is a senior specialist who could go in depth with you on how the solo are self employed four one K. works for\nSo actually we did the opposite of splitting the baby we put it back together into one choice\nYeah and I I'm so glad I called because that makes it a you know before I was looking at what I just took it out under the law and then what will to set up this kind of case they're all that and long so\nExactly if you've ever end up with employees as I got to work anymore and then do your original thing of\nThe rough IRA and doing the sap Matt's\nWith us on the Clark Howard show hello Matt hey Clark how we do\nGreat thank you met your wife's getting a free car tell me

[noise] so [noise] we're in a time that\nWe've had quite a run up and stock markets over the years at the same time a lot of people are nervous waiting for the the shoe to drop\nWaiting for the market to face turmoil and it always comes from something unexpected not something expected and markets do go through ups and downs\nA lot of people have had a nice run over the last decade who've been investing usually through a plan at work but could be a self employed individual maybe when you have an investment account\nAnd\nYou may be using one of the robo says where you something like that or men or wealth front or a may be used to Schwab intelligent portfolios and so you're on kind of automatic pilot\nAnd automatic pilot works fine for a lot of people when things are going well but on the other hand you may have questions\nWhere you're trying to go with your investments what your goals are\nAnd what to do when the hiccup comes with the marketplace and so the big thing going on now and it's ironic because half hour ago saying about robots in the workplace\nNow we're talking about robots and investing and with more and more people in Hungary for is a combo meal where you have\nMaybe robotic investing but you also have access to a human and so\nNow that seems to be an option that's morphing is available from so many people with the investments does it for point three five ... percent per year\nWhere you have access to and their case a team of humans they called the fidelity go team\nSchwab has what they call intelligent advisory where you have humans you're able to talk to and plan with\nAnd you have to have a higher minimum fidelity is no minimum ... twenty five grand to be part of it\nAnd Schwab charges point to wait for ... percent again very small percent point three five to point to wait traditionally hiring somebody for advice costs you one percent of your money\nVanguard has where they got personal advisor services point three per se but you have to have fifty thousand dollars in order to have access to the humans and those are the big three\nOf the low cost firms so fidelity if you're just starting out you still want the humans but allergies or you want to go since both Schwab and vanguard are going to require more money from you\nAnd then there are the independents\nWill provide advice six figure uses a completely different model sick big is free till you hit ten thousand dollars you have to have two thousand open but the advice for humans is free to hit ten thousand after that it's point two five\nAnd betterment\nIs point for oh for

to want to go to college you know a new order to have the opportunity to go by there\nDo you know why I asked that question\nA based on I guess that the type of a a couch or\nAre they are because our first because there's these great accounts available for kids where you can put money aside for college and it grows tax free and spent tax free but if the kid doesn't go to college you get eaten up with penalties in taxes\nSo that's why I always ask that question so if college is you know what is sometimes people say oh you bet she's going to college she never said that matter and then other people will say well you know whatever\nWorks best for her for a trade or whatever and that would mean not doing a college plan so what is the purpose of this money for a long long term\nI don't know if I Want her to be able to use it a ... or say it would just got to be more towards like\nEarly ... her out of that nature\nRight either or a right now this is in a savings account and your purpose in intentioned forward is to be for her benefit\nRight All right I'm going to tell you the craziest suggestion you've ever heard of a Roth IRA\nYes\nSo I Would put the money I Would empty the savings account put it into a rock the IRA and all the money that you ever intend to beef or benefit goes in that raw that way it grows tax free\nYou can give her the contributions of this money you put in it\nTax free penalty free when she reaches Eighteen or Twenty one but you only account you control it whatever earnings that has over the next couple of decades that stays in there for you for your retirement way down the road\nAnd the contributions can go to her but whatever earnings stay there for you the beauty of it is you keep control\nIt grows tax free you get rid of the money tax free and
