to share the story he said it was brutally tough but they chose not to file bankruptcy\nHe said he'd heard me talk about going to the national foundation for credit counseling\nAnd they contacted them and they directed him to a local accredited counselor and they went on a payment plan with all these credit card companies I'm sure none of which thought they were ever going to see all their

they're headed steadily higher towards three percent so versus one quarter of one percent what I Would do is I was a link your checking account at the credit union to a savings account at one of the

operating systems way beyond just trying to take over in individual account at the bank but in fact to disable the computer systems at the bank\nNow nobody's saying but you can just assume that it's a state actor who would try to completely disabled or computer operation at a bank even according to federal officials maybe even to wipe the data clean\nOn all account holders\nThese warnings coming from his office there isn't the federal government I saw this on Wall Street Journal dispatch about this there's an office of critical infrastructure protection and compliance policy that the treasury\nThat's a mouthful isn't it\nIt's very very freaked out about what's going on right now you know you know certainly assume it's the Russians or another foreign power trying to mess with U.S Russia is always the first suspect because\nOf the evil boot and in charge but anyway in the past things the Russians have been up to I don't understand the Americans who don't\nGet how rotten terrible the Russians are under ... anyway I digress\nSo think of two things one\nIf a bank's database gets completely wiped out it is long term no real problem short term there are potential hassles plus the long term one of the things that has been implemented I don't remember how many years ago this was\nBanks and credit unions work under a buddy system where they all have and nobody really talks about this because it's doomed to the doomsday scenario what kinds of stuff but there is a companion bank\nA competitor has a database backup it's never more than twenty four hours old from their competitor and in the event that something happens where foreign actors able to completely disable\nThe computer operations at a bank or credit union\nPeople will still be able to use their accounts with the other financial institution acting is host\nAnd for you and me after a cut over\nIt should be somewhat pretty much business as usual I guess records would be there'd be like a twenty four hour window of a missing data potentially\nSo which again is not normally the end of the world but two things come to mind with us if we were to receive a serious attack\nFrom the Russians the Chinese another foreign actor Iran look at our list of potential enemies that would do this\nIt'd be North Korea I mean we got a lot of such potential suspects\nWind a lot of people never have any

up at three times the general rate of inflation and the economy is because universities face no budget discipline\nBecause people can borrow unlimited sums for school\nIt's I think we've created the

going\n[noise] uh yeah I'm actually a kind of like a few extra contract job so uh that requires travel and I've tried looking or looking at some apps to track those kind of expenses\nBut it just seems there's on the list [noise] long as you look for in a kind of wanted to call and get your input on a really kind of suggestion\nYou're looking for any of the apps that will allow you to track your expenses\nThis is you go yeah not only that\nBut also if ah if they also allow how best to categorize rather than keeping receipts and piles and piles of her seats that there's some ... either more efficient or better way to go about that\nSure so there are any number of apps for both the iPhone and Android most of which are free they give you the ability to track your expenses and I use one called smart receipts\nNot necessarily better or worse than any other it's just the one I like to use and the way it works is when I have a receipt I take a picture of it with my phone\nAnd then it basically categorizes and if it doesn't know how to categorize it they'll ask me and I put it into the category it will do the driving reports if you're trying to track your driving and get reimbursement per mile\nAnd there are many of these okay and expensive fi is both a if I remember as a website and an app\nThat allows you to track your expenses there's not any one that is like the category killer in the ... the absolute\nBest for it but if you were to if you were to just put in as a Google or bing or whatever search\nPut an expense account apps\nAnd look through the various reviews 'cause there are a number\nOf online reviews of different ones these expense account apps and you can see which one does best what your needs are for expense account tracking it's been great for me 'cause I don't know if you notice I Am a complete flake\n[laughter]\nAnd so and believe that at all it's completely true I'll be on a trip and I'll ever see for this a receipt for that receive or the other and then I'll get back in like what did I Do with that receipt\nWere not do with that one and so now second I get the receipt I take a picture of it\nAnd then I have it and it's categorized and essentially it helps me with expense report accounting\nOn its own for each trip and it's got the date the trip started ended all that and that's why these things are so wonderful as a way to track those expenses specially when you're any kind of independent contractor a sales person where you have to keep really good expense tracking\nJim is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Jim\nHi Clark how're you doing I'm\nOut doing beyond good that we're trying to get out of some time shares my wife and I am to ... wanted which just bird to the ground and the fires you know and\nOh yeah um it's it's as bad forest fires we had that there's an advertiser on your show that promises they'd be able to sell time shares and I've tried to research them with no success\nI wouldn't have that at all at you with me I wouldn't believe that at all okay\nSo the time share resale business is one that is not something you can trust\nAnd normally what happens in that business is they'll promise you that they're going to be able to find a buyer for you and all that or that they'll get you out of your obligation on the time share but you have to pay them up front how much to these people want up front\nWe haven't gone that far yet\nDon't go any further that you've got as far as I Want you to not anywhere with them\nWell we've heard that on your show before and you're just wanted to make sure we listen to your advertisers and want to make sure that there wasn't anything special about these people\nKnow and and you may have missed a segment I did recently on the show that I don't even know who's advertising on the show\nOr the way ads are served on the show I don't even have any idea so it's news to me that somebody was advertising that they can catch at a time shares now you've heard me on the show Jim that when you have a time share your stock is stuck could be right\nI Believe that's the case\nYeah and that has not changed in my overriding advice for you is when they finally get the place rebuilt that you just you'll have a brand new place to go to you just enjoy it\nThere isn't any way that you can think of with the thing being burnt down that we

nine and the gold rush [noise]\nThat you don't know your history people disrupted\nTheir lives moved wherever there was a rumor there was gold and then there are hills is people used to say and most people ended up with broken dreams we now have a new gold rush in America and its legalize marijuana\nIn various states with various levels of legality and purposes for which marijuana is legal now and I know this is weird\nBut people that are rushing into this is a business\nOr going to find overwhelmingly that it does track like the Eighteen forty nine gold rush most people will have broken dreams those that are only passively investing\nAnd looking for the latest greatest place to put their money\nAnd believed that marijuana because all these towels on the Internet or saying how this is gonna be the greatest thing ever\nListen to this quote I saw in a market wide story from\nAn investor investment opportunities create new businesses have never been more compelling\nYeah\nSo in any new opportunity there's always a shakeout period do not believe the goal I'm Sorry marijuana\nWhat a forty and flip that has that marijuana is the new Eldorado\nThere will be people who\nAfter the shakeout will figure out sustainable profitable businesses but one of the real ironies is that as marijuana becomes more legal with less restrictions and more places\nIt actually becomes less profitable business than it was as an illegal activity\nSo the promise of great wealth\nIs not really going to be there except for a lucky few do not bet\nMoney you have to depend on on this industry if there's money that's your play money and you want to invest in marijuana business go right ahead as long as it's legal where you are\nBut if you believe that you're going to end up incredibly

collection debt off or am I better keeping that cash on hand for my down payment on my house I've read on line that even\nIf you pay off things that are already in collections it has a zero impact on your credit score\nSo if you have a collection on your report that is the main factor and what happens with your credit so if you pay off\nAn old item it will raise your score potentially some but it depends on the scoring model being used how much effect it has so the newest scoring models like the newest psycho model\nJust hates it and most people I have a great result she had a bad result and

right so you just smile through the whole thing\nAnd she wants to bring a marching band through for a final walk through just tell them what song you want him to play but what are bringing the marching band through because the goal is for you to establish as much trust\nIn her and you know it's really great about her having all that family they're slightly larger Klee it's like I'm showing you my home\nThat's what's so important because you don't want the buyer to get any cold feet and see they they brought up this little nitpicky objection that one in the other and what did you tell you you satisfy their objections right away what you meant the deal even more\nOkay now should I be there at the final walk through\nDoes it sound like it to me [laughter] are you if you have did you do if as well where did you have an agent\nI have an agent who will not be there\nOh All right you pay the agent a little ... to be there as you are representative\nNo there's no way that will happen\nAll right what can I Do to convince you that no matter what happens on that final walk through you just smile\nYou look I think you can hear me okay just show there ... all show up and just smile\nJust smiled be happy have ah one thing I like it a final walk through since you have a woman buying\nHave a little flower arrangement there for her to welcome her to her new home\nOh when I got

build up trust in each other\nPamela with us Hi Pamela how're you\nO clock I'm fine how are you today\nGreat thank you I Can't believe it I've been getting a lot of these calls lately about problems with condo association is homeowners' associations what's going on in your circumstance\nA big problem my husband and I purchased a home within the ... back in Nineteen Ninety six\nEach year ... and not from the mortgage company but of course from ... association fees\nWe did sign a contract with them indicating that we want to be paying them a fee every year each here at the fee is going up annually visual alone as four hundred dollars is\nThe problem is it only takes care of being able to use the top house the swimming pool I ate the golf course\nWe were wondering if they don't get to use that\nOff course for free or do you have to pay green only have to pay because I was gonna say\nFor four hundred bucks you got the clubhouse in the pool and golf and tennis and all that that would be quite a deal but you just get you get the pool and tennis for the four hundred\nBucks we have all of that that you just name wow of course a swimming pool in the club\nThat's actually pretty good for Jews if four hundred but you said it's been going up\nIt's gone up every year you want out\nWe have been in my house for Thirteen Years we would like to get out and the problem is if we decided to sell the home the parts that purchases this house with half to actually be a part of the subdivision has for the association faith\nSo you're telling me that because of the papers you signed in Nineteen Ninety six correct you are what's known as a member in perpetuity meaning forever and whoever in turn buys your property they then or a member in perpetuity\nThat's correct\nThat is the most one sided deal I've ever heard of ... this was not a mandatory homeowners' association this was a voluntary that you volunteered into or act\nVolunteer\nSo you have lots of neighbors who have chosen not to be part of the swimmer and as I\nSay we have quite a few doctors lawyers teachers you name it and they don't like that and now they have not a lot of them have not join whatsoever\nNow how certain are you that you really did sign a contract in what's known in perpetuity which means that always with that piece of property that obligation continues even if it's not your piece of property we have the paperwork\nBut you still can lay your hands on that Nineteen Ninety six document I Hope so because the real answer comes from the original paperwork you sign\nOkay just 'cause somebody says that you signed a in a uh obligation in perpetuity doesn't mean you did okay that's why you need to get the paper work out it did you keep your closing papers and when you bought the home\nYes her weight at All right\nThen hopefully that document is with it now if you want out which is I think your whole issue here you're done with them you don't want the pool you don't want the tennis you don't want the Gulf\nCorrect you don't want to live but we want to continue to live in our home\nRight All right so if you can't lay your hands on your copy of it you can try to play a game of bluff and say we want to see what we signed a\nCandidate we sign something that said that this was in perpetuity also in most states if it was an item in perpetuity where it would pass with property and not owner it may well in your state be required to be filed\nAt the court house in the county in which you reside\nIn what's supposed to be\nAnd was it in fact is it on record at your county\nFrom

you aware of one of those things that I really\nDidn't think about that and you can follow me at Facebook dot com slash Clark Howard when I rent a car\nFirst thing I Do before it ever leave the rental plaza is I Hope my phone up to the Bluetooth in the car\nAnd the reason I Do is it's safer you don't want to have to be looking down dialing in so many states now have those hands free laws you can't touch your phone while you're driving but when you connect to Bluetooth in a car\nWhat is it ask you were to ask you if you wanted to save your contacts and your past calls or some ... like that and I always answer noted that\nThe reason is is that that information then is stored in the car and if you're somebody dishonest\nWell who knows what information is available to them apparently pretty easily they can access that information that's in the car Bluetooth system\nAnd so I learned this a couple of years ago when I got in a rental car and I couldn't add my phone to blue too because there were no additional spaces and I went through the protocol which is why I always do it while I'm Still in the parking lot so I'm not trying to drive into a wall while I'm doing this\nAnd there was like bills phone and Mary's iPhone and all these people you know funny nicknames for their phones and so I was deleting deleting deleting deleting but not everybody's going to be ... like I was\n'cause once I had cleared one space I was good to go but I just delete it everybody off\nThat car and when I get in cars now I Do that I delete everybody's left behind all their contact information and the call history and all that and suggests know\nWhen you're in a rental car\nYou don't want to leave information behind\nThat in some way could be harmful to you and so just do what I Do if somebody has left all that stuff and around car just take the moment to delete those phones that it's not much effort\nAnd you're going to protect somebody if somebody rents that car who's not on the up and up and knows how to use that information it was funny is somebody who's been\nA just a natural thing I Do I rent like thirty cars a year and it's something I Do when I get in the car\nAnd now I see an article in the Cleveland Plain dealer about how criminals are able to use this information and that you really need to make sure that if you do rent a car\nThat the last thing you do is delete your phone from the menu that I don't do that because I'm not sharing my call history or my contacts\nBut if I'm In a car that they accidentally would I'm being foolish because I'm leaving myself at risk\nJohn joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi John\n... three weeks I'll be starting a job congratulations and\nBelieve me this jogging one week and I'm hoping to put an awful lot of the house today
