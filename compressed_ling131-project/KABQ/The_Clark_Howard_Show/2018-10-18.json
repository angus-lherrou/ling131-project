such a miscalculation because the crown prince to convince everyone he was a reformer he was getting foreign investment he was talking about making the oil company public\nAnd it just turned\nAnd his ruthless I became clear okay so I\nAm basically on board with everything that you've been saying but there's this nagging thing that I Can't get out of my head which is everything that you just said he's really cultivated this image very carefully at great length great expense\nI'm great effort\nInto through it all away with this unbelievably stupid gambit to off this guy who wasn't even really that much of a ... yeah and what we can tell he was a sort of like he was an anti regime it it does not make sense to me that he would order this in terms of\nIf he's not a dummy like the the down

someone else logical that I Am a lie on now you bring him to your ... and ... member him\nThere there so I this is my theory the crown prince has undertaken a series of increasingly reckless moves and there's been no real pushback right so he\nHas been incredibly violent toward civilians and the war in Yemen which they're also fighting an Iranian proxy there but he has basically used us weapons there has been multiple evidence\nPiece of evidence to basically bomb civilian areas like he has been increased it is a humanitarian catastrophe that he has\nPerpetrated on a lot of civilians and yet man\nHe's also basically held the Lebanese prime minister hostage in Riyadh and forced him to resign and then let him go home where the prime minister was like yeah he told me I had to resign but I'm not going to\nLike you won't be back to Riyadh anytime but like that's insane actually and then as you mentioned he put a bunch of Saudi prince says under house arrest and the Ritz Carlton like he's been doing increasingly reckless Spain that hasn't really gotten much pushback\nI think he underestimated the fact that ... worked for the post and lived in the U.S\nI think he is it because this is

would also be ready to\nUm ... right that's right and that's something I've I've felt forever but even more intensely after Enron went by the last decade and people's in total of their IRA was in Enron stock and everybody's retirement got wiped out\nOf ... [noise] so they got me to one little first I was wondering why and I guess that explains that um but then also my company actually offers a stock purchase planned for employees\nThat use a Fifteen Percent discount when you are just stuck\nYeah I Love those plans to hold it\nOr at least one year before you can show it\nAnd I was wondering what would be the best way to go about\nManaging it I'm I'm fairly new to investing overall among the you're doing it for a couple of years I'm I'm thirty three years old and he's turned that into the game kind of leave 'em and so my ideal is is the kind of keep it there\nUm and just let it grow a long wish my four oh one K.\nUm however when I heard the other day I thought maybe that might not be the best idea so I was just wondering what your suggestion would be\nSo I Love these plans where the company offers you a discount and I guess they take a little bit out of each paycheck and find the purchase of the stocks that they give you a Fifteen Percent off\n[noise] is that right yes that's right\nYeah so I I Love that because they're giving you a direct incentive and you've got a guaranteed Fifteen Percent deal on the stock I mean that's pretty great and then the iffy part is you have to own it for a year\nAnd then add a year you can sell so it's possible the stock would go down over that next year and even though you got to discount you might lose money beyond the likely\nThat you would lose money consistently and it's really a a great gift they're giving you\nGiving you an opportunity to be an owner of the company and part and on the stock so I don't have a problem with that\nUm and you could add the years mark ... salad and take your profits paid the tax on it\nBut okay the four oh one K. thing\nThere's when you load up a four O. one K. with company stock that's the money you're depending on for your retirement money that you're doing and the stock purchase plan where you get the discount you can use it for any purpose you want after that twelve month holding period\nOkay and you and I was scared that allow at twelve month so are there different issues and different concerns\nOkay actually but I guess I was wondering if I should be taking that money and you know showing it taking the property and then you know moving back to something else like an IRA\nWhy we're live at you took the words right out of my mouth when I Would love him smiling as you asked that because you made it sound like you don't get the investing thing at all and you ask the perfect question so if you how the stock for a year you sold it then I'd love it if you put it in a Roth IRA\nAnd cause you're allowed to put up to fifty five hundred dollars a year and a raw you put money into Ross and it grows tax free all through the next Thirty years he'll be working and then you spend that money and everything at CERN tax free\nSo and then that automatically diversified you away from the company stock in a four one K. you have what are you putting your money in and hit\nA with a company matches a six percent so I put the sole six percent match in there\nAnd then what do you what do you investing in in\nThe oh oh well most of it was in um the vanguard I'm target fun\nThat's perfect then I Would put it all and the vanguard target fun for since you're thirty three let's look like um oh what would that be great doing like twenty six the twenty fifty five\nI say it's twenty shave the child I Want to say yeah\nThat's fine and there'll be a great decision\n... and then you're completely diversified away from what you're doing in that company stock\nAnd then if you did a Roth IRA with money you'd sell after a year of that company stock plan you could put all that in a Roth IRA with vanguard in the same target retirement fund twenty fifty five so you'd have\nYour a four O. one K. at work it would be ... times and then you have Iraq there would be after tax money and that would be a beautiful combo so sounds to me Brandon like you're doing a great job and you should know that\n... saving money for retirement thirty three puts you ahead of most people don't really think about it so they have their fortieth

order to draw the sun's out so I could do that\nUm and take a lump sum would\nWould there be any other plans that she'd recommend take a I think it's maybe for about twelve thousand dollars which is a great song but should I ... and other plans\nSo you said this is a state retirement plan\nCrafts public employees retirement plan\nAll right so you got this twelve grand and so your option would be to take it where they give you just a monthly check for the rest of your life or get that twelve grant\nSo until I D.C.'s he had received that amount but it did not pay all too I'm an air war or you can write\nThis depends on the state plan and ah I my thing generally is like for you to get the monthly check\nAnd the reason is you're not as likely to be able to generate as much money from that twelve

each week if you go to court dot com scroll down a little you'll see the phone number and hours available each weekday for free off the air advice and information from a member of team Clark\nThis is something that has come out of\nOur Web team is something they very much want me to talk about and they're so right\nThat a problem that has appeared over and over again\nThat we've noticed and is happening to so many people in the country is you'll resolve you're going to set up a Roth IRA are you going to set up an IRA even put money into the account after you open it\nBut you forget one more step\nAnd that is\nYou've got to choose the investments the money's going to go in so many people's dollars are sitting in IRAs burning basically nuts\nBeing in the default equivalent of like a money market account like a savings account inside an IRA or off you're not even going to be able to keep up with inflation\nIt's absolutely essential but when you open a retirement account that you go to the next step\nThat may or may not be obvious when you open that account that with the money you put in\nYou choose what it will be invested in a lotta times people will be overwhelmed\nBy what psychologists referred to as the paradox of choice there are so many different funds they are so many different options you just basically shut down you put the money in the account but you don't ever choose how it will be invested\nSo keep it very simple\nMost places that have you on any of the low cost\nPlaces I recommend you're going to be able to put money into a target retirement fund\nAnd you put it in the target retirement fund for the year closest when you're going to retire\nAnd just put all the money in that\nIf you whiter want to do things that are more involved in let's say you decide well I Want to put some money in\nEmerging markets so it's the term for third world countries or I Want to put money in some form of bonds or I Want to put money in a European stocks or whatever it is I mean you want to do things more exotic have at it\nBut for so many people starting out with a Roth IRA or traditional i._r._a.\nJust picking a simple default choice to target retirement fund will get your money heavily diversified mean simply spread out in many different types some investments many types of stocks here and oversees all in One Fund and so\nWhen you do find that IRA or raw\nMake sure you complete the deal and get your money invested and while we're at it really look at being a creature of habit where you automatically add money month after month after month\nTwo year Roth IRA or your traditional so that you are building up money for the long term and if you are a business owner\nOr you have side income you can do\nAlternative things like the south which takes like no paperwork to open some provide employee pension and is very flexible from you let's say with a side gig or your own business where you can put aside from nothing in a year to

doing with credit is that right\nYeah my question on you often talk about keeping your via little credit below thirty but around ... ... ... and you keep talking about credit cards all the time [noise]\nMy question was if that number and it also includes plot lines of credit or specifically home equity lines of\nWhat a great question and as a general rule if you have a home equity line of credit with the veil of credit let's say of fifty thousand which is a very common number for a homeland when your line of credit\nThe percentage that you're using would also factor because a home equity line of credit many times is looked at as a personal line of credit like a personal loan or a credit card\n[noise] personal old also affected him to that or just credit that's evolving like\nAre usually it's mental and the crash in a home equity line that's a form of revolving credit so in in ... alone like a car loan um mortgage alone would not be figured into the ratio for available credit there's I\nClear correlation that the credit bureaus can demonstrate and particularly fight go can demonstrate that the percent of available credit someone's using a revolving credit is a direct indicator\nAbout when somebody is going to be a risky person to win too\nAnd so it the way they the way the math works you pointed out the thirty percent thing\nThat we don't want to use is thirty percent of available credit is considered to be a low risk for or somebody who uses ten percent of available credit is considered to be an extremely low risk for or somebody who is likely\nNever to be an issue with the default on the other hand somebody who uses fifty percent of available credit is an extremely high risk of getting delinquent or defaulting on debt\nOkay because it used to be that in the past if you had a lot of available credited look bad because they they assume that if she got into trouble you lack of a lot to get it right now to like it's gone and the other direction\nActually it hasn't and this is where it gets confusing Dorian is that when you're talking to a mortgage lending underwriter\nHe or she hates the available credit\nBecause they're worried just like you said so it's such a mixed message because qualifying for the best rate on a mortgage is partially a factor of you having extremely low utilization of your revolving credit like credit cards\nAnd on the other hand that gets you the rate from the mortgage lender and then some underwriters will say yeah yeah yeah but I'm nervous you're going to take that visa card that you're using four percent of the available credit and you're going to go crazy going out and buying stuff\n[noise] correct\nSo that's why it's it is a confusing message so my attitude and my advice is this\nLive your life using his widow of your available creditors you can\nAnd if you get to the end of the line and it's time to close on a mortgage and the underwriter throws up a roadblock at that time you may have to close a line of credit or to to get the mortgage through\nBut the principle of having a very low utilization is the right answer and the right thing to do\nThe whole talking very much thank you and you have a great day Sabrina is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Sabrina Hi how are you clock great thank you you are trying to help a relative what's going on\n[noise] well I think that's I got over his head and get oh I'm Sorry I think\n... yeah well you know nothing about it he didn't come to ... feet and he even had the four oh one K. to help pay off their credit card oh\nYeah exactly [laughter]\nSo what we did was we were going to come up with a plant that I got taken point\nWhat we would like to do it it's not too much I got to look at it papers and see how much that that is what could pay off his that the Clinton credit cards are twenty four percent we will obviously they can pay it back but it may be three percent\nOkay and they wait wait wait wait wait wait stop you right there because I hear your heart talking\nSo Sabrina somebody who has run up a lot of debt and as a family member and you\nDo a work out for them and that's what it's called ... you know work out where you pay off the high interest rate that you become the wind or for the lower interest rate debts you said something right there that I got to throw the flag on you said and of course will make him pay back\nThe the odds are that he may intend to pay you back but\nThey're not high that it'll actually happen\nSo when you if you were to do something like this you have to think of it in terms of you are you will call it alone to him you'll even have loan terms but psychologically in your own mind you have to be prepared that this may ultimately be a gift not alone\nOf course of course and now waiting here in the way I Do\nWell selling the orange inconvenient [laughter] back in ... show and that's why he never came to a ...\n... having run up he didn't want to come to us\nAnd what kind it was a lifestyle things or did he have a medical problem or what caused the debt as best you can tell\nIt started with a car that died and he had to go out to buy a car and then from there we also think that he got himself into a credit card debt daddy started than maybe buying scratch on our own now that you know the answer is getting a lottery\nAnd then I think it's I don't know because he hasn't told us the whole story yet but he used to send me pictures\nOf his cell phone telling his credit rating of over a country so he he integrate spender in the past I think he just got in over his head on that\nOkay so let me tell you what I think needs to happen next and it's not you giving him alone\nOkay what he needs to do is if he's got the best of intentions and things got out of control won him he needs to sit down with a budget councilor and there's a group called the national foundation for credit counseling have you ever heard me mentioned them\nI have a he may have to hear it several\nTimes before he'll be willing to make an appointment and go in but they'll take him to the root cause of because everybody's always got a story about how they ended up where they did with that right but it's a it's a plan\nAnd a map basically the gets you on to a new path and you just lending them the money I don't think changes whatever it was that got him to where he is and that's why I think he needs the tough love of a budget counselor\nTo help him see a path to better way of handling as money because even if you wait or choose to win them the money the things that brought him to where he is those to have to change first\nOh I completely agree\nSo would I Would say is ... have you broach the subject with him of lending money\nNo we've had we were going to meet with either tonight or some kind of sleep\nSo great because I don't want that out there yet as a carrot or a possibility\nRight I Would I Would go in with the idea that you want him to go sit down with somebody at the closest an FCC affiliate and you go in with the information for them if you go to an FCC dot org you'll be able to find the closest\nAffiliate and generally if they sit down and do counseling with the most affiliates that's free or it's so cheap it's like in significant\nGreat that they can go with the national step if he's really box himself into a corner they can actually negotiate a payment plan with the various companies he owes money to\nAnd they may even be able to get the interest rate marked down to zero should we better there are eight percent sure and then you're not in this thing where you have lent money and then the awkward thing happens well he didn't pay this month\nEight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three that's eight hundred Seventy seven

A. dot Gov dot Gov slash radon fracturing okay and\nAgain it's very ... remember there's a government agency and they did a great job explaining it all in perfectly understandable English\nOK okay that's what I was curious about\nAnd it's not cheap when you end up in a situation where you fail a radon test is a seller and you have to mitigate it but it's just a cost of doing business selling a property because of the buyers\nGonna walk you fix the problem [noise] you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\n\nNow it's time to make it\nNow's the time to take a stand to get involved

they don't have any way of knowing if you're there or not\nAnd you just ask them why they're there and it's great because you're able to monitor your home so well the beauty of these things is some of

or whatever you might earned buying airline tickets right now we got to get you into credit with training wheels we had to get going with that because\nUm when you have no prior establish record of credit you've got to start with a program where they'll let you establish credit such as going to a credit union\nAnd or either of you a member of a credit union yet\nIs we both uh have you on the same on your with the same what were you were not with the St Louis now that that's\nActually an advantage here because one may offer and the other not which often referred to as a fresh start program and with a fresh start you a post a certain amount of money in a CD or a savings account\nAnd then they'll establish a visa or MasterCard with you now the advantage of doing a fresh start with a credit union versus what you may have heard about in the past with the security card\nMost of the credit union programs issue you a regular bees or MasterCard\nAnd tied the limit and what you have on deposit but they don't report it or treat it as a secure card\nAnd after a period of time of on time payments you're then released from having to have any money on deposit specifically to back up movies or mass car do you have\nThat so that's the best way and the reason the credit union fresh start programs are so great versus anything else out there in terms of security cards secured cards tend to come with very high fees\nWhich he will not have with the credit union so each of you should check with the credit union you reach a member of\nThe what they would require issue you a visa and MasterCard and if one has a credit union does it and the other the other credit union doesn't send you both just joined the credit union that that does allow that in each get a fresh start visa or MasterCard\n... all the other one will do also ...\nNo don't even that's down the road right now you just gotta get established with credit\nOh thank you very much sure and where are you thinking you
