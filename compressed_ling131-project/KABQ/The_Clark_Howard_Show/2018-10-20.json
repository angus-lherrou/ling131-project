on the healthcare front where the news historically has not been so good\nAndrew is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Andrew\n[noise] hey how are you\nGreat thank you Andrew you are moving towards the end up paying off your student loans is that right that is correct well what kind of journey if you've been on with that how ... then\nUm I Would I Would say it's been pretty rough of tried to focus pretty heavily on trying to get those paid off as soon as possible\nUm but it has taken a lot of um a lot of work to do so and I had to make sacrifices but we're nearing the end so I'm pretty excited about it\nWell that is great news how much do you have left burdening you\n[noise] I got just over sixty one hundred at the moment [noise]\nOh that's fantastic because you know when I hear from people calling me about student loans usually it will be in the tens of thousands or or probably one in five times there will be more than a hundred thousand dollars in student loans that someone's asking me about\nYeah I started at the right at about thirty two I'm a couple of years ago and so of I'm nearing the end so it's a very great showing that\nWonderful well how can I be of service in this quest to be done with the student loan lenders\nSo the question I have is so I've got just over the sixty one hundred and student loans and it's a right at four percent four point zero one percent interest on that [noise]\nI have a a little bit over seven thousand built up and just individual savings and so I'm I'm just I'm questioning do I just go ahead and erase the student loan and be done with it\nOr just continue it out and I'm looking at potentially make it easier last payment and march or April next year\nSo that even if you did not um kill off your savings you'd still be done in another half here\nYes that's correct [noise]\nAll right so that means you're a very determined savor your very careful with your money I Would go ahead and blow out the student loans and extend in early Christmas gift to yourself [laughter] okay\nBecause you're on that kind of trend line where you're paying five hundred or so a month towards this balance you're going to replenish her savings pretty quickly\nAnd getting to that goal line of getting rid of the student loans is so worth it with the slog you've been through reward yourself and wipe it out\nOkay yeah I appreciate that because I was the kind of the same thing same thought process I had as if\nI go at it and remove this now that just benefits me in the long term like put all that extra money back into savings and the Cornish that then they would have backup\nAnd pretty quickly to one thing though that I Want to make sure you're aware that record keeping by the student loan servicers is pitiful and you need to keep the documents showing that you have successfully paid off your student loans for guess how long\n[noise] forever [laughter]\nThat is right for the rest of your life you need to keep the proof because over the years it's been so disturbing to me when I hear from someone who's being hassled by a student loan collector on loans thing long since paid off even decades before\nAnd they have no way of proving they actually pay them off\nAnd Congress and its wisdom gave student loan collectors extreme powers where they don't even have to prove the validity of a debt and that's why having your proof of pay off is so key\n[noise] yeah I I I appreciate you reminded me on that I'll definitely make sure I I get a um when I Do get a clear it out\nAnd congratulations to you and your early Christmas gift to yourself\nThank you very much I appreciate they've I\nCertainly and Sam is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Sam\nYes Hi how are you\nWonderful Sam how can I be of service to you\nI'm

voters likely voters and people who voted in the last two elections right these kids are new are just now getting registered and our daughter goes to Texas state and she said it becomes times around their registering voters they've been doing that for the past few weeks\nI Love the fact that the combination tell us with Willie Nelson is making lose their collective ... will\nJoin our right to the parents and the kids you know yes Willie Taylor let's do this handler yeah time doing doing doing are you doing [noise]\nEveryone has to be there most annoying with everyone they know about voted [noise] you're much as my daughter you right now we're going to do it [noise]\nAnd I can't name one song otherwise I'd do it oh really I Can't I get off she could come about well hey you know I'm

then our guns all of us are planning a walkout for election day where they're gonna where students are going to leave their schools and are going to march on down to their local precinct and vote\nGood these are things that we're not hearing about in terms of young voters and I I'm skeptical just as much as anyone else in terms of the young voters turning out but that bad in particular is good news\nYeah well I mean just five you treated among other people you said there is an exodus of women from the Republican Party Trump always makes things worse for Trump and again yeah the matter how they kind of keeps spinning this cabinet stuff and Trump's ego women love in women is very angry about the Democrat hoax at like ... yeah no no\nYeah yeah I mean right now I think fifty eight percent of all women all of a women registered voters in this country are voting for Democrats this time around and that's a big deal\nYeah this has that scene in New generic ballot pool has women opting for democratic candidates sixty three to thirty three gender gap as a net thirty five percent I mean I've been saying this for a long time\nAbout this blue wave is going to be female but I also say well you see every day don't get happy you know don't focus on any polls don't because there was one showing democratic enthusiasm way down after the Kavanaugh thing for a day and everybody freaked out right\nYeah well it's really sad that we have to worry about so much complacency on the left but the fact of the reality is that we kinda are in a place where we have to scare our own people into voting yeah you know like I I literally we got to get a Malcolm adds to go to the door to door to scare people\nVote out as just knock knock knock chow chow chow okay\n[laughter] I could look at the trick or treaters it won't even\nGo just stand on their front doorstep and just start yelling at the door\nThey come down and I was scared enough to vote but I mean it's it's true but I think we're\nUnderestimating the number of voters that are going to turn out on election day I think there are a lot of people and especially especially women and rightfully so who are fed up and and now the time to rise up because again\nIf only women voted weed out of the most progressive country in the world if only men voted the Republican Party would be the left wing party yeah this is so important figure for for women especially to get out and and change the tide of this uh this disaster\nYeah well you know and Bob I think I'm like I was saying it it is an interesting I mean Ted Lieu tweeted yes the electorate has was transformed this November we experienced the Nineteen Ninety two years a woman times a hundred um but again I\nOnly if we turn out at night and we keep talking about all these various voter suppression you know a ... that they're trying around the country so you know voting early as ... keep saying voting by mail was a lot of ways to avoid you know meddling on election day right or own a lot of these machines broke who sell well\nYeah and and you know as much as we're concerned about things like voter suppression voter id and gerrymandering and all of the shenanigans the Republicans what I mean we've got so many impediments that are passed ultimately in terms of winning back at least one chamber of Congress\nKissing is right but we have not they have
