... with ...\nAnd today in addition to doing all this amazing work at Stanford we are spending some time with the tech companies that here in Silicon valley today we went out to Facebook and Twitter later in the ... will be at Twitter later in the week and we got a peek at Facebook's new war room and its headquarters in Menlo Park\nIt especially has specialist all co located together working to detect and disrupt bad\nActors who are attempting to de legitimize elections spread information or suppress the vote there obviously very focused on the midterms guy but they're also for example tracking what's happening in Brazil who also had an election coming up right now\nWe should remember Facebook is truly a global company let's take a listen and cut forty three to one of their officials talking about the purpose of this new around\nThe face looks more room for the upcoming midterm election and it's actually the combination of two years of hard work we put in ensuring that our platform is safe and secure place for election builds on massive investment that we've made both people and technology to do things like\nCombat fake account to fight the spread of fake news and then also to bring unprecedented transparency to political advertising and now as we enter the final days before the election we've convened this more room with experts from across the company to be able to detect and respond in real time to any sort of late breaking\nThe threat that we may see on the platform\nSo guy um and a much bigger fan of Facebook and Twitter as you know although I'm happy that we are in conversation with them about how to correct them of the things I think have kept me off of the platform and maybe some other people at Wyoming Twitter yet\nUm but I I actually you know full disclosure left Facebook use it a lot I use it to communicate with friends from home particularly\nUm and they've had a lot of criticism over what happened in twenty sixteen over some of the false information over stories that looked real and weren't fake accounts and this war room it's just the latest in a line of effort they've really been undertaking that we talked about today to try and make this site a little more responsible\nYeah and I was also talking to them about the imbalance the ideological imbalance at big tech companies because you know look I never been out there before it is a very cool compound they have this amazing rooftop garden that we saw a from from the ground up\nThey their whole workspaces like this futuristic Mayes with all sorts of art all over the

it was\nNo is when it it is a different kind of company we in the east coast are you still totally different and\nYou could just sort of look around and it's like okay this is exactly what you would sort of imagine from a Silicon Valley style TV show on HBO like this is what you would you would envision Facebook looking like\nAnd it's cool and it's different and it's interesting a lot of it's you know cutting edge stuff\nBut there is the component of human biases and you know the fact that this is out in a very liberal state and a very liberal part of a very liberal state with the type of people that they hire I think a lot of conservatives are concerned that not just Facebook but Google and Twitter and others\nAre extremely powerful corporations that are populated overwhelmingly by people who are hostile to the world view that we have and that was one of the issues that I raise\nIn our neighbors and and they do have some people that they've hired who are right leaning a I Would also point out that recently they've\nUndertaking a fact check amalgamation or like a coalition of fact checking including a few right leaning sites that have been\nVerified as reliable in their ... yeah so I think it's something that they are aware of their certainly attuned to the criticism and I think they're trying to\nCombat it or mitigate some of those concerns\nYeah and I think I think um there are we need to be careful there clear examples of bias and there are places where I think some on the right claimed by us because it helps them politically and maybe it was just big tech\nNot doing their job right you're doing something that they shouldn't have done that had nothing to do with political bias and so I think both sides need to be careful about that\nUm I also think there are a lot of people who are libertarian out here or maybe don't fall exactly and the one political party it's just an interesting collection of people it was and it and I think they look at putting a lot of attention to that issue in the election issues\nUm and really paying attention to some of the criticism when Mark Zuckerberg has to go testify before Congress I think they know it's Syria\nI also just thought it was fascinating to scaling up from starting at a college room at Harvard to this massive global corporations that element of our talk today was really interesting\nAnd what we'll be

Seventeen years ago\nBrooklyn was still a backwater\nAnd it's so alive and then there's this area called Long Island city in Queens which was a industry all kinds of slum area and now there are all these gleaming towers they're probably thirty high rises there and that area's become a hip kind of area\nAnd you see what is so fantastic about our nation and that is the spirit we have in a time as we approach the midterms\nVet we in one respect have lost our way and something that's so frustrating for me and that that those among us that are part isn't that our political\nLook at those they disagree with is their enemies in ... uh dehumanize them and act like they're a lower form of life for the people of either perspective look at the other left or right look at the other is if they're not good Americans I mean this is nuts\nBecause we are all privileged as Americans to live in a land where we are able to disagree and we need to remember\nThe thing that Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill one Republican one Democrat\nSo eloquently stated so many different ways so many different times the concept of disagreeing without being disagreeable I saw\nWith my own eyes\nIn a visit I did to the Pentagon a few years ago to give a speech and you may not know this but I worked in the Pentagon has a civilian employee at the end of the Vietnam War\nAnd then I was back to speak at an event at the Pentagon\nAnd in between of course in all those years there was the attack on the Pentagon is well on September eleventh and I saw there that the people more than their losses rebuilt and\nThe Pentagon is there as it was before to provide for our nation's defense and security I mean what what I Want you to really reflect on\nIs what a great country we have the privilege of being part of and how we as Americans\nAnd as a people showed that we would not be defeated by those who wish to rain evil upon us and death and destruction upon us we lost thousands of our fellow Americans that day\nWhat we found afterwards was our strength as a nation\nAnd our ability to move forward and succeed in spite of others who wanted to bring us nothing but failure\nWe showed in a time of adversity what we were made of and that makes me so proud to be an American\nMartin is with us on the Clark Howard show oh Martin\nSlow o'clock now are you today\nGreat thank you Martin if you've been to New York in recent years\nNot in recent years no sir I was there when they were first constructing the towers back in the I guess late sixties early seventies when they were that was on a family vacation\nWell if you went back you would see a completely different New York was interesting when you were in New York New York was as a city was flat on its back crime was out of control [noise] nothing seemed to work\nAnd today in New York is send amazingly ah for live better term user friendly place things just seemed to work there\nFor well that's that's kinda know tells into my question let's say I wanted to go to New York just to see that but I didn't care when I went and there's lots of other places I'd like to go to Florida for instance I Want to go see him of always wanted to see 'em but I don't care when a when I go but I Want to do at least expensive time\nAnd I was searching the Internet age is difficult to find a\nIf you don't care when you go how do you find when is the cheapest on together\nSo you've got different tracks here so [noise] ... and the case of hotels depending on the city you can figure out that pattern really easily it's like I had this question from someone who wanted to go to Las Vegas with his girlfriend and I was talking through\nHow you can go to these price calendars for the big casino hotels and you can see week by week month by month when they're at their cheapest\nRight and you can do that same kind of thing with um any city in America not as easily as you can do it in Vegas wail [laughter]\nBut you can you can go to let's say you go to trip advisor and you put in a city you're interested in going to\nAnd you put in um whatever level of hotel you're interested in three four five star whatever it is right that your level\nYou put on you put it and and then you can put in the dates and put and tried different dates over the course of many minds and you'll see the prices move up and down like crazy\nOh I Know over many months but I don't it's I don't care where the where the next two or three months I don't want to have to put in you know every day for the next Ninety Days\nNow wait if you're if you're going to be a

if if you go to Google dot com slash flights you can put down a destination and it'll show you in a in a split second where you can see month after month after month the lowest price is\nGoing to place there was no equivalent with hotel so you have to be that's a shame to be more in my article is\nNice places to visit don't care when I just you know over the next six months you know if you've got the legislation found that you choose a plan which I think most people get to choose when they go well if they don't care when they go let's go at the least expensive time and\nNo Clark some of us don't have time to go through a week or so much trying days\nTo say what's cheaper actually [laughter] you know if you don't care went over the next year let's say Ryan that's another thing European overseas travel\nIt'd be nice there 'cause you you know of course know when the when the off season is and all these places well I have I mean I'm here in Pensacola I Know on the off season is here but I Can't tell you ... years ago I didn't even know all the all the the last of the rest of the state of Florida any different than a year [laughter]\nWhat what you could do is one strategy that might work if you sign up for the hotel specials at that there aren't that many big hotel chains anymore if you did it at ... website Hilton website and Hyatt tribes site yes I've seen\nThat and they send you those that would be a way that would be in a work who prices are really low right now to blah blah blah on the air fare yeah inch and patterns so the cheapest time to travel\nTo Europe is November to march except during Christmas\nRight as far as the cheapest time to travel anywhere in the United states it is the first two weeks of December right after the Thanksgiving holiday closes out except for New York\nCity everywhere else on the on her yeah those are the cheapest two weeks of the year so\nTraveling too but I'm I'm Still looking at driving you know a couple of states away to a town somewhere you know just for a few days and that's what it's frustrating to find the cheapest time together\nAnd and there is nobody doing that yeah maybe someone listening I'll think think ooh

I Want you to learn ideas to me so you can save more and spend last and don't want anyone ever rip you off\nAnd you can follow me Facebook dot com slash Clark Howard I hate hate hate covenants not to compete\nRestrictions on you and your ability to work somewhere drives me to distraction one in five Americans today covered by covered it it's not to compete in the fields that people are covered in now or beyond ridiculous I don't know if you heard\nThere was a story that came out just in the last week Cushman Wakefield the big property manager requires ... janitors the clean buildings to sign covenants not to compete\nBurger King has causes the workers don't sign butter in the franchise agreements with franchises Burger King says or not there anymore but according to reporters are still there that\nOne Burger King worker is banned from ever going to work at another Burger King\nAnd really and this is one of those things holding down wages in the United states as corporations continue to report bigger and bigger profits when you're not allowed\nTo Jimmy Johns 'til there was a lot of publicity about it you couldn't make sandwiches there and then go work anywhere else making sandwiches for years\nAnd company after company is using these governance ... compete\nFor people in jobs that don't necessarily require a college degree but you don't have trade secrets there's nothing about what you do other than trying to hold you down and hold you back\nAnd it is absolutely one of the complete\nOut rages imbalances in our economy that companies do this and you know what one of the craziest things about these governors is they hold back economic growth\nIs that when you keep people from achieving the best they can achieve to have the latitude to move around and have new opportunities it hurts our economy\nOf the states that don't have covenants not to compete tend to grow quicker than the states that do\nAnd they lose some of the dynamics of their economy when they have these covenants here's what I have to say to you in a really strong economy with millions of jobs going unfilled\nIf some employer comes to you and tries to strong arm you and the signing a covenant not to compete do not sign do not sign it\nYou know in in my world\nWith court dot com and court deals dot com there are things that my digital people learn\nThat are valuable to them in the marketplace enter potentially valuable to people who do similar things to what I Do but I don't have any covenant not to compete\nFor my digital team even though it's one of those examples where you could say well they're learning internal stuff they're learning secrets they're learning things that could be valuable elsewhere I Want people to succeed\nAnd part of it is allowing people the opportunity to learn and they want to be where they are instead of may prisoners compelled to remain where they are one of the most egregious things though\nAbout so many covenants not to compete in the United states and so many of our companies in so many of our nation states is that even if a company lazy you off or fires you you're still prohibited from going to work somewhere else\nWith the skills that you have and that is so wrong there is no great to what there is no question that that is out of line\nYou can do a alone where you put a Fifteen Percent down and you're able to get to the twenty by doing a very small second mortgage\n\nAnd that would navigate you having to borrow from the four oh one K. and these are known is eighty Fifteen five ... were you borrow I'm eighty percent on the first mortgage\nAnd then you put a actually I should have said eighty five fifteens C do eighty percent on the first mortgage five percent on what would be a relatively small very low risk for the lender second mortgage and you put the Fifteen Percent down and you avoid the private mortgage insurance\nI'd say that's probably better long term than losing out on the games that they can fall okay\nThat's the idea of the other thing though is that when people take money as alone against four one K. the math shows that by the time you retire you end up with\nQuite a bit less money saved for retirement by having that money not active plus having to pay back alone a lot of times people will reduce their four one K. contributions while they're paying back alone or the employer will require that\nSo doing an eighty percent first mortgage or five percent second rewards you for having saved such a substantial amount of money towards down payment\nAnd you just close that gap with that five percent second five percent second we usually have a floating rate\nAnd so it will be a priority for you every time you have an extra dollar to throw it towards that loan that represents five percent of the purchase price\nYeah ... well I think that would be a good option instead of on my mind that didn't sound like a good idea I thought I thought well maybe the savings from that angle margin shots might make it worthwhile but I didn't\nEver take loans off of my\n... and I hate the idea of taking alone against four one K. if you had no other options to close that five percent gap I Would reluctantly say yeah you could do the borrowing against four one K. 'cause that would be superior to having to pay pm by\nYet since it should be pretty easy for you with Fifteen Percent saved to be able to borrow that five percent in a second that would be the better of course of action and congratulations to you for being such a diligent saver you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nOnly smack energy for granted ham Thirteen fifty\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them if you want to fifty year old male maybe it'd be fee or even with type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance my only cost you about two hundred bucks a month of ... life insurance is out there called term provider and speak with big Lou and eight hundred for a one\nFourteen fifty eight eight hundred for a one fourteen fifty eight or is it big blue dot com\nRemember big lose IQ he's on meds too\nMuch think about estimates nation presented by liberty mutual insurance liberty mutual customize your auto insurance so you only pay for what you need so why aren't more things in life customize\nMice in a burger cheaper and when you ask for no one\nSo shouldn't use the duck the price of the onion right otherwise I'm paying for the onions but I'm not receiving any\nGo to liberty mutual dot com for uh customize quoting you could save\nThe\nCoverage has underwritten by liberty mutual insurance company ...\nWhen the need for senior characterizes there's no place like home\nYour loved one should never have to give up living at home visiting aims of will provide home care for your mom and dad at home to twenty four hours per day including personal care meals and light housework you're selected professional caregiver with visiting angel look up and getting into dot com or calling eight seven seven three seven four men\nThat seven seven three seven four men franchises are available visiting in America's Choice in senior home care\nI used to lead voice mails for myself because the only one I could trust to get something done right was me\nMe remember to order safety goggles on your way\nBut now I use Granger ... got the technical support you would expect from America's number one source for industrial grade supplies during the business of helping my business so no more talking to myself now I talked to Granger because when it comes to keeping your business running ... got your back\nColor click ranger dot com to see for yourself Granger for the ones who get it done\nIn many countries around the world medical care is scary\nFrom birth defects to Syrian injury than illnesses countless millions have no access to have surgery mercy ships they're down with a team of volunteers professionals nurses surgeons utilizing state of the hospital\nShips mercy ships provides free surgeries for themselves and some of those\nWho are waiting for surgery at each port messages\nIs bringing services and the countries that would otherwise be as ... as the people\nThat need help he had I that they have no way of getting out and I\nHad last help make a lasting impact in terms of someone's fear to joy\nFind out how you can help by visiting our Web site at mercy ships died\nOr some more information\nThat's mercy ships died or\nA car nice [noise] [noise] ...

I'm trying to remember how many pounds I mean I think that it's just six panel\nAll right I think you've got to do some more work to get some more quotes that sounds way too high\nOkay All right so why would you say for let's say if he was telling me six panels ... would be a good right\nWell you don't really look at that because the system's supposed to be engineered based on what your power demands or somewhat translated from your square footage\nAnd it it would not be unusual for you like we have a somewhere install with thirty two panels okay it wouldn't be unusual that you might need somewhere twenty four to thirty two for your house\nAnd even that many panels would be surprising if it costs that kind of money\nSo you only have one quote so far\nThat would be where I'd really concentrate what's your current monthly power bill average as best you can guess\nProbably around two hundred and thirty a month\nOr so if you're spending a so let's just rounded off let's say you're spending three thousand dollars a year on power you're not going to go every thousand to zero\nIf you sit around and twenty eight thousand on panels you get the thirty percent federal tax credits so he's going to drop you to let's say Nineteen\nRight I don't know that would take for ever to get paid back on yeah for camera can act\nSo that does not on the face of it the numbers don't add up to me and that's why you gotta go get more quotes okay I didn't want to be able to get a pay back net of credits in less than a decade\nOkay they said after ten years my ... out of pocket would be under five thousand house that\nHis the way that they said you know the monthly installment I'm certain that would be a hundred and forty three and then the installment minus the energy saving energy production Woodward did it's like you know a year to do that and that's made about sixty dollars a month okay if\nI let me tell you I mean when you're running numbers never take their assumptions based on installment payments or anything like that look at it from the raw numbers of what you pay for a system minus thirty percent credit\nTake your three thousand dollars a year power bill figure out how much of that you're likely to say let's say you cut it in half so you say Fifteen hundred dollars a year\nHow long would it take you to make up that Nineteen five plus interest\nYou're looking at for ever and the day and that's why I Need to go get more quotes and see where the numbers really would flesh out this is sort of somebody who is a strong strong so we're advocate\nSherry I Need for this to work for you financially not be something you do and you're like why did we do this why did we sign this contract we have to pay all this money and where's the savings Robby is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Robbie how are you doing\nAll I'm doing great car thanks for taking my call starting with all the wonderful things that you do to a educate thousands of people\nWell thank you you that what's going on with you\nWell I have a credit card account with one or banking institution it is a little bit it's brought about Fifteen thousand dollars [laughter] I have money saved up which which I could actually pay it off but that would exhaust my um emergency savings I don't want to do that\nI have another institution it's a credit union and they currently have a promotion going on where you can do the balance transfer and it's at two point nine nine percent for twelve month\nSo I was thinking about doing that and in doing that I was planning to close out the other account that has the sixteen or right over Fifteen thousand dollars in it\nBut I've been hearing I've heard often I think even from during your a show do not close the account keep it open and use it periodically\nWhere you don't have to use it I'm constantly but if you use it even twice a year for very small purchases it will keep it in your credit mix and that's very valuable for you to do you don't want to have just a single credit card\nYou want to have I always call it the Noah's Ark rule you want to have at least two credit cards\nOkay\nAnd the reason is is that the available credit that you have\nOn the two cards added together versus the amount you have charged on cards figures directly into what makes up your credit score okay and so you want to have substantial available on use credit\nYou also want to have multiple lines of credit that you can be graded on essentially in your credit report and your credit score\nWell see I'm also her well actually I've been through this before probably about Twenty years ago I'm retired military\nThank you so much for your service\nAnd thank you so you bet you bet and uh years ago my wife and I were purchasing a fan and we were told at the time we had too much available credit\nRight so it had to do so that a mixed message right yes I'm telling you keep credit open and then it's unusual with a vehicle loan they tell you up too much of AOL credit but where you'll hear that the most often is when you're applying for a mortgage\nBut at the same time when you're applying for that mortgage if you don't have multiple lines of credit it makes your credit score lower and then people may not make you the the home loan or they may charge you a higher interest rate so okay wait till something happens if somebody says no we don't like all that available credit\nAnd then you choose maybe to close or something but otherwise leave the winds open because if you look at what makes up a credit score is\nIn the two major areas of a credit score it pays for you to keep that old line open\nBeth is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Beth\nHow are you\nA great so excited to be on\nWas great to have you here you want to talk about my thing about owning a cow\nYeah so I heard you talk about crowdsourcing cows their couch surfing as they call it and I went ahead last summer and I bought myself a quarter of like how\nHow did that go\nWay great I'm here in Idaho a lot of people die like large chairs of the cow like a ... a quarter of a cap and\nI went down ... market and there's quite a few different sounds\nAnd so that's a lot of meat did you have to get a freezer to store that quarter of a cow\nYeah so a quarter about I'm a hundred pounds and so I Can't put that like a normal size family freezer so I went by a phrase there a moment dot com and for like\nTwo fifty or three hundred dollars and that fed four hundred pounds his side\nAnd so you're going to buy a portion of a cow again once you go through the supply\nA

know your credit card companies usually give you your score for free if you sign in and I just saw a mine\nAre mine is based on psycho scoring model eight which is an obsolete model I think there are pretty sure I think there are nine now\nBut I'm based on my experience credit file is a seven Ninety eight I could go to credit karma it would not be a fight go better give me an approximation as well
