{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "[noise]\n\nYou listen to some other show I'm Jeff Smith with us now Luke Vargas talk media news talk many news dot com look\nWhat's going on what new information we've already we're already reported here at least pass along reporting here that in the uh the the suspects and taken into custody these rich Republican the Trump stickers on his ban\nHas been convicted of anything can be clear that than they are now been what eleven eleven by Bob's et cetera that twelve or what else do we need to know what are you covering\nWell I I'm a covering the story in so far as I'm I Am on the group or messaging\nBored with the rest of my colleagues who are working on the story that they seem to be saying that uh well let's just say there at two thirty the department of justice will give a formal update on this and I think until then I at least will hesitate I'm passing along information that I Can't quite\nA you know a ascertain it's provenance this is not really my beat 'em so that would just leave it there with your permission I I think what I've been focusing on today are are events over seas which often get quite buried a as we get a swept\nUp you're saying the world is relevant if I'd bombs are male nonetheless world is still relevant how dare you sir how dare you\nOne thing I've been looking at with with some interest is that the defense secretary Jim Mattis or whom many folks\nThink might be on his way out there and some reports that the likes of um\nEverybody's going after the election that the ... whatever the bart after the\n... yeah yeah I mean the ... and it looks like John Bolton may be responsible for\nCirculating reports to the press suggesting that a mad as says on the way out that we have some palace intrigue here where uh you know Bolton and some of his ilk seem to think about it is an annoyance and that Trump or could replace him with\nSomeone who will let Fay go a little bit harder on Iran that that's possible to do and the current environment um and and yet what it appears Madison is going to do even though some of us have may view him as sort of the rational savior in a world of of Trump come old\nIs he going to give a speech tomorrow in Bahrain a which is a very very close ally of Saudi Arabia and according to embargo road a bit of that speech he is going to basically say that if you're the U.S questions in any way our relationship with Saudi Arabia but we're going to create a very dangerous political vacuum in the middle east\nAnd that Russia will sweep and instill that vacuum I think that you know one completely overstate\nRussia's a power to be able to be an ally anything like the U.S has been in the middle east and seems to be in the exact conformity with the kind of throw a status quo policies toward Saudi Arabia that the U.S has\nEmbraced in democratic and Republican administrations for decades so again if if you thought for a moment that the crush hokey killing the subsequent cover up a and everything else that's been abhorrent about the Saudi reaction to this is going to prompt a major ...\nWe think of this alliance in Washington I think Madison is a comments suggest otherwise that to you know we're not just going to hype or over hype or mistake the jobs impact about real relationship\nUh we are actually going to be actively sort of talk up um what would happen if we dared question this and and we were mad as really seems to be implying a we'd be leaving a very very dangerous situation if we really thought this relationship I I'm an ear to ear these remarks but they don't bode well as to a a possible sort of shift in policy here\nSo let me make sure I've got a I've got the he said he said correct so short the a\nMad as has been viewed as maybe on the outs certainly in some conflict will jumbled and I think we have this mythology that there's well there's a good Trump people that will save us I that's not how I see the world I don't see a lot of facts of merit up but you know somebody's while at a post a lot of them is a bad to the to to that\nA ... effect and and what you're saying is that Madison his comments were instead just saying the same old line of no no we need the Saudis because we need a bowl work in the middle east\nYeah and I would say you know um I I agree with you that trying to draw some sort of line separating out the like rational good Trump\nFigures and the unhinged bad ones is a little bit of a complicated task what I Would say and then maybe not one worth even engaging in what it is I think something we can see pretty clearly is a difference in the caliber\nOf person who was brought into the administration early on when I think uh yeah I mean Trump's ah I'm based instincts were still pretty clear to a lot of people but he hadn't done a whole lot of\nSpecific harm in office yet and I don't think you would get people like mad as\nTillerson Nikki Haley now I think those are people who are willing to take a bet on their careers um and that's probably why they some of them have moved on to other things I was listening to Nikki Haley at the U.N Security council\nOr on Wednesday when they were hearing testimony about genocide and the andme are I mean she was giving these\nQuotes from John Adams about pesky facts and things like that and I said this is you when you're not going to find a new hire to the role of UN ambassador who no matter what the issue is going to go in front of the world and talk about how much\nThe U.S values facts I mean any replacement to her at this point is not going to be in her model and so I think the same is true of mad at us\nEven if it's a stretch to say that you know perhaps he's one of the good ones but uh yeah I I Do think you are a lot of that has a talent that came in a early on you you're just going to get different people now who who probably are okay\nWith a short term stint in this administration and care less about\nRejoining I don't know serious foreign policy circles after their time in in in the White House\nAnd what do you think we we only got about forty seconds left but what do you think should happen ... media news ... news dot com how should the United states the reacting to Saudi Arabia is a is mad as wrong\nOr is the administration wrong that that that alliances important should we withdraw from the middle east because we've only made things worse or is constructive engagement given are still need for oil or something we should be engaged in what do you think or if you just want to quote someone else feel for doing that\nWell the oil is five percent of our imports that not giant and a Saudi Arabia is a huge purchase of her purse a producer of our military arms but overall you know engagement\nWith that country is still relatively low tide compared with others and I would say you can still is constructed engagement but not just be willing to do anything for your ally and let's see if those are those military trade as leverage on our side or the other way around\nMubarak is thanks so much we\nHave a good weekend [noise] worry me right back it's not the weekend yet

I had a middle school and my younger brother and my younger brother right now uh one of his job he works too but one of his jobs is\nRunning video for a successful local artist uh and now I Do a bunch of stuff in media helps train people to do stuff as well as covers stuff that's helping out covering local stuff\nWell I think it's as that's why I think it's it's actually at the media diversity success story um but you see in public educational government access television because you know training grounds for people who want to do creative things they may not be in New York City or Los Angeles I'm the baby in small towns all across America\nOr what they have a desire to be able to communicate with others to to use the skills to be able to build skills on medication to build a career so that when you're talking about but you media experience that happens at a\nPublic school or perhaps in a community setting after school of public access center has a lot of impact on on the creative community in in in many many states across the country and actually we she just her case after case of people who got their start in\nCommunity access media either on the the public radio side or the commercial television side\nUm and it's actually one of the success stories or media system that we actually have the ability to be able to have people in small towns across the country and maybe and media markets that are\nLarger than that but they actually may not have power they may not have the ... the inside track to be able to get into a she if she BS or an NBC Universal\n[noise] the systems actually allows\nIt is right drink a lot a lot of coverage they allowed access not only to information but also to the to the means of communication to learning those means what is happening right now what the FCC tried to do right now as I understand that try to change the rules\nThat a lot of this stuff is funded it almost entirely funded by cable franchise fees and the cable companies have been lobbying to change that and are having a little more success now please explain\nWell what's happening right now is the FCC is trying to ... to find a balance between local communities and an industry\nBy tipping the scales toward toward industry and specific uh they're trying to make sure that you just get breaks or the use of public property to be able to make money the cable ... the local communities give out\nOr is it kicked in the balance so that the public property that that a a cable company has to use to be able to get to your home um\nAnd they don't own all that land they need to get an ease meant to uh or or some other permission to be able to run all that cable they're not just going over the airwaves like\nThey actually need to get a license to be able to get to your home or to get to your apartment building\nUm and the humidity owns the property to be able to go through the the entire community itself rights or the public rights away are are controlled by local communities\nOne of the things that was enshrined in the Nineteen eighty four cable act was a that local franchise fee and that local support could be a could be gotten by local communities from the cable industry to be able to make money\nBy having cable channels go to your home\nNow what's happening right now as the FCC is trying to tip the balance and say and say\nThat you know a cable company is not making enough money to state that again for your job the cable company it's not making enough money um how\nNot a real time I really I I I I very out in fact I've been starting to send money a little bit each month to the cable company 'cause I'm worried about a poll late night that caught my cable bill it's expensive it's a lot more expensive than my community immediate memberships that I'm ... and\nAnd I think you know because we give you one example\nYou know how we got I committed to make sure I Want to make sure the most important stuff gets out\nOf the most important thing to know is that what she is specifically looking to\nChange the change the rules are by which we define what a franchise fee is and what other kind of support for community media is and it it will in danger um the ability for local communities actually have these channels the things that were fearful of in the rulemaking that's going to be happening or this at this all\nIs that you have to actually redefine what's support is allowed and we actually will see these channels disappear it's it's a it's a terrible thing\nRight and so so you have these yeah these community outlets only the only outlets that actually gives the acts of the media that's not controlled by Mark Zuckerberg or by you know media oligarch and people have a chance to use them that is part of the deal\nFor them using a public right away and they're trying to change it so that instead of getting money they can say well we'll let you use the channel and then we're going to charge you for the channel and they wouldn't be able to for then they go out and this is when the rulemaking happening when people find out more we got five second\nRule making happening this fall you can do it

voters but I think they're actually let something\nLike the economy and I've never heard anyone compare unregulated capitalism to an anomaly game\nKeep going is that what is that not appropriate I think\nIs appropriate the makers of the game I it was as I recall it was a victim monopoly game was borrowed from another game that was a ... that it bore vying landlord ing but it was actually supposed to do the opposite of glorifying landlord ing\nBut what's the particular rather than me making that connection what's the particular connection you're wanting to make or at least investigate\nThe outcome yeah somebody wins everybody else is out of the game yeah yeah thank you Dana I don't I I I think you understand the economy's old anybody else does\nYeah All right I'm Sorry that I think you\nHave a good weekend [noise] Robyn civil information for political organizing from Kingston, Washington speak your piece\n[noise] yeah I mean if you want me to ask you a question right away I can do that but I just want to introduce the audience again to the concept of civil information which is something I came up with a Nineteen excuse me two thousand and two\nIn Reno and it's a different tool in the bag of activism we understand civil disobedience civil resistance which both sort of negative or reactionary civil information he has got to do it\nUm your civic duty as a citizen and then civil behavior and how we deal with people and and connect with them and the information in part is that you collect your own information not from ... media but your own way\nShare it with others and then you talk shared grow organizer locally and then from that we have political power trickling up we're constantly to do it yourself program and it's completely opposite of the big event only activism which is the breeding ground of\nA sixties seventies activism and also the residual effects of it going on right now with those who organized so the question that I Would have to you have to ask you a Jefferson is simple which would you prefer\nOkay would you prefer one million person march\nOr would you prefer a million one person marchers that's my question that you can answer all take it off the air and then they are the major point of view is\nAs soon as the left stopped arguing with fools those people who have ... personalities those people who are the Limbaugh Fox News Trump Tea Party I'm a ... it did\nUnderstood you just stop\nArguing those and then we just take our time to have communications with sixty to sixty five percent of the people who are actually a progressive and thoughtful and who has evidence shapes their opinion as soon as we start\nOur you share backs with people who do already persuaded by facts you have a question about whether you're whether you're wasting your time uh I I tend to think that there are more persuadable people than more than most book ... seem to think\nYou are but I think it takes a while and I think that takes a yeah he takes a while to respond also to your thought about uh\nDo that on civil information and gets a new term to me so I'm I I don't know that I'll respond athlete but I Will go a little bit further at least in this respect\nThat much of modern activists culture was built in the industrial age or the uh Mario savvy a line of ... well after that saying it's all you gotta throw your body out of the gears the machine the idea of the industrial machine is I think it was moving and the workers' strike is the thing that could lock it\nIn an information age is not the means of production that are at ... at risk or being purchased it as a means of communication is the most powerful companies now more powerful than the trust so hundred years ago the most powerful companies now are Google Facebook Amazon and apple and Microsoft should be included as a fifth\nTheir information companies they control the means of information\nActivism that is only physical there's not also informational that doesn't understand that we are engaged in a conversation that needs to be made a little bit better rather than a lot worse I think it's misunderstanding both a big and the small picture so at least agree with ... in ... it with you in that respect\nOr Montgomery, Alabama Norma go ahead\nI guess I'm One of the things that I wanted people to be aware of when they go to vote you need to be thinking about who is going to be the governor and the state\nBecause as these groups like heritage corporation alec the federalist society may have been putting their people into offices from every level from your city council on up\n[noise] so mostly weekends [noise] hope you have plans\nAnd maybe your plans include democracy\n[noise] got a question a moment ago about whether or not the president to be indicted they were thinking in terms of\nThe uh the the ... bombing that the answer that question is almost certainly know that crying fire in a crowded theater\nIs still is a hard it's hard to prove causation\nSo then if somebody gets trampled that it is the fault in a given person who calls ... who caused fires it's their fault that somebody gets injured but this was not even that even if you could prove that this was even further removed from that so I'm not going I don't want to go that far but it does raise another question is can the president be indicted at all\nThere is a major debate to that question and if one agrees with Oliver Wendell Holmes who says what a judge will do is all I mean by law\nThen you understand that the answer to the question of whether or not the president can be invited can be indicted is relatively similar to the question of\nShould Brett Kavanaugh beyond the Supreme Court\nBecause that question might well get to the Supreme Court\nAnd Newt Gingrich said just this week with a yesterday\nThat well if there's a subpoena for Trump's tack record tax records\nThen we'll find out\nIf the Kavanaugh fight was worth it\nCharles you got something to say about Fox News from ... Florida it might be ...\nTo ... go ahead\nAnd of course that's where some of the mill Spencer where was\nGod it right I'm not my thing is the um basically I don't want us to go out\nAnd what I mean by that is because as a Democrat of and this one and the leadership um we have been taken advantage of opportunities that they were on the vice president\nFor them it's just the other day when they were when he when he burning out there are a Muslim and and I'm the kind of man or middle Easterners\nThan a ... ram it and all that and then one thing and I'm like well we're going to want\nSchumer or close to be coming on and say well if they are I think you should go get them right now you know the answer to an American before he was dinner\nI'm ... I ... I got to answer your question\nRelates to suddenly that Tom says also the generally put too much agency we too too much of our own us on elected officials to control what's happening in the media\nWhen with the exception of the president\nMost elected officials have relatively little purchase with what ends up\nOn TV and the radio and Internet feeds\nAnd so anytime I hear so I Wish the Democrats would just say blank\nAlmost ... almost every time I can find a Democrat who did say that very thing but they say that a lot of people\nAre they tweeted it to a few thousand people or got retweeted some tens of thousands of people but not to millions and millions repeated times\nThe other though is you raise a more specific questions why didn't in this instance is it OK well put up or shut up ... we think your bluff and\nWe don't think they're Muslims there if you think that there are terrorists they're Muslims are terrorists those are different things\nBut if you think they're criminals there go investigate part of the challenges that feeds the story\nThat if the if Trump gets to call the tune the bully pulpit of today is not the bully pulpit to talk all the time to be the first mover to garner the attention of the electronic hordes\nAnd we feed into it he says oh we we were spot everything he says sometimes we've got to sometimes we shouldn't\nAnd that's a question of judgment it's all going to be a hard decision to make those are my two answers to your good question I appreciate the Charles a mark the uh uh about the Supreme Court you're going to just about our last caller am I going to get somebody else go ahead\nYeah about the Supreme Court you know what are we going to hold the Supreme Court accountable for basically a be able to buy a politician Bush having a party that sold out the country and basically runs on hate and fear because it has nothing for the American people\nI appreciate it mark and let me just say this when are we going to hold springboard accountable hell no I think there is going to be a more robust conversation around either expanding and don't say packing court already got packed got backed by the Republicans over the last ten years or less twenty\nI think there will be a more robust conversation about expanding the court or adding term limits to the court about saying yeah lifetime appointment how about twelve years there's still a pretty well shielded and with no chance for reelection so really all you're doing is trying to manifest your judgment to make it a little bit less political in that regard at least\nI think there will be a more robust discussion but it's one of the reasons why Nancy mclane wrote her book democracy and change\nIs it in fact the big move has been by John seek out home by James who can't about Koch brothers for not years or decades but more than a century\nIs to shackled democracy is to make sure that the will of the people is limited by strictures by the Supreme Court it has been only brief periods more in court for instance\nWhen the Supreme which happened to coincide with a lot of the dawn of the modern media age and it got really famous but it's only been brief periods where progressive change has happened because of courts\nProgressive change usually happens because of bigger pools of people not smaller rooms but big rooms people engaging and operating and activating more and this is why I say that you're priceless\nThat you are the coalition of the ... irrational\nThe good people doing good things for no good reason\nWhat do we learn today we talked

message themselves I take ownership of this tell us about what happened today and some of the significant developments that you've been following\nWell you know we got a clue in the morning or stick around ten am ah got me now that the attorney general it cancelled his trip to\n... originally going to Louisville, Kentucky that attack opioids and that was the first kind of clue that maybe they're getting somewhere um because at that point\nSet our law enforcement knew they had their man we didn't know yet um but they they knew that uh that they had a good\nA good Trade Center and and they knew that the attorney general want to be in Washington state you're in the uh get him so that they could announced this um he faces up to access is up to forty eight years\nUm he will be arraigned on a on Monday alive as additional appeared Monday at the end of the southern district of Florida this case ultimately will end up in the southern district of New York however um you know legally as to get before a magistrate judge in a certain amount of time so his first appearance is going to be in South Florida um\nAnd as you saw in the news conference says a lot of a lot of evidence that we're getting more frankly because today\nYou know who they were more discovered and they're still on out there that the FBI hasn't officially confirmed yet but I think probably they will before long and that's one in the San Francisco bay area Burlingame, California\nWhich is just south of San Francisco and south San Francisco and that was to a Tom ... who is the California billionaire he's been calling for the impeachment of Donald Trump and I was told that\nTax intercepted a postal facilities in Burlingame address dire but the FBI has an officially confirmed yet that it that it is one of the ... but I have a feeling that that probably will happen\nCan can I say I want to jump in just really quickly 'cause you mentioned in passing that the suspect could face up to forty eight years in prison he's in his fifties already so you know if convicted on all of those counts he would spend the rest of his life in jail that being said\nI I'm just a little bit surprised that you send bombs to former presidents of the United states if not more that is not more that's that's odd to me why why could there'll be more charges tacked on still\nThink that there could be more charges stacked tacked on still I think that you know this uh these charges were were put together pretty quickly and I think the prosecutor certainly have the uh the authority to to check on more charges if they find a way to this is\nThis is what they've got right now and they probably feel that if they got all this done that that'd be that'd be life for him but yeah I think you're right I think that uh that\nThere might be some in the department of justice or looking at at ways will is there it's a way we could get stronger punishment [noise] um and you also talked a bit about how they caught him um you know these are the first I think as I understood it from director re during the department of justice um during the new star say these\nAre the first couple of packages that actually made it down to Quantico even in the first couple\nThey were able to to catch him it was you know I think that there was a Maxine Waters and maybe the President Obama on the packages that made it to go yesterday and by the by today they had already found a late fingerprint on I'm\nOn the on the low budget address to Maxine Waters here in Washington I don't think it was a Los Angeles or someone here in Washington and inside it on a device some type of DNA they didn't really say skin or whatever it was alive or something they also\nSo they shut down below that matched track so so it was pretty quick work from the FBI and from that you know world famous political FBI loud turn that around pretty fast\nJake just one more question for me and thank you again for joining the ... he's been chasing down all these leads but why and I should know this but why would the case eventually end up in the southern district of New York is that because that's where some of these bombs were eventually center why is that the place where this will be adjudicated\nI think because of the SPN SBN why one on it because of the the packages were sent to CNN strict um those those broke laws in in New York but you know we could see other us journeys office try to jump at it um but\nYou know Hillary former Secretary Clinton it was on to her house in ... there's a couple of different interests as well yeah so they're not up all\nDifferent New York packages that gives us the and watch them authority um and it must be that the department of justice decided that's where they want it to give it you know the aggressive prosecutors there are pretty famous you know\nJake are you hearing anything about the possibility of accomplices and the reason I asked that is by all accounts from what we know so far this guy was not in a loser he'd been kicked out of his house by his parents in his fifties he was living in a van I mean if you're a guy living in a van\nBeing able to build bombs and find addresses for people I mean it's possible and conceivably did it completely all by himself\nBut some people are wondering is there is there a chance that he had help from someone or someone knew he would what he was up to giving him some space is there any update on that whatsoever or is it just Caesar and psych right now\nWell it's just him in the sense that that's what they have but I think you're right in the sense that started ... ... are very much uh looking to see if there's any one given him any you know she has any accomplices or any time and it showed that threat is certainly not\nTied up yet um we don't we don't have any news just to bring that their accomplices we just know that they are very much looking at that possibility\nJacobson Fox News producer for the department of justice that gift for

President Trump earlier decrying political violence saying it's part of his goals president to help stop and now we can never take root\nJoining the conversation here with us is Chris ... front of the program Fox News politics editor and author of the new book every man a king crushed good to have you good to be with you my friend\nAll right so I Want to start by playing you a soundbite from an exchange on our air earlier today on Shepard Smith show Shepard Smith and Chris Wallace getting into the very discussion that Marie and I have been engaged in a little bit over the last two days a lot of people are debating\nThis issue this was from Fox News channel ... thirty one earlier today take a listen\nAnd the president says we need to unify will that some of that begins with the rhetoric does not well it would certainly be good but I think at separate and apart from the actions of this guy a this was a twisted person there are three hundred million Americans and they may be part of the fierce political debate in the country but they don't put explosive devices and\nUh but when you have this rather have the money but when you talk like this the ... the concern is that that one crazy one might then get empowered we don't know what happened in this case\nBut overall current you know what happened I mean I don't know if he goes all the President Trump aides and so I'm going to go targeted\nWe don't know any of that kind of fun but what difference does it make job in fact the fact that they're out or is it on the west that it's a twisted individual and the whole President Trump responsible I told him that that's clear implication that would work either this is not now let's be fair Chris I'm afraid I shop must be fair\nSo a disagreement about rhetoric herring balance right yeah no that was I think of a pretty good and caps elation of how the conversation we're having the IRA I didn't know you were on hello\nHi Hi current events in higher\nWinds so I didn't know how to do I know we're we're fly together out here at Hoover Institution at Stanford but a ...\nA it is it is very fancy it's very exciting but Chris I'm not asking you to pick sides among our beloved colleagues are between our beloved colleagues I'm just wondering if you can comment on that type of exchange and the arguments that we're hearing on both sides of that question well\nLook I'm there is no both things can be true I I think that I didn't hear the the entirety of their conversation but I think that both things can be true in the sense that um it's obvious that the disgusting rhetoric that dominates our political discussion\nOr that has you know it's funny we used to dabble in this stuff\nAh lightly question each other's motives and patriotism and sniff around a little bit the edges of these things and play with it and the electric fence of social program\nPoll politicians back you couldn't do too much or you'd get in trouble you couldn't be too big of a demagogue you couldn't lie too much you couldn't really call your opponent is vile scum\nBecause people wouldn't go for it but now they realize that if your if your election or re election is conditioned on just the ... the vigorous support of a third of the people who are either gullible enough or cynical enough to go along with you if you can really have\nThirty or forty percent of the country that is white hot for you either through connive inch or ignorance have you can do that\nIf that's enough then you don't ever have to worry about being doing the right stuff really and there isn't a sanctioned there isn't a political sanction for doing the wrong stuff now what we've seen over time\nWhether it's the shooting at the congressional baseball practice\nOr whether it's a attacking Nancy ... craze mob attacking Nancy Pelosi when she is campaigning in Florida\nA Mitch McConnell can't have a a pulled pork sandwich and peace um or whether it is in fact these fake bombs we see the trend right this hot rhetoric does have consequences\nI think what the disagreement that shepherd and Chris we're having\nWas in the context of\nDon't say that this is Donald Trump's Donald Trump didn't make this guy do this ultimately this person is responsible for his behavior but I think we can hold both of those ideas in our head at the same time people are responsible they're culpable for their own conduct but I think we are coming to a point where both sides thank God or maybe I should say pray God or ready to admit\nThat the way that we talk to each other as having negative consequences that go beyond just living in a toxic space\nChris I that was better than I could have done that with that and I'm grateful when you're on the show but that they can get really my take on that but I you just said both sides are saying we should talk talking to a better way to each other\nRight I'm not sure I Would say that about the premise that based on what he he when someone writes on a teleprompter we should be nicer to each other and then he gets asked a question are you going to tone down their rhetoric and he said I might Tony now everyone's been really unfair to me lock him up for that George

Institution\nAnd guy and I talked about this a little bit yesterday our friend Megan Kelly who now is not returning to her nine am eastern hour on the today show NBC has said that she still unemployed NBC and I think they're trying to figure out what comes next\nAnd the comment you just heard what was the discussion that she had on her show\nThat got criticized by a lot of people she then apologized on air for that said she had learned more about the history of blackface she did a very lengthy apology which which we played part of yesterday\nAnd now it seems like some at NBC are using this controversy as an excuse to\nFire her or to cancel her show when guys we've talked about they wanted\nTo get rid of her I think for a while to show wasn't doing as well as they hoped I think they put her in a position that was designed not to be perfect for her I think a lot of that's on NBC but\nWhat I don't like it they're like they're having a discussion here about a very sensitive issue she expressed some thoughts in and later then apologized for them I don't like them using\nThis controversy as an excuse to do something I think they wanted to do regardless because it it's not fair to her so that racialized as it\nWhich is and I think I agree with her comments either I'm staying\nOn neither does she like right right so she has backed away from them I think I Would not have said it this way I think there's some discussion on Twitter about like okay is there a difference between black space in the sense of a minstrel show versus someone dressing up as their favorite star\nWho happens to be black for Halloween um and and toward the cultural sensitivity to play there and they were having this discussion on NBC's air\nAnd she came out later and said look I did not\nFully appreciate the history of blackface and I should have approached this way that I did\nBut the fact that they ran multiple segments across multiple NBC platforms attacking her I mean they were just the number one day she was their teammates so to speak yeah they were piling on and punching her while she was down\nAnd I think a lot has to do with some resentment that she came in with so much money and she may have passed over other people who have been there longer but also she came from Fox\nAnd there's people that are networks who just\nDon't believe that you should have a life after Fox if you leave Fox and I know it was better stay then it's not it's just I just don't think this is she's not being treated fairly even though I don't think that yeah handled this perfectly as she has admitted\nAnd its humans do right right I I agree I think they wanted to get rid of her anyway and this is not great that will take a break we'll be back for our two right after that [noise]\n\nHey

people don't like the idea that something might be taken away they get scared of a change of the status quo but there have been\nThe you know the mandates gone they're cheaper plans that are short term planning now available that people like in her signing up or what do you think of the politics of Obamacare and how Obamacare looks as a policy today versus even a few years ago yeah I think that there\nWere finally seeing in the polling generally on Obamacare and I think people's opinions of it is that the the overall popularity of the law\nFinally the the components are catching up with it used to be the case if you ask people about Obamacare you know do you like these various features the fact that insurers cannot discriminate against\nPeople with preexisting conditions do you like the fact that kids can stay on their parents' plan up to age twenty five you like all these different components people would say yes yes yes we liked them and then you get to do you like Obamacare and they'd say no no I don't like Obamacare and and I think what we're seeing now is because Democrats have done a relatively good job\nOf focusing on those popular components people are beginning to see Obama Care not as this big monstrosity but as these component pieces and I think you're starting to see some of that Democrats in this campaign that was an article in the wall Street Journal a couple of weeks ago that talked about how many campaign ads from Democrats have\nFeatured healthcare and it featured Obamacare in particular something like three hundred thousand between the middle of September and then in the middle of October yes a three hundred thousand impressions and and I think what that does is it puts Republicans on defense in part because the Republicans have taken so many votes to repeal Obamacare\nThe positioning of the Republican Party on health care is very interesting I think they were chastened by what happened in twenty Seventeen and so\nWhen did they learn from that that what was the lesson they took away I why should they have\nTo say well I think the lesson they should've taken away was how difficult it is to come to a consensus position even amongst conservatives on health care reform\nIs a tendency to think well conservatives think alike on this but they don't I mean there were all of these pitfalls there's a reason why conservatives were not able to get something done on Obamacare for salon where they weren't able to get things done on health care reform for so long\nAnd so coming into it it was a very very challenging endeavor already and I think what they learned is just how divided Republicans are on health care and and I I just think that's something that they really underestimated\nAnd there I think collectively during their loans now for a future fight over the direction that Democrats are headed which a single parent\nAnd that frankly is a much more fruitful place for Republicans because that's Democrats go left as they think about medic you look in Medicare for all each of the two thousand four hundred Democrats running for president in twenty twenty has already endorsed Medicare for all\nAnd and that is a position that I think is going to be difficult to defend because Medicare for all and single payer very interesting people kind of like the idea when you initially tell them about it but as you informed them of what the impacts will be of that policy disruption and ... so\nYou know I think it's going to be interesting because the Democratic campaign for twenty twenties gonna start November seventh and it's already it's already started right so you're going to see people being there's a tendency to push leftward is is there is on the Republican side we push right where the Republican primary\nIs going to be very difficult to see any other ah outcome than the Democratic nominee having to endure some kind of single payer proposal I just think in a general election that's a very difficult position to a spouse\nAnd interestingly Democrats poll are pulling right now way ahead of Republicans on who you trust to deal with health care yeah and one of the things I said during the repeal and replace debating twenty Seventeen wise it seemed like Republicans in Congress and convince themselves that they keep all the stuff people like\nYou can get rid of this stuff we don't like and bring costs down and ensure more people all at the same time\nAnd it didn't seem like there was any way from a policy perspective to do all of those things at once you have to make decisions about what's more important and as you said Republicans were divided on which decisions\nTo make yeah and I think radio the other point that you make which is a good one is that\nAh when you've taken that many votes to repeal the whole law right it's it's difficult political you see how it can be weaponized against you might have seen that in this campaign I mean Missouri's a perfect example of this where Claire McCaskill and Josh Hawley the Democrat and Republican respectively in the U.S Senate race\nHas basically been going back and forth on this issue for the last two months yeah and and it is it has now become a battle of you know who's going to do a better job of defending preexisting conditions and and this is a difficult set of of terrain for Republicans to be\nFighting well especially because what the Democrats have done it Obamacare is they shifted from the name of the law which was the ... CARE Act right and the affordability peace was not working out they shifted their focus to pre existing conditions and more people insured which are covered which was not\nThe main thrust of the major U.S we're going to bring down costs would you didn't have those but it was called the Affordable CARE Act and so what we saw was between twenty Thirteen implementation and twenty Seventeen the average premium on the federal exchange\nThe costs doubled in raised by a hundred and five percent CNN is just put out data not that long ago that for the first time benchmark plans are going to ever so slightly come down the prices are gonna come down a little bit why\nWell you know the the argument that you'll hear from the administration and I think there's some truth to this is that they've actually there in the position of implementing the law they've actually made some policy changes that are helping the dynamics that are underlying the law and they'll know fundamentally\nUh the the question becomes if this really sustainable right there are some of the changes that this administration and they've made is it sustainable in terms of seeing long run premium growth not being a significant as what's been passed I I don't know the answer to that except to say that\nUm there are still some fundamental concerns I have about how Obamacare as is architecture if you will\nAnd I don't think those are going away regardless of how this administration implements the law so while we're seeing some relief on premiums for twenty Nineteen that's absolutely true\nI don't know if that trend is sustainable into twenty twenty and beyond me fundamentally just the Detroit a little bit on health care I mean look I think that the Affordable CARE Act was properly named in the sense that\nAffordability is still a key struggle we have in our health care system\nWe still have not addressed the fundamental drivers of why health care costs more year over year correct and unless we do that we're going to be fighting this fight for the next three decades four decade I mean who knows right because if you look at a chart I can show you a chart that compares the growth of health care prices to prices on everything else in the economy\nAnd the gap between the two is growing and has grown\nAnd and yes from year to year it drifts in and out but the fact that people look at their health care bills every year and this I don't get why this is getting more expensive keeps the salient issue\nAnd for our listeners why does it keep getting market I mean what is that there's a lot of reasons but\nWhite says ... for ... for well you're so so there's a couple of things I went to one is a we have the most innovative healthcare system in the world and an innovative technology costs a lot of money especially here in Silicon valley and pushing new cures new ... new new technologies new devices\nThese all costs money are India's expensive we are on the cutting edge of that and therefore our system is more expensive\nBut we also have much higher utilization than other countries do of health care\nBecause we're not aware of the cost of the health care workers you know we know how much we pay in a copayment aggressions\nBut you don't you get these bills from the insurance company or you get these statements that say here's the care you've got his you don't know what it means I don't know what a customer is separated from the cost it we we have this this intermediate we have desegregation of the end consumer of health care\nFrom the cost of health care it's very dangerous and so as a result what do you see are one primary example is you see a bunch of people showing up at the ER\nTo get basic care right even if they have coverage people said oh with Obamacare now people won't show up in the ER or more people are showing up in the ER now why because they think oh I've got coverage I can go to the ER ER is the last place you want to go if you've got something that can be treated relatively easy and we got to figure out a way\nTo push care into a lower lower cost higher quality setting than the ER so I mean basically utilization and innovation or two things I\nWho are waiting for surgery at each port\n... is bringing services to countries that would otherwise not be as ... as the\nPeople that need help he realized that they have no way of

Abbas Milani is a research fellow and co director of the Iran democracy project here at the Hoover Institution he's also the need and Christina\n... director Iranian studies at Stanford has expertise to us Iranian relations Iranian cultural political and security issues is the author of numerous books you can check them out and get them all on line thank you so much for joining us tonight my pleasure\nSo we had lunch with you earlier this week and had a fascinating conversation about us Iranian relations like we have to put this on the air yet we can't just confined ... exactly and what's happening inside Iran right now so there's so many questions we we did at you and good luck to ask you here I Want to start with\nUs Iranian relations because you've lived here for a number of years you're so focused on this issue how do you evaluate where that stands right now and and where are you hopeful that might go\nSee when we talk about us around relation and so you always have to separate the people of Iran's relations with the people of the United states and the government of the United states and Iranian regime\nAnd even within the regime in Iran there's at least two different voices some who want to really improved relations and some like the old powerful Mr harmony the Supreme leader\nWho is adamant that he does not want to normalize relations with the United states has a kind of a in bread and very a developed animosity towards the United states that goes way beyond his days as the lead to\nOf the things that you said when we were eating together was and this is an important distinction I think for Americans you said the Iranian people\nAre so different from the regime the regime is extremely anti American as we know at a lot of it oh much of the regime is you know going to the very top as you said but you said large swaths of the Iranian people are actually quite positively disposed towards the United states can you talk about\nWhy that is and why that distinction matters\nBut first of all the while it is very clear that the majority of the run and people dislike this regime immensely they are are\nAware that the United states has been for the last thirty five years and the only main country that has stood up to this regime at different times to different degrees so\nThe force that can help me overthrow this people or as at least standing up to these people has gotten a lot of credit in the minds of the Iranian people there's a lot of anecdotal evidence there some polling\nThat shows this uh the paradox is that you have one of the most anti American regimes and if I wanted the most pro American\nPeople and even within the regime the number of people within the regime the top echelons of the regime to send their children here to get educated that is absolutely remarkable [noise] talk\nA little bit about that last uh ... you mentioned about people from Iran coming to the United states to study\nHow have people that people tides been impacted by the Trump administration's ban the travel ban and also just on the general rhetoric withdrawing from the nuclear deal sort of the whole package that impacted those kinds of type\nI think the ban has had some very personal uh affect some people haven't been able to bring their families here the parents here I I Know myself a couple of cases were grandparents couldn't come to go to the children's graduation\nThey're sick people who have a very hard time getting a visa a\n... at the same time that rhetoric that Mr Trump has used against the regime has found them some popularity in Iraq I think it would be wrong to say that this tough talk has no popular in Iran people in Iran who hate this regime and are willing to pay any price\nSay maybe the only person that can get to these people is someone who talks this rhetoric but\nThe sanctions are impacting people's lives are are making life or steamed difficult for the majority of the Iranian people and that's why I think that they will become counterproductive ah because I think the people who are going to be able to change in Iran\nOr the people of Iraq that were ...\nRegime change in Iran cannot be masterminded by the United states it cannot be micro managed with Saudi Arabia has to be done by the people of Iran and they want to make this change and the more they feel like this is being engineered from outside\nHi I'm In London ... when I needed to find your care for my mom I really struggled to find the right fit and found an advisor and been through that before\nThat's why I

O. J. a very busy day at the Justice Department today you heard some of the soundbites Jake you know one thing that I was struck by watching that press conference\nWas the choice that was clearly made by the administration the very top levels\nThis was not going to be farmed out to lower level officials doing a briefing this was the attorney general and the FBI Director wanting to send a very forceful message themselves I take ownership of this tell us about what happened today and some of the significant developments that you've been following\nWell you know we got a clue in the morning and I think around ten am or got me now that the attorney general it cancelled his trip to\n... originally going to move or Kentucky that talk opioids and that was the first kind of clue that maybe they're getting somewhere um because at that point\nSet our law enforcement knew they had their man we didn't know yet um but they they knew that uh that they had a good a good Trade Center in and they knew that the attorney general would want to be in Washington state did you get him so that they could announced this um he faces up to access is up to forty eight years\nUm he will be arraigned on a on Monday alive as additional appeared on Monday to go to the southern district of Florida this case ultimately will end up in the southern district of New York however um you know legally as to get before a magistrate judge in a certain amount of time so his first appearance is going to be in South Florida um\nAnd as you saw in the news conferences a lot of a lot of evidence and we're getting more frankly because today\nYou know who they were more discovered and they're still going on out there that the FBI hasn't officially confirmed yet but I think probably they will before long and that's one in the San Francisco bay area Burlingame, California\nWhich is just south of San Francisco and south San Francisco and that was to a Tom ... who is the California billionaire he's been calling for the impeachment of of Donald Trump that I was told that\nProtects intercepted a postal facilities in Burlingame address desire but the FBI has an officially confirmed yet that it that it is one of the ... but I have a feeling that that probably will happen\nJon can I say I want to jump in just really quickly 'cause you mentioned in passing that the suspect could face up to forty eight years in prison he's in his fifties already so you know if convicted on all of those counts he would spend the rest of his life in jail that being said\nI'm just a little bit surprised that you said bombs to former presidents of the United states not more that is not more that's that's odd to me why why could there'll be more charges tacked on still I think\nThat there could be more charges stacked tacked on still I think that you know this these charges were were put together pretty quickly and I think the prosecutors certainly have the uh the authority to to check on more charges if they find a way to this is\nThis is what they've got right now and they probably feel that if they got all this done that that'd be that'd be life for him but yeah I think you're right I think that uh that\nThere might be some in the department of justice or looking at at ways will is there it's a way we could get stronger punishment [noise] um and you also talked a bit about how they caught him um\nYou know these are the first I think as I understood it from director re during the department of justice um during the news coverage say these are the first couple of packages that actually made it down the Quantico even in the first couple\nThey were able to to catch him it was you know I think that there was a Maxine Waters and maybe the President Obama on the packages that made it to go yesterday and by the by today they had already found a late fingerprint on I'm\nOn the on the low budget address to Maxine Waters here in Washington I don't think it was a Los Angeles or someone you're Washington\nAnd inside it on a device some type of DNA they didn't really say is skin or whatever it was saliva or something they also found inside the envelope that matched ... so\nSo it was pretty quick work from the FBI and from that you know world famous political FBI loud turn that around pretty fast\nJake just one more question for me and thank you again for joining the ... he's been chasing down all these leads but why and I should know this but why would the case eventually end up in the southern district of New York is that because that's where some of these bombs were eventually center why is that the place where this will be adjudicated\nI think because the SPN SBN why one on it because of the the packages were sent to CNN [noise] um those those broke laws in in New York but you know we could see other us attorney's office try to jump at it um but\nYou know Hillary former Secretary Clinton was sent to her house in ... as a couple of different or us as well yeah so there's a couple of\nDifferent New York packages that gives us the NY some authority um and it must be that the department of justice decided that's where they want it to give it to that you know the aggressive prosecutors there are a pretty famous you know\nJake are you hearing anything about the possibility of accomplices and the reason I ask that is\nBy all accounts from what we know so far this guy was a not in a loser even kicked out of his house by his parents in his fifties he's living in a van I mean if you're a guy living in a van\nBeing able to\nBuild bombs and find addresses for people I mean it's possible and conceivably didn't completely all by himself but some people are wondering is there is there a chance that he had help from someone or someone knew what he was up to giving him some space is there any update on that whatsoever is it just\nCaesar in psych right now\nWell it's just him in the sense that that's what they have but I think you're right in the sense that ...\nGot skaters are very much uh looking to see if there's anyone giving him any you know if he has any accomplices of any kind and it said that threat is certainly not tied up yet um we don't we don't have any news to to bring that their accomplices we just know that they are very much looking at that possibility\nJacobson Fox News producer for the department of justice that gift

President Trump earlier decrying political violence saying it's part of his goals president to help stop it now it can never take root\nJoining the conversation here with us is Chris ... front of the program Fox News politics editor and author of the new book every man a king crushed good to have you good to be with you my friend\nAll right so I Want to start by playing you a soundbite from an exchange on our air earlier today on Shepard Smith show Shepard Smith and Chris Wallace getting into the very discussion that Marie and I had been engaged in a little bit over the last two days a lot of people are debating\nThis issue this was from Fox News channel ... thirty one earlier today take a listen\nAnd the president says we need to unify will that some of that begins with the rhetoric does not well it would certainly be good but I think a separate and apart from the actions of this guy a this was a twisted person there are three hundred million Americans and they may be part of the fierce political debate in the country but they don't put explosive devices and\nI but when you have the red or has the story about when you talk like this the ... the concern is that that one crazy one might then get empowered we don't know what happened in this case\nBut overall careers you know what happened I mean I don't know if he goes all the President Trump aides and so I'm going to go targeted\nWe don't know any of that kind of ... but what difference does it make Charlotte and the fact that they're out or is it on the west that it's a twisted individual and the whole President Trump responsible I didn't hold him or whatever that come on that's clear implication that would be either this is not now let's be fair Chris I'm afraid\nI shop must be fair [noise] so a disagreement\nAbout rhetoric Karen balance right yeah no that was I think of a pretty good in capsule Asian of how the conversation we're having the IRA I didn't know you were on hello Hi Hi current events in higher here which is why it's so I didn't know how do I know we're we're fly together out here at Hoover Institution at Stanford but uh oh ...\nOh it is it is very fancy it's very exciting but Chris I'm not asking you to pick sides among our beloved colleagues are between our beloved colleagues I'm just wondering if you can comment on that type of exchange and the arguments that we're hearing on both sides of that question well\nLook I'm there is no both things can be true I I think that I didn't hear the the entirety of their conversation but I think that both things can be true in the sense that um it's obvious that the disgusting rhetoric that dominates our political discussion\nA that has you know it's funny we used to dabble in this stuff ah lightly question each other's motives and patriotism and sniff around a little bit the edges of these things and play with it and the electric fence of social program\nHold politicians back you couldn't do too much or you'd get in trouble you couldn't be too big of a demagogue you couldn't lie too much you couldn't really call your opponent is vials gum\nBecause people wouldn't go for it but now they realize that if your if your election or re election is conditioned on just the ... the vigorous support of a third of the people who are either gullible enough or cynical enough to go along with you if you can really have\nThirty or forty percent of the country that is white hot for you either through connive inch or ignorance have you can do that\nIf that's enough then you don't ever have to worry about being doing the right stuff really and there isn't a sanctioned there isn't a political sanction for doing the wrong stuff now what we've seen over time\nWhether it's the shooting at the congressional baseball practice\nOr whether it's a attacking ... craze mob attacking Nancy Pelosi when she's campaigning in Florida\nA Mitch McConnell can't have a bus pulled pork sandwich and peace um or whether it is in fact these fake bombs what we see the trend right this hot rhetoric does have consequences\nI think what the disagreement the shepherd and Chris we're having\nWas in the context of don't say that this is Donald Trump's Donald Trump didn't make this guy do this ultimately this person is responsible for his behavior but I think we can hold both of those ideas in our head\nAt the same time people are responsible they're culpable for their own conduct but I think we are coming to a point where both sides thank God or maybe I should say pray God or ready to admit\nThat the way that we talk to each other's having negative consequences that go beyond just living in a toxic space\nChris I that was better than I could have done and that was that I Am grateful always when you're on the show but that they can get really smart take on that but I you just said both sides are saying we should talk talking a better way that each other\nThirteen fifty [noise]\nDo you have an idea for an

about they wanted\nTo get rid of it for I think for a while to show wasn't doing as well as they had hoped I think they put her in a position that was designed not to be perfect for her I think a lot of that's on NBC but\nWhat I don't like is there like having a discussion here about a very sensitive issue she expressed some thoughts and and later then apologized for them I don't like them using\nThis controversy as an excuse to do something I think they wanted to do regardless because it it's not fair to her\nDon't get it racialized as at\nWhich is I mean I agree with her comments either I I'm saying\nOr neither does she like All right so she has backed away from them I think I Would not have said it this way I think there's some discussion on Twitter about like okay is there a difference between black face in the sense of a minstrel show versus someone dressing up as their favorite star\nWho happens to be black for Halloween I'm at and toward the cultural sensitivity to play there and they were having this discussion on NBC's air\nAnd she came out later and said look I did not\nFully appreciate the history of blackface and I should have approached this way that I did\nBut the fact that they ran up multiple segments across multiple NBC platforms attacking her I mean they were just the number one day she was their teammates so to speak yeah they were piling on and punching her while she was down\nAnd I think a lot of has to do with some resentment that she came in with so much money and she may have passed over other people who'd been there longer but also she came from Fox\nAnd there's people that other networks who just\nDon't believe that you should have a life after Fox if you leave Fox and I don't think any better stay then it's not it's just I just don't think this is to not being treated fairly even though I don't think the handle this perfectly as she has admitted\nAnd its humans do right right I I agree I think they wanted to get rid of her anyway and this is not great so we'll take a break we'll be back for our two right\n\n[noise] okay gang so chances are they'll never be an emergency ever ever again ... just in case let's talk

you were able to pay it off and nine\nMore aggressive schedule I I kind of laid up plan a of getting it paid off in less\nThan ten years because I did a lot of this you know over my head like you just

especially your one that you want to be a hundred percent certain you have a prove that you have successfully paid off your student loans\nProblem in this area is that student loan lenders were granted extraordinary power by Congress I think in two thousand five where they don't even have to prove\nThat you owe a debt they're able to uh sees your bank accounts are able to see easier paychecks it's unbelievably abusive what student loan lenders are allowed to do and that's why you've got to make sure you have every bit of documentation you can\nTo fight back if five ten Twenty

wondering if\nUsing or we're off the IRA wouldn't be as a savings account for him would be a dual strategy\nSo doing the raw for an eleven year old is beyond fantastic because you have to it has to be a custodial raw\nRight all three of my kids had Ross from the second they started working and so it allowed them as teenagers to start building up money\nFor the long term and so you can open a Roth with any of my low cost companies I've got and find it a only up to the amount your eleven year old earns in a year okay and then that money can either grow tax free for the Next Fifty years\nAnd will grow into an amazingly large amount of money over fifty years\nOr your son when he reaches adulthood can pull out contributions\nThat have gone in as he's a young child through that and then through the teenage years he can poll contributions out tax penalty free any earnings would need to stay in their till he is in fact at retirement age fifty years away\nOkay that was kind of my understanding is that maybe we need to do this we need to track his contributions\nYeah and actually you know on down the road the phone companies will do that for you now okay so that shouldn't be hard and how much money is your eleven year old gonna be earning that would be available to go into Iraq\n[noise] well he's pulling down about eight dollars an hour three days a week for about three hours a day

perspective\nThat's fifty percent higher than the entire outstanding credit card debt and the country for student loans the good news is that\nPeople entering college now are much more wary about taking on student loans they're playing harder to get\nColleges are having a tougher time getting people to say yes and the result is that tuition costs after going up year after year or roughly three times the rate of inflation now aren't going up generally at all\nThe list price may be going up but in order to more students into their classrooms colleges are having to offer deals\nPrivate colleges have become really aggressive at offering deals and the actual cost of four year degrees\nIs not going anywhere for cause the increases we've had over recent years have all been because the ease of borrowing money and people unfortunately not realizing\nWhat can be lifelong implications and burns from taking on those student loans so the marketplace is now working\nAnd it's working because people are making better decisions and a lot of private colleges if you're going private instead of a a government colleges state college\nA lot of private colleges now are short of students some of that just demographics playing into the equation but they're struggling to fill their enrollment and that means that you don't have to be\nThe number one student in your high school class or number five student in your high school class you may still be able to set off a competitive battle a bidding war if you will\nAmong schools they would like to have you as a student\nRemember my rule though you're never going to protect your wallet if you only negotiate a first year deal you need to negotiate a four year deal\nAbout what that school is going to offer you versus another school versus another school may have heard me tell the story that my daughter\nAh after she made her decision where she wanted to go to school and rejected places one of the school she rejected came back and offered her a monster scholarship if she changed her mind\nAnd go to that place instead of the other one that where she's actually attending and I was kind of hoping she'd say monster scholarship I'm gonna take it but she didn't but it was out there and that's the thing is to use the marketplace to your advantage and with state school systems\nThis very somewhat state to state with more and

greatest irony of it though the whole system\nIs that people who go to a first tier state school\nYour freshman and sophomore year will be in far larger classes than someone who goes to a fourth

company another thing people do is when you get to Orlando\nIf you instead of getting a rental car at the airport\nTaken Hoover lift to an enterprise location that's a neighborhood location\nThose tend to rent vehicles a lot cheaper than an airport car rental you don't have enterprise has a little neighborhood locations in suburbs all over the country that that may save you a lot of money and the other thing I've noticed with enterprise would that\nIs that different locations in a metro area often will charge very different prices so if you hung around on enterprise that could save your money and if you you may find\nThat doing Hoover and lift could actually be cheaper depending on how much you're moving around and those two weeks then you having any form of rental car\nOr one sneak

an historic game last night\nFor Los Angeles Dodgers fans to go to a game three's the fact that doctors one Boston now leads that series two games to one but for everyone else well here's the play by play\nIt right that's right and that's something I've I've felt forever but even more intensely after Enron went bus last decade and peoples and total of their IRA was in Enron stock and everybody's retirement got wiped out\n[noise] so they'd gotten me wondering well first I was wondering why and I guess that explains that um but then also my company actually offers a stock purchase planned for employees that is a Fifteen Percent discount when you are just stuck\nYeah I Love those plans to hold it or at least one year before you can sell it and I was wondering what would\nBe the best way to go about managing it I'm I'm fairly new to investing overall among you're doing it for a couple of years I'm I'm thirty three years old and he\nGot into the game kind of late um and so my ideal is is the kind of keep it there um and just let it grow a long with my four one K.\nUm however when I heard you the other day I thought maybe that might not be the best idea so I was just wondering what your suggestion would be\nSo I Love these plans where the company offers you a discount and I guess they take a little bit out of each paycheck and find the purchase of the stock that they give you a Fifteen Percent off\n[noise] is that right [noise] yes that's right yeah\nSo I I Love that because they're giving you a direct incentive and you've got a guaranteed Fifteen Percent\nDeal on the stock I mean that's pretty great and then the iffy part is you have to own it for a year\nAnd then add a year you can sell so it's possible the stock would go down over that next year and even though you got to discount you might lose money beyond likely\nThat he would lose money consistently and it's really a a great gift they're giving you\nGiving you an opportunity to be an owner of the company and part and on the stock so I don't have a problem with that\nUm and you could at the years mark ... salad and take your profits paid the tax on it\nBut okay the four oh one K. thing\nThere's when you load up a four O. one K. with company stock that's the money you're depending on for your retirement money that you're doing and the stock purchase plan where you get the discount you can use it for any purpose he want after that twelve month holding period\nOkay and you know it was good at all out at that twelve month so are there different issues and different concerns\nOkay actually and I guess I was wondering if I should be taking that money and you know selling it taken the ... and then you know moving that just something else like an IRA\nWell I live at you took the words right out of my mouth would I Would love I'm smiling as you asked that because you made it sound like you don't get the investing thing at all and you ask the perfect question so if you how the stock for a year you sold it then I'd love it if you put it in a Roth IRA\nAnd because you're allowed to put up to fifty five hundred dollars a year in Iraq you put money into Ross and it grows tax free all through the next Thirty years he'll be working and then you spend that money and everything at CERN tax free\nSo and then that automatically diversified you away from the company's stock in a four one K. you have what are you putting your money in and hit\nA with a company matches or six percent chocolate so six percent match in there\nAnd then what do you what do you investing in and\nThe oh oh well most of it was in um the vanguard I'm target fun\nThat's perfect and I would put it all and the vanguard target fun for since you're thirty three let's look like um oh what would that be great doing like twenty six to eight twenty fifty five\nI say it's twenty shave the child I Want to say yeah\nThat's fine and that would be a great decision and then you're completely diversified away from what you're doing in that company stock\nAnd then if you did a Roth IRA with money you'd sell after a year of that company stock plan you could put all that and a Roth IRA with vanguard in the same target retirement fund twenty fifty five so you'd have\nYour uh four one K. at work it would be a ... times and then you have Iraq there would be after tax money and that would be a beautiful combo so sounds to me Brandon like you're doing a great job and you should know that\nIt's saving money for retirement thirty three put your head and most people don't really think about it till they have their fortieth birthday so you're not behind you're kind of a head of a lot of people\n... with us on the Clark Howard show hello Marlene\nBut after ... lego and\nI'm having a great day and I hope you are to\nCertainly are um [noise] just a question of one question I have\nA state employees retirement fund I've been a contributing to with my employer for about twelve years and I'm a\nI'm needing to it's higher in order to draw the sun's out so I couldn't do that\nUm and take a lump sum would would there'll be any other\nPlans that she'd recommend take a I think it's maybe for about twelve thousand dollars which isn't that great some but should I call a life that was another plan\nSo you said this is a state retirement plan\nCorrect employs retirement plan\nAll right so you got this twelve grand and so your option would be to take it where they give you just a monthly check for the rest of your life forget that twelve grams\nSo until I D.C.'s by receive that amount but they are not pay up all too I'm an air war or you can write\nThis depends on the state plan and uh my thing generally is on light for you to get the monthly check\nAnd the reason as you're not as likely to be
