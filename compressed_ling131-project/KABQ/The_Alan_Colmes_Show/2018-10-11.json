to become stale too that they no\nNo and he's very good at it he's a he's a very good performer and that's why president right now Ronald Reagan was a good performer too\nRight but I Do remember that failed I I was just wondering if you thought it was going to get stale\nI don't think so I think I think these people have bought into a cult of personality and and you know when you are and we actually we talked about this uh at link that up and maybe it's been more than a year now\nBut if you look at the history I Lived in Germany for a year and I knew I literally news some old Nazis I mean elderly Nazis who are still not six and I knew elderly Nazis who were embarrassed Nazis and I knew elderly Nazis or you know never again you know whatever\nAnd what I learned from that experience and I have a good friend who is Japanese I mean you know from Japan friday came live the United states for five years he's back in Japan Louise I've stayed at his home\nUm and uh you know talking to him about his parents' generation is is more my age so he wasn't there for ... but I'm\nIn both cases the people bought into the cult being sold by tell Joe in Japan and Hitler and Germany they completely you know large enough enough of the people bought into it that the country basically had become seniors by a cult\nAnd the only way you can de program an entire nation from a cold is essentially to destroy it\nYou know they had to have because they believed in the fallibility of Hitler into Asia they believe that these guys were absolutely right and they had the answer to every problem and it wasn't until they were defeated in war that they figured out that it was wrong\nI Would argue that similarly there was a Cold War and hardy and brought into the United states in Nineteen twenty when he ran for president on the platform of dropping the top tax rate from Ninety One percent or Seventy five percent down to twenty five percent and dean regulating business and and uh\nUh you know in fact his slogan was more business and government less government and business I'm so excuse me less government and business more\nOr whatever it was then governor yeah a lot more business and government they deregulated privatize was his agenda sure and that that call was really bought into the roaring twenties even though average working people didn't see an income increase

which completely see as the country and the Republicans control this country from and and\nAnd and control all three branches of the federal government everything right\nWhen that bubble burst the American people said holy cow we were ...\nAnd that's what it takes to get people out of a cult they have to be able to step away from it and look back and say wow I didn't realize at that point in

through the south east forecasters say the system was one of the strongest storms to ever hit the U.S what it made landfall on the Florida Panhandle Wednesday we're all just ... comes\nStatistically they're much more likely to vote went up right after they registered talk a little bit about that well I think\nThis really plays up not only in the house races in specific because that's where you're going to see a lot of young people and a lot of the women who may have previously been sort of hey it's a midterm election I mean\nLast time around or in twenty fourteen we actually hit a low in terms of you know turn out and and we're looking now at potentially historic highs for any mid term election\nBecause people are so I mean polarized as part of it and angry voters are likely voters and I think that's what you're going to see\nBecause then twenty ten one side was angry Rand they shut up and mass\nAnd the other side really didn't and it was a blowout ride sixty three house seats for the Republicans what we're seeing this time and it wasn't really the case even a few weeks ago below we're seeing now we'll see if it continues is the left is they've been at a ten out of ten and eleven out of ten for a while here already five every day\nYeah it's like way way up there but Republicans I think we're sort of floating along and now with Kavanaugh that's changing and that having impacts on\nSome house races but certainly a number of the Senate races wants of the reasons that you just said I mean the fact that the map\nFavors the geo pay on the Senate side by virtue of\nThe one third of the Senate that happens to be up and twenty Eighteen a lot of these most important Senate race has happened to be disproportionately in red states weren't awakening of the Republican base could be deeply unhelpful to Democrats who were trying to unseat Republicans or hang onto their seats correct\nAnd I think you also have to factor in when we come to Murray's point about new voters who are these new voters because if you go back and you say hey people really don't turn out permit there as well who doesn't turn out from it turns turns out\nThat your typical Republican voter is much more likely to vote in a midterm then guess what again highly educated women or minorities or recently registered voters so Murray makes the point\nIn this cycle regions recently registered people are highly likely to turn out because they they're being registered for a reason and the money that's been flowing in has been blowing in to voter registration so I think that's a key point to keep an eye on\nAnd I think just naturally the party that's out of power\nIs more motivated to show up get involved crawl over broken glass to get it done because they feel like something slipping away from them and and there's a high level of motivation and that I think was the case\nStarting the day after the election of President Trump this was they they started mobilizing instantly\nBuilding up to this mid term in a way that I think we have not seen from the Democratic side of the aisle since in a very long time I think not even know sex I say before that\nRun member oh six was a transition here in terms of the house and the Senate for the Democrats right uh we'll see what happens but you know even today is we're dealing with the hurricane down south\nI think people are wondering what happens to a race between Rick Scott and a Bill Nelson for the U.S Senate yeah I mean how does it affect things because that area that just got hit that's a strong Republican Harriet right there yeah\nAnd yet on the flip side in Florida and the fact that so many Puerto Ricans who are American citizens now live in Florida because they're still displaced they vote and they vote overwhelmingly democratic one my last question before we we had to break\nTalk a little bit about the state races because the Democratic party as we know very well had basically nowhere to go but up\nVery few governorships very very few state legislatures and that sort of the farm team for national leaders it's also who will help determine redistricting in twenty twenty I have some hope that the Democratic party's rebuilding at that level ... absolutely\nI again I think the energized vote here is going to help and you look at a race like Georgia and you say oh gosh\n... actually in good shape in there when you look at Andrew Gillum go back to what you're saying hey how is this possible but again I think that what you're seeing is people are focused now on these local issues in addition to this being a referendum on President Trump\nI think it benefits a lot of Democrats down ballot or and you know it's interesting that the reverse dynamic in New Jersey where the focus and not likely high turnout by Democrats is going to benefit Bob Menendez thank\nGod because these are not a healthy way jeeze guys\nWant to add one thing on Florida because I was thinking about that today\nIt was actually a little bit sad that I was thinking about the political implications of this hurricane a but what I came up with was sort of\nA few different things cutting in in opposite directions I think Rick Scott Marie mentioned the Puerto Rican community\nOr in Florida according to a lot of polling Rick Scott has been doing uniquely well for a Republican among Puerto Ricans because of his handling\nOf previous hurricanes he's really strong showing very strong leadership and he was really making an effort after Puerto Rico to help as much as possible and bring to bear the resources of the state of Florida helped that island and so he's really done very well in making inroads\nAnd if there's now an opportunity for him to once again to carry that torture of leadership in a crisis situation that could we're down to his political benefit because he's in that role helping people actively blood\nOn the other hand one is you just said the most Republican portion of the state is getting absolutely hammered right now and we don't know what even\nThe infrastructure is going to look like in three weeks and be with early voting starting\nPlaces where Republicans really need to bank a lot of votes may not be thinking about voting at all for quite some time because of this really terrible storm that we're going to cover later on in the show so a Florida is definitely for a political nerd one to keep an eye on but in the meantime the human cost\nIs is frightening as this storm hurricane Michael makes landfall today Greg Jenkins will join us later in the program from Florida to tell us first hand what he's seeing one let's take a break here Juan Williams is our guest he's up in New York with Marie\nHe's got a book out called what the hell do you have to lose it's an illusion to something that President Trump said\nMaking a pitch to black voters saying hey the Democrats are failed you vote for me what the hell do you have to lose and Juan Williams argues well in his opinion quite a lot and he lays it

Lewis in my friend Mary Catherine hand but also Don Lemon later that evening told that Louis to shut up when he talked about ... like behavior and we've seen Ted Cruz getting heckled out at restaurants we've seen a lot of the whipping up of\nA frenzied crowd at Trump rallies against journalists\nSo Murray we're seeing a lot of charges and counter charges about\nWhich mob is worse and which mob is more dangerous and seemingly more overt embracing of mob tactics or at least downplaying mobbed tactics for him a number of\nSignificant national figures even as they decried the mob mentality or bad behavior on the other side\nYeah and let's take a listen I'm to sound like Donald Trump talking about protesters let's let's start with cut three is a guy\nThrowing punches mass screaming and everything else when we're talking I didn't work out and we're not allowed you know the guards are very gentle with him and his work it out like I was smiling laughing like the punch him in the face of [laughter]\nSo I have a lot of thoughts on this topic and I think we should start from a point and I think you and I agree on this that public figures getting screened at in restaurants or\nLike I screamed at in the middle of Penn Station a few weeks ago like Ted Cruz was that that's never acceptable on either side\nThat that kind of behavior I I don't think is okay\nAnd the way can I just cannot just interject what worries me too is this is starting to trickle down to media figures I mean we saw this happen to Bryan kill me in the streets of New York where he was followed by basically a mob in the subway\nOr were there agitating to try to get in his face is a Fox guys are Trump guy so across the board is worrisome\nSure I Will also say that Donald Trump if you've ever watched one of his rallies which I Know you have and a lot of our listeners have\nLike his rallies he fires people up he gets them really agitated the press people who cover him have said they feel unsafe some of them had to have a security especially during the twenty sixteen elections so I think for Donald Trump to talk about a quote mob is like\nIncredibly hypocritical because in many ways he had whipped up his own versions of mobs and I would point out that\nWe have seen someone killed from an angry political mob and that happened in Charlottesville when protester Heather hire who is protesting the white supremacist that had come to Charlottesville where I live used to live um she was run over by a white supremacist who's currently on trial or will be on trial he's currently in jail\nSo I think that\nWe should all start from a place where we agree on what's not OK when I also said guy is that\nPeople exercising their free speech to protest even if that protest is loud even if they're that protested is not physically aggressive but it's you know loud there's a lot of people even you know you know go into the capital and trying to confront senators that's part of\nDemocracy and I think when President Trump says they're an angry mob or when even Susan Collins made very disparaging comments about some of the protesters these are citizens these are voters these their constituents they are trying to I think de legitimize\nAnd yeah and I think and I think the party in power or you know needs to be careful I don't think it democratic the house I don't think Democrats shit like immediately moved towards impeachment or start spiking the football or or take take sort of a short term political gain to me and like we've won the war and led to burn it down\nI think to a lot of Democrats that feels like white particularly Mitch McConnell\nHas done in the Senate and and so\nI like at some point someone has to cry uncle yeah and no one wants to do it now because powers so fleeting it feels so temporary and you have this right very small amount of time to get anything done when you are in office and I think it's going to make a lot of people say I'm going to go work at the state and local level because that's actually where things get done\nAnd I I think a lot of Republicans for the first time\nAre appreciative of Mitch McConnell because he is doing what they believe Harry Reid always you know the Harry Reid crew would do this to us now finally McConnell's playing hardball and I get that like a that resonates with me as well especially over these last couple of weeks as we've been talking about this very difficult issue where\nYou know I think\nWhen we talk about this it's very difficult\nTo be like well do you not believe women do not care about survivors of sexual assault ... you know if you support this nomination before any of this came out your complicit an evil there was just this extremely high level of vitriol that began with the nomination and then\n... has run through this to this very day so how do we how do we talk about it like I don't know I mean because it 'cause I feel like no matter no matter what argument I Try to make on you know what I make this on Twitter I was very active on Twitter during the Kavanaugh thing\nAnd a lot of the responses from people who disagree with me was that I'm like a hateful massaging as to doesn't care about the victims of sexual assault um and like it was like in a ... I was like in a twilight zone I I was trying to\nYeah I think it might be less and this is for all of us like in these conversations maybe less about winning arguments and I believe me I like to try and when arguments and more about listening to the other person and talking I don't know like I just feel like if\nI I just I first of all I think arguments on Twitter awful to like I don't miss it but I I just I don't I sort of don't know where to go from here and I mean I think we do need leaders who who said it better example certainly in my party and obviously Donald Trump is like the king of incivility an idea\nLet's draw some we should draw some lines and when lines are crossed by your own side\nIt should be\nIt should be incumbent on that side to call it out and I think we need more of that and I\nI don't know if we're going to get it 'cause I think both basis don't want to hear that um 'cause everyone's really mad for some good reasons but we can't lose ourselves completely here

preaching the choir here with me guide you had some thoughts on what Mattis thing\nYeah if you think that Donald Trump is the cause of this then you're you're totally missing the boat he is a symptom

that Trump doesn't says\nBut there is an overwhelming believe\nAnd I think it as well grounded on the right that the media by in large for the most part is either rooting for the other side or

we're joined on the line now by a friend of the program David French National Review Institute fellow he's\nNot in the program many times talking about a number of issues but a lot on the Supreme Court battle we thankfully finally\nJust got through this past weekend David thank you for joining the show tonight\nThanks so much for having me and I love the term printed approach\nWell we don't give it out to just anyone so it's earned it or not or an ... carrying\nA it's a David you really good pizza shop at the Atlantic called the wounds won't heal and the reason I really like it because you lay out I think in very clear ways how one side of the country viewed the Kavanaugh controversy and how the other side that now\nAs a liberal progressive I mind one side I think you and I are on different sides on that was one of the first pieces I saw\nThat that I think accurately laid out the guy in metric Lee opposed way and genuine ways both sides saw that\nTalk a little bit about this piece why you decided to write it and it sort of where we go from here I Know that's a lot of questions and those are big ones but just sort of dive right into it to the meat of the argument\nYeah so I work at it and I and I started that it could tension that I think it's it's true and that in a in an important way this was\nA this twenty six teams that this fight with more divisive than the twenty sixteen election and you might think well you're insane to say that because the ... election was incredibly divisive but the reason why I say it is because what this did a in twenty sixteen Hillary and truck\nWe're not exactly the best sort of avatars and champions of their respective points of view or the respect your point of view of of conservatism grasses are a lot of people were able to sort of say a pox on both your houses open links and but the Kavanaugh controversy\nBrought people good people on both sides just due to direct conflict over really on a different way in which they view the world and they're fundamentally different language\nThey view the relationship between the sexes gender a whole bunch of really big issues and so that's what I tried to lay out is fairly as I could like different approaches that people were taking in a in a I'm not focusing on sort of the bad faith the trolls and write all of those folks\nI'm Talking about the people in good faith you looked at this and how\nEvery last part of this controversy was filtered through two very different ... and if you want to know why it felt so raw it's because of that divide and so that's why that's why I wrote it I just sort of wanted to lay it out there and say\nHey we just experienced in court at moment and it opened up wounds and created get a it created divisions that I don't think are going away anytime soon\nYou know I'm I'm concerned that David that you're right about that and I was looking at great interest with a CNN poll that came out that I referenced a few times on the air about this whole\nAnd ... and the results were in some ways\nConflicting and all over the place so support for Kavanaugh was underwater\nSupport for Republican handling the Kavanaugh matter it was even deeper underwater support for Democrats handling of it was the best underwater but most people\nBelieved Kavanaugh's accuser is but also most people believe that he was the victim of a political smear campaign I think there were a lot of people struggling to get their arms around\nExactly what this was and where to come down\nUm and and and write a feel about it based on some of those\nData points that are sort of inconsistent\nAnd I know that you and I came to the same conclusion ultimately that justice was served or justice prevailed in this case via the confirmation of\nNow justice Kavanaugh why is it in your mind because you wrote a piece of natural view about this why is it that looking at all of the evidence and all of the allegations and all of the really fraud difficult questions that we were grappling with why do you think that it was the right thing ultimately that he did get confirmed and is on the court\nYeah so it goes back to this difference of starting positions that I think in in the way I put it in the Atlantic piece is I'd say you know look I'm when Republicans look at a Kavanaugh\nThey saw a person who had a checks all the right boxes play ball or ... or the rules um he was a family man he was married to his wife no hints of infidelity married to one why do his ability\nAm much or have the uh it's sort of in I'm In the position where I ... I feel like I can clearly see where we are\nAnd I can clearly see some short term consequences of that which are going to be more division more contentious clashes and then the other you know one of the things that I think we'll see whoever wins in a less than a month is going to be overly triumphal list\nAnd overreach if that's one thing that we have seen time and time again it's the people over interpret short term victories\nSo I think it's going to be incumbent on us those of us who try and struggled to have some historical perspective to urge against over interpreting the results of ever but as far as what do we do about this really big divide aside from speaking about it honestly um I I don't I don't have a five point plan [laughter]\nYou know what David I think that's okay I think defining the problem is a good place to start in treating the other side argument with respect which is what you do in your latest piece at the Atlantic the wounds won't heal I was quite frankly grateful for some clarity you Brian and actually how you described my\nPosition not my personally but I Would echo party's position David French senior writer at National Review thank you for joining

the strongest storms to ever hit us when it made landfall Wednesday you there were all just ... comes\nI think this really plays up not only in the house races in specific because that's where you're going to see a lot of young people and a lot of the women who may have previously been sort of hey it's a midterm election I mean\nLast time around or in twenty fourteen we actually hit a low in terms of you know turn out and and we're looking now at potentially historic highs for any mid term election because people are so I mean polarized as part of it and angry voters are likely voters and I think that's what you're going to see\nBecause then twenty ten one side was angry Rand they shut up and mass\nAnd the other side really didn't and it was a blowout right sixty three house seats for the Republicans what we're seeing this time and it wasn't really the case even a few weeks ago but what we're seeing now we'll see if it continues is the left is they've been at a ten out of ten and eleven out of ten file here already five every day\nYeah it's like way way up there but Republicans I think we're sort of floating along and now with Kavanaugh that's changing and that's having impacts on some house races but certainly a number of the Senate races wants of the reasons that you just said I mean the fact that the map\nFavors the geo pee on the Senate side by virtue of\nThe one third of the Senate that happens to be up and twenty Eighteen a lot of these most important in Senate races happened to be disproportionately in red states weren't awakening of the Republican base could be deeply unhelpful to Democrats who were trying to\nUnseat Republicans or hang onto their seats correct and I think you also have to face\nYou're in when we come to Murray's point about new voters who are these new voters because if you go back and you say hey people really don't turn out permit there as well who doesn't turn out from it turns turns out\nThat your typical Republican voter is much more likely to vote in a midterm then guess what again highly educated women or minorities or recently registered voters so Murray makes the point\nIn this cycle reduced recently registered people are highly likely to turn out because they they're being registered for a reason and\nThe money that's been flowing in has been flowing in to voter registration so I think that's a key point to keep an eye on\nAnd I think just naturally the party that's out of power\nIs more motivated to show up getting involved crawl over broken glass to get it done because they feel like something slipping away from them and and there's a high high level of motivation and that I think was the case\nStarting the day after the election of President Trump this was they they started mobilizing instantly\nBuilding up to this mid term in a way that I think we have not seen from the Democratic side of the aisle since say in a very long time I did not even know sex I'm not a before that well remember\nOh six was a transition year in terms of the house and the Senate for the Democrats right uh we'll see what happens but you know even today as we're dealing with the hurricane down south I think people are wondering what happens to a race\nBetween Rick Scott and a Bill Nelson for the U.S Senate yeah I mean how does it affect things because that area that just got hit that's a strong Republican Harriet right there yeah\nAnd yet on the flip side in Florida and the fact that so many Puerto Ricans who are American citizens now live in Florida because they're still displaced they vote and they vote overwhelmingly democratic one my last question before we we had to break\nTalk a little bit about the state races because the Democratic party as we know very well had basically nowhere to go but up\nVery few governorships very very few state legislatures and that sort of the farm team for national leaders it's also who will help determine redistricting in twenty twenty I have some hope that the Democratic party's rebuilding at that level he may help absolutely\nI again I think the energized vote here is gonna help and you look at a race like Georgia and you say oh yeah gosh\nThey see it was actually in good shape and there are when you look at Andrew Gillum go back to that you think hey how is this possible but again I think that what you're seeing is people are focused now on these local issues in addition to this being a referendum on President Trump\nI think it benefits a lot of Democrats down ballot a and you know it's interesting that the reverse dynamic in New Jersey where the focus and not likely high turnout by Democrats is going to benefit Bob Menendez thank\nGod because even healthy that way jeeze guys want\nTo add one thing on Florida because I was thinking about that today\nIt was actually a little bit sad that I was thinking about the political implications of this hurricane um but what I came up with was sort of a few different things cutting in in opposite directions I think Rick Scott Marie mentioned the Puerto Rican community\nOr in Florida according to a lot of polling Rick Scott has been doing uniquely well for a Republican among Puerto Ricans because of his handling\nOf previous hurricanes he's really strong showing very strong leadership and he was really making an effort after Puerto Rico to help as much as possible and bring to bear the resources of the state of Florida helped that island and so he's really done very well and making inroads\nAnd if there's now an opportunity for him to once again to carry that torture of leadership in a crisis situation that could we're down to his political benefit because he is in that role helping people actively blood on the other hand one is you just said\nThe most Republican portion of the state is getting absolutely hammered right now and we don't know what even the infrastructure is going to look like in three weeks and with early voting starting\nPlaces where Republicans really need to bank a lot of votes may not be thinking about voting at all for quite some time because of this really terrible storm that we're going to cover later on in the show so a Florida is definitely for a political nerd one to keep an eye on but in the meantime the human cost\nIs is frightening as this storm hurricane Michael makes landfall today Greg Jenkins will join us later in the program from Florida to tell us first hand what he's seeing one let's take a break here Juan Williams is our gas he's up in New York with Marie\nHe's got a book out called what the hell do you have to lose it's an illusion to something that President Trump said\nMaking a pitch to black voters saying hey the Democrats are failed you vote for me what the hell do
