I did\n[noise] I'd have to go back and read that paragraph Michael to to know exactly what I was thinking about what I can tell you is that uh both Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln set the precedent a three times between the two of them of ignoring Supreme Court decisions and no tape and\nThe uh some people can ignored you can say basically Supreme Court got it wrong and you could like real wages campaign against the court by saying concerted got it all wrong and maybe like\nThat is what Jackson Lincoln did but but you know in in the case we had her Jackson there were two to a Supreme Court decisions that he ignored\nOr the first had to do with the second national bank the court ruled that it was just fine to have the bank Jackson shut down anyway and claiming that it was unconstitutional and the the second was the trail of tears the court ruled that the ah the relocation of Indians was illegal and Jackson did that anyway are initiated that I was finished during the president who followed him\nUm in case of Abraham Lincoln was Dred Scott it was the Eighteen fifty six hundred and fifty seven decision that said that that uh African Americans could never become citizens of the United states and you know Lincoln overtly ignored that\nAnd then you know with the Emancipation Proclamation when even a lot farther than that and fought a war over frankly I'm Rob a\nCake being regard to unite and you just say eat do you do an article ... section to action said the Supreme Court was mistaken and flawed\nWell that's my recollection of one way or ... when I wrote the book is that that was the argument that I was making his that article ... section two gives Congress the power to regulate the Supreme Court and Congress can simply pass a law saying you know we are passing term limits or excuse me we are passing of a fight campaign finance reform\nAnd the Supreme Court may not\nRule on this case and he was simply embedded as called court stripping new embed that into the legislation it's been done in a few cases it's very controversial um\n... ... you think the Democrats will start doing that you're black power the Supreme Court where do you think they made the they may take additional action that may cause chief justice Roberts\nTo focus more judicial restraint instead of judicial activism because I'm quite certain that even the threat of patting additional justices would scare the or the body itself\nI Would think so that's what happened in Nineteen thirty seven I don't I I think in the current environment there's you know the court basically has nothing to worry about but hey because they've got a Republican president and and the and Congress is in the hands of the Republicans\nBut by twenty twenty if if the Democrats have achieved a super majority in the house in the Senate and they can recapture the White House\nAnd if Donald Trump and the Republican Party has been discredited and the easiest way to do that the thing that most people pay attention to is not sex scandals it's crashing economy and you know that that ah when that's going to happen is the big question not if\nBut if that was the case and this court with Kavanaugh or Amy Coney Bryant or whoever you know a Trump ended up putting on this court\nIf the court starts handing down these these locking her era kind of decisions where they say child labor laws are on constitutional right to re right to unionize laws are unconstitutional though Medicare and Social Security are unconstitutional\nUm you know government support and housing is unconstitutional these are all\nDecisions that the Supreme Court in the past has made they have said they have said exactly what I just said\nAnd Nineteen thirty seven for and Franklin Roosevelt scare the hell out of my threatening to pack the court and suddenly a you know one justice in particular ironically his name was Roberts started changing his votes and and going along\nThe extra pressure is necessary\nYeah well this week those are pure political pressure\nOver all and just maybe you could just add to the pet me with a ...\nThere's a couple of there's a couple of ways to pull it off and want us to record stripping legislation another would be through an amendment to the constitution which is one move to amend the America dot org or working on\nThe other voices is to learn and the final want us to

jeeze the only way the founders allowed us to help hold the government accountable is through the ballot box and somebody responded saying yes\nBecause it's about checks and balances each of the branches are supposed to check and balance the other way to keep them under control and there's supposed to self police to some extent so\nI guess my point is so we now have the executive branch colluding unquestionably with the legislative branch to pack the additional branch where the checks and balances Tom was a representative government\nThat they're not there and we haven't you know we really haven't had a representative government I Would say since the since the late seventies or after the Buckley decision in which paved the way for the rise of Ronald Reagan\nSo that's what I'm

whether you're picking up\nYour phone calls and Paul and wouldn't they'll washing hey Paul what's on your mind\nWell you started to mention a little bit about my topic is what is to become of the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh\nWhich allegations of sexual assault allegation\nYeah okay\nAnd uh you know we have to look at this at least the senators talked to this is not a matter of beyond a reasonable doubt it's not even a matter of preponderance of evidence it's a matter of sufficient doubt the fishing down as in playing Russian roulette\nRussia is one in six or one in eight no one would do that right right talking percentages that are very low uh and I would say that regardless of Christine Blasey Ford's F my legal set that aside his own testimony left\nPlenty of doubt yeah\nWhich is why they may be a has reopened their inquiry into whether is downgrade to merely qualified status should be drawn downgraded further\nAnd twenty five hundred law professors\nHave signed an open letter against his is a domination or I guess as a as confirmation and twenty five hundred by the way this was on another program a is a Fifteen Percent of all the law professors in the country because there's only about Seventeen thousand of them\nWhile I was wondering I was wondering about the context that's fascinating\nBut this is what I Want to talk about why if they're I think what's to become this\nThere's an article in the national review it says well you remember the book Harper Lee's to kill a mocking bird were a black man was accused of raping a white woman right\nAnd the movie Gregory Peck play Atticus Finch who successfully defended the black man they're saying if if it isn't just contacts Atticus Finch would be raped in Iowa so they're playing racism\nAgainst sexual assault\nWell this is this is my point in my first hour ramp Paul where I I I was going off on you know you've got four different Fox hosts now who have said that this is all because Kavanaugh as a white man\nAnd and so ah okay who's going after the white man well there's only two people of color on the side judiciary committed about Democrats on demand one's a woman Cory Booker income Harris is that what they're saying you know I haven't been watching Fox News so I don't know if they're showing\nYou know a black senators when they say this but you know racialized in this is insane\nWell let's look at an even keel we've century left are hung out to dry yeah Democrats were in order to control the Senate at the time and so what happened and it was re fight against sexual harassment\nAnd Joe Biden has apologized to put a black\nOn the court because a black man just died left the court so it it's insane and this is what we have I I'm very frustrated time because we have\nA white woman being a ... a alleging sexual assault against the blinds if I'm In sexual assault when you when you count and covering her airway that's just plain first degree felony assault right but we have this this is these are two white people in fifty three percent of white women voted for Trump\nI don't know how to advocate for women for women when that's what happened fifty three percent is not the women to do kind of white women women obviously the majority of women that but that was made up by women of color\nThere was only three percent of black when I voted for Trump the as I recall and and and and this was by the way Paul and then let's you know reminding each other in our audience this was after the Access Hollywood tape came out in which Trump bragged about grabbing women by their crotch\nAnd and uh you know bragged about sexual assault and said you know when you're a star they let you do it at cetera et cetera I mean this is this is what we\n[laughter] so I when someone only leave Christine Blasey Ford hung out to dry\nThe only way it sure looks to me to continue this investigation these allegations is for enough people to get off of their snooty whatever and started voting and if we can take control of the house of representatives then they can open up hearing cetera\nContinue looking into this but otherwise this is going to ... and we're going to be in the same as it should not be happening twenty seven years after Clarence Thomas\nWhile and I remember after ... acquired Thomas's put on the court um and again Democrats control Congress there was no follow up on those hearings and right\nYou know ... and and again it was ... ... and the other thing is uh you know\nBlack people are being subject every sort of ... black and being shot while I'm On black black folk in very small number\nThat you know part of that is the is the legacy of Jim Crow\nBut yeah we all need to the young people voting you know basically the only

don't have to use all thirty hours and it's typical sometimes that they you'll back that time but uh but we've been told to expect the Senate to be an all night and around the clock ends tomorrow afternoon now here's the wildcard we think this vote is going to go fifty one forty not\nBased on the the announcements by a Susan Collins and Joe Manchin\nSteve Danes the Republican senator from Montana it has made it abundantly clear that he supports a Brett Kavanaugh he really wants to be here if his vote is necessary he will be here but Steve Gaines is supposed to walk his daughter down the aisle in Montana\nSaturday and he'd do in that way or another and he is doing that now the question is\nWill they keep that vote open in other words you could have you gotten from\nBrett Kavanaugh fifty forty nine now it's not like there was a well fifty one forty nine is one more vote\nYou don't get style points when you do this you know this isn't like the Olympics where they say well you know Brett Kavanaugh was a confirmed the Supreme Court but it was when the ... like they do it and the Olympics and he looked at the record book and they put a little asterisk by the by the Martin and I know they don't do that would they really keep the Senate can\nFall night Saturday probably into the wee hours of Sunday probably Sunday Morning because you know two hour time difference a\nThere's a lot of you know they they have to land at Dulles Airport so at least maybe forty five minutes to just to get from there to hear\nA would they really keep the Senate in an additional twelve Thirteen fourteen hours just to get Steve Gaines here on a fate accompli so it's fifty one forty nine versus fifty forty nine that's up to Mitch McConnell we don't know the answer to that question\nLet it let me right now the brick capital we've confirmed whether it be with or without the voters Steve games\nOn the Danes thing um which is just it's amazing how outside of ants can affect politics is is a long planned a wedding for his daughter and by the way let me just fortunately say on the record\nYou go to your daughter's wedding period I Know this is a hugely important vote but that's a hugely important day and the wife and his family and I'm Glad that he's making that decision um\nI Wonder chat if you think that it may be up to McConnell were partially up to to Danes could gain say I know my vote may not be absolutely necessary but this is\nA really important one for me to cast and therefore please do hold it open is that something where he might make that decision for himself and McConnell will sort of ... what Danes decides\nIt is up to Mitch McConnell if he decides to do that\nI just Mitch McConnell really want to keep the Senate in another twelve Thirteen hours we've had some pretty long days up here the Senate will have already been in session all night on friday night at a Saturday and do that again what about the staff here on Capitol Hill you have to have at least one presiding officer meaning you have to have one senator presiding\nI was told initially that Mike Pence the vice president was going to preside not necessarily to break a vote just it's a big vote and so my question is what does he come at a ... you know four o'clock in the afternoon or does he come six o'clock in the morning on Sunday I mean ... what do you do when you close the votes are there are operational considerations there\nAre windows President Trump wants his justice Warren and does he say I want to swear it and then on Saturday Night\nUm the longest vote in Senate history\nHappening on the stimulus package in February of ... not right five dollars and Fifteen minutes and the reason I took so long as they needed the vote of democratic Ohio Senator Sherrod brown his mother had passed away in Cleveland he flew to the lake they held the vote open they needed sixty votes on that particular vote\nHe came back cast a vote they pass the stimulus bill sixty to thirty eight\nOr so you're talking about adding to that record going from five hours and Fifteen minutes to somewhere in the neighborhood of fourteen Fifteen hours for the longest Senate history [noise] wow [noise]\nCat have you slept at all no method ... if\nI needed something to drink I Need sleep now [laughter] ... especially if we're here to ... tonight and then tomorrow night as Steve Danes we're waiting for Steve days to fly back from Montana\nAs you well you might you might be rooting for a certain outcome on the Danes thing chat and I can't blame you but you know reading books and that's where\nAre you said something I didn't treat me though about the timing of this let's say in fact there is not something strange that happens and I'm not writing off the possibility by the way that God Knows Jeff Flake decide something who knows\nBut if it is fifty to forty nine or fifty one forty nine the current Supreme Court term I Believe just recently started a few days ago right side of the first ... right right yes so Chad what would\nWould this sense be in the White House or on Capitol Hill are you hearing anything about the president's desire to get\nA a potential justice Kavanaugh to join the court by Monday so he can basically joined the active session is that generally accepted as as the timeframe here boy\nThat was the goal to get him on before the charm started you know and they can sort of that goal because of of having to have the extra research and having the hearing was Christine Blasey Ford last week so they blew past that deadline um\n[noise] ... either way I mean even if they closed this roll call vote on on Sunday Morning sometime in the wee hours or when people are going to church or whatever time might be they probably still be able to swear him in by Monday morning no matter what so you could go in and be participating and an oral arguments and going through paperwork and and all that stuff at the\nSupreme Court said that doesn't really speed things up that much or whether he is you actually you know where the person and on Saturday Night or not we have seen this administration moved quickly I remember some of the initial cabinet secretaries and people like that ah you know when they were checking through these in early twenties Seventeen and the Senate\nOr they were you know swearing them and sometimes in a matter of a couple of hours now the White House so uh we have seen them move expeditiously or in the past\nChat last question for a man a lot to work still today tonight the house is out in fashioning\nRight and I wonder what what's that word you used to [laughter] I Know I Know there's this other we have our by camera government you're sure about that I I'm not actually at the moment and it's\nGoing to do anything else of real substance before then they'd terms I mean they're basically a little over four weeks away ... what happens after that\nWell Mitch McConnell still has a slate of uh of judges that he'd like to get a concert\nAnd we'll see you know what that agreement might be how many people that Democrats\nWould agree to because you know they want to go home and campaign there were a lot of vulnerable Democrats in red states up this full of Mitch McConnell and a perfect world keeps them here as long as possible oh we we think that there'll be here at least about another week\nThey've cleared the deck of major uh legislation of this big opioids bill ... every authorizing the FAA was something else bipartisan\nAnd let me make a point on the two piece of legislation they did knock out in the past few days with very little fanfare um\nThey talk about how broken everything is you've heard that from Susan Collins remarks well they pass these two major piece of legislation on the FAA and opioids with very little fanfare and in very bipartisan fashion I Know last week we talked about this I guess what the government did not shut down why they worked in a bipartisan fashion so\nEven though there's all this German dragging over Brett Kavanaugh\nOn both sides of the aisle on the other hand\nI can point to three major things that have happened here on Capitol Hill in the past eight days where lawmakers from both parties really work together in harmony it's remarkable and it's gotten a zero coverage\nNow that is a very important perspective to end our discussion on here for this segment chat program thank you for your hard work please do get some sleep soon\nUm and we will have you leave rains office number there [laughter] have you on us well all all call 'em just say at the wedding have another glass of wine senator I should say have the ... and we were talking about the\nNeed indeed chat thank you thank you All right we're going to step aside we're going

will be a I've never seen war since prop really has been elected I've never seen more unity among Republicans will services then right now\nSo there is a segment of the Republican electorate this either\nAnti Trump or ambivalent about Trump and those folks for particularly suburban districts some suburban congressional districts in a certain stage there's always been a sense of lack of enthusiasm among those Republican votes they couldn't distinguish\nBetween Donald Trump and the Republican Party the whole thing was chaos and the whole thing was frustrating to them and they didn't want anything to do with it\nFor the first time in the last ten days I think the cabinet dynamic is transform that had been brought all Republicans regardless worth I think the president how\nWe are back on ... that was dance center longtime Republican eight and operative on CBS talking about the dynamic within the conservative movement the center right coalition\nAnd I think he's exactly right I think he has his finger on the pulse on the point that he just made welcome back its Bentsen in ... in Chicago today here for a wedding tomorrow congratulations ray and Jenna Marie ... my friend and broadcast partner is back in D.C\nAnd Murray I just want to talk briefly and expand a little bit on what center was saying a there's been a lot of divisiveness on the right or apathy ... on the right among\nThe various elements of the coalition um we tend to fight sometimes there's backbiting\nAnd this has been a mind focusing exercise I Wish we didn't have to come this way because it's I mean I'm I'm very gratified at what appears to be the outcome here but I'm not gratified at all by this process or like I I feel\nNot happiness like some degree of satisfaction but no happiness which is it's sort of an odd feeling to have after a significant political victory but these disparate elements I mean you had George W. Bush tweeting thank you use\nTo Susan Collins today ah you know you have the far right end of the party and the most moderate members of the party I think United in this sense of what we just went through and witnessed being not okay and as we've talked about in terms of polling in terms of\nUh anecdotes to the data plus the anecdotes people on the center right have been extremely fired up double digit increase in intensity among Republican women um and it's something that I've seen every single day for the last ten days fourteen days something like that\nAnd I think one of the political questions that we're gonna have to track for the next few weeks it's okay if in fact the confirmation goes as planned tomorrow and that boxers checked a significant one does some of that passion and anger on the right dissipate\nHead of the election or yeah or people on fire and they're like okay we cannot let the Democrats win this reminded us why and so let's all you know let's get out there in a way that they wouldn't have otherwise I think that's an open question\nI agree and I I Would split the Senate and the house unless actually start with the house there is recent pulling out from the New York times and Sienna college that it's looking at Kavanaugh's support in a congressional districts the ... suburban districts\nAnd us and the trumps districts where you know a lot of those are going to determine whether or not Democrats take the house\nThey found the cabinet support was lower and those suburban districts where Trump is already very unpopular right but it's higher in districts where President Trump has high approval ratings so I think when it because house districts are so weird I think when it comes to the house um\nIf it does anything it may fire up the last ... or or keep some of these suburban independent women who are really uncomfortable with President Trump I I actually think it may help Democrats but again I Do think it's an open question as well in the Senate though obviously much bigger voter pools here\nAnd Democrats are defending some really tough seats six I think it could help Republicans now I I uh so that sort of when you look at the house for the Senate um but but you're right forty or kidneys thirties plus days towards the mid term that's a long time\nAnd I think Republicans and you tell me if I'm wrong feel like it may feel like the fight it over on this right and so with when the fight it over a little of the fire goes away\nUm but you know we'll see I think this has galvanized Republicans in a way that we hadn't seen any other issue but ... not a do not rule out Donald Trump doing something crazy between now than ever\nRobot out between now and then the show ending\nExactly right yeah it's a reminder to sort of her mind some of those Republican women and some of these independent women\nOf like okay we Kevin always was an aberration and not a feature of what Republican rule will look like I don't know so it's it's an open question right I just don't know\nYou may qualify for substantial savings so get the help you need if\nYou owe more than ten thousand in taxes call for free information and to see if

Queens Judy thank you so much for calling tonight what are your thoughts on this issue\nFiber of sexual abuse so obviously all of this is very important to me but I have to tell you for women that are out there I've learned they believed and I don't doubt or Dr Ford that something happened to her but we have to be able to\nGive this guy an open and fair hearing and give him the presumption of innocence because that's what the law is all about and I listened to testimony on both sides and unfortunately for her I Believe although I Believe something happened there was nothing\nTo collaborate that was compelling to me to make me think that he had anything to do with it he could have\nBut it just didn't come about so what is the likelihood of here that he was involved that's where we have to deal with and the likelihood is based on what we were able to gather from everything from her\nWe can't prove that he was\nHe was involved in any of this I Do believe hurt my heart great for her I Know what it feels like\nTo be like I said I'm a survivor myself and I do feel\nThat based on and I'm sixty nine years old and this happened to me in my twenties by an attorney that I trust and it went on over a four year period I cried through the whole thing it made me relive everything all over again\nBut the law is the law and we have to abide by that because we don't then my son who's forty years forty seven years old and all the men out there have to worry that\nJust because a woman said something happened that they are going to be presumed guilty and we can't have that go on that would be a disaster for this country\nToday I Want to ask you thank you for sharing your story I yeah I appreciate that it's I'm sure not easy to do um and and I know a lot of folks who watch who are survivors who watch the hearing and we're reliving their own memories and it's been hard for people so I'm grateful that that you called in with your story Judy\nLast time you and I talked on this program I I think I remember correctly you said you would voted for President Trump but you were unhappy with some of the things he had done and to know the tone he had taken and you were at that point said you would probably not vote for him again at that moment\nHadn't been having a process impacted your support of him or the Republican Party at all\nOn the swing voter so I ... I voted on the field and not the party I don't think when you when you really when the when the dust settles and we clear the air the only thing that mattered at this point is that the Senate follow the law\nWhere they were able to determine because like I said this is not about a production and it's just\nThis isn't about beyond a reasonable doubt it's about what's the likelihood that he had anything to do what is what is your that might voting for Trump again no he has other things that I have to think about regarding yeah behavior that would impact that by Kavanaugh was treated very badly\nAnd presumed to be guilty when he what we don't know that for a fact that's not to say that he had something to do with any of this but we don't know that\nWe do know Judy I'm so sorry we have to cut you off or up on a break but thank you for sharing your story guy I Know we both are very grateful for that we have a lot of other callers we're going to take you after this break so stay on the line keep calling in day to\n\nDo that hey did you guys know that kids who play sports earn more money when they grow up [noise]\nOf course I\nKnew that hey did you guys know the kids who read books have a bigger vocabulary oh yeah absolutely [laughter] well I don't think [laughter] did you guys know that friendly children have more friends you know yeah yeah\nThat's true I knew that did you guys know the winter babies are better at music\nEveryone knows that [laughter] oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh hey guys did you know that most people think they're using the right car seat for their kid but they're not [noise] I didn't know that I'm pretty sure any of that I'm pretty sure he didn't\nParents who really know I don't know for sure that their child is in the right car seat at the right age and live visit they for car dot com bust a right to make sure your child is protected brought to you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council\nDishes Albuquerque progressive talk AM's Thirteen fifty K.

for brick cabinet or to the Supreme Court GOP Senator Susan Collins of Maine said there is nothing that Kavanaugh's record or accusations of sexual misconduct that will keep her from voting\nAnd you know when it using their heads everybody's being guided by their feelings and how they feel about things that are really researching you know\nThat the topic for each race Archie and let our government officials are running on\nI'm holding them accountable for it I think that I Am all for a hundred percent victims being heard I'm all for one hundred percent on that theme protected but I'm also one hundred percent for\nHaving some proof before you get an allegation such as what and that's a sport I'm alleged happened with judge Kavanaugh and I think that it's a very slippery slope that if we start believing everyone than just simply because she's a woman\nOn just because she said that this happens\nWe're going to find that this is going to be running rampant\nAngie are you happy that Kavanaugh appears to be set for confirmation then\nYes because there was no proof there was no proof you cannot in this nation just go round willy nilly alleging that things are happening to you and that this person did this thing and this person at that and then their entire lives completely isolated and ruined because\nSomeone said so that's not how our laws work that's not how we are protected as a nation and if we began to believe that way and we just say well they said it so it must be so we're in trouble\nYou know and yeah I I one of the things I've talked to that a lot as how difficult sexual assault cases are precisely because\nThey're often isn't a lot of evidence and this is something we as a country have to keep grappling with I don't want there to be a backlash now

really good job walking a fine line\nOf both defending due process um but showing compassion and respect for her for and I just wanted to go on record as saying that needs to be talk more about\nInteresting that so that's an interesting given your background yeah watched the hearings did you think the hearings were fair or do you feel like the process now that is almost over ... large has been relatively fair based on your background and your expertise\nI Do a generally do um\nI have a lot of questions as a clinical psychologist some forensic psychologist that I was eating curious to explore I think what we forget is that outside of the scope of the Senate and I think given what the Senate's responsibility is and the effects that would be for them I think it's as close to justice says we could get it and I I Am happy with the outcome\nAnd I think together Republican senators that I Do I think they did a really good job of walking a very delicate line they could have just either did one direction and the kind of go on a very different ways so\nBrad renting so much for the call ... and tonight so many people were interesting calls yes really interesting calls and I think people are exhausted by it\nAnd I said earlier we both are it wasn't just a hearing it's all of the days since um I think we should all take some time this weekend no matter what happens to like

way\nAlthough I think we feel differently about the likelihood of our teams winning a which is often the case may be in the northwestern found her being in Ohio State fan Murray we'll get into our games injustice sec but looking at the other big games not a ton on the calendar of a match ups have ranked teams this week\nWhich of the big three or four games are you most looking forward to watching\nYeah so so I played it for which is a weird time so in terms of the the evening game that's Notre Dame at Virginia Tech I really don't like Notre Dame and I don't think you do either for instance\n... exactly pick a conference put on your pants and you know have to win a conference in Blacksburg which I think it's a tough place to play so I'm going to be watching that game a\nAnd also Oklahoma Texas that's an early game that's the noon eastern game I also really don't like Oklahoma I'm for various reasons yeah I'm like\nWell what I generally don't like teams that when they beat you and your home turf they plant their flag out of a yard line yet and act like sort of jerks um this game as in Dallas that the cotton ball actually so it'll be ... the red river shoot out a natural language rivalry game\nAlways a big rivalry game the other game I'm looking for guy is this LSU forty game at three thirty at Easter analyses ranked ... after this last week of games LSU quarterback as we've talked about is a transfer from Ohio State and I will say last week when our quarterback wasn't looking too good in the first task\nThere were people saying can we get Joe Burrow back from LA\nToo much and that's not how it works but LSU I think is really one of the sleeper really really good teams that could make it into the playoffs this year how they handle at Florida in Gainesville I think will be really interesting\nI also think of those two games we were just talking about Red River and then LSU Florida the other teams that we haven't talked about really Texas and Florida these are both traditional powerhouse programs that have been down\nFor a number of years a lot of frustration in Austin a lot of frustration in Gainesville than Raul they're both back into the rankings will be a low Nineteen for ... twenty Jupiter, Florida but Texas is a quality wins under their belt they lost in week one Maryland but aside from that I you know their win against TCU was impressive and now\nIt's a rivalry day Oklahoma's their number one photo and they're really really good at\nTexas fans are hungry for a victory in this game will see an end to compete and in Florida I don't I don't know if I'm going to say that they're back\nBut to some extent they're back so I'll definitely there way back\nI think that that's a fair way of putting it off so angry at Northwestern at Michigan State Michigan State rank number twenty\nOr not only have we lost three game straight not only are we gonna shut out three times in the second half out of four games to of our best position players are now in Jordan out not to mention our star running back who's out for his career now\nSo so if I had to say that I Am\nPessimistic about our chances in East Lansing you meanwhile have Ohio State hosting Indiana which is an interesting dynamic you're loving team versus your alma mater\nHow do you negotiate those feelings when nine out of happens every year\nWell it's interesting so my dad also went to Indiana and he got his PHD there but then taught at Ohio State for Thirty years he's going to the game tomorrow um my mom also got her undergrad Indiana at graduate degree at Ohio State\nSo we all are a little conflicted but I I honestly guy even through college when I was in Bloomington I read it for the buck eyes\nAnd anti rental I'll was actually in the NFL quarterback when I was there so we were not terrible India is one of those teams that can give you fight 'em they're scrappy and I think they're up and coming like I think they could be a sort of rising mid level big tent teen they're not quite there yet but I mean\nYou'd be mad if Indiana Ohio State I ... Oh yes Oh yes I Would be very mad if if India and it'd be the highest day I don't get are not going to Ohio state's good I think I think\nThey're doing I think Ohio State you know we're up to a third in the rankings this week but we had we had we lost a hundred and five yards last week against Penn State to penalties really stupid dumb penalty so I think are going to get a little get a little disappointed in our players\nYeah I mean and but but all that being said you look at their record and two words driver's seat\nAnd the big ... that may oh I mean if I Know I Know how that goes is a sports fan but I'd rather be in the driver's seat I've never been in the driver's seat as in northwestern vents are All right well we are done for the week uh we'll be watching of course the News Tomorrow but\nAlso college football because that's what Saturdays were designed for by God um and so that's I think that's in the Bible somewhere so\nIt was hanging out in the New Testament brand new week next week we look forward to talking to you then the best hard\nTake an ordinary potty knife and scrape off the old wax ring police the new X. ring over the flinch in line up to ... with a bowl and gently sending place making sure a proper seal is created with the ... drain next um\nA sweetie\n...\nOh I'm yeah [laughter] yeah I mean we really need to get to know All right um do do you want me to stop yeah\nOkay tightened ... line up the flushing vows to the opening in the top of the bowl and secure the tank with a screwdriver and\nCrushes range the smallest moments can have the biggest impact on a child's life take time to be a dead today goalie seven seven four dead for one way or the other who dug up to you by the U.S department of health and Human Services and the ad council [noise]\nThis is Albuquerque progressive talk AM's Thirteen fifty ... is available everywhere he wants to listen on our free eye on radio ad downloaded now American hostage\nHi Ronald Reagan stylish where I was actually execute the office of president\nUnited States [noise]\nAm control here in the White House and he returned vice president\nAnd the labor and twenty five years and the only thing that everyone from a strike or the lawyers trial\nBy where they live so long\nIn the Wii is videos with music as a young meat is not my function to continue to try to develop public policy by means of making the long use\nAs it happens then you have is now gone [noise]\nFollow am Thirteen fifty on Twitter for the latest news updates just go to a B.

we've got ... program um senior Capitol Hill producer for Fox News joining us on the line now Chad or just to get going here we were just talking to them quite a bit of a of Susan Collins speech from today and talking about it\nLeading up to that speech everyone was guessing no one knew how where is it for ... made a decision of that sort of important not to leak out in advance\nWell we've seen it before we didn't quite know last summer a year ago and change where John McCain was going to vote on health care but you know we had questions about the tax\nBill I mean it it is not unprecedented and why we have such high drama around here sometimes to know exactly how although it's going to do it\nSo it's not not rare to to to go in with people biding their fingernails and and and and vetting and trying to figure out reading tea leaves understanding how roll call vote of this magnitude is going to go [noise]\n... what are the next twenty four hours look like why our listeners\nWhen are we going to get a final no one will be\nDone now did you say twenty four hours or did you say thirty six hours I'm going to throw a wild card at your hair ... okay\nSo we are on the clock right now the rule is in the Senate once you invoke cloture vote to end debate that's the term of art here on the side and the Senate by a clock that runs for thirty hours starts to pick a which means that they would have uh the confirmation vote at four fifty two eastern time\nOn Saturday afternoon that's three hours from when they ended debate now they don't have to use all thirty hours and it's typical sometimes you'll back that time but uh but we've been told to expect the Senate to be an all night and around the clock and demar afternoon now here's the wildcard we think this vote is going to go fifty one forty not\nBased on the the announcements by\nA Susan Collins and Joe Manchin Steve Gaines the Republican senator from Montana it has made it abundantly clear that he supports a wreck Kavanaugh he really wants to be here\nIf his vote is necessary he will be here but Steve Gaines is supposed to walk his daughter down the aisle in Montana Saturday\nAnd he'd do in that way or another and\nHe is doing that now the question is will they keep that vote\nOpen in other words you could have you could confirm\nBrett Kavanaugh fifty forty nine now it's not like there was a well fifty one forty nine is one more vote you don't get style points when you do this you know this isn't like the Olympics where they say well you know Brett Kavanaugh was a confirmed the Supreme Court but it was when the ... like they do it in the Olympics and he looked at the record book and they put a little asterisk by the\nBy the ... no no no they don't do that [noise] would they really keep the Senate in all night Saturday\nProbably into the wee hours of Sunday probably Sunday Morning because you know the two hour time difference a\nThere's a lot of you know they they have to land at Dulles Airport so at least maybe forty five minutes to just to get from there to hear a would they really keep the\nSenate in an additional twelve Thirteen fourteen hours just to get to Steve Gaines here on a fate accompli so it's fifty one forty nine versus fifty forty nine that's up to Mitch McConnell we don't know the answer to that question let it let me right now the brick capital we've confirmed whether it be with or without the voter Steve games\nOn the Danes thing um which is just it's amazing how outside events can affect politics is is a long planned a wedding for his daughter\nAnd by the way let me just fortunately say on the record\nYou go to your daughter's wedding period I Know this is a hugely important vote but that's a hugely important day in the wife and his family and I'm Glad that he's making that decision um\nI Wonder ... if you think that it may be up to McConnell were partially attitude to Danes could Danes say I know my vote may not be absolutely necessary but this is\nA really important one for me to cast and therefore please do hold it open is that something where he might make that decision for himself and McConnell will sort of bowed to what Danes decides\nIt is up to Mitch McConnell if he decides to do that\nI just Mitch McConnell really want to keep the centered in another twelve Thirteen hours we've had some pretty long days up here in the Senate will have already been in session all night\nOn friday night into Saturday and do that again what about the staff here on Capitol Hill you have to have at least one presiding officer meaning you have to have one senator presiding I was told initially that Mike Pence the vice president was going to preside not necessarily to break a vote just it's a big vote and so my question is what does he come in at\n... you know four o'clock in the afternoon or does he come six o'clock in the morning on Sunday I mean really I but what do you do when you close the vote or they're operational considerations there\nAre windows President Trump wants his justice Warren ... does he say I want to wear it and then on Saturday Night [noise] um the longest vote in Senate history\nHappened on the stimulus package in February of ... not right five hours and Fifteen minutes and the reason it took so long as they needed the vote of democratic Ohio Senator Sherrod brown his mother had passed away in Cleveland he flew to the wake they held the vote open they needed sixty votes on that particular vote\nHe came back cast a vote they pass the stimulus bill sixty to thirty eight\nOr so you're talking about adding to that record going from five hours and Fifteen minutes to somewhere in the neighborhood of fourteen Fifteen hours\nFor the longest vote in Senate history [noise] wow [noise]\nCat have you slept at all no I mean do you need ... I mean\nIf I needed something to drink I Need to sleep now [laughter] ... especially if we're here\nTonight and then tomorrow night as Steve Danes we're waiting for Steve days to fly back from Montana\nIt sounded like you might you might be rooting for a certain outcome on the Danes thing chat and I can't blame you but you know ready to go around the box\nAnd that's where I you said something I didn't treat me though about the timing of this let's say in fact there is not something strange that happens and I'm not writing off the possibility by the way that God Knows Jeff Flake decide something who knows\nBut if it is fifty to forty nine or fifty one forty nine the current Supreme Court term I Believe just recently started a few days ago right side of the first ... right right yes so ... what would\nThe would the sense be in the White House or on Capitol Hill are you hearing anything about the president's desire to get\nA a potential justice Kavanaugh to join the court by Monday so he can basically joined the active session is that generally accepted as as the timeframe here boy\nThat was the goal to get him on before the term started you know and they were to that goal because of of having to have the extra research and having the hearing was Christine Blasey Ford last week so they blew past that deadline um\n[noise] either way I mean even if they closed this roll call vote on on Sunday Morning sometime in the wee hours or when people are going to church or whatever time might be they probably still be able to swear him in by Monday morning no matter what so you could go in and be participating in\nAn oral arguments and you're going through paperwork and and all that stuff at the Supreme Court so that doesn't really speed things up that much or whether you if you actually you know swear the person on Saturday Night or not\nWe have seen this administration moved quickly I remember some of the initial cabinet secretaries and people like that to you know when they were checking through these in early twenties Seventeen in the Senate\nWell they were you know swearing them and sometimes in a matter of a couple of hours now the White House so uh we have seen them move expeditiously or in the past\nCat last question for me in a lot to work don't produce tonight for house is out in session right\nAnd I don't wear what what's that word used out now I Know there's this I think we have our by camera government you sure about that I I'm not actually at the moment and it's\nGoing to do anything else of real substance before them in terms I mean they're basically a little over four weeks away what happens after that\nWell Mitch McConnell still has a slate of ah of judges that he'd like to get to confirm\nAnd we'll see you know what that agreement might be how many people the Democrats\nAre would agree to because you know they want to go home and campaign there are a lot of vulnerable Democrats in red states up this fall Mitch McConnell in a perfect world would like to keep them here as long as possible uh we we think that there'll be here at least about another week they've cleared the deck of\nMajor uh legislation of this big opioids bill ... every authorizing the FAA was something else bipartisan\nAnd let me make a point on the two piece of legislation they did knock out in\nThe past few days with very little fanfare um\nThey talk about how broke and everything is you've heard that from Susan Collins remarks will they pass these two major piece of legislation on the FAA and opioids with very little fanfare and a very bipartisan fashion\nI Know last week we talked about this what the government did not shut down why they worked in a bipartisan fashion so even though there's all this German dragging over Brett Kavanaugh on both sides of the aisle on the other hand\nI can point to three major things that have happened here on Capitol Hill in the past eight days where lawmakers from both parties really work together in harmony it's remarkable and it's gotten a zero coverage\nThe latest in a long line of ... in in you know I don't know issues [noise]\nWell I mean I agree with what you're saying not all of it obviously um I think that there was a sense and Susan Collins talked about it uh I think pretty eloquently as well talking about the balance that needs to be struck between\nAcknowledging a moment and seeking justice based on facts and evidence of any particular case which is what she sought to do what I've been seeking to do regarding judge Kavanaugh\nUm and I think in terms of open season I think some people could have handled this Betty better on all sides because to some extent there's open season on Republicans in terms of threats and vicious comments as well it's been\nIt's been an ugly exhausting process [noise]\nIt has we're gonna take a break we'll be right back\n[noise]\n\nCompelling\n[noise]\n\n\nI think he will be a I've never seen war since ... really has been elected I've never seen more unity among Republicans will serve it is that right now\nSo there is a segment of the Republican electorate is either anti Trump for ambivalent about Trump\nAnd those folks for particularly suburban districts suburban congressional districts in certain states there's always been a sense of lack of enthusiasm among those Republicans are words that couldn't distinguish between Donald Trump and the Republican Party the whole thing was chaos and the whole thing was frustrating to them and they didn't want anything to do with it\nFor the first time in the last ten days I think the cabinet dynamic has transformed that than brought all Republicans regardless of what they think the president how we are\nBack on ... that was dance center longtime Republican eight an operative on CBS talking about the dynamic within the conservative movement the center right coalition\nAnd I think he's exactly right I think he has his finger on the pulse on the point that he just made welcome back it's been hard guy Bentsen in Chicago today here for a wedding tomorrow congratulations ray and Jenna Marie ... my friend and broadcast partner is back in D.C\nAnd Murray I just want to talk briefly and expand a little bit on what center was saying a there's been\nA lot of divisiveness on the right or apathy rent ... on the right among the various elements of the coalition um we tend to fight sometimes there's back biting and\nThis has been a mind focusing exercise I Wish we didn't have to come this way because it's I mean I'm I'm very gratified at what appears to be the outcome here but I'm not gratified at all by this process uh like I I feel\nNot happiness like some degree of satisfaction but no happiness which is it's sort of an odd feeling to have after a significant political victory but these disparate elements I mean you had George H W. Bush tweeting thank you use\nTo Susan Collins today ah you know you have the four right end of the party and the most moderate members of the party I think United in this sense of what we just went through and witnessed being not okay and as we've talked about in terms of polling in terms of\nUh anecdotes so the data plus the anecdotes people on the center right had been extremely fired up double digit increase in intensity among Republican women um and it's something that I've seen every single day for the last ten days fourteen days something like that\nAnd I think one of the political questions that we're going to have to track for the next few weeks it's okay if in fact the confirmation goes as planned tomorrow in that box is checked a significant one does some of that passion in anger on the right dissipate\nThe head of the election or are people on fire and they're like okay we cannot let the Democrats win this reminded us why and so let's all you know let's get out there in a way that they wouldn't have otherwise I think that's an open question [noise]\nI agree and I I Would split the Senate and the house and let's actually start with the house there is recent pulling out from the New York times and Sienna college that it's looking at Kavanaugh's support in a congressional districts the ... suburban districts\nAnd passing the trumps districts where you know a lot of those are going to determine whether or not Democrats take the house\nThey found the cabinet support was lower end those suburban districts where Trump is already very unpopular right but it's higher and districts where President Trump has higher approval ratings so I think when it because house districts are so weird I think that when it comes to the house\nUm if it does anything it may fire up the last or or keep some of these suburban independent women who are really uncomfortable with President Trump I I actually think it may help Democrats but again I Do think it's an open question as well in the Senate though\nObviously much bigger voter pools here\nAnd Democrats are defending some really tough seats ... I think it could help Republicans now I I uh so that's sort of when you look at the house for the Senate um but but you're right forty or excuse me thirty plus days towards the mid term that's a long time\nAnd I think Republicans and you tell me if I'm wrong I feel like it may feel like the fight it over on the right and so when when the fight is over a little the fire goes away\nUm but you know we'll see I think this has galvanized Republicans in a way that we hadn't seen any other issue but I Do not a do not rule out Donald Trump doing something crazy between now than ever\nRobot out between now and then the show ending\nExactly right yes remind to sort of her mind some of those Republican women some of these independent women of like\nAnd we used to be our technology just showing that helped climate I used to additional companies joy but dozens of people just like you who chose invent failed to pursue their idea we're experience we are working for you we are in bed\nFellows for free information to one eight hundred and five four or five zero Seventy five that's one eight hundred five four or five zero seven eight five again one eight under five four or five zero seven eight five\nA special message for those who owe the IRS at least ten thousand or more in back taxes\nThe IRS has special programs in place that could eliminate or reduce your tax dead by thousands of dollars go all the federal tax management help line that has been set up for you eight hundred to three three eighty five forty stop the wage garnishment celebrities in tax liens now\nOnce you've qualified and enroll the IRS will stop all the collection activities against you these unique programs have been allocated to help the economy and significantly reduce or eliminate your tax burden the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements and other favorable programs\nYou may qualify for substantial savings so get the help you need\nIf you owe more than ten thousand in taxes call for free information and to see if you qualify ... down the number now for the federal tax management hotline eight hundred to three three eighty five forty that's eight hundred to three three eighty five forty eight hundred to three three eighty five forty\n[noise]\nShe's come back to Benson and horrify Marie ... in Washington DC tonight guy ... is with us too he's in Chicago [noise] he there for a wedding this\nWeekend and the guy the phone lines are absolutely lighting up eight three three four five six Thirteen hundred let's start with Judy in Queens Judy thank you so much for calling tonight what are your thoughts on this issue\nFiber of sexual abuse so obviously all of this is very important to me but I have to tell you for women that are out there I've learned they believed and I don't doubt adopted forward that something happened to her but we have to be able to\nGive this guy and open and fair hearing and give him the prevention of in a sense because that's what the law it's all about and I listen to your testimony on both sides and unfortunately for her I Believe although I Believe something happened there was nothing\nTo collaborate that was compelling to me to make me think that he had anything to do with it he could have\nBut it just didn't come about so what is the likelihood of here that he was involved that's where we have to deal with and the likelihood is based on what we were able to gather from everything from her\nAnd he can't prove that he was\nHe was involved in any of this I Do believe hurt my heart great for her I Know what it feels like\nTo be like I said I'm a survivor myself and I do feel\nThat based on and I'm sixty nine years old and this happened to me in my twenties by an attorney that I trust it and it went on over a four year period I cried through the whole thing it made me relive everything all over again\nBut the law is the law and we have to abide by that because we don't\nThen my son who's forty or forty seven years old and all the men out there have to worry that just because a woman says something happened that they're going to be presumed guilty and we can't have that go on that would be a disaster for this country\nToday I Want to ask you thank you for sharing your story I yeah I appreciate that it's I'm sure not easy to do um and and I know a lot of folks who watch who are survivors who watch the hearing and we're reliving their own memories and it's been hard for people so I'm grateful that that you called in with your story Judy\nLast time you and I talked on this program I I think I remember correctly you said you would voted for President Trump but you were unhappy with some of the things he had done and said oh the tone he had taken and you were at that point said you would probably not vote for him again at that moment\nHave they have in our process impacted your support of him or the Republican Party at all\nOn the swing voter so I ... I voted on the field and not the party I don't think when you when you really when the when the dust settles and we clear the air the only thing that matters at this point is if the Senate follow the law\nWhere they were able to determine because like I said this is not about a production and it's just\nThis isn't about beyond a reasonable doubt it's about what's the likelihood that he had anything to do with is what it is that my voting for Trump again no he has other things that I have to think about regarding yeah behavior that would impact that by Kavanaugh was treated very badly\nAnd presumed to be guilty when he well we don't know that for a fact that's not to say that he had something to do with any of this but we don't know that\nWe don't know right and Judy ... sorry ... we have to cut you off or up on a break but thank you for sharing your story guy you know we both are very grateful for that we have a lot of other callers we're going to take you after this break so stay on the line keep calling in they did [noise]\n\n\n[noise] okay gang so chances are they'll never be an emergency ever ever again ... just in case let's talk about a plant okay so who's going to do what anyone uh yeah OK perfect we'll figure it out as we go so who is going to grab to go back\nGo bag it is a bag we do not have that is filled with things we really really need in an emergency you got me want to have to worry about it than a\nGood point [noise] so are we all know who to call if something happens then right\nI'd have to call Jill Devon Melissa can and breathe and I tried to call a view that Greg doesn't have a cell phone dad's phone will have a dead battery and Julie will be on the phone with Jill ...

Howard show where it's all about you and learning ways to keep more of what you may [noise]\nWhen I talked to people who are would be entrepreneur [noise]\nPeople like the idea of being their own boss\nThere's a common question I'm asked by somebody who has the entrepreneurial\nSpirit but they don't know what they want to do over and over again they say well if you were looking for where you thought there was opportunity in business where would you go and I always give the same answer\nAnd that is if you want to succeed in your own business you gotta do what you love\nAnd you've got to be willing to work as many hours as it takes even if it's seven days a week in order to build your business\nIs another thing I say is well\nBefore you start a business make sure your own personal financial houses in order\nBecause there's too much risk and the start up a business if your own finances are on fumes and then I say one other thing and that is your personal life needs to be okay\nI Will say it has to be perfect there's got to be OK if your personal life is too Moultrie was been likely it's not a good time in your life to start your own business and so those things I mean what I said they're doing what you love\nHaving your personal financial act together first having your personal life together all those things I mean that's advice you'd probably see just about well you might not see it everywhere for entrepreneurs but I think he'd see it pretty as common advice\nAnd then there's other stuff about the business plan and all that stuff but this is a different wrinkle I Want to bring to you and it's about the demographic time bomb we face in the United states and you think about\nHow Social Security is running short of money Medicare is running short of money why because we're an aging population\nWe have\nPeople who are getting older\nEvery day without as many young people coming up to take their place we have a birth rate in the United states that is not necessarily even replacement population so we're an aging country\nAnd so that creates opportunity I've been reading all this stuff about what's going on in Japan which is like Twenty years ahead of us on this\nAnd all the things they're doing in Japan to try to deal with labor shortage and an aging population so I'm going to talk about something right now briefly did is different than what I normally talk with an entrepreneur about which is doing what you love\nWhat I Would say is an annex or an amendment do you what you love find something you love it specifically feeds into the fact that the number of older people in the United states is going to double over a generation\nDouble over a generation\nSo we're going to have a massive number of people who are going to need all different kinds of assistance as they age\nIt is perhaps our nation's largest growth industry when you look forward so when you're looking for where there's opportunity\nRight now\nAnd for years to come decades to come it's going to be how do we meet the needs of an aging population you find that hole and the market you find that need and you're gonna find opportunity\nGot to do those other

I think that's\nGot to be any solid for 'em but she may you know and the lane is all about the labor market up there and and so uh so I think she'll she'll try you know she like she got laid off along the way for sure\nYeah so I'm may\nYou know has the oldest population in the United states\nOh if I remember right the oldest average population and there's enormous need for people with her skill set and a senior facilities and involved with aging\nWell and that may be an area she hasn't looked at with the degree she's gotten the skill set she has but I Would definitely encourage her to look in that area as a potential employment\nShe's looking at ... monthly payments of what about two hundred and Seventy five a month is that what it is\nYeah I think that's a I guess\nWell that was quick math in my head okay so even if she's working as a waitress\nTill she finds she wants to do she can come up with two Seventy five a month\nYeah and I do not want you to take on this is your responsibility I think you said at yourself a minute ago you said when she saw with her payment was going to be it got are more focused on a career\nThat's true\nAt all I think I think you don't ride to the rescue here and you wouldn't do ... you indulge your six and a half years in school and it two hundred and Seventy five a month she can make that happen\nCocoa and let her be responsible for these so I Would not look at I Would have\nGot a lot of safety net for something that it can I say if a fight it just ...\nBut even as a waitress that's not a whole past for you to make those minimum payments for her\nShe should be making those I the discipline\nNeeds to start with her because if you just come not as a backstop like you just describe but instead urine first position\nThen there's never a sense of urgency on her part to take ownership of the loans and be the one who's paying on them I think she needs that discipline\nIn order to get her moving towards I I really got to get going on getting this job and let her try that senior thing I talked about and see if that generates any job leads for her best to her\nMatthew's with us on the car coward show Hi Matthew\nHello how you doing I'm good\nSo your wife's credit card though isn't good what happened\nHere about two months ago I was a just check it all the cards as I use it in the morning and I saw that a car came across on her car about nine hundred dollars but I called her and asked her if she did is that now so I called the company that the charges that the late ...\nAnd gave them credit card number and said hey I'm yeah I think this was he was ... and ... and they so they can cancel it but they ... the card and refunding the amount\nWell then I go to the bank and record it recorded the cards so the bank just took her to a little charge straight off that Lizzie a refund that money and\nSo my biggest question was do I need to wait around for the banks kind of figure out that little extra they\nWere when you got money twice\nYes I got the money back twice\nOkay tell your bank [laughter]\nSo I figure yeah I mean you don't want to be in a position where you're like hey I got one over on the bank everybody hates the bass anyway I scored one on the net or tell them you realize you just realize that you've got the refund twice\nRight and uh just that's how you tell them and say how do I make sure you get your money back\nOkay and leave it to them administratively and they may tell you you know we hate you Matthew you're wasting our time I got to get to the next call\nWhy are you trying to give us our money back [laughter] you have people calling so all I Want you to do is do the right thing and there'll be up to the bank to do with it should do but they may they may tell you\nThat uh stopped bothering us and just go away but at least tell them\nThat way so yeah I'm enjoying the negative ballots so we were paying any uh any kind of interest or anything\nRight I've got actually yeah and I bet it's best to do the right thing that problem\nOkay daycare I got to tell you something we talked about on the air before with uh when I bought a bicycle on a dot com and they never charged me for it\nAnd we're actually pay charge me for it and then they accidentally refunded it called customer know service at the company and kept telling them that I needed to pay the money\nAnd the person was like so annoyed with me that I was wasting their time and never I still have not paid for that bicycle it feels wrong feels terrible we called him and said hey I owe you money you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nIn the winter games have you seen ...\nDot com ...
