T. shirts dot com slash tough [noise] so let's check in which our\nMedia news and find out what's going on in the world today this report brought to you by goats for the old goat dot com and loving what you do well in ... new book on the line with us is look Vargas that she foreign correspondent for talk media news from the United nations in New York you can follow him on Twitter at the career Luke uh the pope Francis thinking about going to North Korea\n[noise] he is and the experts I've talked to think this is actually likely to happen that you are seeing kind of a a real orientation of Pope Francis is geographic priority over the last few months\nI don't know if you ended up covering this uh at the end of last month late September but I did not China and he made a big controversial deal with the Chinese government who for decades a little bit like they have their own pension Lama right they have basically\nBeen appointing you know state ... Catholic bishops to state backed\nCatholic Church which the Vatican had always considered to be in ... I'm right not part of the official Catholic family and a Pope Francis went to China he recognized the state appointed bishops and said look I understand this is\nGoing to cause some suffering to people who consider themselves true Catholics who follow the Vatican there's going to look like\nA negative compromise but it was part of sort of a deal but it's been explained to me as a you know in the hopes of\nA big causing the Chinese government to respect Catholics in China more in the long run by doing that and I think there's a possibility to see some mirroring of of how that would go in North Korea of course that North Korea doesn't allow their population to openly practice religions but there is a Catholic\nChurch in Pyongyang where a lot of diplomats and other people go and and the thinking uh on the Vatican side is that look this is a away for Kim Jong noon to bolster his regime to be seen as\nExtra legitimate but we're not President Trump were not bound by the same sort of political calculations this is about it you know of Angela's Asian of a new part of the world work at all system hasn't flourished\nAnd let's also note that there have been people troops in the past where there were concerns it was going to play into the hands\nOf a government think back just three years ago Pope Francis goes to Cuba he wasn't terribly outspoken against the the regime there but he did talk about the desire for people to have greater freedom he said Cuba should open itself up to the world that was seen as\nSort of suddenly advancing political priorities in the Bible back the clock\nTo the early Nineteen eighties ... jump all the second goes to Nicaragua under the sand in eastern government\nThe fender nieces were really excited for Francis or rather a Pope John Paul to go there they thought he would basically condemn American support for the contras\nAnd instead the pope on leashes on the Sandinistas for their human rights abuses so they're sort of an interesting history here of popes sort of having the freedom to be able to defy expectations let's let's see if this does it happens it would certainly be a very interesting one\nThat would be fascinating meanwhile you've got these are people from Guatemala mostly of families that so I you know seen the pictures a lot of kids\nAre people fleeing I mean you know Guatemala and Honduras bad both had military coups El Salvador you know there's been run by death squads over and all this goes back to Reagan I mean he's the want to rip to this area part I don't know why we as a country are not helping put you know these countries put themselves back together\nA instead when there are people flee and they are more than a half million people have fled Guatemala just in the last year when there are people flee\nA you know if Trump freaks out or or actually he's he's loving it I think oh you know there's three thousand in our Guatemalans hadn't for the United states through Mexico and of course they're traveling together because that that's how you avoid being\nKidnapped or murdered by by Mexican criminal elements who who pray on loan travelers who are trying to make it to to North America so what's Mexico likely to do about that\nYeah well I think you're right to diagnose sort of hypocrisy of of the government response here I mean on one hand when this caravan sets off earlier this week the president's threatening to nix are aid to Honduras which is predominantly directed towards\nAnti crime you know helping the judge judicial institutions which are seen as\nThe weak points of that society which caused people need to leave in the first place so that would seem self defeating he doesn't look like he's going to cancel that a but it's a it's a very sort of a ... odd instinct that he has\nAnd then you are right again about people traveling groups I mean we are basically trying to uh we are advancing narrative at least at the U.S government\nThat we are trying to dissuade illegal immigration because it's unsafe pride and it allows a you know smugglers or human smugglers to profit so here these people are\nAre banding together and going through official asylum channels to stay safe and yet we're also condemning them for doing that and you're right Fox News here on this talks about illegals trying to breach the border which is not at all a part of their plans but it looks like in this case Mexico\nIs going to react differently than I did in April the big difference there is that they've now got that NAFTA deal rights and eat the relationship with Trump has been passed over a little bit ah unlike in April and Mexico gave the caravan the first minute left or a bunch of trends of permits\nWhich allow these people to go across Mexico the Mexican government here at the Guatemalan\nBorder is basically stopping people they're saying if you don't have transit papers to come through Mexico and if you're not going to apply for asylum in Mexico then we're going to have to turn your back\nUm and they have asked I think and this is responsible policy they've asked the United nations refugee agency to come to the border there and help process these claims rapidly and I'm going to be true the good Mexico's not safe everywhere but it is becoming more and more a place that is recognized as safe at least in part\nAs a place for people fleeing violence in the northern trying to Central America to go so I think Mexico that changed his tune here they want to preserve the slightly improved relationship with the United states\nReal quick on the road of change when al all becomes president like a whole animal to last I don't know I think there are a lot of signs of theirs continuity and the government and the current government in many ways coordinating with the incoming one to preserve the U.S relationship with along that's good that's very good so far as we talk media news you can follow him on Twitter at think Korea sank it

reporter yeah so it was obviously not a good thing\nFor Greg June fourteenth to do like you don't assault anyone you definitely do not sold a journalist when you're a political candidate but it was the very end of the race and he won anyway so and now he's a Republican hold so last night Trump was giving a shout out\nTo Greg gee unfortunately I\nAnd then cut one here's what he said\nWhat Greg is smart and by the way it never wrestle him [noise]\n\nGod let your body slammed much I should say that there's nothing in Russia when doors Greg very early but I had heard that he body slams a reporter\nWhich he did and then the president went on to say I thought it would hurt him but it helped them and well guy\nI Know Donald Trump you this crazy rhetoric but two things came to my mind when I saw this this morning when I woke up first we are still dealing with the situation where a reporter for the or a columnist for the Washington Post was likely killed\nBeheaded dismembered murdered\nBy the Saudi Government and the Trump Administration is in the middle of dealing with that situation so maybe we shouldn't joke about violence against journalists\nAnd also there's been so much uproar on the right but Donald Trump says Democrats are promoting violence their quote the mob Democrats are promoting all this violence this is this is\nIn sheer violence against the reporter it's just still I mean I Can't say this Everytime Donald Trump said something that I find grotesque and anti democratic and offensive but like he was cheering this\nYeah it would have been a take on it he was at least joking about it and you shouldn't right ... shouldn't have done what he did and there is an inherent contradiction so when Trump's talking about the mob on the left I actually think that there is something of a mob mentality on the left it's\nThat crosses lines into dangerous territory we saw that this week with a number of assaults against Republican\nCandidates are on the I think there is some of that nature that both sides I I'm just saying in terms of candles being physically assaulted it's happened twice this week to Republicans and to a staffer it's it's not okay at all\nAnd for Trump to rightly called out\nYou know mob action and violence on the left it under cuts the message\nHey when he was at his rallies when twenty sixteen and saying oh beat up the protest or I'll pay for your legal fees and he pretended he never said it what he did because on tape and then this thing like I think the last thing that Greg June forte frankly\nWants to be associated with himself moving forward is this moment where he completely lost his composure and and attacked a reporter I like I Can't imagine the gene flaming\nMaybe I don't know like I\nI Would like for gene for did it come out and say something about that because Donald Trump is the head of the party and he was celebrating it he was making light of it he was basically complimenting it I mean my he's my kind of guy he's my kind of guy\nNever never wrestle him you know that was that was sort of the the tone of it I just think it's a pretty bright line is that it should not be acceptable\nIn basically any contact whatsoever to physically assault a journalist if you're anyone especially if you're a candidate for office and if you do and if you really screw up and you lose control of yourself\nAnd and you face the repercussions for it I Know he end up getting elected anyway but you know it's not it's not a good thing to do it should not then be\nCelebrated right that that's not so by the president like right like what I mean I get like at some point\nGuy you say you don't like it I say I don't like it even some members of Congress say they don't like it but like\nThere's never any consequences for now at least there hasn't been any consequences around from so far now and it was like you have people go out and vote against his party in the mid term because of his rhetoric and part there will be but yeah I mean the Clinton see\nI and I try to pick my spots because I think a lot of people in the media freaked out about way too much the Trump says and tweets and I think sometimes they take his joking\nTo literally or it's it's too much self importance in hand wringing and that sort of thing and for example and I don't want to go down this path but I Know you and I have a disagreement about Pocahontas and the way that he says that right in that joke\nI put this in a different category right like I think I'd I'd try to identify things wear\nLess either AOL defend it 'cause it's funny or be it's just whatever it's not worth criticizing this one's worth criticizing now the counterpoint to counter point was made by one of his sons\nToday on out numbered the hash tag one lucky guy on the Fox news couch was Eric Trump and in ... three here's how he said it's a joke it's just fun it's anti PC take a listen\nWhen it wasn't the guy your body slammed anybody can\nThey can have fun I mean by the way this is actually exactly when my father one because there's so many people are so sick and tired of\nAll caged the perfect the perfectly scripted politician memorize or a little sound bite and they went out there and they had no crowds and they weren't any fun and they had no\nCharisma they had no personality to go out and say as as as a guy who's a little bit is on the sci fi movie one because he's on pay say anybody who body slam somebody like on a guy in joke about in the old crowds laughing with stuff\nNo I mean this this is this is in theory and to me because I heard from the right\nFor eight years when I worked for Brock Obama\nEverything Brock Obama did forget policy right but the thing he did it the right said denigrate at the office number that time he put issues up on that resolute desk member of the time he or the ... member of the time he didn't wear\nA tie into the oval office and the rights has exploded and they were like well actually not oh I mean okay I Would love to play some tape of certain shows for you that\nYou know some some people dead but like not the only one known over every some stuff bother me some stuff did but like a lot of stuff\nBothered a lot of people on the right when they said Brock Obama isn't respecting the office okay and so now Donald Trump is like\nJoking about beating up reporters and calling women terrible names on Twitter and it's like\nI Know we have to do to to say there are things that really matter and there are things that are just trumping Trump's but I Will never be okay with the silence of those same critics and I'm not saying you but the same critics who said Brock Obama wasn't presidential because he didn't wear a tie to the office on Saturdays and yet they're like\nDon't find funny he's on PCs just funny he's just he said Trump ... trial it's like guys you can't have it both ways that look the good and now me bothers me to my\nCore guy that bothers me to my core and I have never ever be okay with it\nHypocrisy is going I I've ... I've been pretty consistent on this stuff um and I look I Will say this of that Eric Trump fight that we just played some of that is true right Trump won\nBecause the politically correct the stifling lead politically correct atmosphere\nThat some people in pushing in this country had set up enough Americans that they wanted to go with someone who was\nGoing to basically be a giant middle finger to puncture PC culture I think that is a huge part of Trump's appeal I think that he can be actually quite funny and charming an interesting and different and entertaining I agree that like that is definitely definitely part of the story here\nThat does not mean that there are not lines\nThat shouldn't be crossed even if you believe all of those things to be true about the president and\nA ... a congressman now body slamming reporter and sort of ... about it to me that is ... you know that's not in the all in good fun category for me\nPlayed into that news of the week I'm with the Elizabeth Warren thing which got a big laugh and then a few un jokes I assume you must love the un jokes\nAnd I I did I Love I Love to the un jokes I like I like the ... for a job but I had heard an eighty country they're probably mad at the U.S yes I Am\nAt any given moment and and like it it just sort of a rite of passage for major political figures to go and do this the presidential nominees every four years both parties know go and do it\nAnd I have seen some dumb speculation like over the fact that you did it does that mean that she's going to love no one twenty twenty like no no no she's not going to run in twenty twenty\nShe's just she was invited to do this no she I think\nI think that Jonathan Swan was right when we talked about this I think she wants to go and get some private sector experience makes money\nAnd then run an Enron ... late ... uh\nIt was a time it's a tough thing to be a politician be funny but she she didn't pulled off last night so kudos to her okay we're going to

after that to experience ... press your blue button on star dot com on style by GM\nLooking back to ... this is a Fox News alert as we were sort of anticipating the Saudi Government\nAs as had been reported widely this was coming they have now\nConfirmed the death of ... and the spin that they're putting on it is that there was apparently a fight or a struggle when can show the arrived at the Saudi consulate in assembled turkey he died in the course of that fight\nAnd that's the ... the news story we'll see if they stick with it Murray I think it's fair to call both of us dubious we've talked about this on the show for a number of days we knew something like this was coming and it seems like they've landed on there was a fight yeah\nWell it took him to the days to come up with their cover story and now the question guy and maybe we'll ask our next guest about this at the end of the other hand is what the US government will do we already have seen European country to spending political visits to Saudi Arabia until they got some more answers\nNow the ball really isn't as in the president's court in Congress's court back\nHere in Washington there needs to be some consequences I Would argue but\nWe'll see and that gas that you just mentioned is Senator Ben Sasse United States senator from the state of Nebraska he joins us from the courthouse gr state he's also written a new book that is terrific it's called them\nWhy we hate each other and how to heal I read it on the plane today cover to cover but senator hey thank you for being here and be your quick reaction to this breaking news\nWell first of all thanks for including very glad to be with both of you uh let me be marked down with you too as dubious uh I haven't done it as gifts or to get it he got survive briefing on this and the last forty eight hours of Wednesday morning I did and I I just reiterate in public that the\nSaudis position on this for days and days and days is problematic they\n... us what is the what is the policy director and we should be heading\nOr they policy needs to flow from principal and we need to know what the Saudi Government is willing to articulate as long term principles and right now it feels it feels like they're just viewing this as what's their media PR a strategy what's their short term public relations crisis management\nPlan and that's not what's needed what's needed is a lot more a truth telling by the Saudis and and they got some big problems for right now\nOh at I think that's definitely true and we'll be monitoring this story on this program we have coverage and Fox News channel as well\nAnd as we said Marie not exactly a stunner that the Saudis have owned up on some level to this also not a stunner that they are putting\nThis spin on it that seems a little bit difficult to swallow given their adamant denials that are now you know of course in operative so senator when we introduced you we talked about this book\nThem and I had the pleasure of reading it cover to cover on the flight today um and I know a lot of times when someone trying to flatter and author they will call the book important\nBut in this case I Will actually say with had in my heart I think this was a really important book to have been written and for people to read about the culture of political vitriol and hatred on both sides of the aisle\nOf which are a lot of which you traced to our disintegration as a society and an increasing crisis of loneliness in America so I guess the big picture question to get rolling here is why is it that you United States Senate decided this book\nHad to be written was there some sort of catalyst\nTo the book and then the second question if you would also follow up is this\nHow did you not become northwestern football fan when you were literally living across the street from what was used to be called I Believe ... stadium\nOne of the first places that you led when you were a newly wed

Ben Sasse of Republican up Nebraska out with a new book called then why we hate each other and how the hill\nAnd senator guy and I both really loved\nThe parts of the book when you talk about setting limits ON Technology use social media use he talked about how it's an addiction and you know I have a new iPhone in one of the things on the new iPhone they tell you how many hours you spend on it which is horrifying\nHum and and and I think that it's it's really at the root of so much of what's wrong with our culture with our discourse\nAnd you set out some limits that you have for your family talk us through how you're looking at technology and social media right now\nSo we have three kids uh Seventeen and fourteen year old girl to the seven year old boy and a we've kind of regret that are girls that smartphones as a kind of because we're all the rats can get a driver's license at fourteen or do you want them to have him for GPS drive purposes so we can know where they are and what not\nBut we really wish they didn't have Instagram and so we we try to limit that kind of stuff a lot because it creates a distorted view of the world everybody a you know if your experiences on to a hundred at any given moment your average experience as a fifty you'll probably checking your Instagram what life is that it's thirty that when it's at at Ninety\nBut everybody else's grooming their image to be a Ninety five\nAnd so your teenage girl this delta between thirty that you're feeling this moment in Ninety five that everybody else has grown to do so we want to limit that and so we kind of illicit my wife and I sort of\nMade up a list of rules that are on our refrigerator at you know basic stuff like your thousand social media friend will make any happier but your fourth real friend

information and you cannot bring\nAny electronic devices in there with you whatsoever and you talk about sort of applying that part of your job as a senator or at least the concept\nTo your life your

team\nThat look he's been in isolation for five months at a bag of his ... his health\nUm when I asked specifically what what is wrong with them I was told man we're not getting into that so I don't know if the health issue as they claim it's something that we use a wheelchair to there are some who would say that this is an old defense attorney chlorine to make it look as sympathetic as possible and maybe there's nothing wrong with them I\nKnow I I don't know that I could that I could say that I mean you know when he was in a wheelchair and people closer to meet our tell me that his health has been negatively affect\nHe's in his late sixties I mean they can look at this poor suffering old men go easy on him right that that got to be the theatrics here or you know maybe he's in he's in rough shape and you know getting locked up for grabs that you committed is not necessarily a fun thing I drink\nOr maybe the maybe the truth is somewhere between the two right maybe maybe there's something\nSure yeah I Know that that would make sense to me also today we saw news of the U.S government\nAre putting out an indictment finding an indictment against a Russian national about election interference but not in twenty sixteen which has only been looking at three in retrospectively but in the twenty eight teen cycle what can you tell us about that\n[laughter] yeah ... and ... this is exactly this is interesting for the reason that you brought up was that this is twenty Eighteen Mrs now we're not we're not looking backward looking for um this is a woman in Atlanta alec she's not a Christian and I'm\nSorry go ahead no that was good I'm embarrassed but ...\nBut she has been she's she used a indicted and we should also kind of put it out there as a lot of these indictments that are happening on Russians this person's not in this country and and they don't have an extradition treaty with Russia so the odds of of this ever this person ever walking into US Quarter are pretty slim\nHowever uh she is she is charged with strikes negatively affect us election and basically they said that she is kind of that ad account that she was in charge of all the money and organization\nThat we're spending a lot of money trying to sow discord inside the U.S and our political system it and it's it's familiar to those of us have been following this basically people you know Russians getting on Twitter going after very controversial issues or abortion second right now the second Amendment rights\nI'm you know things like that and trying to sow discord and people to Americans to fight with each other and and the idea of being maybe they could push down the turnout on on election day at least that's what some people say\nAnd it's interesting because you're right Russia's not going to extradite her but it could this indictment hey I think sends a message right sends a signal and it also means\nYou know she can't she can't for example probably traveled to London or else the British might help so you know it died maybe ... a little bit but but the likelihood of seen her in a U.S court is in ... but but they do outline how they know what she's doing in court documents which I think it's helpful for people to see\n[noise] yeah I I agree with the with a what you're saying about her travel and that and that as a also protests that those other Russians who have been indicted by a father's office it does make life a little more difficult for them um and it and it sheds light or for the American electorate American public\nOn the idea that\nRussia really is trying to trying to have an effect on our elections and ... and ... ... the baby already considers all this success or because we are talking about it\nJacobson speaking of smaller in that investigation there was a little bit of movement who back and forth this week Murray and I got into it on the show yesterday just a tiny bit\nUh where there was this report a few days ago from Bloomberg oh they're going to wrap it up shortly after the midterms and then push back from the deejay or various sources all these sources unnamed a Wednesday and Thursday yes it will now he won't\nDo you have any sense whatsoever from your sources about where along the timeline this thing might be or is it a complete mystery\nAnd other reporters wrote that Bloomberg the Senate and he's a good reporter only thing I Would say is that that he's basically said\nLower might wrapped up after the election I think that we all know that I don't I don't think that that was a huge screaming\nAnd then I thought it was a decent headline but I didn't know there was a whole lot of air there I'm In the sense that we we're known for a long time and we have been told by sources close to the mall investigation that once we got passed away with it was very unlikely that we're going to see anything to last elections drive they don't want to affect the outcome of the election they don't want to be seen as\nA putting a son on one side of the scale or another so yes I I I think that\nSometime soon after the election will see some kind of action or from the special counsel's office however we

fight song is actually very good we played them in a bowl game in twenty ten and it was an amazing game we lost and double overtime but there were a lot of fight song\nRendition is played on both sides 'cause he was a high scoring game and I have to admit\nEven though I hated having to hear it because they were scoring the Auburn fights on really good\nI don't like anyone sites on but my team

favorite fight song\nOn Iceland build a term fight songs rubber ruin for me by Hillary Clinton without one song that got playing during the campaign\nKnow Matt I'm a Democrat and I agree with ya I hear that\nI'm not welcome back to the show the average we back again some big match up and look we're getting towards that time in the season where we're starting to talk about the the ad about the college football playoff\nAnd about conference champions so now it's sort of like we've seen what some teams can do but now really where the rubber meets the road give us a rundown of the top games you're looking at this weekend there were deep into conference play so mostly\nThey'll have conference games what are you looking forward to this weekend\nWell we've got four games with in the top twenty five this week one of the big ones I've been looking at is Mississippi State take on LSU the bulldog coming in twenty second in the nation to Death Valley LSU with incredible when on Saturday just dominating Georgia in that ... absolutely crush them\nBut the bulldogs last year crush the tigers thirty seven to seven one of the most lopsided losses and ed or drawn ten year with LSU\nPretty ... tackle in office we see from LSU all season long they actually have a split right now of one thousand foreign Fifteen rushing yard so far this season to one thousand foreign Fifteen passing yards\nPretty impressive statistic there Mississippi State those got some great presidents and the Russian game so they're going to try and upgrade their passing attacked the best they can with Nick bits Gerald it hasn't been going great but they're gonna try again this week the other game to watch is the battle for the call bunny and\nTroy hang on let's let's stick on this game for justice okay\n'cause I watched that George LSU game yeah last week and we talk to Steve skull lease the house majority loud and he's a big tigers ideas\nAnd so you know I was rooting admittedly for Georgia 'cause my buddy Mary Catherine hand my co author is a big Georgia fan but that was an absolutely dominating performance by LSU I think that they've earned their number five\nRanking every single bit of that or else they're coming off a loss to Florida but that being in Georgia the way that they did\nIs impressive and I guess the only question are the only concern I Would have if I were in LSU fan with no disrespect to Mississippi State it's a home game they dismantled the bulldogs the other bulldogs but the obviously it's also the bulldogs by the way\nUm but there's multiple bulldogs and multiple tigers in the SEC they like the name\nYeah we're the only one buckeyes that's wild cats in the big time like I feel like there's what the LSU Tigers the Auburn Tigers are already tigers nobody three in the same ... it's called the tigers anyway I digress if I'm LSU the only thing I'm worried about is okay\nToo much talking is right we beat Georgia were at home Mississippi State is in Georgia so we should be fine the let down right to let down after that big when is the only thing I Would be concerned about\nOh you know there's always the concern for the hangover after a huge win like that but it seems like they said pretty level headed when they talked to in order to an earlier this week they said that you know hey it was a good when we celebrated for a day and then we got right back to business\nSo I think the tigers are just focused on getting this game done they had the off week after this to kind of like soak it all in and realize where they're in the standings I think they'll come away with a victory against Mississippi State because they got a brace themselves Bamako come and that's a big contract with them if they really want to prove that they are the cream of the crop that they deserve to be in that college football playoff picture that's the game to do it\nWell they and they can't get there without being al about court out\nThe question of Alabama that sorry I digress for a moment but I'll tell you before you live on the other games at the weekend it rained yesterday that Alabama has messed for field goals within forty yards and they've missed like a number of extra points this season can\nReact they've had some issues on special teams but they found that up man they got it and they will literally execute the kicker discontinue whoa yeah there's a reason there's a good team within that stadium [laughter] it is okay well anyway news news um so what so obviously Michigan Michigan state's this weekend\nYes that's a huge matchup for the call bunny and trophy Spartans coming off a huge ... sporting already got a big win over Penn State in happy valley Twenty one Seventeen when they're MSU actually won this match up the eight of the last ten and they want it last year at the big house there in East Lansing this year Michigan coming off last year was\nThat trial absolutely right it's it's really a good challenge for producers

large congressman because there's not enough people in Montana justify multiple districts so\nA congressman gene forte won a special election during the Trump Administration because you may recall previous guy was blocked for the cabinet I Believe so gene forte won that race relatively narrowly but the night before\nThe election or within twenty four hours of election day special election day there was a\nSignificant dust up where GM forte got angry with a reporter um who he then bodies or the Kennedy ... bodies land\nWe're actually no reporter as names Ben Jacobs he's up a guardian and you know I'm Shia Ben Ben's a lefty but I think he's a pretty fair guy he's very mild mannered and yeah they were\nAnd he broke his glasses and there were numerous witnesses and so actually Jean Fort they had to plead guilty first he lied about it and that didn't happen then he had to plead guilty and go to an anger management\nThere was all you want but and also there was I Love it yeah and our Fox News\nTeam all round in Missouri was there and witnessed it and backed up\nThe reporter yes so it was obviously not a good thing\nFor ... to do what you don't assault anyone you definitely do not sold a journalist when you were a political candidate but it was the very end of the race and he won anyway so and that was a Republican whole show last night Trump was giving a shout out to Greg gee unfortunately I\nAnd in caught one here's what he said\nBut Greg is smart there by the way it never wrestle him [noise]\n\nGod let your body slammed my I should say that there's nothing in Russia when doors Greg very early but I haven't heard that he body slams a reporter [noise]\nWhich he did and then the president went on to say I thought it would hurt him but it helped them and well guy\nI Know Donald Trump you just crazy rhetoric but two things came to my mind when I saw this this morning when I woke up first we are still dealing with a situation where a reporter for the or a columnist for the Washington Post was likely killed\nBe headed dismembered murdered\nBy the Saudi Government and the Trump Administration is in the middle of dealing with that situation so maybe we shouldn't joke about violence against journalists\nAnd also there's been so much uproar on the right with Donald Trump says Democrats are promoting violence their quote the mob Democrats are promoting all this violence this is this is\nThe sheer violence against a reporter it's just so I mean I Can't say that every time Donald Trump says something that I find grotesque and anti democratic and offensive but like\nHe was sharing that\nYeah it would take on here is at least joking about it and you shouldn't bright ... shouldn't have done what he did and there is an inherent contradiction so when Trump's talking about the mob on the left I actually think that there is something of a mob mentality on the left it's\nThat crosses lines into dangerous territory we saw that this week with a number of assaults against Republican candidates are on I think there's some of that nature that both sides I I'm just saying in terms of candles being physically assaulted\nIt's happened twice this week to Republicans and to a staffer it's it's not okay at all\nAnd for Trump to rightly called out\nYou know mob action and violence on the left it under cuts the message\nHey when he was at his rallies when twenty sixteen and saying oh beat up the protest or I'll pay for your legal fees and he pretended never set up what he did because on tape and then this thing like I think the last thing that Greg June forte frankly\nWants to be associated with himself moving forward is this moment where he completely\nLost his composure and and attacked a reporter I like I Can't imagine that gene framing\nMaybe I don't know like I I Would like for gene for you to come out and say something about this because Donald Trump is the head of the party and he was celebrating that he was making light of that he was basically complimenting it I mean my son he's my kind of guy he's my kind of guy never\nNever wrestle him you know that was that was sort of the the tone of it I just think it's\nA pretty bright line that should not be acceptable\nIn basically any contact whatsoever to physically assault a journalist if you're anyone especially if you're a candidate for office and if you do and if you really screw up and you lose control of yourself\nAnd and you face the repercussions for it I Know he end up getting elected anyway but\nYou know it's not it's not a good thing to do it should not then be\nCelebrated right that's that's that's up by the president like ... like what I mean I get like a it's a\nGuy you say you don't like it I say I don't like it even from members of Congress say they don't like it but like\nThere's never any consequences for now at least there hasn't been any consequences for Donald Trump so far now even if I should have people go out and vote against his party in the mid term because of his rhetoric and part there will be but\nYeah I mean the Clinton see I and I try to\nPick my spots because I think a lot of people in the media freak out about way too much the Trump says in tweets and I think sometimes they take his joking\nTo literally or it's it's too much self importance in hand wringing and that sort of thing and for example and I don't want to go down this path but I Know you and I have a disagreement about Pocahontas and the way that he says that right in that joke\nI put this in a different category right like I think I'd I'd try to identify things wear\nLess either AOL defended 'cause it's funny or be it's just whatever it's not worth criticizing this one's worth criticizing\nNow the counterpoint to counter point was made by one of his sons today on out numbered the hash tag one lucky guy on the Fox news couch was Eric Trump and in ... three here's how he said it's a joke it's just fun it's anti PC take a listen\nWhen it wasn't the guy your body and they can\nThey can have fun I mean by the way this is actually exactly when my father one because so many people are so sick and tired of\nThought cage to perfect a perfectly scripted politician and memorize or a little sound bite and they went out there and they had no crowds and they weren't any fun and they had no\nTheir charisma they had no personality pay to go out and say as as as as a guy who's a little bit is on the sci fi movie one because he's on pay say any way to body slam somebody like on a guy and joke about in the old crowds laughing like\nNo I mean this this is this is in theory and to me because I heard from the right\nFor eight years when I worked for Brock Obama everything Brock Obama did forget policy right but the thing he did it the right said denigrate at the office number that time he put issues up on that resolute desk member of the time he or the ... member of the time he didn't wear a tie into the oval office\nAnd the rights has exploded and they were like well actually not oh well I mean okay I Would love to play some tape of certain shows for you\nThat you know oh I Know some some people dead but like not the only one out over every some stuff all the ... but like\nA lot of stuff bothered a lot of people on the right when they said Brock Obama is in respecting the office okay and so now Donald Trump is like\nJoking about beating up reporters and calling women terrible names on Twitter and it's like\nI Know we have to do to to say there are things that really matter and there are things that are just Trump being Trump's but I Will never be okay with the silence of those same credits and I'm not saying you but the same critics who said Brock Obama within presidential 'cause he didn't wear a tie to the office on Saturdays and yet they're like\nDon't funny he's on PC just funny he's just he said Trump the trial it's like guys you can't have it both ways that look the good and now me bothers me to my\nCore guy that bothers me to my core and I have never ever be okay with it\nHypocrisy is going I I've ... I've been pretty consistent on this stuff um and I look I Will say this of that Eric from white that we just played some of that is true right Trump won\nBecause the politically correct the stifling we politically correct atmosphere that some people would\nMarching in this country had set up enough Americans that they wanted to go with someone who was going to basically be a giant middle finger to puncture\nPC culture I think that is a huge part of Trump's appeal I think that he can be actually quite funny and charming an interesting and different and entertaining I agree that like that is definitely definitely part of history here\nThat does not mean that there are no lines that shouldn't be crossed even if you believe all of those things to be true about the president and\nAt any given moment and and like yeah it it just sort of a rite of passage for major political figures to go and do this the presidential nominees every four years both parties now and go and do it\nAnd I have seen some dumb speculation like over the fact that she did it does that mean that she's going to run now in twenty twenty like no no no she's not going to run and twenty twenty\nShe's just she was invited to do this no she I think\nI think that Jonathan Swan was right when we talked about this I think she wants to go and get some private sector experience make some money\nAnd ran ran an Enron when ... ... ...\nIt was a ... it's a tough thing to be a politician be funny but she she didn't pull it off last night that could add to her okay we're going to take a break come back with senator bands that data and [noise]\n\n\nCompelling\n\nAnd now look back at this week in history\nThis week in Nineteen thirty one gangster Al Capone is sentenced to eleven years in prison for tax

continuing\nThis ... legacy of academic excellence classes are held to the same high standards that consistently named the ... the\nLooking back to ... this is a Fox News alert as we were sort of anticipating the Saudi Government as as had been reported widely this was coming they have now\nConfirmed the death of ... and the spin that they're putting on it is that there was apparently a fight or a struggle went to show the arrived at the Saudi consulate in assembled turkey he died in the course of that fight\nAnd that's just the news story we'll see if they stick with it Murray I think it's fair to call both of us dubious we've talked about this on the show for a number of days we knew something like this was coming and it seems like they've landed on there was a fight yeah\nWell it took him to the days to come up with their cover story and now the question guy and maybe we'll ask our next guest about that's why it's going to go to hand is what the US government will do we already have seen European countries just spending political visit to Saudi Arabia until they got some more answers\nNow the ball really isn't as in the president's court and Congress's court back\nHere in Washington there needs to be some consequences I Would argue but we'll see\nAnd I guess that you just mentioned is Senator Ben Sasse United States senator from the state of Nebraska he joins us from the courthouse gr state he's also written a new book that is terrific it's called them\nWhy we hate each other and how to heal I read it on the plane today cover to cover but senator hey thank you for being here and be your quick reaction to this breaking news\nSpecial effects for including very glad to be with both of you uh let me be marked with your Jewish dubious uh I haven't done it as gifts to get any got certified briefing on this the last forty eight hours a Wednesday morning I did and I I just reiterate in public that\nThe Saudis position on this for days and days and days is problematic they\n... you you asked what is what is the policy director who should be they\nAre they policy needs to flow from principal and we do know what the Saudi Government as well and articulate as long term principles and right now it ... it feels like they're just viewing this as what's their media PR a strategy what's their short term public relations crisis management plan and that's not what's needed what's needed is a lot more a\nTruth teller you buy the Saudis on and they got some big problems for it now\nOh at I think that's definitely true and we'll be monitoring this story on this program we have coverage at Fox News channel as well\nAnd as we said Marie not exactly a stunner that the Saudis have owned up on some level to this also not a stunner that they are putting\nThis spin on it that seems a little bit difficult to swallow given their adamant denials that are now you know of course in operative so senator when we introduced you we talked about this book\nThem and I had the pleasure of reading it cover to cover on the flight today um and I know a lot of times when someone to try to flatter and author they will call the book important a button\nThe case I Will actually say with Hannah my heart I think this is a really important book to have been written and for people to read about the culture of political vitriol and hatred on both sides of the aisle\nOf which are a lot of which you traced to our disintegration as a society and an increasing crisis of loneliness in American so I guess a big picture question to get rolling here is why is it that you United States senator decided this book\nHad to be written was there some sort of catalyst to the book and then the second question if you would also follow up is this\nHow did you not become a northwestern football fan when you were literally living across the street from what was used to be called I Believe like stadium\nOne of the first places that you led when you were a newly wed with your wife you were in Evanston I mentioned what happened is Brian Field last week 'cause I'm a nice guy ... for a guy we can we can use an extra fan and purple senator [laughter]\nWell let's take the other one for a just cause it's it's still a fresh open to learn from me [laughter] where where I'm from football's the second most important religion we know and congratulations job

address when we were newly wed and it was pretty great the football season the Nineteen Ninety four Ninety five northwestern went from having been you know\nColumbia University bad and the Nineteen eighties and in Ninety four you could see they were going to read about my Nineteen Ninety five you're going to the rose bowl so I was a fun time to live there but I'm ... broader point so I I think political tribalism\nIs ramping right now precisely because the good tribes are in the collapse and so it's worth I think distinguishing between good and bad tribes and you asked why I wrote and I wrote it because I I don't think Washington\nHe joined us and continues in this conversation when we return it Benson and ...\nThe only place for battling stock and barrel discussion and then\nGot to

it was brutally tough but they chose not to file bankruptcy\nHe said he'd heard me talk about going to the national foundation for credit counseling\nAnd they contacted them and they directed him to a local accredited counselor\nAnd they went on a payment plan with all these credit card companies I'm sure none of which thought they were ever going to see all their money\nBecause once your debt goes credit card debt goes above fifty percent of your annual income odds are very low you're ever going to be able to pay off the debt but their credit card debt was way past a hundred percent of income\nSo they sacrificed everything they could in their lives\nAnd made it work and in just under eight years John and his wife made their last payment\nAnd paid off the entire hundred and Seventy thousand dollars in credit card debt today other than their mortgage which they are very little one versus the value of their house at this point\nYou know now it's been eleven years later they are almost at free and living a life of frugality\nThey were able to make it all happened the irony and I didn't say this to John and John if you are listening and here this if you would call me eleven years ago\nI Would have told you that you had too much debt to be able to pay it all off\nBut you had more faith in yourself and your wife and I would have in a situation where the debt total was so enormous\nAnd you made it happen and so\nIn the spirit of what John and his wife accomplish I Want you to know that if you find yourself because credit card debt levels are rising again at a very rapid rate you find yourself facing\nA lot of debt know that you don't give up that morning better ways to handle your money\nOr if it's because you lost your job or whatever you ended up with that\n\nGot to be patient you got to have a plan and you may have to make changes in how you spend money to tackle that debt and yes it's true eleven years later\nIt was it was banned in FCC dot org\nNational Foundation for credit counseling and FCC dot org\nIs a great place for you to go for budgeting or beyond for negotiating with your creditors so you can pay off your debts and a reasonable period of time\nSo congratulations to you John and your wife and your whole family most interesting thing John said to me was the early on it was a strain but later\nAs they made progress

Clark Howard show where it's about you learning ways to keep more of what you may you may or may not have heard the news reports that a number of\nThe nation's largest banks are facing a very heavy barrage of cyber attacks right now attempts to hack into\nThe bank operating systems way beyond just trying to take over an individual account at the bank but in fact to disable\nTheir computer systems at the bank\nNow nobody's saying but you can just assume that it's a state actor who would try to completely disabled a computer operation at a bank even according to federal officials maybe even to wipe the data clean\nOn all account holders\nThese warnings coming from his office there is and the federal government I saw this on Wall Street Journal dispatch about this there's an office of critical infrastructure protection and compliance policy\nThat the Treasury Department that's a mouthful isn't it\nIt's very very freaked out about what's going on right now you you know certainly assume it's the Russians or another foreign power trying to mess with us Russians always the first suspect because\nOf the evil boot and in charge but anyway in the past things the Russians have been up to I don't understand the Americans who don't\nGet how rotten terrible the Russians are under boot and but anyway I digress\nSo think of two things one if a bank's database gets completely wiped out it is\nLong term no real problem short term there are potential hassles so let's see a long term one of the things that has been implemented I don't remember how many years ago this was\nBanks and credit unions work under a buddy system where they all have and nobody really talks about this 'cause it's doomed to the doomsday scenario what kinds of stuff but there is a companion bank\nA competitor that has a database backup that's never more than twenty four hours old from their competitor and in the event\nThat something happened\nWhere foreign actors able to completely disable the computer operations at a bank or credit union people will still be able to use their accounts with the other financial institution acting is host\nAnd for you and me after a cut over\nIt should be somewhat pretty much business as usual I guess records would be there'd be like a twenty four hour window of a missing data potentially\nSo which again is not normally the end of the world but two things come to mind with us if we were to receive a serious attack\nFrom the Russians the Chinese another foreign actor Iran look at our list of potential enemies that would do this\nCould be North Korea and we got a lot of such potential suspects\nWind a lot of people never have any cash anymore cash for a very short window would become valuable having a small amount of cash available stored in a place in your home\nSmall I mean for a lot of people just for walking around money under a hundred dollars let's say\nHaving that available particularly if you're somebody who never carries any cash at all you should have it when I travel you know I travel a roughly thirty weeks a year\nI carry even though I never use it I have a supply of cash with me not a huge amount but I have some cash that

number of this luxury vehicle\nAnd a description and you know miles that kind of thing [noise] purchase price and then you eat signed both copies and knew each keep one copy the reason that's important for you it wouldn't be where the type of vehicle you're selling\nBut often with a run of the mills used vehicle if it's later used in a crime or the person who buys it never registers it in their own name then\nAnd everybody's coming to you saying hey wait wait you're the one responsible for this this vehicle still shows registered to you right\nAnd that's where the bill of sale is an important piece of evidence so it's not foolproof protection in a situation like that but it is a layer of protection [laughter]\nOkay well that's that's wonderful advice clerk I I appreciate you

Parker has done with eye glasses were ... Parker at first was only on line and now has physical stores\nAre but not a lot of those either but for people who want to go see frames and get a sense in person they can go do that and so this idea just like Harry's the the razors\nOriginally only on line now you'll see displays and I think target stores of Harry's\nAnd it doesn't take a lot of market share to disrupt the way in industry works the Gillette has been absolutely beaten into a pope", "show_name": "The Alan Colmes Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "20"}
