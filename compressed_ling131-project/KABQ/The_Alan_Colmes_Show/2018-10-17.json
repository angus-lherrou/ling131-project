committed to conducting a complete investigation into the disappearance of journalist ... ... could run chase has\nMore when it comes to the physical search what we know is on Monday the ... forensic experts entered\nThe current governor's race there's been a really interesting one the female democratic candidate African American woman named Stacey Abrams if if she were to win would be the first African\nAmerican female governor she's raised a ton of money she's you know gotten a lot of national attention she's running against Brian Kemp Georgia secretary of state he's been secretary of state from two since two thousand ten\nAnd he's been advocating very strict voting rules that he says are needed to combat voting fraud although there's not evidence that that happens\nWith any basically at all except for just a few very very minor cases in ... in Georgia\nBut which critics are saying is basically a form of voter suppression aimed at the kinds of new voters that have registered to vote for Stacey Abrams so the a P found and this is this is interesting guy the a P found that Seventy percent of the fifty three thousand new registrations\nCurrently suspended so so the secretary of state's office has put out rules that have suspended\nA huge number tens of thousands of voter registrations Seventy percent of them were for African American Georgians that's obviously a key part of her constituency there have been lawsuits filed that that accused by and camp of trying to disenfranchise people that are likely to vote democratic\nThere have been also guy a ton of public service announcements being done whether it's on Twitter whether it's ads telling people to go to the polls and vote\nThat you know you should not stay away but I think what they're concerned about is that they get a letter saying something's wrong with their distribution and then more likely than not they don't show up that's not how the system is supposed to work there have also been Ninety thousand voters purged from Nevada voter rolls\nNorth Dakota they put in place new rules that that disenfranchise native population so\nThis is a big issue countrywide and my whole theory on this is that we should be encouraging more people to vote not fewer given so fewer percentage vote anyways but given that voting is a term in by the states and secretary of state are elected part isn't officials\nYou know ... ... it can lead it like in Georgia should the person running for Governor Bill in charge of making the rules that determines who can vote for him right I I don't think so I think secretary of state should be nonpartisan positions but this is a problem if all these people are being kicked off of the voting rolls and they shouldn't be\nWell okay so so a few things on Georgia um it's interesting when this story was sort of blowing up\nA journalist at the Atlanta Journal constitution which is the biggest newspaper in the state\nHe tweeted fifty three thousand Jordan's will not be shut out of the election this was false they will be able to vote they will be able to vote with a regular ballot\nThat is unless coverage like this convinces them that there's no use in trying he actually also cited the ACLU of Georgia who is also urging people that know if you hear this fifty three thousand number\nThose people are going to be allowed to vote and so they\nGet a letter saying there's something wrong with their registration which if you're not used to voting back you admit if you've got that letter and you're not a regular voter that may dissuade you from both\nI mean if it were me I Would I Would fix the issue but I think it's important to point out ... these people who may have their pending registrations are allowed to vote in this election\nYes actually will show I think they should show up and they should they should absolutely vote\nYeah it's it's they are able to do so it is their right to do so and they can do it legally and I think it's important to say that um\nAnd then I Wish that Brian Kemp would say that he's he's just he's well he has a lot of issues here but but interestingly guy before we move on from Georgia I Want to play cut forty\nIn Georgia Republican senator Purdue was a student from Georgia Tech went up to hand was asking him why he'd endorsed Brian Kemp who was trying to purge all these voters and\nThe senator took his phone away and tried to leave with that let's take a listen [noise]\nSo uh how can you endorse a candidate I'm not going to\nDo my property in one of the law and order for\nUs to talk of the one for what they want to run away for the morning after a while candidate is trying to hurt people are voting on the basis of their race\nI mean since you shouldn't have taken his some yeah you probably shouldn't do that you should keep it cool or for example remember when Ted Cruz's being hounded out at a restaurant by a mob left is he kept his cool and ended up looking better because of it I can understand if someone has like a phone in your face and whatever\nIt might be annoying and I think the premise of the question was flawed but you also I as an elected representative yeah just like just be like you can say no comment walk away [laughter]\nUm you don't have to take the phone away so I think probably\nOr or if you think that you have the right answer substantively you shorter substantive\nAnd be like hey I'm happy to endorse but that's for governor is going to keep our taxes low in the state's economy growing and blah blah blah you\nCould have said well you said they can all vote go vote yeah right like but that's not the behavior of someone who is comfortable or who's willing to defend what's going on that was crazy\nI mean you could probably control in that moment his temper better I'm learning moment perhaps for senator Purdue process but I also feel like the idea of ... years purging people based on their race a that's a claim that\nIs very charged and he's not perjuring these people is the point\n... rule he put in place rules some people argue are arbitrary ray and the fact that Seventy percent of the people who are affected by those rules are African American I mean there's been cases where courts have ruled in similar on similar issues in voting ... you know laws and id rules and all of that\nWhen they adversely affect one group of people\nYeah I'm I'm totally in favor of voter ID laws their constitutional I think they are important I think the goal should be for both parties\nTo make sure that everyone who is legally allowed to vote in their state can do so and there's also a state interested in making sure that people are who they say they are when they show up to vote and that they are eligible to vote in that state\nBecause when we look at voter purges quote unquote I think that's often used as a scare returned that makes it sound to people like just innocent ... you know eligible voters are\nFor no reason being heard from the rules when in fact the state of course has an interest to make sure that people who aren't allowed to vote people who are dead people who have moved people who are felons depending on the laws those people should not be on the voter rolls\nWhite but but like in Nevada [noise]\nThey sent a postcard to people at home\nAnd that the postcard was not for double meaning if a voter who moved it wouldn't follow them to their new address\nPostcards that came back as non deliverable for any reason results in the state sending affordable postcards the old address\nIf the second card was not returned within a certain timeframe the voters were moved to enact that status and this has been statistically proven to show that a disproportionately impacts poor and minority voters so I I I my point is [noise]\nWe can make sure people who are are they say they are and who are eligible to vote in that state but it just as all these different secretaries of state in these different states start doing things that disproportionately overwhelmingly impact minorities\nYou have to think there are better ways to do it and when they are when it's pointed out to them that their adversely impacting minorities more than any other group and they still say well tough\nThat has to make you ask them questions I think why would they be doing that yeah and I was a scar thing is crazy\nYeah I'm not sure about that methodology um the way that they go about that I also think that the knee jerk opposition to you know voter integrity laws by a lot of people on the left is also\nNever mind it is let me assure you it is the greatest state in America despite what I Am told multiple audiences for years\nRight and the thing is I I actually think that I thought before a lot of these things came out she was a pretty strong candidate um I'm just sort of be Wilbur by some of these things she said like it's not\nGood and the other thing is she had been talking to the press at all she has been shutting out the press for months since ... do you think that it I think she looked at the polling you know six months ago showed her up seven or eight point she was like I got this in the bag\nSo I'm going to just play prevent defense and not make mistakes and not talk to anyone I'll just run ads\nAre and not appear publicly what she's done almost nothing publicly\nAnd now she needs the press to sort of [laughter] ... explain away some of this stuff and it's you know it's a challenge for her there was also I mean there were a couple of very heated exchanges\nLast night between Martha ... the Republican and cure some cinema who's also having trouble I think squaring the circle of she was a really radical leftist I mean really radical a number of years ago and now she is sort of running as a moderate and explaining how she got from point a to point B is\nA challenge um I I think but the bigger challenge\nHer ... trying to watch to walk this line between supporting the president\nBecause she had to win a primary and also because she does a lot of ways but there are a lot of people in Arizona who don't right there is a huge minority population I'm so we'll see we're up on a break we're going to come

so let's talk about uh the Senate to begin with ... there's a new piece out today from Charlie Cook who says that the national races seemed to have\nGravitated a little bit in the Republican's direction overall it's particularly pronounced in Senate races one piece of data that caught my attention today\nIs that one of the major democratic superPACs just announced\nThat they're going up with three million dollars of new attack ads in New Jersey to help Bob Menendez a three million I Know New Jersey is an expensive state because New York and Philly but that's still a lot of money for a Democrat in a blue state in a blue year\nOr are you surprised at all by three million bucks from an end as\nA little bit I mean Republicans have the same problem in New Jersey that the Democrats based in Texas for example right there nine hundred and twenty thousand more registered Democrats in the state of New Jersey in\nA state that you know every cycle it feels like Republicans feel like they they have a shot there and it it tends to be sort of a pipe dream um\nMelendez is obviously a flawed candidate and Bob who can actually is a pretty good candidate I mean he's a veteran former marine businessman he's moderate pro choice you sort of fits the state profile um and we did see a couple of polls that showed the race close a couple of weeks ago\nBut they were followed by a couple of polls showed\nA minute is a double digit so maybe the maybe who gets people maybe the the um [noise] the Republican or you know Senatorial Committee or seeing some some internal numbers that look better particularly in a post a post Kavanaugh hearings which seems to look at the Republican across the country so maybe he got up out of that now they now think that it might be within reach but\nIt seems like I'm\nSorry I'm surprised by that it seems like it might not be the wisest unless it got data shown otherwise and and you know people don't typically other than Texas where the ... of their sort of a fruitless endeavor in my opinion\nUm you know typically these do when you when you commit that amount of money you got some reasoning some data behind it\nYet I I uh\nWe talked about this last time when you were here with us in Studio and then I think men end as well when but he sure not making it easy certainly not in in New Jersey he's up in the real clear politics average seven point too but like you said you don't put money behind something unless you have some reason to\nGo down south to Florida we talked about this last time you were here since then there's been a devastating hurricane\nA lot of people displaced a lot of damage how you look at but the Senate and the governor's race in the aftermath of this horrible natural disaster sort of what has changed what hasn't how are you looking at that state three weeks out\n[noise] I I really don't think it's affected the the fundamentals of this race you know what Rick Scott is still governor he's he's suspended his campaign he's um you know indefinitely until he they get through the the hurricane recovery piece of this\nMaybe it benefits him you know he did have high approval ratings for for the way that he handled a Maria and and the aftermath of that I'm so there may be some benefit for for Rick Scott I'm but I think fundamentally minutes raise the ... that's it\nI think true with most races around the country\nUm you know most voters have already decided by now I mean they've they've they've retreated into one of the one of the two camps and I think most of the voters in Florida probably already made up their mind as well I don't I'm not sure that what's happening down there now it's going to cause any Republicans to vote Democrat or vice versa now\nIt makes them independence and and even though that's a pretty small slice of the electorate these days you know these races are pretty close I mean the Senate race we've got a two and a half points for for Nelson right now\nI'm a couple of polls have that down at one point so if it's that if it's that close maybe it does make a difference but by and large I think it's it's probably not going to shift the dynamics of the race that much\nI pick up on something you just said in a follow up do you I mean I don't know what the numbers are in terms of undecided than a lot of these places that you think most people have pretty much made up their minds and people are already going to the polls early voting in many places\nThat's right [noise] people are caffeine yeah I mean there was a poll recently that that\nWas looking at trying to trying to isolate the number of independents in the electorate right 'cause most most polls show glass you how do you still have done it by Republican Democrat or independent and then for that group of independence that say well which way do you lean they'll push them to call them leaders in one direction\nAnd we used to be our technology to show a bit helpline ideas to additional

accountability from the Saudi Government\nBut there are plenty are both within and outside of the U.S government who think that that suspect first off the primary investigation now is the Saudi Government with the Turkish government it took the Turkish government nearly two weeks\nTo finally secured that meanwhile there have been reporter standing outside the Saudi constantly Istanbul cooking cleaning crews come in and out ah and there is just there is just very little faith among many in Washington or that this is this is being conducted in in a very straightforward\nBatter Riyadh is not necessarily known for having a culture of robust independent inspector general who can step in and look into this thing uh so I I guess the question and rich is from my perspective\nLet's say we determine that the Saudi Government is responsible on some level for this what is the appropriate response because [noise]\nYou know we have a strategic interest\nTo remained friendly and ally in many important ways with the Saudi Government particularly views of the Iran and and other things are there is married to the argued that if we disengaged from Saudi Arabia they might become stronger partners with\nCountries like China and Russia but even our flawed friends have to understand when their flaws come to the surface in such a degree just ways you know the United states has I think the moral imperative to to say something to do something\nAnd I'm a what does he have been history shouldn't weighing as a as possible options here if they determine that indeed as it seems the Saudis are responsible on some level\n[noise] if the results of this investigation is what has been long suspected and what has been floated in the crust before that it was some type of rogue elements president even said it himself after speaking to king Solomon yesterday that it could be a rogue element that is responsible for the question then becomes\nDoes the United states hold that person responsible the whole Saudi Government responsible and it's as you noted guy\nThe British version is balancing on one side they are right now a head of November for when the Iran nuclear sanctions kick in on oil\nThey want us allies to replace Iranian oil with Saudi oil and they need their help on that they need their help on this Mideast peace plan that Jared Kushner has been discussing with\nOur job is

of your phone calls here and just a moment a three three four five six Thirteen hundred Warren is saying Trump should pay out the million bucks now\nBecause of this video she put out in which she includes a snippet from this genealogist who's looked at her DNA and says based on migration patterns from Peru and Colombia and Mexico\nShe might be between one sixty fourth and one one thousand and twenty fourth [noise]\nNative American\nSomewhere between six generations removed one relative six generations to ten generations ago and up the far end of that it would be before America existed as a country\nHas she proven that she's a Native American because that's the challenge that President Trump made and now she's saying pay up I proved it I Do not believe she proved it and\nOne of the points Murray made on the show yesterday is who gets to decide what counts [noise]\nWhat percentage counts and I don't I don't think there's an easy answer to that question and I understand some of the difficulties historically and genetically and socially when it comes to answering that question but what I Do know\nIs actual Native Americans in America have specific guidelines and rules that govern who is a Native American in their tribe and who is not\nIt's codified and they take it very seriously and the tried that she for a long time claim to be a part of the Cherokees\nHas very explicitly said she is not a Cherokee she's never been a Cherokee and in fact called what she's doing inappropriate and wrong and undermining the tribe\nSo I sort of defer to the Cherokees on whether someone's a Cherokee and the Cherokee say Elizabeth Warren is not a charity\nAnd Murray says well no she's not claiming Cherokee anymore yeah but she did for a long time she called herself a Cherokee history did not start yesterday when she put out this video\nShe has gone through an entire litany of explanations and excuses from the high cheekbones comment which I think is problematic\nTo powwow chow to family folklore Janelle this DNA test originally she said she had a DNA test or a family tree that says she's one thirty second Cherokee and the Cherokee said no that's not accurate\nBecause you had to abandon that thing now she's back to the DNA test possibly one sixty fourth all the way down to a little more than one one thousand\nPercent\nI mean there is a good chance as I said yesterday a few times based on some of the science on this that she is less Native American than just the average white person in America\nThe average white person in America is one five hundredth roughly Native American and almost won five hundred Africa\nAnd I can ten if you have that tiny bit of lineage somewhere you cannot legitimately claim to be that thing if I'm an average white person in America I should not lay claim to being a native\nAmerican port of being an African American\nAnd as a positive if I tried to do so I Would be laughed at and in fact I Would probably have some very severe professional and reputational ramifications but this is what she did based on this family story that isn't actually rooted\nIn reality\nAnd again it would be one thing if she heard these rumors and it was part of the folklore in the family\nAnd she talked about it sometimes it's another thing when she went out of her way to professionally list herself as a racial minority at a time in her career in that profession\nWarren's we did not get to your calls yesterday has to be proven that she's a Native American watching Trump's do the list goes on let's hear from you we will begin in Connecticut mark you're on the line welcome\nSick or it's clear that Warren will say anything to get what she wants but as the Trump does need to pay nine hundred and Seventy six dollars and fifty six that's that's one one thousand twenty fours of a million\nYeah I [laughter] I've seen this idea elsewhere and I like it the only thing I Would add mark is he should donated to like a Peruvian charity of some soil that's even better right\nBecause under this definition to get the definition of the DNA tests to include Native Americans they had to use ancestry of Mexicans Colombians and Peruvians which I think is interesting right mark appreciate the call and yeah so if he were to\nPay just to underscore that point if Trump were to pay one one thousand and twenty fourth of the million dollars it'd be a couple of hundred bucks [laughter] a million dollars that's the amount of Native American quote unquote that Elizabeth Warren actually is\nEven under the very generous in ... definition laid out by the genealogist that she hired a three three four five\nSix Thirteen hundred rocky in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania rocky congratulations on the Steelers victory on Sunday and welcome to the show\nThat you are yeah jeeze alive or got\nAbsolutely allowed her Cherokee nation's uh well actually all share all Indian nations require a certificate degree of Indian blood and they actually give you a card\nThat given them for years and years and years and years and if you're not at least one thirty second you'll never get a car that's why she said one thirty second\nBecause that way she could put herself in that in that range\nBut she's not she's alive absolute liar and um\nYeah that that's that's all I got to say that well they absolutely nuts\nI Hope I Hope she created her own trail of tears when she gets voted off the stage every time she goes on it\nSo rocky you seem to know about this this card and the one thirty ... are you are you a Native American I Am\nYou are I'm only one sixty so but my descent I'm a director or I'm a descendant of John and Andrew Ross are well John Ross let them down the trail of tears Andrew Ross was actually the traitor that um that you know made to feel what the American government to send them down the trail of tears\nSo hang on some rocky which tribe are you a part of\nTurkey\nYou're oh we're speaking to a real Cherokee here on the program absolutely so you're a member of the Cherokee tribe you are one is sixteen Cherokee\nShe now has come up with this thing saying it seems like she's kind of abandoned the Cherokee thing 'cause she was writing the the Cherokee thing for years saying that she was a Cherokee the high cheekbones all thing now she's saying no no I have native blood and it could be one one thousand that could be one sixty fourth\nBut she said that she was a Cherokee for a very long time\n... ... how does that make us a an actual bona fide Cherokee feel\nI I I'm just scraping by everything she says that that woman\nOkay what she's done if she took something from somebody else to go to a park oh wait took her position in that job first saw but\nNot only that not just that you know it's just it's just saying that she's a jerk it's like stolen valor you know what I mean you can't you can't just say that I'm a church because one proud of who we are I'm only wants to say that I'm extremely proud of\nMy Cherokee heritage but as I've read up on it and I know about it and you know that's just that's just like stolen valor it's the same thing you know she's just stolen\nSomeone's identity so there's a profit and benefit from it and then at the same time you know all Cherokees most well most of them vote liberal\nAnd I guarantee you this right here because they did have they did have a a broadcast\nAbout this I'm through with the Cherokee nation's through all the in all all the\nThey did have a broadcast and they did go on on TV and networks and everything saw it and they've been talking about it through the council's and everything this woman is she's about to get exposed and I hope the Cherokee Nation start going vote Republican and are seeing the laws that these people create\nIraqi I appreciate that phone call really interesting really really interesting\nAnd noticed the moving goalposts from forever Cherokee charity Cherokee when she was explaining this\nAnd now it's just oh some of this native blood you can't raise what she said for a long time you also cannot raise the fact that she was white white white white white white white white her whole life\nNineteen eighty six becomes Native American racial minority gets hired under the Iraqis get tenure at the peak of her entire career path at Harvard\nAnd drops it back to white that same year\nI can imagine being a real Cherokee and being ticked off they put out a statement yesterday really harsh about this\n\nA three three four five six Thirteen hundred my buddy Cameron Cameron Cassie calling from Washington DC we had him on the show before he wants to weigh in Cameron very briefly the stages yours sir\n[laughter] oh guy I'm a well you know we've we've seen this kind of thing before I mean you've got a Julia Salazar was that her name in New York yes who um\nWho is clearly just flipping on everybody all the time I'm\nLess as ... as as a woman who invented her heritage as well for political purposes running for I think state office in New York a Democrat if people don't know what you're talking about but go ahead\nSure she she uh and um you know I as a young Democrat I can tell you a lot of young Democrats I Know are looking towards people like it was like oh Rourke and and people like Swalwell in California as leaders the Democratic party they're not looking towards people who have been here a lot and you know when it comes to Trump paying this money I think that\nI think that it's a it's a lot of media attention for the two of them I think that it's not really worth buying into I mean Trump should donate a lot of his money charities are very rich man charities are very good thing to do it doesn't matter this is all you say he's having fun with it\nA war and clearly isn't having fun with it but it was for a couple of years\nAnd she and she had she had she benefited from it then she had about an hour a fund yesterday and then realize this was back firing a mentally honor the only one I Would make in the scheme of things it doesn't really matter very much I agree um you know whether she was a Native American and even if she used this and sort of a fraudulent way it's not good\nAt it and and I think it's a character issue\nBut the leftist so wrapped up in identity politics and cultural appropriation and checking your privilege she violated all of those piety and she should not get a pass just because she's a leftist who wants to be president [noise] All right back tomorrow on Benton Harbor we'll see then\n...

meeting with Saudi leaders Tuesday to find out what happened to a Washington Post reporter believe will have been murdered by Saudi operatives an instant bow meanwhile some members of the Senate are ready to take action and the Kenyan reports\nSo voters in Georgia can go to the polls\nThe current governor's race there has been a really interesting one the female democratic candidate African American woman named Stacey Abrams if if she were to win would be the first\nAfrican American female governor she's raised a ton of money she's you know gotten a lot of national attention she's running against Brian Kemp Georgia secretary of state he's been secretary of state from two since two thousand ten\nAnd he's been advocating very strict voting rules that he says are needed to combat voting fraud although there's not evidence that that happens\nWith any basically at all except for ... a few very very minor cases in ... in Georgia\nBut which critics are saying is basically a form of voter suppression aimed at the kinds of new voters that have registered to vote for Stacey Abrams so the a P found and this is this is interesting guy the a P found the Seventy percent of the fifty three thousand new registrations\nCurrently suspended so so the secretary of state's office has put out rules that have suspended\nA huge number tens of thousands of voter registration Seventy percent of them were for African American Georgians that's obviously a key part of her constituency there have been lawsuits filed that that accused brand campus trying to disenfranchise people that are likely to vote democratic\nThere have been also guy a ton of public service announcements being done whether it's on Twitter whether it's ads telling people to go to the polls and vote\nThat you know you should not stay away but I think what they're concerned about is that they get a letter saying something's wrong with their ... and then more likely than not they don't show up that's not how the system is supposed to work there have also been Ninety thousand voters ... purged from Nevada voter rolls North Dakota they've put in place new rules that that\nDisenfranchise native population so\nThis is a big issues countrywide and my whole theory on this is that we should be encouraging more people to vote not fewer given so fewer percentage of votes anyways but given that voting is a term and by the states and secretaries of state are elected part isn't officials\nYou know it it it can lead it like in Georgia should the person running for Governor Bill in charge of making the rules that determines who can vote for him right I I don't think so I think secretary of state should be nonpartisan positions but this is a problem if all these people are being kicked off of the voting rolls and they shouldn't be\nWell okay so so a few things on Georgia um it's interesting when this story was sort of blowing up\nA journalist at the Atlanta Journal constitution which is the biggest newspaper in the state\nShe tweeted fifty three thousand Jordan's will not be shut out of the election this was falsely will be able to vote they will be able to vote with a regular ballot\nThat is unless coverage like this convinces them that there's no use in trying he actually also cited the ACLU of Georgia who is also urging people that know if you hear this fifty three thousand number\nThose people are gonna be allowed to vote and so they\nGet a letter saying there's something wrong with their registration which if you're not used to voting that you admit if you've got that letter and you're not a regular voter that may dissuade you from\nVoting I I mean if it were me I Would I Would fix the issue but I think it's important to point out ... these people who may have their pending registrations are allowed to vote in this election yes legend\nWill show up and they should show up and they should they should absolutely\nVote yeah it's it's they are able to do so it is their right to do so and they can do it legally and I think it's important to say that um and\nThen I Wish that Brian Kemp would say that he's he's\nJust he's well he has a lot of issues here but but interestingly guy before we move on from Georgia and when I play cut forty in Georgia Republican senator Purdue was a student from Georgia Tech went up to him was asking him why he'd endorsed Brian Kemp who was trying to purge all these voters and\nThe senator took his phone away and tried to leave with it let's take a listen\nSo how can you endorse a candidate I'm not going to\nDo my brother in law and order or something like that and you're listening\nUs they don't really want or what they want to leave for the ... after a while the candidates are trying to hurt people are voting on the basis of their race\nI mean since they say there shouldn't have taken his some yeah you probably shouldn't do that you should keep it cool or for example remember when Ted Cruz was being hounded out at a restaurant by a mob left his he kept his cool and ended up looking better because of it I can understand if someone has like a phone in your face and whatever\nIt might be annoying and I think the premise of the question was flawed but you also I as an elected representative yeah just like just be like you can say no comment walk away [laughter]\nUm you don't have to take the phone away so I think\nProbably or or if you think that you have the right answer substantively you shorter substantive it'd be like hey I'm happy to endorse but that's for governor legacy is going to keep our taxes low in the state's economy growing and blah blah blah you\nCould have said well you said they can all vote go vote yeah right like but that's not the behavior of someone who is comfortable or who's willing to defend what's going on that was crazy\nI mean you could probably control in that moment his temper better I'm learning moment perhaps for senator ... due process but I also feel like the idea of all he is he is purging people based on their race a that's a claim that\nIs very charged and he's not purging these people is the point what ...\nRule he put in place rules some people argue are arbitrary ray and the fact that Seventy percent of the people who are affected by those rules are African American I mean there have been cases where courts have ruled in similar on similar issues in voting ... you know laws and id rules and all of that\nWhen they adversely affect one group of people\nYeah I'm I'm totally in favor of voter ID laws their constitutional I think they're important I think the goal should be for both parties to make sure that everyone who is legally allowed to vote\nIn their state can do so and there's also a state interest in making sure that people are who they say they are when they show up to vote and that they're eligible to vote in that state\nBecause when we look at voter purges quote unquote I think that's often used as a scare returned that makes it sound to people like just innocent ... you know eligible voters are\nFor no reason being heard from the rules when in fact the state of course has an interest to make sure that people who aren't allowed to vote people who are dead people who have moved people who are felons depending on the laws those people should not be on the voter rolls\nAnd white but but like in Nevada [laughter]\nThey sent a postcard to people at home\nAnd the postcard was not for double meaning if a voter had moved it wouldn't follow them to their new address postcards that came back as non deliverable for any reason results in the states sending affordable postcards the old address if the second card was not returned within a certain timeframe the voters were moved to enact that status\nAnd this has been statistically proven to show that it disproportionately impacts poor and minority voters so\nI I I my point is we can make sure people who are are they say they are and who are eligible to vote in that state but it just as all these different secretaries of state in these different states start doing things that disproportionately overwhelmingly impact minorities\nYou have to think there are better ways to do it and when they are when it's pointed out to them that their adversely impacting minorities more than any other group and they still say well tough that has to make you ask them questions I think why would they be doing this yeah and I ... a card thing is crazy\nYeah I'm not sure about that methodology um the way that they go about that I also\nI mean there were a couple of very heated exchanges\nLast night between Martha mix Sally the Republican and cure some cinema who's also having trouble I think squaring the circle of she was a really radical leftist I mean really radical a number of years ago and now she's sort of running as a moderate and explaining how she got from point a to point B is\nA challenge um I I think but the\nBigger ... trying to watch to walk this line between supporting the president because she had to win a primary and also because she doesn't a lot of ways but there are a lot of people in Arizona who don't right

listening guy Bentsen in New York ... in DC\nAnd joining us by phone Tom Bevan executive editor real clear politics dot com tone it's great to have you back\nGoing to be with you got All right so let's talk about uh the Senate to begin with ... there's a new piece out today from Charlie Cook who says that the national races seemed to have\nGravitated a little bit in the Republican's direction overall it's particularly pronounced in Senate races one piece of data that caught my attention today\nIs that one of the major democratic superPACs just announced\nThat they're going up with three million dollars of new attack ads in New Jersey to help Bob Menendez a three million I Know New Jersey is an expensive state because New York and Philly but that's still a lot of money for a Democrat in a blue state in a blue year\nUh are you surprised at all by three million bucks from an end as\nA little bit I mean Republicans have the same problem\nIn New Jersey that the Democrats faced in Texas for example writer nine hundred and twenty thousand more registered Democrats in the state of New Jersey and that's a state that you know every cycle it feels like Republicans feel like they they have a shot there and it it tends to be sort of a pipe dream um\nMelendez is obviously a flawed candidate and Bob who can actually has a pretty good candidate I mean he's a veteran former marine businessman he's moderate pro choice you sort of fits the state profile um and we did see a couple of polls that showed the race close a couple of weeks ago\nBut they were followed by a couple of polls showed\nA minute is a double digit so maybe the maybe who gives people maybe the the um [noise] the Republican or you know Senatorial Committee or seeing some some internal numbers that look better particularly in a post a post Kavanaugh hearings which seems to let the Republicans across the country so maybe he got up out of that now they now think that it might be within reach but\nIt seems like um\n[noise] so I Am surprised by that it seems like it might not be the wisest vestments unless it got data showing otherwise and and you know people don't typically other than Texas where the ... out of there and sort of a fruitless endeavor in my opinion\nUm you know typically these do when you when you commit that amount of money you got some reasoning some data behind it\nYet I I uh\nWe talked about this last time when you were here with us in Studio and then I think men end as well when he shared not making it easy certainly not in in New Jersey he's up in the real clear politics average seven point too but like you said you don't put money behind something unless you have some reason to\nGo down south to Florida we talked about this last time you were here since then there's been this ... hurricane\nA lot of people displaced a lot of damage how you look at but the Senate and the governor's race in the aftermath of it's a horrible natural disaster sort of what has changed what hasn't how are you looking at that state three leaks out\nI I really don't think it's affected the fundamentals of this race um you know what Rick Scott is still governor he's he's suspended his campaign he's um you know indefinitely until he they get through the the hurricane recovery piece of this\nMaybe it benefits him you know he did have high approval ratings for for the way that he handled a Maria and and the aftermath of that I'm so there may be some benefit for for Rick Scott I'm but I think fundamentally him in this race sort of\nThat's enough I think true with most races around the country\nUm you know most voters have already decided by now I mean they've they've they've retreated into one of the one of the two camps and I think most of the voters in Florida probably already made up their mind as well I don't I'm not sure that what's happening down there now is going to cause any Republicans to vote Democrat or vice versa you know\n... some independence and and even though that's a pretty small slice of the electorate these days\nYou know these races are pretty close I mean the Senate race we got a two and a half points for for Nelson right now I'm a couple of polls have that down at one point so if it's that if it's that close maybe it does make a difference but by and large I think it's it's probably not going to shift the dynamics of the race that much\nI pick up on something you just said in a follow up deal I mean I don't know what the numbers are in terms of undecided than a lot of these places that you think most people have pretty much made up their minds and people are already going to the polls early voting in many places\nGuns right people are caffeine yeah I mean there was a poll recently that that\nWas looking at trying to try to isolate the number of independents in the electorate right 'cause most most polls show you how to use up and down to five Republican Democrat or independent and then for that group of independence of saying well which way he's leading the push them to call them leaders in one direction", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Alan Colmes Show", "city": "Albuquerque",
