I Know\nWith the ... so I don't think of an elephant this why would never do this are typically but the common man and Kanye match made in heaven now the reason why I mean the first time that someone sending me messages you got to see this and I I didn't I wasn't near TV I watch five minutes of the crap\nAnd it was five minutes I'll never get back in my life out of the first thing I thought what norm and and and be ready what Joe\nWell yeah yeah what the hell is this is a joke is is buried somewhere how about this are you kidding I worked for you know we may get a deal and they feel wonderful

a youthful idiot used a youthful idiots trying to gain the headlines\nAnd and I think some of us so for nine right now kind of fallen for it in the sense that I just wanted to\nSpotlight fact but

world all of us there were all white guys now so I'm an old white guy\nAnyway to me when I'm observing is that the African American community kinda writ large uh has\nAlready largely discounted in deeply discounted con yang basically saying he's not real he's just you know whatever you do a part of what we got in mind I think they just kind of mentally separated from him he feels he seems to be you know\nOh it's I don't I don't follow this stuff I'm not target demo I don't have young kids like you do uh but I Know that he's kind of had these breakdowns on stage where he's been supposedly doing a concert and all of a sudden you start talking to change the years not been about a debt situation or whatever I mean the guy obviously you know look this\nThere's something wrong with the guy he's got sick himself the guy said\nThis about one more of the labels it needs to be put to rest norm Ninety nine percent of us now means almost all of this reality show people and and the news and all the uh the cable news networks don't we use reality t._v. it's not reality to have a TV camera in your faith\nEven if it's for a week or however long\nYou have it for the show that's not reality reality is we don't have them in our lives and so we got to stop that because that is a bad label and this guy isn't crazy he's just not\nBash right well John I guess everybody's allowed to live their lives the way they want to live their life within reasonable limits right I mean if you want to be an ax murderer or you're not allowed to live your life the way you want to live your life I guess we have laws against murder and stuff but if Kanye West wants\nTo act like a fool Kanye West has the right time like a fool absolutely I mean they lie in her absolutely and the fact that Benedict was that like a full well look we we allowed\nHim to be there it if it were up to me and I have you know my\nLittle weight on Twitter has been hey why don't we just ignore con you you know go away and and obviously we can't ignore him and he's not going away because he's been invited to the White House by Benedict Donald and when you get invited to the White House by whoever's in the White House that

just completely destroying themselves and then we went in to I Believe the Kavanaugh effect they called the ...\nIs that what they ... they call you know they do they call it the bread bounds you lay out I wanted ... now now I don't have to hear that from him every day at ... think about Israel and then we played some sound from the ... interview\nOver in Africa and all one wanted to talk about is what she was wearing and a very fashion conscious\nAnd then and then we sandwich cottage in there and then at the end there's a new poll that says eighty percent of the country hates political correctness and get this [noise] the people that hate it the most are Native Americans Hispanics and black Americans\nHow did it defined political correctness can I ask you know what I don't read deeply for\nUm a headline kind of guy we we have like guy goes deep into the uh now he breaks\nIt down I uh we looked at the polls and that's shocking you know as someone that's lived and died by political correctness I have moons to prove it just watch a waters world but if I had known everybody was on my side I Would have done things a little differently\nUm so what do you have a ... about this weekend's a live show because Trump speaking we have and culture diamond and silk and still do it every week everyone here is that good are you asking it back on yet we will talk about\nKanye and

best done over you watch the editor you watch the eight o'clock silver and then you watch the eleven o'clock\nDrunk and you compare\nIt's always better at eleven [laughter]\nSo you were just talking about the five and we didn't get to county let's play very quickly caught one this was one of the more interesting comments from Kanye West today that got a lot of attention talking about liberals and the African American community Kanye West taken away\nA lot of times it's just an overall lack of reparations that we can be given point we say this is right because this is this is racist racist so we don't have a reason why we had a Thirteen we got up\nThe whole conversation so and I got to move from one of the movies that I Love the liberals tried to do\nOf a black person to the concept of racism because they know that we're very proud of most people when I said I'm like try to like someone as liberal they'll say oh what do you think of what\nCan you just you just um at your thoughts yeah\nUh I did not understand the first half as much at all I can but I think the second half of the soundbite was that\nLiberals use racism as a weapon against black people to keep them voting Democrat and to keep them angry at Republicans and you can see that for decades how the Republican Party has just been savagely attacked\nFor any policy they have as trying to keep the black men down whereas if you look at the Democratic policies have they benefit of the African American community there is a big debate about that\nMy point for the ... thing was this was about made in America this was a business meeting he went in there as a shoe guy or whatever he's trying to sell and he's saying I Can't even open up a factory in Detroit or Chicago or in Atlanta because the costs are so high because China's out they're stealing all the jobs\nAnd he said that black Americans in some of these urban areas because the jobs of left for China are forced to do with legal things to feed their family and they wind up in prison so it's a vicious cycle and he wants to make America great again by having things made in America again\nAnd if you can get Donald Trump black by in on\nThe made in America gender the trade agenda the manufacturing agenda that's a huge boost to the U.S economy and you're going to see a renaissance in this country and that's\nWhy the Democrats are so scared Jesse we had a bad one William's on the show yesterday and we were talking about his new book why the hell do you have to lose I'm Sorry to hear that and ... and he was talking about ... he brought him up specifically and basically we're saying this is kind of tokenism\nFrom the Trump Administration they find high profile black people who support them whereas most black people do not and they bring them in front of the cameras to praised Trump and it makes them feel better and it's sort of this is sort of a cheap stunt rather than a policy argument or a serious effort to engage the African American community what do you think about point\n[noise] I Believe a lot of Democrats feel that way and it's sad because ... not a prop as one said today on the show ... is a challenge to artists in America right now he's not a policy expert but he wields a lot of influence and power\nIn his community and financially and when he talks people listen so\nI don't see anything wrong with the president bringing in voices from all shapes and sizes and colors and background I think Trump to convene or he's a summit guy he does deals in the boardroom he did it on guns\nHe's done it on race and there's nothing wrong with bringing people with different backgrounds to talk to I think he was always friends with the African American community there's pictures all over the Internet\nOf him with black Americans Americans love Donald Trump he didn't president sued\nNo God now okay we're going to take a break I'm going to collect myself we'll be right back [noise]\n\n\nCome in contact

speaking to African American communities during the campaign and one in his book runs through\nAll the ways that Donald Trump is hurting the black community in his in his argument whether it's ... you

salaries during the damage on France's cue senators are demanding the U.S take action against Saudi Arabia over but he presumed enough of us based journalist or my grocery with the Kenyan report\nSenator Jeff flake a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tells ABC's This week Saudi Arabia has some explaining to do\nOr what he wants to do and he says it of course that that that's something that that absolutely does concern me he said but what is my alternative he said if I leave the country where it's heading right now the lowly goes off the cliff yeah and he said so I I've got to make these changes and so most of us who looked at the middle east for a while have wish them well\nYou know what this is not only will change this country but change the country's I'm In the middle east and bring a degree of modernity to them that that we haven't seen in generations\nYou know I I think that's right and and when I first started focusing on Saudi Arabia king side was still alive I mean the things that ... been someone had done where we're glimmers of hope you know in in the back of people's mind at that time and and particularly in general I think it's interesting how NBS\nHas focused on opening up to foreign investment he talked about making aramco public\nUm he had he had very much\nTried to show the kingdom as a place that foreigners could feel comfortable investing in which for a long time they had not seen it again it's like you said it seems to me if he's trying to show that there's a new came down\nDoing something like this would be so counterproductive and yet we have no answers more than a weekend\nYeah um I think the the president certainly I I Believe it's taken a right action in the sense that um while this is not an American citizen this as an ally of the United states\nAnd we have a a got our Federal Bureau of investigation involved in this uh and that's a good thing\nI'm a ... certainly that's being done with the cooperation\nOf another ally and really you know a strained ally at the present in terms of turkey but also the president stated it with the cooperation of of Saudi Arabia I mean obviously based on the facts that we have right now I'm which I'm not complete by anybody's ... a\n... statement they look highly suspicious because obviously what one fact we do have somebody I mean we we saw Jamal go into the consulate\nAnd if there was evidence she came out of it believe me we would have seen it yet I'm so that alone you know be got so many questions as to what actually transpired and inside that consulate and and the suggests that while he just left by the back door and then there's no there's no surveillance of the back door\nUh that's highly unlikely\nUm yes so it is suspicious but I I think we also have to wait and and then let's let this investigation or them play out I I certainly ... miles welfare is the thing that's most important that he is a ... a dissident journalist or who's been willing to take on the regime\nOf for his his says that the regime has not move fast enough to correct\nOr some of the ills that has had and it doesn't take much to light a match and the Congress when it comes to Saudi Arabia and create a bonfire and um the suspicions alone are beginning to do that because the Congress has had\nThe challenges with the regime for some time\nI'm particularly over a human rights are justified and also a most recently they've had concern with him over Yemen and the and the killing of a of civilians up in in their judgment disproportionately so [noise]\nAnd so those concerns of have always been there and I I I Believe the sewer this investigation as it gets completed and the thought on this other hopefully will will be something people would have have confidence and one thing I I I'm not as enthusiastic about\nIs any proclamations coming from turkey because there's there's there are stark divisions between\nSaudi Arabia and and turkey and the ... the number of journalists that I'm Out on has on his jailhouse right now yeah hardly gives him any\nPlatform to point a finger at at any one else when it comes to this kind of horrific behavior so I take what they say a guarded Lee yes it does I mean it couldn't be factual but we also need to know the history here\nThat's right they're certainly not an unbiased observer you mentioned President Trump and pressure from Congress and I think that's that's where we should go next because there is pressure from the Senate\nParticularly and not just Democrats are people like Rand Paul I think you're going to hear more of this if we find the fatty they're responsible President Trump was asked today how the u._s. should respond let's take a listen and cut fifty his response

editor of the cook Political Report and she knows all things midterms Amy it's great to see you\nWell I'm very happy to be here I just am under dress ... can't say that but\nYes I Am a fantastic in his tax rate I talked to although I for the purposes of the live stream I did not put on my vest or my bow tie and trying to keep it really ran that people really manage that populist streak in you it's dry\nI have never claimed to be a populist [laughter] okay well maybe if he made no\nFree alcohol\nA lovely evening at a very cool venue here in DC and all I had to do is put on a tuxedo and show up on their tiger yeah and it's funny I when we when we arrived in the studio earlier before the break and he was like what are you doing a tuxedo and we were\nReminiscing about one of the greatest lines ever from thirty rock where Alec Baldwin character\nJack Donohue is wearing a tuxedo and Liz Lemon and me are up Tina Fey walked into the his office and says what are you doing attracts you know he says\nIt's after five PM I'm not a farmer um again was that populism is burning right well that's that's the whole ... I've never seen that show oh you got to get on that\nI can you not have seen that short Iraq is brilliant terrific yeah it's very very funny and I think it's available on one of the streaming services now I don't have that either [laughter]\nOh my God [noise] well I play with the pop culture wasteland\nUh-huh yeah without let's move on from ... total lack of finding out about really exciting things like the ... yes that's fun [laughter] let's let's start on the Senate side because that's the side that makes me happy or um it does seem like a lot of these races are if not breaking\nTurning we're veering in the Republican direction pulling out of Texas in Tennessee and some of these other red states looking pretty strong for the GOP I Want to ask you do Amy about Nevada Lucy ... now a Dean Heller clinging to a one or two or three point lead\nThe bad news for him is that a lot of the undecided just a few undecided leftover are anti Trump\nThe good news for him as you still had his opponent is pretty bad favorable life he's running a pretty tough race what do you make of of that contest and do you think if you had to put down some poker chips uh-huh would you bet on Dean Heller 'cause that's maybe the toughest one of the country\nI think that I'm Glad you brought that race up\nTo things the first is I think people assume because it's Nevada and Democrats at least at the presidential level have carried it Trump I mean I'm Sorry Obama carried it easily in two thousand and eight and twenty twelve Hillary Clinton carried it by a narrow margin that it's a blue state\nWhat it is is really it's a red state but it also has a significant\nLatino population that helps give it a blue tent so um this is a state that is a in terms of the population that is there that's white it is less a fluent\nFewer college educated voters they're you know just if you compare for example the Nevada to Colorado both have significant Latino populations diverse populations and their major urban areas but the electorate in Colorado\nI think this is true they may per capita have more college graduates than any other state people who have advanced degrees so just the type a voter in\nNevada is much more ... of the Trump profile type voter than\nIn Colorado so that's number one the second thing I think about every time we go to Nevada and we see a close race I think about Harry Reid and every poll and twenty ten had him losing um [noise] that race obviously much\nWorst year for Democrats in twenty ten and worst candidate and the recall absolutely [noise]\nOther polls to you this is a polite to pull the race of the race always looks really tight and that sort of breaks open at the end the theory being that Harry Reid\nHas that machine he knows how to turn those voters out they may not show up and pulling and the other thing that doesn't show up in polling is Latino voters that it's the Tories Lee difficult to model\nAnd so there's just this pool of voters out there that aren't going to get picked up in a in traditional polling I Would just say that the the ... the best thing going for Democrats right now again is the is the mood right now in the country\nWhich they should be getting to then you can also say well maybe this and do the as them isn't really as you know that the Kevin album or whatever it is isn't as significant as we thought it is but I I definitely am going to um you know look to compare it to where we were at the presidential not at the last ... yeah\nAnd there's also you know just some data points that or\nI saw NPR andme Eris there are big national poll that just came out they've Trump's job approval at forty one percent among Latinos and that I just fell out of my chair on that one and there was a piece of slate talking about how some of the polls have him in the high thirties low forties among Latinos how's that going to play out in some of these congressional race I like\nHer Bellow or will hurt or whatever so All right

guilty of every single time used to order the election with food and actually well\nDid on that point one of the things that we've heard over and over again and I don't always think this is an unfair criticism of the president ... from the left he his words his attacks are undermining Americans faith in their institutions Brad think sometimes that's for sure a fair it is not on Donald Trump\nBut I look at what's happened in the wake of the cabinet confirmation and I saw someone had a tweet today where they ran through and they had screen shots of left do you think pieces on we must repeal the Senate\nWe must of vox today abolished the case we're following the Supreme Court Alexandria Ocasio Cortez when you do a lemonade the electoral college mhm and think progress the constitution has failed and so they lose and rather than\nLooking at maybe why they lost their like less actually attacked our institutions well sure\nAnd they used the same people are lecturing you about overturning norms right norms really the revolutionary party is telling me that they're really for the status quo no it's just the opposite look\nThey are not acting in good faith and I and I have a million friends who are liberals I live in a liberal see the most democratic city in the country Washington DC and I've lived here most of my life a lot of liberals who believe what they believe in good faith right for sure yeah but the ... and by the way what I learned in writing this because I'm a liberal\nActually I mean I'm very suspicious of concentrations of corporate power why wouldn't that be I Believe absolutely and freedom of speech and association and due process I mean I sincerely believe I'm very suspicious of an expansionist foreign policy and basically kind of anti war and for whatever's worth I'm against that\nI'm also you know very pro life opposed to abortion but these are traditional liberal these ones I grew up with\nAnd they have been abandoned by the left which is now taking the polar opposite position so they're siding with\nApple and Google and Facebook massive companies run by teenage billionaires against a population really isn't is everything you feel if expediency isn't it partly partly those those companies have paid an ... an indulgence essentially to the left by funding the left\nAnd by you know making transgender bathrooms are supporting black lives matter symbolic and yet free gestures that inoculate them from criticism and to the left turns its I the thing that it is feared most which is huge accumulation of corporate power that basically make democracy impossible and that's what we're getting I Know the last couple\nOf weeks have been tough they've been tough on this show we'd had a really strong disagreements on Kavanaugh not even really coming at it\nFrom the same vantage point at all like right like basic fundamental disagreements about how to view the question of right Kavanaugh should be on the court and presumption of innocence and all of that but you know your subtitle there talks about these elitists or the ruling class pushing us to the brink quote the brink of revolution\nYou believe that the brick revolution\nWhile we're in the middle of a revolution we already had a revolution Donald Trump who is not a Republican and not a conservative got basically\nOver through the Republican Party which hated him or hated him so much they tried to take the nominal waste nation away from him at the convention there Republicans scheming to convince electoral vote against him no one hated Trump as much as the Republican Party Washington DC I I live here I Know\nAnd he took over the party and then took over the country as president I mean Donald Trump really I've known her for Twenty years 'cause I'm In the media I I'm not against or by actually like Trump I think he's saying a lot of important things\nYou write a happy country doesn't elect Donald Trump needless to say I mean is the clearest possible society people say I'm not sure what the public things really\nKnow one thing they think they hate you that's why they elected Trump adding [laughter] I Want to ask you about something and this is somewhat related to it's in the back of my mind's been bugging me all week and then I saw a tweet today from Ezra Klein\nWho and this is actually really interesting tweet so there's a there's a podcast called slow burn just going back and really chronicling the Clinton impeachment\nAnd here's what as we're tweeted today he's a ... if you don't know liberal journalists you should listen to the season finale of slow burn Juanita broader ex allegations against Bill Clinton are credible and horrifying and hearing her tell the story is a gut punch\nSetting aside you know whatever it was this ... it's a free pass but here's here's like\nHere's the thing that's been bothering me we just went through this whole thing where there was one credible allegation against Brett Kavanaugh the rest I don't take seriously and it had no corroboration whatsoever including from the people that the alleged victim put at the place you could\nCorroborate or they couldn't she couldn't name the location or the date or anything like that but it is basically a belief of the entire left almost the entire left that Brett Kavanaugh because of that should be of should have been left off the Supreme\nCourt's not their belief they don't mean any of it\nBill Clinton's expendable to them they can't get anything from him he's an older white southern conservative who has nothing to give them any more Keith Ellison who is the deputy chairman of the DNC has been in the words misery ... credibly accused by his girlfriend from two years ago and it says she has videotape\nAnd they're of the nation tape but yeah well she says she's making the tapes his show which doesn't trust them but her view is I talked to one or the other day her view is the Democratic party has just completely blown off and they have\nAnd so why what's the difference when Keith Ellison a Bill Clinton Keith Ellison is a sitting officeholders member of Congress look this doesn't have anything to do with protecting women if it did Ted Kennedy would not be a liberal icon he killed a woman it literally killed a woman literal yeah in a horrible way actually\nBut the point is sort of it's almost treated as impolite to bring that fact up oh I was I was on the set when he died and by the way I knew Ted Kennedy and actually they were good things about Ted Kennedy I just think if Ted Kennedy is\nYou know your ... either living example of a feminist erode the criteria are using to describe how much are very different from mine but going back to Clinton too I this was a long\nTime ago so I was doing some some reading there was a piece in slate from Nineteen Ninety nine that ran through some of the evidence that Juanita Broderick brought forward against him she said that he raped her in a hotel room do it as an adult and I did not realize that she had told five people almost immediately afterwards that had happened in one of her friends found her crying and bleeding\nImmediately after NBC wouldn't put it in an interview with her ... that is if we're comparing that is so much more credible and corroborated than anything against Brett Kavanaugh classic\nRational conservative linear thinker literal person I Am too I'm not in any way criticizing but you're completely missing the point is nothing to do with the facts or women or protecting women are stopping sexual they're happy to abide sexual assault they knew what he was doing everybody did I did\nI covered this whole thing was never any question about it all being true\nThey didn't care because they could get him to veto two partial birth abortion bans or whatever they want it but they're like he's still fundraising for the parties I'm sure he'll speak when he's when he won't he won't you don't think so because look the his sin isn't being a sexual abuse or there are lots of those in the Democratic party well Keith Ellison just been accused as I said\nNo his chin is being in the wrong demographic were against older southern white man that's like disgusting to us\nAnd being useless like there's nothing there's nothing but Clinton can do for the Democrats so it's only about political power\nAnd that they just send you fell
