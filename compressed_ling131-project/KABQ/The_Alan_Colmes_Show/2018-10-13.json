C.\nAnd he thought he would be arrested if he returned the United states\nNow Saudi targeted other people it just hasn't made a lot of news riots but Dolly a got a thousand lashes for insulting Islam\nAnd could show himself was not exactly the ah I Want a revolution guy I wanted to mention that he's not a guy that said we should overturn the royal family and in fact he he was quoted Thomas saying that that type of regime change would be quote ridiculous right\nI Want to point out when his troubles started because it's just quite fascinating\nMister show gauge a march ... was was killed a his troubles began when he gave a speech to an American think tank after President Trump's victory he argued the Saudi Arabia should be quote rightfully nervous about a Trump presidency\nAt a time when the kingdom was cozying up to then of course President Trump we know the whole history of that now many presidents have goes up to Saudi Arabia I'm not saying that but I did want to point out his troubles seriously began with the kingdom not ever calling for revolution\nBut his troubles began when he tried to say that you know the two countries should watch the ties with the Trump White house so I think\nThat's interesting I Wonder if that's why I'm wrong is what provoked to Mohammed bin Salman to reach out to Trump and then you know do do that whole song and dance to to impress tromp and suck up to and yes\nAnd also you know the fact that um the president's comments I'm sure you whatever that today on your show\nI haven't yet no I have a what basically what Trump said is that a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of arms sales is more important than a human rights record\nAnd by the way it's not really a hundred and ten billion dollars with the arms sales it was twelve billion\nThat a Trump a deal with Trump or soak the things the yanks but actually there still is no deal I was just a a memorandum of understanding so there are no arms sales or at least from the Trump Administration a lot of those is you know goes back to deals that ... caught so Trump is lion through his teeth as he always does\nA about this but apparently you know the Saudis have handed tens of millions maybe hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump\nIn in laundering money or buying apartments and things you know from his companies and they are currently a saying in the Trump Hotels and to you know to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars a day in some cases are all over the country\nOr you're correct to show here's what he said twice when he had a chance to at least backtrack a little bit of what she did\nA he has eluded to the fact that show is not a U.S citizen here's here's a quote it's in Turkey and it's not and it's not it's not a citizen\nAs I understand it right but the thing like that shouldn't happen president said again comma this took place in Turkey and to the best of our knowledge ... is not a United States citizen is that right question mark [noise]\nSo you know the point is ... is a resident he lives in Virginia and he works for the Washington Post that people are starting to put out a thing there Tom which is pretty disgusting that all the media never went after Saudi Arabia when he when when one of their own is gone after they've always let them slight on human rights which is not true the media is\nMore than expose it but the United states government\nLets Saudi Arabia slights I just wanted to mention a little bit of background there's also a very interesting fact it because uh the president's son in law Jared Kushner is the quote Mideast guy you know and obviously\nAnd I ended up in public ... public beheadings and uh oh we're not going to push back on you know it used to be now I got to push back on that but they they get a lot of money to the ... best preachers and the ... the source of al Qaida and ISIS but we're not really going to talk about that because we need their oil\nWell now we don't need their oil although we're still buying their oil\nBecause we changed the law and the United states so they all companies can actually export American oil she got some oil companies exporting American oil other oil companies uh you know buying a the tar sands from Canada and refining them here in the United states and actually exporting the product of that\nBut we're still importing Saudi oil and a this is you know I I think personally I think it's\nTime for us to reexamine our relationship with the kingdom if they don't start significantly changing their behavior this is this is a and I ... a really consequential issue Alberta marina del Rey Albert thanks for waiting on hold there so long what's on your mind that I [noise]\nHey Tom thanks for taking my call messaging a little bit ... a pretty massive messaging before the ... and I was running for Congress or the office all I Would be talking about the corruption and then you know leading up to the election and post\nElection all Democrats should be talking about in Medicare\nOr ... and Medicare for all the degree and some of some of the objections we need to go ahead and be ready to take on things like high\nProtection and I got two words but people who don't understand what that is Martin scrambling and if you want to explain what that guy did I I'll go ahead and take the call off line but Martin ... we're going to be fighting protection and we can't be scared to you know\nThey need to know how to program actually work\nYeah and my mind is currently was the was this a young venture capitalists who bought a pharmaceutical company that that made an obscure a drug that was absolutely essential\nTo our you know a couple of tens of thousands of people in the United states whoever rare genetic genetic condition as I recall correctly if I'm wrong Albert\nAnd then he ... the price of that drug rep seven hundred percent just to make money for himself and then he bragged about it um he's in jail right now for fraud because he also runs a venture capital firm that was apparently a you know they can gauging fraudulent behavior\nI Would add another name to that and I believe her name is Heather brash which was Joe mansions daughter\nWho is the CEO of the company that sells ... pounds and she jak the price on those things up another vitally important thing for people who have allergies [noise] making sense Albert [noise]\nThat is correct comment also a lot of that we can't be scared to that that's the only way you're going to be able to control costs but also with Medicare it would be criminal and I would say it would be criminal if you don't\nWorry about the supply and people going into the health care for that should understand that there should be protected and we should not their education because the only way you're going to truly long term of upon that more people giving chair\nI agree I agree and we should also um by law stop the AMA from limiting the number of people who've been graduated from medical schools in the United states ah this this uh\nKnocked down monopoly we're may has had you know operated as a union basically only as kind of the worst aspect of unionism limiting the supply of labor to drive up the price of the labor is not doing a any kind of favor to the American people Albert thank you spot on Laura in Chicago I Laura what's up\n[noise] yeah Hi I'm so I'm ... I'm with clean count Cook County I'm In the actual election integrity activists I'm not um\nWhat's your name turnout on track to eventually say not to draw out of trouble so I wanted to talk to you about what people can do if they find that they had been purged from the voting rolls are there are things that they can do\nSo if you discovered an advanced on November\n... you had been purged\nWe're asking everybody to check your voting rights a registration online ... if you discovered advance then it's really beneficial to take ... of the voter registration cars mailers from the election division copies of emails I'm Down to the election division with at least two pieces of ID\nOkay most states require two pieces\nRight you need to monitor residency and your and your citizenship\nThat's exactly right that's exactly right and you go down to the election division if other people in your neighborhood had the courage to spell than go down in the group that does help do show up with several people\nMy age and he will um and it's you can record what the official said back to you in some manner but you have to be discreet okay and so you go down there and you have to be reinstated\nAnd don't um you know the they made a\nPut some hurdles over you would ever asked every time they put up a hurdle say okay if I Do this than when will I be reinstated pushed them for an actual date\nThat he will be back on the rules so that you can check okay I have heard of many people that have gotten back on the rules if they push push you know the squeaky wheel decay\nRoyal otherwise it's after the election that they'll take care of it is that the problem\nYeah well here's the deal that's exactly right so if they you also at the same time\nI think that everybody if you're supporting the candidate or candidates in your area you should notify them that you've been encouraged and that you're in the process what the election officials have told you so that they can start gathering names there have been challenges to elections\nBased on voter purges show that's very important for candidates to know you do have the right to go on a lecture day or end in early voting on the states that have early voting and vote on a provisional ballot\nThat you cannot stop at just voting at the ballot okay here are things that we recommend first of all you have to complete that ballot on the outside envelope exactly how you are you think you're registered to vote so carry your voter registration card with you because\nSome people may say San Tunisia junior\nAnd forget they registered junior right\nRight or in Georgia if if I said Thomas see period Hartman in one thing and I simply so Thomas see her without the period after my middle name or my middle middle initial in another place right now Bryan cap would refuse to register made a vote\nThat's exactly right that's it so on your voter registration card it will say how you registered to vote so please sign the ... like that okay and I'm In complete it completely a lot of traditional speech actually did a study in Chicago\nUm after the election on provisional ballots and only thirty percent of them were counted and uh but some people didn't fill out the lump they just didn't they didn't even\nTouch guarantees the provisional ballot gets thrown away\nRight exactly so a youth fill that out\nYou take a picture if you can in the privacy of your a bow to vote in both of your voted ballot an ear that completed ... turn off the flash okay cause some in some states you get is illegal to take a picture of you about\nOkay so turn off the bat and it's definitely illegal to take pictures of other people voting in a polling place so they may have a real connection so\nUm and then you go down with your pieces of ID take all the pieces of ID you can down to the um the election officials\nAnd during the week after the election day acquitted or World War and the new argue and if you can go in a great\nYeah you said I'm Laura we just have five seconds left isn't it a shame that we have to jump through all these damn hope so I mean\nYou know the service registers Eighteen year olds are young men as soon as soon as they turn Eighteen why can't we do that with voters\nThe declaration of service government knows as a citizen who is [noise] you know the residents in the United states are not getting the selective service notices when they turn Eighteen just citizens we know when we are\nThis is this is crazy this is all designed to keep the Republicans empower Laura thank\nYou very much will be back\n...

go in and wind up in the Gulf of Mexico or ...\nI I Would guess that a lot of wind up in landfills Daniel but that's a really good question I have never thought to to ask\n'em but it's got to be an issue and it's got to be an issue that's been dealt with in the past I mean this was a part of the world where we regularly see hurricanes but are massively destructive although they're getting worse and worse\nUm I I I remember a news story after Hurricane Sandy out of New Jersey that some landfills were being inappropriately uh uh you know they were they were dumping stormed are bringing these landfills in a way that was not consistent with the law proper environmental practices\nUm but I I Can't remember any more details on that so um but I just uh Daniel I just don't know that's a good question maybe somebody listening will know we'll we'll get the get the word out\nThere thank you Daniel for the call a mile in highland park Illinois a mile itself you want to talk about Rick Simpson oil\n[noise] yes I have leukemia and\nAt two years ago I went on the ... oil and found that it was a you have to get up you have to work yourself up to a whole Graham a day for and that and and the Illinois it's legal and and so I wanted to make sure that it was you know ... ... as she said it was you know nothing wrong with it nothing tasted so so to get it legally\nEighty dollars a grant eighty dollars Graham per day is a lot of money so after a year my numbers were still the same so finally I said well I'm a I'm going to go broke here so I went I went to a different doctor and I went on chemo\nAnd the first month because my cells recovered bitchy each state my numbers went back to normal I went right into remission it's amazing so that you can't say that it gives you do anything

seen this with my own eyes and in my own family I you know when Louis wants her chemotherapy for breast cancer she was also smoking pot for the nausea and I think it was\nHer in ways beyond just analogy but it was fabulously successful for that you're suggesting that the Rick Simpson oil\nAlong with chemotherapy was more effective than in your opinion or your experience chemotherapy along was and still like okay thank you for that ...\nThat ... that if you if you're using conventional treatment and and then augmenting them with natural things and I realize there are some cancer doctors who don't like that but\nUm you know that that's the end and there are others who are enthusiastic about Louise had one of eight shatter one regular oncologist who was like\nDon't take anything else and then I had a another oncologist who ah who Ellen rat are hooked us up with who was up in New York as a regular empty and uh you know specializes in cancer but he said oh here take this and you know

that point one of the things that we've heard over and over again and I don't always think this is an unfair criticism of the president but when I heard it from the left he his words his attacks are undermining Americans faith in their institutions ... sometimes that's for sure a fair it is not on Donald Trump\nBut I look at what's happened in the wake of the cabinet confirmation and I saw someone had a tweet today where they ran through and they had screen shots of lefty think pieces on we must repeal the Senate\nWe must of vox today abolished the case we're following the Supreme Court

book is it I'm a liberal\nActually I mean I'm very suspicious of concentrations of corporate power why wouldn't that be I Believe absolutely and freedom of speech and association and due process I mean I sincerely believe I'm very suspicious of an expansionist foreign policy and basically kind of anti war and for whatever's worth I'm against ...\nI'm also you know very pro life opposed to abortion but these are traditional liberal these ones I grew up with\nAnd they have been abandoned by the left which is now taking the polar opposite position so they're siding with\nApple and Google and Facebook massive companies run by teenage billionaires against the population really isn't is everything you fearless expediency isn't it partly partly those those companies have paid an a a a an indulgence essentially to the left by funding the left\nAnd by you know making transgender bathrooms are supporting black lives matter and symbolic and yet free gestures that inoculate them from criticism\nAnd sort of left turns its I the thing that it it feared most which is huge accumulation of corporate power that basically make democracy impossible and that's what we're getting and it'll last couple of weeks have been tough they've been tough on this show we'd had really strong disagreements on Kavanaugh not even really coming at it\nFrom the same vantage point at all like right like basic fundamental disagreements about how to view the question of right Kavanaugh should be on the court and presumption of innocence and all of that\nBut you know your subtitle there talks about\nThese elitists or the ruling class pushing us to the brink quote the brink of revolution\nDo you believe that the brake revolution\nWhile we're in the middle of a revolution we already had a revolution Donald Trump who is not a Republican and not a conservative got basically\nOver through the Republican Party which hated him or hated him so much they tried to take the nominal waste nation away from him at the convention there Republicans scheming to convince electrodes to vote against him no one hated Trump as much as the Republican Party Washington DC I I live here are now\nAnd he took over the party and then took over the country as president I mean Donald Trump really I've known her for Twenty years 'cause I'm In the media\nI I'm not against Trump actually like Trump I think he's saying a lot of important things you write a happy country doesn't elect Donald Trump needless to say I mean is it clear as possible to science people say I'm not sure what the public thinks really\nKnow one thing they think they hate you that's why they elected Trump heading\nI Want to ask you about something and this is somewhat related to it's in the back of my mind's been bugging me all week and then I saw a tweet today from Ezra Klein who and this is actually really interesting tweet so there's a there's a podcast called slow burn just going back and really chronicling the Clinton impeachment\nAnd here's what as we're tweeted today he's a ... if you don't know liberal journalists you should listen to the season finale of slow burn Juanita broader ex allegations against Bill Clinton are credible and horrifying and hearing her tell the story is a gut punch\nSetting aside you know whatever it was this ... it's a free pass but here's here's like\nHere's the thing that's been bothering me we just went through this whole thing where there was one credible allegation against Brett Kavanaugh the rest I don't take seriously and it had no corroboration whatsoever including from the people that the alleged victim put at the place you could\nCorroborate or they couldn't she couldn't name the location or the date or anything like that but it is basically a belief of the entire left almost the entire left that Brett Kavanaugh because of that should be of should have been left off the Supreme Court's not their belief they don't mean any of it\nBill Clinton's expendable to them they can't get anything from him he's an older white southern conservative who has nothing to give them any more Keith Ellison who is the deputy chairman of the DNC has been in the words mazer Klein credibly accused\nBy his girlfriend from two years ago and it says she has videotape and they're of the nation tape but yeah well she says she's making the tapes his show which doesn't trust them but her view is I talked to one of the day her view is the Democratic party has just completely blown off and they have\nAnd so why what's the difference when Keith Ellison a Bill Clinton Keith Ellison is a sitting officeholders member of Congress look this doesn't have anything to do with protecting women if it did Ted Kennedy would not be a liberal icon he killed a woman that literally killed a woman literal yeah in a horrible way actually\nBut the point is sort of it's almost treated as impolite to bring that fact up oh I was I was on the set when he died and by the way I knew Ted Kennedy and actually they were good things about Ted Kennedy I just think if Ted Kennedy is\nYou know your ... either living example of a feminist erode the criteria are using to describe how much are very different from mine but going back to Clinton too I this was a long time ago so I was doing some some reading there was a piece in slate from Nineteen Ninety nine that ran through some of the evidence that Juanita Broderick brought forward against him she said\nThat he raped her in a hotel room do it as an adult\nAnd I did not realize that she had told five people almost immediately outdoors that had happened in one of her friends found her crying and bleeding\nImmediately after NBC wouldn't put it in an interview with her ... that is if we're comparing that is so much more credible and corroborated than anything against Brett Kavanaugh Ira classic rational conservative linear thinker literal person I Am too I'm not in any way criticizing\nBut you're completely missing the point is nothing to do with the facts or women or protecting women are stopping sexual they're happy to abide sexual assault they knew what he was doing everybody did I did\nI covered this whole thing was never any question about it all being true they didn't care\nBecause they could get him to veto two partial birth abortion bans or whatever they want it but they're like he's still fundraising for the parties I'm sure he'll speak when he's when he won't he won't you don't think so because look the his in isn't being a sexual abuse or there are lots of those in the Democratic party well Keith Ellison has been accused as I said\nNo his chin is being in the wrong demographic were against older southern white man that's like disgusting to us\nAnd being useless like there's nothing there's nothing Bill Clinton can do for the Democrats so it's only about political power\nAnd that they defended Fidel Castro for fifty years like come on now I mean okay I mean point yeah

Benson and ... just guy Benson today hope you are well on this Friday I Want to talk about a Senate race out in Arizona that's gotten quite interesting\nWe're talking about any Walter yesterday on the show that a couple of the Senate races including Nevada where Dean Heller is hanging on their barely and nearby there's there Arizona race which is\nThe Jeff Flake seat\nRight so Senator McCain passed away that's being held by Jon Kyl for the moment and then there's the battle for the open seat from the retiring Jeff Flake between Republican Martha ...\nWho is I Believe the first ever female fighter pilot in combat in combat for the United states who served after nine eleven and then her opponent cure ... who's a congresswoman\nShe's a Democrat she positions herself now is a moderate this is something that she's been shifting on for years but she began her career a sort of as a radical leftist she was an opponent of even the Afghanistan war after nine eleven there's this crazy ad\nThat Martha mix Sally has run just opposing her in her fighter pilot\nUniform getting ready to run bombing missions over\nOver terrorists versus cures to send them up who was protesting the Afghanistan war in a pink to to\nBuy it is a very drastic difference between where these two women are coming from\nAnd more and more is coming out about ... and her very radical path she was a co hosts of this nutty left wing radio show with uh nine eleven conspiracy truther\nWas that was our co host CNN has a story today about she was in a discussion about the war I Believe in Iraq\nA few years later and she was talking to someone who\nMentioned hypothetically that if it was his choice he should be able to go and joined the Taliban and fight on behalf of the Taliban take up arms against the United states on behalf of the Taliban and she was just like OK yeah if you want to do that fine which is\nAn odd thing to say\nBut there have been a few speeches that have been discovered audio and video of speeches that she gave not back in two thousand and one\nOr two thousand two when she was in that era a law student involved with the Green Party involved with anarchists in communist she was really in the left wing far left wing mail you when she was younger but this was years later like a decade later\nShe was a state senator or she became a congresswoman she was an adult who was in some ways trying to burnish at least for the consumption of voters this more moderate unifying healer type\nImage because that's what she felt like she needed to do in a state like Arizona well occasionally though she would go out of state and give speeches\nToo liberal and left wing audiences and it turns out that she had had quite a habit of dumping on her state\nSo she would leave the state of Arizona to go talk to\nLiberal activists and she would attack and mark the citizens of her own state and now she's trying to run statewide to be a U.S senator she wants to represent the entire state of Arizona and these old clips from a couple of years ago at this point but not too long ago\nShe was in public life at this point you as an adult or she is apparently letting us know exactly how she feels about Arizona and the people of Arizona and it is not terribly flattering\nAlso I think it was the Washington Post the ... of the New York times did a whole story on her where she's gone around during her campaign talking about how she grew up homeless and has some specific\nWhen he was about her homelessness that apparently are not true and they found records to prove that they are not true so she sort of definitely grew up in difficult circumstances but she has exaggerated\nAnd sort of enhanced the difficulty of upbringing which seems gratuitous I mean she she has an interesting life story to tell but she's fabricated certain elements of it\nI guess for political gain she wants to have a more compelling story in\nAny case I Want to play you some of these audio soundbites that are now being released\nThe Republicans it seems like had been sitting on these for a while and now we're in mid October so it's time to drop the bomb shells in addition to that crazy Taliban exchange where she said she said\nBut this is an unusual cycle so if you're out there in Arizona I mean Martha ... Sally put everything on the line for this country she fought the terrorists\nTo my knowledge he's never said anything this insulting about the people of Arizona to very clear choice\nAnd the GOP would be nuts\nNot to exploit these self inflicted wounds and make sure every single voter is aware of what curiously cinema thinks of them exactly what she thinks of them because she said it herself and

it would be one thing if the if there was any sort of objective\nBasis for comparison here but there is no object a basis for comparison that war it's obvious that not only have we seen some left leaning moms that are trying to\nIntimidate people is doing what they want but also that we've seen democratic politicians were again on those mobs and suggesting that it's fine to cost people at restaurants and and try and get them thrown out of restaurants and that it's fine to\nA cost people in public spaces and scream at them and and that all of this is totally fine because his Mazie Hirono said white supremacy which again no relation to reality but\nIt it that that sort of Catholic missing going on it's pretty astonishing if people like Hillary Clinton saint the delivery is not an option at the right people on CNN are saying that no you know what everybody's being perfectly civil ... what I mean we're we're not crazy it's just that you could get letting us\nYeah and if a Republican were out there talking about kicking the left in this type of environment we would have a civility panic I remember the civility police ban back during the Tea Party era they were very alert and vigilant\nConstantly accusing tea partiers of violating civility they blame the Tea Party for the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords' which had nothing to do with politics whatsoever but it's a left wing myth that\nSurvived to this very day\nWhere anything that might be a bit heated became a rhetoric problem on the right and it's a\nIssue that Republicans had to answer for and conservatives in the media had to answer for and it seemed like a pretty transparent effort\nTo attack our ability to make points to argue they want to call it a very dangerous but then when there's actual left wing violence and the other direction at best they minimize it and at worst\nThey kind of shrug it off or endorse it or we get it and kind of agree with it\nYeah that's right and it's and it really is an amazing double standard because\nWe all remember that twenty sixteen when the left is very upset about President Trump's rhetoric on this score I think sometimes justifiably so oh yeah the same time they were at the same time they were shying away from saying anything about the Trump\nFor achieve a partisan and uh you know or or goal in this particular case last question ... pero about Kanye West thing I'm pretty consistently on the record I don't care what any of these celebrities have to say about politics whether they agree with me whether they disagree with me I just don't care they're welcome to say whatever they want sometimes they\nMight say it in a way that's offensive and other times it might be more thoughtful overall I don't care I Do find it interesting to see the left that traffics in this stuff all the time not only attacking ... for\nSaying nice things about Donald Trump but by their own set of rules mental health shaming using\nRacial slurs against him and getting big last uh again CNN was just a barrel of chuckles over calling him a minstrel show participants in a house and word I\nI'm I'm Amazed that this seems to be acceptable and it seemed like they they're just sort of giving away the game that the double standard could not be any clearer\nYeah and it it's it's quite obvious that look Tanya what led to send his lack and he's a celebrity\nAnd because he supports Trump he violated tenets of identity politics for the last ... celebrity you have to support the Democrats and if you're black you have to support the Democrats tiny didn't do

well you did well on that point one of the\nThings that we've heard over and over again and I don't always think this is an unfair criticism of the president heard it from the left he his words his attacks are undermining Americans faith in their institutions ... sometimes that's for sure a fair it is not on Donald Trump\nBut I look at what's happened in the wake of the cabinet confirmation and I saw someone had a tweet today where they ran through and they had screen shots of lefty think pieces on we must repeal the Senate\nWe must of vox today abolished the case we're following the Supreme Court Alexandria Ocasio Cortez when you do a lemonade the electoral college mhm and think progress the constitution has failed and so they lose and rather than looking at maybe why they lost their like ... let's actually attacked our institutions will sure\nThey used the same people are lecturing knew about overturning norms right norms really the revolutionary party is telling me that they're really for the status quo no just the opposite look\nThey are not acting in good faith and I and I have a million friends who are liberal I live in a liberal see the most democratic city in the country in Washington DC and I've lived here most of my one of the lot of liberals who\nBelieve what they believe in good faith right for sure yeah but the ... and what I learned in writing this because I'm a liberal\nActually I mean I'm very suspicious of concentrations are corporate power why wouldn't that be I Believe absolutely and freedom of speech and association and due process I mean I sincerely believe I'm very suspicious of an expansionist foreign policy and basically kind of anti war and for whatever's worth them against that felt\nI'm also you know very pro life opposed to abortion but these are traditional liberal these ones I grew up with\nAnd they have been abandoned by the left which is now taking the polar opposite position so they're siding with\nApple and Google and Facebook massive companies run by teenage billionaires against the population really isn't this everything you feel it's expediency isn't it partly partly those those companies have paid an a a a an indulgence essentially to the left by funding the left\nAnd by you know making transgender bathrooms are supporting black lives matter symbolic and yet free gestures that inoculate them from criticism\nAnd to the left turns its I the thing that it it feared most which is huge accumulation of corporate power that basically make democracy impossible and that's what we're getting I Know the last couple of weeks have been tough they've been tough on this show we had a really strong disagreements on Kavanaugh not even really coming at it\nFrom the same vantage point at all like right like basic fundamental disagreements about how to view the question of what happened now should be on the court and presumption of innocence and all of that but\nYou know your subtitle there talks about these elitists or the ruling class pushing us to the brink quote the brink of revolution [noise] do you believe that the brake revolution\nWhile we're in the middle of a revolution we already had a revolution Donald Trump who is not a Republican and not a conservative got basically\nOver through the Republican Party which hated him hate him so much they tried to take the nominal waste nation away from him at the convention there Republicans scheming to convince electoral vote against him\nNo one hated Trump as much as the Republican Party Washington DC I I live here I Know\nAnd he took over the party and then took over the country is president I mean Donald Trump really I've known for Twenty years 'cause I'm In the media\nI I'm not against her by actually like Trump I think he's saying a lot of important things you write a happy country doesn't elect Donald Trump evil is to say that I mean is the clearest possible society people I'm not sure what the public things really I Know one thing they think they hate you that's why they elected Trump betting [laughter]\nI Want to ask you about something and this is somewhat related to it's in the back of my mind's been bugging me all week and then I saw a tweet today from Ezra Klein\nWho and this is actually a really interesting to wait so there's a there's a podcast called slow burn just going back and really chronicling the Clinton impeachment and here's what as we're tweeted today he's a ... if you don't know liberal journalists\nYou should listen to the season finale of slow burn Juanita brought her ex allegations against Bill Clinton are credible and horrifying and hearing her tell the story is a gut punch\nSetting aside you know whatever it was this ... it's a free pass but here's here's like\nHere's the thing that's been bothering me we just went through this whole thing where there was one credible allegation against Brett Kavanaugh the rest I don't take seriously and it had no corroboration whatsoever including from the people that the alleged victim put at the place you could\nCorroborate or they couldn't she couldn't name the location or the date or anything like that but it is basically a belief of the entire left almost the entire left that Brett Kavanaugh because of that should be should have been left off the Supreme Court's not their belief they don't mean any of it\nBill Clinton's expendable to them they can get anything from him he's an older white southern conservative who has nothing to give them any more Keith Ellison who was the deputy chairman of the DNC has been in the words misery ... credibly accused by his girlfriend from two years ago and she has videotape\nAnd they're of the nation tape but yeah well she says you naked pictures show which doesn't trust them but her view as I talked to one of the day her view as the Democratic party has just gone off and they have\nAnd so why what's different from Keith Ellison and Bill Clinton Keith Ellison is a sitting officeholders member of Congress look this doesn't have anything to do with protecting women if it did Ted Kennedy would not be a liberal icon he killed a woman it literally killed a woman literal yeah in a horrible way actually\nBut the point is sort of it's almost treated as impolite to bring that fact up oh I was I was on the set when he died and by the way I knew Ted Kennedy and actually they were good things about Ted Kennedy I just think if Ted Kennedy is\nYou know your ... either living example of a feminist erode the criteria are using to describe the atmosphere is very different from mine but going back to Clinton too I this was a long time ago so I was doing some some reading there was a piece in slate from Nineteen Ninety nine that ran through some of the evidence that Juanita Broderick brought forward against him she said\nThat he raped her in a hotel room as an adult\nAnd I did not realize that she had told five people almost immediately outdoors that had happened and one of her friends found her crying and bleeding\nImmediately after NBC wouldn't put didn't interview and there wasn't there at that is if we're comparing that is so much more credible uncorroborated than anything against Brett Kavanaugh classic rational conservative linear thinker literal person I Am on to I'm not in any way criticizing\nBut you're completely missing the point is nothing to do with the facts or women or protecting women are stopping sexual ... they're happy to abide sexual assault they knew what he was doing everybody did I did\nI covered this whole thing was never any question about it all being true\nThey didn't care because they could get him to veto two partial birth abortion bats or whatever they want it but they're like he's still fundraising for the parties I'm sure he'll speak when he's when he won't he won't you don't think so because look at the his in isn't being a sexual abuse or there are lots of those in the Democratic party will keep that wasn't just been accused as I said\nNo his chin is being in the wrong demographic were against older southern white man that's like disgusting to us\nAnd being useless like there's nothing there's nothing Bill Clinton can do for the Democrats so it's only about political power\nAnd that they just send it fell Castro for fifty years like come on now I mean okay I mean point yeah there was a poison [laughter] Carlson is my guest tonight on Tucker Carlson tonight eight PM any major gets that we should tune in for I don't know I got to finish reading the lead oh

charges of\nPerjury and obstruction of justice by December Nineteen Ninety eight the Republican led house had gathered enough information from an investigation committee to vote in favor of impeachment which in turn sent the case to the Senate Bill Clinton was the first president to be impeached by the house of representatives since Andrew Johnson in Eighteen sixty eight Johnson was also

Lee Lewis records great falls the fire and the now the\n\nQuarterback Benson and are just guy Bentsen today hope you are well on this Friday I Want to talk about a Senate race out in Arizona that's gotten quite interesting\nTalking with any Walter yesterday on the show that a couple of the Senate races including Nevada or a Dean Heller is hanging on their barely and nearby there's there Arizona race which is\nThe Jeff Flake seat\nRight so Senator McCain passed away that's being held by Jon Kyl for the moment and then there's the battle for the open seat from the retiring Jeff Flake between Republican Martha ...\nWho is I Believe the first ever female fighter pilot in combat in combat for the United states who served after nine eleven and then her opponent cure ... who's a congresswoman\nShe's a Democrat she positions herself now as a moderate this is something that she's been shifting on for years but she began her career a sort of as a radical leftist she was an opponent of even the Afghanistan war after nine eleven there's this crazy ad\nThat Martha mix Sally has run just opposing her in her fighter pilots uniform getting ready to run bombing missions\nOver over terrorists versus cures to send them up who was protesting the Afghanistan war in a pink to to\nQuit is a very drastic difference between where these two women are coming from and more and more is coming out about ... and her very radical path she was a co host of this nutty left wing radio show with uh nine eleven conspiracy truther\nWas that was our co host CNN has destroyed today about she was in a discussion about the war I Believe in Iraq\nA few years later and she was talking to someone who\nMentioned hypothetically that if it was his choice he should be able to go and joined the Taliban and fight on behalf of the Taliban take up arms against the United states on behalf of the Taliban and she was just like OK yeah if you want to do that fine which is an odd thing to say\nBut there have been a few speeches that have been discovered audio and video of speeches that she gave not back\nTwo thousand and one or two thousand two when she was in that era a law student\nInvolved with the Green Party involved with anarchists in communist she was really in the left wing far left wing mill you when she was younger but this is years later like a decade later\nShe was a state senator or she became a congresswoman she was an adult who was in some ways trying to burnish at least for the consumption of voters this more moderate unifying healer type image\nBecause that's what she felt like she needed to do in a state like Arizona well occasionally though she would go out of state and give speeches\nToo liberal and left wing audiences and it turns out that she had had quite a habit of dumping on her state\nSo she would leave the state of Arizona to go talk to\nLiberal activists and she would attack and mark the citizens of her own state and now she's trying to run statewide to be a U.S senator she wants to represent the entire state of Arizona and these old clips from a couple of years ago at this point but not too long ago\nShe was in public life at this point you as an adult or she is apparently letting us know exactly how she feels about Arizona and the people of Arizona and it is not terribly flattery\nAlso I think it was the Washington Post the ... of the New York times did a whole story on her where she's gone around during her campaign talking about how she grew up homeless and\nSome specific claims about her homelessness that apparently are not true and they found records to prove that they are not true so she sort of definitely grew up in difficult circumstances but she has exaggerated\nAnd sort of enhanced the difficulty of our upbringing which seems gratuitous I mean she she has an interesting life story to tell but she's fabricated certain elements of it [noise]\nI guess for political gain she wants to have a more compelling story\nIn any case I Want to play you some of these audio soundbites that are now being released\nThe Republicans it seems like had been sitting on these for a while and now we're in mid October so it's time to drop the bomb shells in addition to that crazy Taliban exchange where she said she said\nOn on camera were on a in a recording that she was totally fine I think it was a radio interview if a guy wanted to go join the Taliban to fight the U.S that's his business fine\nBut I Wonder if some independence and even some Democrats and those Republicans that she's hoping to pull off in the French I Wonder if those people will appreciate her calling them the equivalent of crazy methods\nAnd sabotaging the state that she wants to represent in Washington [noise]\nI mean in a in a normal cycle I think she'd be cooked I think she'd be done but this is an unusual cycle so if you're out there in Arizona I mean Martha McSally put everything on the line for this country she fought the terrorists\nTo my knowledge he's never said anything this insulting about the people of Arizona so very clear choice\nAnd the GOP would be nuts\nNot to exploit these self inflicted wounds and make sure every single voter is aware of what curiously cinema thinks of them exactly what she thinks of them because she said it herself and her own words not good will see All right that more ...\nBe a

of\nCathy's with us on the car coward show Hi\nCathy Clark how's it going it's going well how are you doing\nWonderful thank you which is very important that we're both doing well when you want to ask me about long term care insurance right\nExactly so what's your scoop\nWell I'm I Am sixty five my fiance is sixty seven we're both retired and we're getting married in la congratulations\nThank you and we had a meeting last its financial planners to get help plenty for our financial need to during our retirement and to um [noise]\nWell looking at it doesn't pay any state planning tax planning and that sort of thing and we want to make sure that you know either one of us at the net income in the end of our death and we don't want to be tried families and so while\nI'm On what are they for if you're not going to be a burden on your family in fact\nYou write down a line that way you know we didn't get laughs [noise] you know the issue of long term care and insurance and it it's really expensive um\nAnd so we were just wondering if he might have any suggestions or and\nThis is this a real problem because generally you have a segment of the population that doesn't need long term care and that's people who have a very large number of assets generally north of three million dollars okay\nAnd then people who don't need long term care because they got nothing they don't own a home you know they're renters they have a very little money saved they've got no investments so there's this group of people in the middle that don't have millions of dollars in assets\nAnd to have some things like maybe owning a home and other accounts they don't want to be impoverished by long term care and you mentioned not a burden on the family so if you're in that middle section and would you say that you and your fiance you're in that middle\nI Would say that we're in that middle you you do have to\nThink through what in the world are you going to do if one of you ended up meeting assistance with what's known as life's daily activities needed long term care needed a assisted living for nurses skilled nursing home what do you do and [noise]\nThe market offers am perfect answers into the long term care insurance will generally pay for a three to five year period depending on what you buy\nIt will have an inflation adjustment to deal with medical cost inflation over the years the premiums are not guaranteed they can go up\nAnd even initially you're looking at several thousand dollars a year aren't you yeah\nSo it is one of those things there is no good answer\nOr their strategies people do where they go see an elder law attorney and title assets in a way that the assets are not at risk it's considered to be a um a a strategy that some people don't like the ethics of others are happy with\nOr you um you buy the long term care insurance\nOkay and I read on line and out an option uh regarding in ... in community care it I get the idea that it's basically investing in\nYou know community care facility where\nThe the life stages ones yeah you go in and independent living\nAnd then as your needs change you move from place to place but they they don't provide the care for free I mean you go into a state a facility that deals with the stages of aging you're still gonna have to pay\nFor the care right so it doesn't relieve the the cost burden so if you if the two of you want to make sure\nThat you're not a burden to each other and you're not a burden to your kids and you're both healthy now as much as it hurts to write a several thousand dollar check a year I Believe it or not I recommend it\nOkay\nBut I Want you to get a five year benefit if you can afford it and a decent inflation adjustment which would usually be minimum three percent per year\nCovering inflation over the years 'cause a benefit to you today it's sixty five\nLet's say you wouldn't need any kind of assistance to your eighty five right if you don't if you don't have inflation adjustment of benefit that looks good today will be useless Twenty years now but I Do have one other alternative\nOkay going back to age eighty five you can buy something known as longevity insurance is anybody mentioned is not at all\nGenerally nobody mentions it because the commissions on it or not very good okay so you can buy a policy that only pays a benefit if you make it to age eighty five\nAnd then at age eighty five it pays a very generous monthly benefit for the rest of your life\nAnd so it's money you can live on in the event you need any kind of long term care is therefore you die before age eighty five poof it goes up in smoke okay but it's a very affordable way for you to find much later in life\nWhen the odds would be higher but you would need care\nAnd so I'm like the longevity policies as an alternative you'll have to look around on your own you probably want to look for a fee only financial planner\nBecause commission oriented sales people won't want to talk to you about it\nAngel is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Angela\nArielle\nGood thank you you want to make sure that your kid knows how to handle a huge amount of money some day is that right [laughter] I

shaving at an early age\nAnd he said if certain amount each year and by the time they were in the early twenties they could come in there for the kid I'm a refresh my memory is so\nWell actually I'm going to burst your bubble they can contribute what I talked about is that they if a young kid starting at age Fifteen starts cutting aside two thousand dollars each year they can do that until they're in their early twenties\nAnd never put in another penny and by old age there'll be a millionaire\nOkay we'll call\nWell I Can't you can't aside money for a nine year old a little bit each year and then by early twenties that child's a millionaire that's not going to happen but the idea is that if you start saving beyond that ultimately it makes later in life much easier\nSo there are financial he thought he\nYeah I like I like are you if it's if it's for a nine year old putting money in a regular investment account to go in something really simple like an index fund where your own

save more and spend less and don't let anyone ever rip you off and we have a problem\nNot just in the United states is a worldwide problem but I most focused on how we're going to address in the United states and that is our food supplies come from everywhere\nThere's something out given ... example when I'm Talking to a school group something like that\nAs a way to really get their attention I say you know it was really easy when I was a kid not to have to eat vegetables all the time or eat fruit all the time because we only had fruit and vegetables when it was in season\nNow and they got really interested in that now because we live in a worldwide food market\nIt seems that things are in season all the time that whatever fruit or vegetable you want is pretty much available twelve months a year but that food chain we now have has come with the addict complexity vet people can get sick\nThe source of the illness hard to track\nAnd keeping people safe has become so much more difficult so we'll have these outbreaks of of foodborne illness\nAnd you can have fatalities you can have illnesses they can go on for a significant period of time before the CDC or whoever else is a sleuth on the case can track down the source and shut it off\nYou'll hear from time to time happened with lettuce or spinach or whatever well\nThe nation's largest grocer Walmart\nIt will have a new system fully implemented in less than a year where with any food item sold in the store there will be full\nFarm to store tracking real time so if there's ever anything identified as a potential source of illness it will be able to be tracked down a whole lot quicker\nAnd the recall will happen a whole lot faster and the danger to people will be greatly reduced we cannot make a food supply a hundred percent safe\nBut what Wal Mart is doing is great and any number of large players\nIn the food industry\nBoth manufacturers because it can also be I mean people get sick from things other than produce you know give me actual um\nCanned food or a processed food that can make people sick as well\nAnd so food manufacturers are part of this process also and John who is part of our Clark dot com

to go to target or any other store without a spinning out a lot of money [noise]\nUh but well it was really interesting and this was Sunday I thought you know shrimp cocktail would be good to have to have with the football games in the afternoon\nA picked up this bag of shrimp that was on sale took it up and as the associates skin shrimp or there was an abnormal sound or you know not the normal lip ah so I looked at the screen on the associate with looking at and it said a do not sell this item\nOr an it printed out a little ticket it said attached to the bag of shrimp and column and injure
