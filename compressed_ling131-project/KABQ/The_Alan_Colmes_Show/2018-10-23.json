uh\nEnjoy your show house have I'm a big fan but um I just wanted to talk a little bit about um the voter fraud voter election fraud Russia yeah lectured lectured fraud and in Minnesota we have a pretty good I'm pretty good system um everything is on paper\nAnd um\nSo it's paper ballots and we don't really have a problem at the polls as much because you can set up a lot of polling stations for each um optical scanner right so it runs pretty officially and then a wheel\nYou're not you're not a ... if you have a lot of people show up you can go from ten polling stations to thirty polling stations in in thirty seconds simply by passing out more papers whereas if you're voting machines you're limited to the number of voting machines which is\nThat was the little game when I Lived in Atlanta that was a little game that they played a down there was the end up in the poor and black areas not only to get the older machines but they got very few machines so you'd end up with you know five hour along the lines whereas in the white suburbs where I Lived there would be ... you know ten twelve machines and\nFifteen people on line I mean it was just a you know and nobody in line functionally um after you bill\nYeah um and another thing we have here is you know just to to combat the whole purge problem as we'd have same day registration so if somebody moves and they need to register at the last minute or something you know to foreign sort of idea and um they're registered\nYeah yeah so um that's a great thing\nI mean you know what's a combination of the two um nobody can hurt you yeah\nThat that is marvelous bill we should do that in every state in the\nOil and one other thing that they do just to make sure that the optical scanners are working because of course that's a machine\nBut you know the people have to fill up the ballot the the machine doesn't fill up the ballot for you right so um you know other people fill out the ballot and then they do random audits at a different polling stations all across the state\nAnd find out is there any discrepancies between the final cow out that they they call in\nAnd uh the actual number in the scanner yeah that'll make an identifier problem very quickly and then they can drill down on it\nThat's all good election integrity stuff Bill thanks so that adds up out of that\nOr what would be of the problem was passing a law I'm nationwide where all national races have to have a system similar to ours\n[noise] the the problem would be that the constitution gives the power to regulate elections to the states\nAnd uh to a large extent and so you can pass federal standards\nYou can pass federal guarantees essentially and and usually tied to money is with the help America vote act that it was tied to a six billion dollar appropriation\nTo give to the states to by voting machines you know back you know when when that happened in two thousand two under the Bush administration let's let's have every every state in the in the country start using electronic voting machines from from our good Republican companies um but I I don't think that the federal government has the power to do that right now\nUm but if we if we were to amend the constitution and grant a federal right to vote or if we had a progressive Supreme Court and they simply you know knowledge the right to vote I think all that would change Bill thanks for the call it's great to hear from you or skip and Asheville Massachusetts they skip what's up\nWith the first hour was getting a little upset about how many votes are being stolen and um I was thinking of voting might not be enough\nWith all the last votes yeah and um so I mean we always talked about revolution would be when the poor and the rich difference became really great and it seems like it's pretty big now and is it time now [laughter] [noise]\nWell I think I think you're watching a political revolution which is what brain always very carefully use that phrase or a a shooting revolution or a secession kind of revolution would be extremely counterproductive right and I had to get\nMore like money boycott because they take the money we give them and fight us\nYeah accept that you know most of the products that for example Koch Industries are the Koch brothers on don't have the word coke anywhere on them you'd have to walk around with a giant shopping

all that stuff has them but I and yeah there's got to be away just by caught and you know well you know a\nYeah except it's just the the the ... typically boycotts don't work and and the reason why is because people have to live and they've got to spend money and they're not they don't spend that much time you know being\nFocused on was that rather than putting all of our efforts into an economic boycott I think we need to be putting all of our efforts into voting registration drives\nAnd get out the vote activities and when you get a bunch of Democrats like passing laws that that will undo all his voter suppression skip thanks for the call I mean it isn't it you know when does the revolution come as a war of the political revolution is a good conversations have been question what's

say it's an arena that she's Eighteen thousand people and apparently they had one hundred thousand RSP peas\nAnd they had to turn away eighty thousand people\nTo this rally according to the Trump Twitter it'll be like triple that that they had to turn away and regardless of the heck of a lot of it and I do think it's interesting that Trump's going to the promise to go to Texas for tat I'm not necessarily sure they need to go there although there are some borderline house districts\nSome of this was about will hurt or extract yes and actually I think we'll heard my being slightly better shape than some of the rhetoric districts in some of the suburbs of the major cities Houston Dallas so the goal I think of this Trump visit\nThe president's visit to Texas and I just to keep momentum

was a new poll out that came out yesterday NBC Wall Street Journal poll that's really interesting read has some very good potential information for Republicans and of course some red flags as well for the geo pay\nPresident Trump's job approval rating is now at forty seven percent among registered voters that his his highest he's ever registered\nTrump in this polling series at forty seven percent among likely voters is at forty five but a lot of Republican strategist I've been talking to for months I've been saying give Trump can get into the mid forties\nThat as sort of what they were hoping and now our Fox News poll last week had him at forty seven some people call that an outlier now NBC Wall Street Journal has a ... at forty seven as well\nThe Democratic party lost a net nine points favorability so they're now neck and neck with the geo pay Republicans leading on the economy by Fifteen points the largest margin in the polls history\nAlso leading on trade Democrats by similarly

were debating the two candidates at\nA synagogue in the district and the Democrat got frustrated there was a question about pre existing conditions he's been running an ad against the Republicans on preexisting conditions the Washington Post rated the ad falls and when he was cornered on the point he ended up dropping an F bomb\nA that is relatively light sledding compared to some of the other things that happened over the weekend I'm shocked there and no ... I mean well I mean they're FCC guy any day now that ... that um that I've yet dropping a bomb in his sanctuaries hopefully not by\nNow and I know oh my gosh now\nSo Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi\nBoth had run ins with angry hecklers over the weekend McConnell was eating dinner with his wife and Kentucky below sea was entering a political event in Florida let's play first cut aid the pillow see audio\nThese were anti communist demonstrators there's some back story to this where I think one of the Democratic campaigns in that state made a strategic error\nThat does not justify what you're about to hear from what must be called a mob outside that event going after Nancy Pelosi and the bleep button was used a lot here\nVery Nancy Pelosi right here\nRight here [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nSo that video made the rounds and\nFortunately and correctly a lot of conservatives condemned to Dana Los ... Dana laughed rather from the n._r._a. bench Shapiro my favorite too he was from Steve ... so we had on the show just last week talking about these issues\nHe retweeted the video and he said I don't agree with Nancy Pelosi's agenda but this is absolutely the wrong way to express those disagreements if you want to stop her policies don't threaten her vote\nThat how we settle our differences which is exactly right\nMeanwhile in Kentucky McConnell Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine Chao is the transportation secretary they were out\nAt a Cuban restaurant of all places in Louisville and little though Louisville right that so that they make it almost like ... like almost one syllable um and there were some\nLeft to use who saw him there four of them and they started\nOnly for Kentucky\nAnd they sort of heckling McConnell or someone whipped out their phone at that point there was only one agitator left who was yelling at McConnell to get out so according to TMZ who got the video\nOr they were yelling at McConnell the one guy went up to McConnell's table slammed his fist down on the table took his left over food off the table and threw it out the door of the restaurant and then told McConnell to get out and get out of the country listen to cut five [laughter]\n[noise] so\nThe thing that I don't think that this heckler anticipated was\nElaine showers jawbone and back at him and she does that she's done this before she is I I Would not take on only show she I mean I I really wouldn't McConnell sat there very quietly with his hands full ... hours like you know arguing back at the guy but there were a bunch of other diners at this restaurant\nWho turned on this guy and started saying leave him alone get out of here and then the heckler started saying oh you do you try to do this and he's trying to do that McConnell and someone says no one cares\nAnd there were women if you watch the video I have a post on at a town hall dot com if you want to see the video they these women at the table are showing this guy out of the restaurant to leave 'em and eventually he did leave and the kind of went around and ... people's hands thanking them for sort of sticking up for him

spending some time with the tech companies that here in Silicon valley today we went out to Facebook and Twitter later in the way he will be a Twitter later in the week and we got a peek at Facebook's new war room and its headquarters in Menlo Park\n... has specialist all co located together working to detect and disrupt bad\nActors who are attempting to de legitimize elections spread information or suppress the vote there obviously very focused on the midterms guy but they're also for example tracking what's happening in Brazil who also has an election coming up right now\nWe should remember Facebook is truly a global company let's take a listen and cut forty three to one of their officials talking about the purpose of this new around\nThis is Facebook's more room for the upcoming midterm election and it's actually the combination of two years of hard work we put in ensuring that our platform is safe and secure place for election so it builds on massive investments that we've made both people and technology to do things like\nCombat fake account to fight the spread of fake news and then also to bring unprecedented transparency to political advertising and now as we enter the final days before the election we've convened this war room with experts from across the company to be able to detect and respond in real time to any sort of\nLate breaking threat that we may see on the platform\nSo guy um and a much bigger fan of Facebook and Twitter as you know although I'm happy that we're in conversation with them that I had to correct some of the things I think have kept me off of the platform and maybe some other people at Wyoming Twitter yet\nUm but I I actually you know if all this leisure left Facebook use it a lot I use it to communicate with friends from home particularly\nUm and they've had a lot of criticism over what happened in twenty sixteen over some of the false information over stories that looked real and weren't fake accounts and this war room it's just the latest in a line of effort they've really been undertaking that we talked about today to try and make this site a little more responsible\nYeah and I was also talking to them about the imbalance the ideological imbalance\nAt big tech companies because you know look I never been out there before it is a very cool compound they have this amazing rooftop garden that we saw a from from the ground up\nThey their whole workspaces like this futuristic Mayes with all sorts of art all over the place and I would gain at least Fifteen pounds if I weren't there have delicious free food everywhere and not just like snack stations but the Gillette Sheree lunch like you can go to these restaurants it was\nNo is when it is a different kind of company we in the east coast ...\nTotally different and you could just sort of look around and it's like okay this is exactly what you would sort of imagine from a Silicon Valley style TV show on HBO like this is what you would you would envision Facebook looking like\nAnd it's cool and it's different and it's interesting a lot of it's you know cutting edge stuff\nThere is the component of human biases and you know the fact that this is out in a very liberal state and a very liberal part of a very liberal state with the type of people that they hire I think a lot of conservatives are concerned that not just Facebook but Google and Twitter and others\nAre extremely powerful corporations that are populated overwhelmingly by people who are hostile to the world view that we have and that was one of the issues that I raise\nIn our neighbors and and they do have some people that they've hired who are right leaning a I Would also point out that recently they've\nUndertaking a fact check amalgamation or like a coalition of fact checking including a few right leaning sites that have been\nVerified as reliable in their ... yeah so I think it's something that they are aware of their certainly attuned to the criticism and I think they're trying to\nCombat it or mitigate some of those concerns\nYeah and I think I think um there are we need to be careful there Claire examples of bias and there are places where I think Sam on the right claim biased because it helps them politically and maybe it was just big tech\nNot doing their job right you're doing something that they shouldn't have done had nothing to do with political bias and so I think both sides need to be careful about that\nUm I also think there are a lot of people who are libertarian out here or maybe don't fall exactly in that one political party it's just an interesting collection if he was and and I think they look at putting a lot of attention to that issue an election year she is\nUm and really paying attention to the criticism when Mark

I mean I thought it was a beautiful performance that was stirring and of\nCourse it's every word of the national anthem it just didn't sound like the anthem to me so I watched it and I'm like I Wonder if I'm going to if he's going to eventually morph into the actual tune of the song\nWhen he was singing it\nDid you you heard the tune I didn't at all I thought it was awesome I can live with his voice\nNow I I didn't but it went everywhere and people loved it and set for you know I liked it I liked it a lot I just ... if a song singing the same lyrics to a different song\nReally alters the song but he was the lyrics and he sort of native Hawaiian either which I also like right okay\nSo what's your point no I just I just don't like it you're going to open this guy\nFor I Am not doing any parade ... I'm doing no such thing I thought it was lovely so did I I just had to say we should do like a Facebook poll or something on our Facebook page about whether or not it was the tune and does that matter\nBut I ... I Know when he's saying it with his voice at what he didn't change the notes that he was thinking I don't think of the anthem yeah I thought the music on the ukulele was\nA little different oh a definite right so I think I when I heard it just now it sounded like\nI keep I keep listening for the actual tune I don't think it really matters and by the way God Bless this guy recovering from

tend to regroup but you know I had tickets to the state Michigan Michigan is heating up I don't want to talk about that they are okay actually it'll get folks out here at Stanford Everytime I see that and I feel like we\nWalking into the hotel earlier and at the exact moment there was a guy sitting by the pool we're walking past the pool and I saw the Michigan logo on his shirt and the second I saw the Michigan Murray saw at the same moment apparently because she just let out this discussion\nIt's we saw a non ... yellow color if this on the rainbow okay we're going to go to politics that let me give\nThe schedule there so much happening right now two weeks off in the primary every day there are rallies their debate so we're going to start off the shows by telling you what's going on tonight President Trump holding a campaign rally in Houston, Texas\nFormer President Obama holding a campaign rally in Las Vegas Nevada both of those competitive Senate races are both current president former president hitting the campaign trail former vice president Joe Biden attending a campaign rally in Florida with the Democratic Senator Bill Nelson\nAnd the gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum they'll be in Jacksonville\nBoth of whom are leading in recent polls by the way\nBoth of whom are leading recent polls Donald Trump junior will hold a campaign rally for West Virginia in West Virginia\nFor the Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey ah let's see what else is going on today CNN had their citizen by CNN forum Jared Kushner spoke Nancy Pelosi spoke Jeff Flake spoke and some others\nOther debates happening New York nineteenth congressional district that's why a race a lot of people are watching as well this is just tonight this is one day on the campaign trail we are going to monitor these events will bring you some of them either alive or like you know tomorrow it happens all hands on deck on both sides now\nGuy we might dip into that Texas rally there were legal resident lined up yesterday\n... like a day in advance not immediate family members of Ted Cruz and there are people know the reality is he real human\nThousands of people say it's an arena that she's Eighteen thousand people and apparently they had one hundred thousand RSVP use and they have to turn away eighty thousand people to this\nRally according to the Trump Twitter it'll be like triple that that they had to turn away and regardless of heck of a lot of it and I do think it's\nInteresting that Trump's going to the promise to go to Texas for tat I'm not necessarily sure they need to go there although there are some borderline house districts\nSome of this is about will hurt or extract yes that and actually I think we'll heard my being slightly better shape than some of the rhetoric districts in some of the suburbs of the major cities Houston Dallas so the goal I think of this Trump visit\nThe president's visit to Texas and I just to keep momentum going in terms of Republican enthusiasm and turnout turnout and I just want to play destructive position as entertaining to me in cup three we're going to listen to some of\nPresident Trump and candidate Trump's commentary on Ted Cruz from the campaign in two thousand sixteen and then a revised update to the nickname that we will play for you but let's listen twenty sixteen Trump on cruise\nThat's a matter of hours and then I'll just learned you probably are worse the gym\nYou know I call him lying to cover the cost down the Bible and the new eyes I've never seen a man alive as much as I call them lying to his ... and you know that's his name\nIn the case of lying ...\nSo what about why and Ted Mr President you're going down to campaign for him here's what Trump said today before he ventured off to Texas He's updated the nickname cut to\n[noise]\n[noise]\nHe's beautiful to sew beautiful so Texas um and so true like\nIf the word beautiful music I described Ted Cruz even if you like him\nSorry you'd beautiful is probably what do you what you can just see trying to think what am I saying what do I say here he then he landed on Texas ... which is just literally the state so better and then I\nI actually liked his new nickname for bait or war which is overrated O'Rourke little double o anyway he'll be down there to not like a child from I\nI you know it's fun to do roar but it's not\nBut I I apparently it work of all the things like well I Know there is a right of all the things not that's not too bad top fifty\nSo there's a new poll out that came out yesterday NBC Wall Street Journal poll that's really interesting read has some very good potential information for Republicans and of course some red flags as well for the geo pay\nPresident Trump's job approval rating is now at forty seven percent among registered voters that his his highest Hughes ever registered\nTrump in this polling series at forty seven percent among likely voters is at forty five but a lot of Republican strategist I've been talking to for months I've been saying give Trump can get into the ... for to use\nThat as sort of what they were hoping and now our Fox News poll last week had him at forty seven some people call that an outlier now NBC Wall Street Journal has a ... at forty seven as well\nThe Democratic party lost the net nine points are favorability so they're now neck and neck with a GOP Republicans leading on the economy by Fifteen points the largest margin in the polls history\nAlso leading on trade Democrats by similarly huge margin are up on healthcare which voters are saying is the most important issue although the economy's right the right to close neck and neck so you're also seeing ... ... men\nAre siding with Republicans now by fourteen points women still have a massive gender gap siding with them with Democrats right and so and last but not least\nOr siding with Democrats by low double digits that to me is a a concern for Republican Republicans however\nThis is from the NBC right up the poll shows Republicans have restored a fourteen percentage point lead in districts they already control up from just two points in August [noise]\nShifts may have narrowed the range of potential Democratic House pickups\nAnd the same light up if I can find it here said that the Democratic advantage in the swing districts has vanished in this new NBC Wall Street Journal poll so both sides have some can highlight\nThat is true I Will say the swing district numbers are bit of an aberration and that's NBC poll because the generic ballot I you know some of the data coming out when they break the generic ballot out\n... the national generic ballot right which doesn't mean a whole lot when we when we talk about Democrats are up nine points or whatever and the generic ballot that's nationwide survey right that's not how people voted mid term they vote either district by district or state by state right when you've broken out the generic ballot on swing districts\nUm Democrats have had you know especially ones where there are moderate Democrats winning they had the huge advantage there there's a bigger advantage for them and for the really progressive Democrats running in their district although not in this particular point in all the other polling so this one right now is a bit of an outlier we'll see if this holds but\nYou know guy I think there is\nLook I Will speak for myself here as someone who was convinced I knew had twenty sixteen was going to turn out I was very wrong\nAnd so I think there's a lot of us who still see the Pauline we know the numbers we know the districts we know that historical issue with terms and we still are gun shy because we\nTwenty sixteen to so many of us even if you like Trump break it felt like oh the rules change everything changed we none of us knew how to predict anymore\nAnd expecting something and then the opposite happening can be like a scoring\n... of and so I think there's still some hesitancy and and there's the argument I Will say and I know we have to take a break but there are some Democrats I talked to who say things like\nYou know it would feel really did take back the house but if we want to win and twenty twenty it may be better for us not to and so Republicans are completely in charge but not by much and that and\nDisaster if the Democrats are when the house after two years of Trump\nI I I agree with you but there are some Democrats who are starting to pilot each day and it sounds like ... I actually don't I don't think it is and I know we have to break but let me just finish and very quickly I actually don't think it is I think they're like\nIf we lose now to win later and yet they play it when you think about it which I Am not criminal it's plausible but if you're confident you're going to when you're not those argue and if you're trying to empower all these new voters shut that their vote matters do maybe don't you might be helping Trump like that's all that's a mixed message I mean it could be true\nPossible interesting possible are we have to break there's a lot more to get you from that poll other races and Senate races more mob action on both sides are over the weekend that will tell you about that's all straight ahead Benson and\nYou can watch game marine for listening anywhere from ... in ...

taught that there is solidly democratic which is crazy to think about 'em after twenty sixteen but that is that an interesting geographical piece of the puzzle here and the bottom line is we may not

lovers is Danny was let's take a trip back to this week in rock and roll history\nThis weekend Nineteen Seventy five all Simon issues has forced solo album still crazy after all these years gone it lasted fifty ways to leave your lover and the title track all reached the U.S top forty and the album hit number one\nSimon's first album to do so emancipated from Simon and Garfunkel then finally

Eighteenth casual\nStyle promoting for review your sample ballot and pregnant with me with a guy you must be registered to vote on all wrong\nOn my phone in your home your sample ballot provide that information\nFrom Montgomery County board of elections ...\nWas released later in Nineteen eighty seven this week in Nineteen Ninety three time magazine push any better on the cover with the headline all the rage book veteran Kurt Cobain repeat to speak with the magazine for the story but they rented anyway in an attempt to explain why young people are listening to such angry music\nAnd this week in two thousand three in the middle of their world tour and flush with fame from their debut album ever in essence founder Ben ... abruptly quit the band\n\nAnd\n\nWe continue on Benson harbor live from Palo Alto California the Hoover Institution at Stanford thanks for listening we are Fifteen days away from the mid term elections and things are getting\nCheated sometimes overheated out there there was a debate in Pennsylvania in a congressional race a contested close race where the incumbent Republican is vulnerable and they were debating the two candidates at\nA synagogue in the district and the Democrat got frustrated there was a question about pre existing condition who's been running an ad against the Republicans on preexisting conditions the Washington Post rated the ad falls\nAnd when he was caught it on the point he ended up dropping an F bomb\nA that is relatively\nLight sledding compared to some of the other things that happened over the weekend I'm shocked there have been no bomb them that's in the dark I mean well I mean they're FCC guy any day now that I'm kidding that um that I've you know dropping a bomb in his sanctuaries ugly\nNon night by you know and I know oh my gosh now\nSo Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi\nBoth had run ins with angry hecklers over the weekend McConnell was eating dinner with his wife and Kentucky polo she was entering a political event in Florida let's play first cut a polo seat audio\nThese were anti communist demonstrators there's some back story to this where I think one of the Democratic campaigns in that state made a strategic error\nThat does not justify what you were about to hear from what must be called a mob\nOutside that event going after Nancy Pelosi and the bleep button was used a lot here\nBecause it right here\nRight here\n\nIn town\n\nSo that video made the rounds and\nFortunately incorrectly a lot of conservatives condemned to de Los ... dinner last rather from the n._r._a. bench Shapiro my favorite ... he was from Steve squeeze so we had on the show just last week talking about these issues\nHe retweeted the video and he said I don't agree with Nancy Pelosi's agenda but this is absolutely the wrong way to express those disagreements if you want to stop her policies don't threaten her vote\nThat how we settle our differences for does exactly right [noise]\nMeanwhile in Kentucky McConnell Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine chose the transportation secretary they were out\nAt a Cuban restaurant of all places in Louisville and will the ... right that they make it almost like little the boy almost one syllable and there were some\nLeft to use who saw him there four of them and they started the only for Kentucky and they started heckling McConnell or someone whipped out their phone at that point there was only one agitator left who was yelling at McConnell to get out so according to TMZ who got the video [noise]\nAh they were yelling at McConnell the one guy went up to McConnell's table slammed his fist down on the table took his left over food off the table and threw it out the door of the restaurant and then told McConnell to get out and get out of the country listen to cut five [laughter]\n[noise] so\nThe thing that I don't think that this heckler\nAnticipated was Elaine showers job owning back at him and she does that she's done this before she was like\nI Would not take on a ... show she I mean I I really wouldn't\nKnow cuddle up they're very quietly with his hands full with Elaine Chao is like you know arguing back at the guy but there were a bunch of other diners at this restaurant\nWho turned on this guy and started saying leave him alone get out of here\nAnd then the heckler started saying oh you see is trying to do this and you try to do that McConnell and someone says no one cares and there were women if you watch the video I have a post on at a town hall dot com if you want to see the video\nThey these women at the table are showing this guy out of the restaurant to leave 'em and eventually he did leave and what kind of went around and show people's hands thanking them for sort of sticking up for him [noise]\nAgain I understand the tensions are running high I on on both sides and if look if you if you live in Florida and you're a Cuban\nAmerican who escaped the Castro regime and the campaign Donald soils campaign was bringing in a relatively pro Castro not Pelosi but Barbara levy who said positive things in the past there were a lot of very angry Cuban dissidents [noise]", "show_name": "The Alan Colmes Show", "year": "2018",
