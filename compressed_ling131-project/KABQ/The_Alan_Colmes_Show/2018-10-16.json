working with this president to keep this great economy growing so that everybody can have better opportunities\nCongress man I I Want to ask you about a different demographic I I Do think the one you mentioned is very interesting but I Want to ask you about women in polls including an ABC Washington Post poll that just came out of the weekend the Republican Party is twenty four points underwater with women\nWho are likely to be voting a registered voters and likely to be voting this fall and three and three weeks some polls have them down as much as thirty points and in a lot of those swing districts as you know\nThese women whether it's health care costs or President Trump's rhetoric\nThey're not really happy right now how concerned are you about that and and what are you doing to address that that demographic\nWho clearly you need to look closely at those polling numbers but if you dig deeper and she's pulling it a lot of these swing districts that show some of those numbers but then when you dig deeper uh those same women that might be moving away and the initial question they really liked the tax cuts or they don't like Obamacare\nThey don't like seeing double digit increases in their healthcare costs or they\nDon't like the idea of abolishing ice or they want border security they want they want to national security and frankly if you look at the polling we the Republican Party\nFare much stronger in the head to head on the economy and on national security with those very same women than the Democrats and the PLO seat\nAgenda was moving us backward so it's it's the ultimately it's the results of the things that we stand for four versus what they stand form of polo see that it's not your traditional Democrats uh it's it's just socialist movement really where liberals and then what ... are getting beat by socialist\nA that's not where this country is so we're a center right nation and with the polling will show you on a lot of those issues ah there was lost in a big fight right now in this farm bill and the big fight is over whether or not people\nAre as they're trying to get welfare benefits if there's a job out there and you're able bodied should you have to work rather than getting taxpayer funded benefits\nThat's like an eighty twenty issue especially a with a with working working moms that understand why should we be paying taxpayer benefits to somebody who's fully capable of working when there's a job out there waiting for\nThe Democrats say they should be able to still keep getting those welfare benefits instead of having to work\n[noise] hunters and I just want to jump in here and then I'm that go back to a guy that could push you a little bit on how you describe the Democratic candidate you are very right that in many districts they're running\nVery liberal candidate for Senate him talk about abolishing nice you're absolutely correct about that but in the swing districts in the mid west across the plains states in parts of the south\nI think the Democratic party has actually been smart and running very moderate candidates many of whom will not say they will not support Nancy Pelosi cell when you're talking about some of these districts is there a chance that maybe the Republican Party underestimating the fact that Democrats have found some moderate folks out there to run into these districts\nWell I'll say they did a real good job of recruiting but the thing is like anybody even if you didn't have a voting record because it's a closely work real hard to recruit a lot of people that have no voting records but then all of a sudden you dig deeper and you find out like in the case of Andy On it or out in Lexington, Kentucky\nAh here's here's somebody who is his name as a as a moderate like you're describing yet she went to Boston, Massachusetts aware Elizabeth Warren hosted a fundraiser for\nThe first of all this image in your mind Elizabeth Warren is no lottery machine in a fundraiser for you in Massachusetts maybe you're not so conservative well she said things in that fund raiser making fun of the people of Kentucky\nAnd now she's having to confront that back in Kentucky you saw that same thing with Kirsten cinnamon Arizona where\nYou know now she's there's video of her ... going to Texas making fun of the people of Arizona we saw it and keep officers district I was in Pennsylvania just last week with Keith ... office and the only race in the country or to combat you're running against each other and in a very tough district\nBut you have Conor Lamb who ran and got elected last year as that exactly as you're describing pro life pro gun anti policy Democrat\nWell lo and behold on so many key votes\nConor Lamb voted with Nancy Pelosi so he's not so conservative and they just look at a contrast vote the right to try bill something President Trump really help Marshall through Congress here's a bill that Keith Rothfus co sponsor and it allows somebody if you're terminally ill\nIf you want to be able to try an experimental that's not fully approved by the FDA but if you think it gives you a chance to save your life and you're terminally ill terminally ill shouldn't have a right to try that truck Keith Rothfus helped get that passed Conor Lamb voted no\nThere's a clear contrast so people are seeing now in the closing weeks here's where you really find out the details of what people stand for it's one thing to say you're conservative and you're against policy and then all of a sudden you find out they're not so conservative and they're not so inside policy as you're getting closer to the election\nSteve ... is our guest in one of the monitors I'm starting to see among some on line conservatives is they're trying to frame the last three weeks of this campaign has jobs versus mobs\nAnd I'm Wondering you wrote an op ed for us here in Fox News of of course we all remember the the horrible incident last year on a baseball field where you were shot and thank God survived\nA you've written this piece warning about the rhetoric and some of the ratcheting up of intense partisan rhetoric and trying to get some of your democratic friends to cool it a little bit on that front and I wonder if you think is\nI agree I I was not happy with what I saw from Hillary Clinton I was not happy with when I saw from Eric Holder of course what we saw from Maxine Waters we also get some pretty heated rhetoric from the president for example and I think the left sometimes tries to punish collectively conservatives for rhetoric\nAnd I'm Wondering how you're trying to draw that distinction and walk the line of trying to lower the temperature across the board\n[noise] well the difference is you know go fight for the things that you believe and express your views you know go out there and when the argument as Margaret Thatcher said and then you're when the vote\nBut it seems like on the Democratic side more and more you're seeing them losing the arguments so they literally just drop trying to encourage almost bowling threatening harassing and even violence against people that disagree with them are you seeing it with some of President Trump's\nCabinet secretaries where they're literally encouraging people to go and run 'em out of restaurants or you know that's not what America's about that's the difference here don't go after people personally\nAnd what you saw it last week there was a Republican candidate for governor in Pennsylvania who made some comments about a chicken or the governor with his spikes on and you know I came out against that\nAnd then he recanted and kind of backed away from his comments you're not seeing Democrat leaders come out against this kind of rhetoric on the left and it's frankly it's people on the left that have been a that going to the next level and actually committing acts of violence and there's no place for that in our society that's where you need to draw the line\nYeah physical intimidation versus political disagreement\nBut of course congressman you would disagree if either side of the aisle perpetrating than that I mean obviously we saw in Charlottesville someone was killed by a white supremacist at a protest and as someone on the last I myself have been screened adding yelled at I had many elected officials as well so\nYou know I I think we should just sort of decry it no matter where it happens and and down how we need a car on the rhetoric\nDown stick with the substance of the issues we disagree with somebody you know whether it's\nThe government itself for some elected official adjust your neighbor you ought to be able to have that conversation about what to you and your neighbor disagree or your your spouse disagree\nOr you don't you don't threaten them personally you don't throw things at um you know you express your difference and hopefully then you move on and maybe you your when I'm over that's what they should be about ... to try to win people over and you don't do that by threatening them personally\nYeah house majority whip congressmen Steve's Gleason Louisiana G.

Q. talk dot com the ice is sticking\n\nMS cofounder died on that we have friends who covers reports going Saudi Arabia may be ready to admit I'm missing reporter was killed while in front of diplomatic facility in Turkey or cross the teeny records\nUm I also think it's interesting that Donald Trump is now basically gotten Brock Obama to release his birth certificate and Elizabeth Warren to take a DNA test which he said\nAt a campaign rally if she did and it showed she with India and what he said he would give a million dollars to charity for choice there she's calling his boss today asking for the money be donated to an indigenous woman's organization India\nSo let me this is the thing I don't think we should be in the business of educating like what percentage is enough to be considered something right and so I think our country has a has a really bad history with that issue when it comes to African Americans but like for example my ancestors six or ten generations ago\nI claim them I'm a daughter of the American revolution because of them even though that six or you know more than that generations back and I clean that heritage\nAnd that heritage is important to me and so I guess my my thoughts on this is when she interviewed these people on tells a story about her parents and about the challenges their families had when they got married because one of them was rumored to have this Native American heritage\nThat story is very compelling and I guess it's sort of offensive to me that people think they can adjudicate what heritage is acceptable or or authentic\nAnd what isn't and and from sort of a baseline and then we can talk about some of the other issues but but you sort of flippant Lee said but she's not she's not what percentage would you say she was\nJust not up to me it's up to the actual Native Americans who are put out a number of statements to the Cherokee Nation and some of them have put out positive statement the Cherokee Nation which is one that she claimed to be a part of\nCalled this inappropriate and wrong and so Jim nay testing undermining tribal interest with her continued claims of tribal heritage which she does not house she is not a Cherokee she claimed to be a Cherokee and to address\nThat in the video she said I understand I'm not a part of a tribe moral she says this in the video today and the news but how did she she argued against her story on how she deals with all of us to talk about her story today yes I Would like to very much so she they found in her ancestry\nOne okay sixty fourth to one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American use ... definition of Mexican Colombian and Peruvian so well what\nPercentage would have been enough for you not that okay but they're not even close to that well how do we are we in the business of adjudicating percentages which makes them want heritage authentic\nShow ... I think on some level yes so I I Want to be uncomfortable with yet I'm deeply uncover what was it before and has done here the New York times had a really interesting piece about genetics and the science of genetics and the average white American\nViews point one nine percent of African and point one eight percent Native American using Elizabeth Warren's definition\nI could claim to be African or I could claim to be Native American and if the DNA that we can talk about it and I go out actually love to death\nI just think if I were to claim based on a fraction of one percent\nPossible heritage from like ten generations ago that I was African and applied to things and presented my so let's\nGet to those African Americans get to that would have been great split ... ... if you watch the video it is clearly part of her family's folklore so so here's my which which is not nothing that's her family that's fine we only have your family ... mind as our ... unimportant\nOr an authentic that clearly is authentic that her family you know again I Believe\nIs not truth so for example there's really a DNA shows that she\nShe she does have an ancestor who was Native American well\nShe has potentially an ancestor ten generations ... very strong evidence I mean the water and moving in one one thousand and twenty fourth and the definition of Native American include Mexicans and Peruvians I can be and is there like a person that you feel comfortable putting oneself and are you comfortable with that I\nYes I Am absolutely when I saw this I was like oh you took\nIf you took a DNA test and it came back that like the average white person in America according to the sciences report in the New York times but your point one nine percent African you would feel comfortable if you Murray harp presented herself as an African American\nNo I wouldn't present myself in American why not if someone said what's your heritage might my comparison was actually\nWould you call yourself a minority a racial minority no of course I went in it that's what she did that's problem is I don't know I Want to be on there I Believe me at one point there are people in the video who are directly contradicting what the point you're making it up and and they are and you don't like any of them you don't agree they're all lying well I think some of them maybe\nI Need I witnessed says any corroborate you had he had no but you believe that\nYou and now you're calling me a conspiracy theorist on I'll be us not lie you have any evidence that that's why she was hired can be you can show me your well can you right now the fact that both of those I'm you you keep interrupting when I Try to spell out very well what do you see evidence I Know that you won't believe anything that she is telling you I\nI don't think she did this right now\nWhy you would never accept this from a Republican yes I agree absolutely in one of the Republicans said and claimed like hardly rather than they were Native American\nSo of course he's the only benefit from us program for minorities based on to get an ancestry LA Times story from the weekend that his brother got more than a million dollars and no big contract at US military institution based on a dubious claim that\nNative American I mean that sounds bad that sounds like me that sounds like lives war and to me if you have any evidence that is why she was hired\nI have evidence that she was not a Native American claimed to be for nine years those nine years happened to be when she got hired into the ivy league and then even higher number of other Institute yeah but not I wouldn't either rising I don't doubt that family folklore was a factor I don't doubt that she was a good professor\nShe is trying to pretend like we are stupid I and

and we're going to go to the phone lines because they are lighting up people have lots of thoughts on that\nThere is a question about timing guy and why she decided to do this right now there are a lot of people and again can remind people I'm not like a fan of Elizabeth Warren this isn't about me defending someone I think she'd be president\nSo just for folks out there who think I just defined Democrats I have a lot of issues that a lot of stuff yet but on that the timing guy a lot of Democrats unhappy that twenty three days before mid term where there isn't\nA lot of democratic momentum focused on you know a moderate candidates in swing districts but also on the midterms not on twenty twenty not on someone to visit like Elizabeth Warren they're kind of pet sitter performer Boston line Jim Messina who ran President Obama's twenty twelve campaign\nWas like oh my God why did you do this today you're taking all the oxygen away so and I I actually sort of agree with that I I don't like the timing\nI think that and here's the tell I think Warren who's not a dumb lady she's pretty smart cookie she knows that this is not a good luck for her and sort of an embarrassment for her so she wants to rip off the band data literally as soon as possible I think she's\n... actually I don't think so I think she likes this I think she\nIf she thinks this has been occasion that is hilarious but I don't think that's the case my thing is she knows this is a problem for her identity politics is a huge thing on the left stealing someone else's privilege and heritage is not a good luck for her she's had a lot of people hammering her for it so I think\nShe wants by the time the twenty twenty campaign really gets going next year yeah she wants this to be old news so she's putting it out now I didn't I didn't really notice in the video that she put out\nA constant theme of it was her and her spin versus Trump and the ... and she she attacked Fox News to her tweet she is ironically appealing to tribalism by\nBasically signaling to democratic voters either you buy my shy no a sandwich on this or you're starting with Trump and Fox News ... ... can I I Want to read\nJust quickly and then we're going to the phone lines two paragraphs in the Boston Globe story\nQuote in the most exhaustive review undertaken of Elizabeth Warren's professional history the glass globe found clear evidence and documenting interviews\nThat her claim to Native American ethnicity was never considered by the Harvard law faculty which voted resenting lead to higher or by those who hired her to four propositions that other law schools at every step of her remarkable ride and the legal profession the people responsible for hiring her saw her as a white woman\nThe globe exam and hundreds of documents many of them never before available reached out to all fifty two of the law professors who are still living and were eligible to be in that room at Harvard law school when she was being considered to be hired\nSummer warrant allies others are not\nThirty one agreed to talk to the globe including the law professor who was the time in charge of recruiting minority faculty most said they were unaware of her clients Native American heritage and all but one of the thirty one said those claims were not discussed as part of for higher\nOne professor told the globe this other one that he is unsure but he is certain that if it did come up and had no bearing on his vote on warns appointment\nOn his vote somebody and she made these decisions or dead I automatically\nYou can't discount\nWe may not like that she did it we may not approve of the fact\nThat she did it and you may think the timing is suspect in it as I told you in the break if you come to me with evidence circumstantial\nEvidence plays really strong but but the people get convicted on circumstantial obscene glow undertook an exhaustive review they tried to talk to everyone that they could examine but lately it listen they examine hundreds of documents spoke to thirty one of the fifty two professors\nFound zero evidence that played a role if you bring me evidence I told you I Will examine it and and and he's taken into account but we have to be guided by the fact that so far there's no evidence that why Harvard hired\nHer the circumstantial evidence is extremely powerful there's no hard evidence yet\nBut there's also circumstantial evidence that you don't want to address that you're you're not grappling with what I what I'm saying why that those look sort of you're making a time in case you think the timing can't be coincident until I make one more point and I say okay hey but not only that but let me make one more point on it shows you that good\nShe was listening resolve is white for her whole life changes in Nineteen eighty six immediately gets hired the ivy league which was having a diversity hiring crisis\nThey also having a female hiring hounded as a racial minority by both schools which she claimed she didn't know about and then has changed her story on that point\nThat's I think a very important piece of evidence and then when she was hired because I'm not then she got tenure at Harvard law school the pinnacle of her career and stopped listening herself as a Native American and when she was asked why that's very suspicious timing\nGo to fire adapted or\nAnd

ones either first\nSo first off I'm a hockey fan and the devils have started this season three which is very exciting including wins over to the best teams in the league Washington six to nothing then come back when they get nothing six to nothing over there I said yeah and then come back in San jose the sharks on Sunday\nBut this was about college football\nAs most Saturdays and the fall are ... and it was north western's homecoming and we do not play well often at home which is usually you people do see other way around like I was not even fully joking with my friends that we should decline home games and like we should just play twelve games\nUh and my perform better but we were playing oh in five Nebraska\nWith their new coach Scott for Austin late at Nebraska\nIn Nebraska and there's all this hype about when did you get in his first win Nebraska football's never started oh and sex and the broadcast the ABC broadcasts was all about Scott Frost and turning the corner and a milestone first when at his alma mater on the program and yada yada yada\nAnd we were down North West was down to Nebraska twenty age of fourteen and the fourth quarter and then what about four minutes left we were down thirty one to Twenty one mhm kicked a field goal made a defensive stop\nNebraska punish the ball to our one yard line\nWe have the ball at our one yard line ... with two minutes to go and no time outs and we drove the longest drive in northwestern football history and Ninety nine yards for the tying touchdown\nWhich over time did you think they should go for ... you know I was playing for the title okay at quote unquote home 'cause it would have Nebraska fans and it was homecoming at least for us so you know\nThe fans who were there and purple were excited\nI was furious throughout almost the entire second half because we're not going well team was playing poorly and then they just sort of the second half hasn't been your ... it has not but they put on this Superman Cape basically came back and then in overtime with the weird college system which is different from the NFL system\nThey picked off the rest of the quarterback on fourth down they were going for it on fourth down interceptions we get the ball and our walk on backup sophomore kicker kicked a game winning field goal they walk off field goal\nAnd I was very pleased so we're now three and three and we go to Rutgers next week and God help us if we lose to Rutgers 'cause that team is a\nGiant dumpster fire up well\nThey shouldn't be in the Big Ten but that's a whole other story I mean we might we might agree that that's great that's wonderful you've had a couple of good games back to bat\nAnd by the way I was telling Christina mhm our producer here in DC 'cause she went to Maryland and they had homecoming this weekend she had a fun Maryland weekend and she's like oh we're playing Rutgers I said oh you'll win and she was a little skeptical unlike believe me leave main against Rutgers and they won by thirty points\nI'm terrible um yeah what else lives next that I Know you should knock on wood three in one in the conference ... great conference history has to be interesting Michigan State and beating Penn State yeah not enough number Asia they lost their anything because they lost to us but I think the so now I think northwestern in Michigan State have all be in them\nAnd say through Penn State's some trouble oh yeah I mean they're not that I'm terribly just noted report that piece of new and\nGeorgia and number two guy trounce crushed by LSU when my best friend is a Georgia fan and she was I Know none too I Know they really got the badly though um and because of that my Ohio State buckeyes won against Minnesota moved up to number two in the polls\nNow I I think the Arabs right that's a deserved move I agree I think that um the Buckeye we have some work to do before things get real with Michigan with probably ten championship game Michigan look good\nOver Wisconsin yeah ah and I yes I think they did they weren't home they play well at home right um so I think that's number two we are offensive line\nWas not great we you know we we are still missing both sides or do we know we're missing a key defensive player so I think it'll be interesting\nTo why the one I'm surprised that you missed the opportunity to brag on LSU quarterback well who led them to that went over to Georgia 'cause that's in Ohio State\nGuy here he transferred from Ohio State because we have two very very good quarterback including Twain Haskins who is on pace to break every quarter back record at the Ohio State university's already broken a couple\nUm put show borough the LSU quarterback is amazing and I at one point I turned to my dad and they said can we get him back like I Would like that so I think LSU is really good\nAh the final score that Minnesota game uh uh I think we won by sixteen\nAnd he was comfortable but not like lower ... fourteen yeah no it was not a blowout blowout at all and we have to lock it up you know we have a ... week this week which gives me a little room to breed\nUm but yeah the big can it's you know a number of people off yesterday big schools said the playoff race is is getting very interesting very interesting\nOkay so uh we'll stop and I say on watching the patch win last night which ... like I hate that pat and I like the

there to help us defy gravity or then we will hold the house and if they don't show up that's when Nancy Pelosi could become speaker\nBut knowing what's at stake knowing what polls you do that only hurts the tax cuts all but the older you economical it's a move to a peach crop and try to abolish ice\nIce I mean there there are times it's clear and our attendance clear to we want to keep work with this president to keep this great economy growing so that everybody can have better opportunities\nCongress man I I Want to ask you about a different demographic I I Do think the one you mentioned is very interesting but I Want to ask you about winning in polls including an ABC Washington Post poll that just came out of the weekend the Republican Party is twenty four points underwater with women\nWho are likely to be voting I registered voters and likely to be voting this fall and three and three weeks samples have them down as much as thirty points and then a lot of those swing districts as you know\nThese women whether it's health care costs were President Trump's rhetoric um they're not really happy right now how concerned are you about that and and what are you doing to address that that demographic\nQuote clearly you need to look closely at those polling numbers but if you dig deeper and she's pulling it a lot of these swing districts that show some of those numbers but then when you dig deeper\nAh those same women that might be moving away and the initial question they really liked the tax cuts or they don't like Obamacare they don't like seeing double digit increases in their health care cost a they\nDon't like the idea of abolishing ice or they want border security they want they want to national security then frankly if you look at the polling\nWe the Republican Party fare much stronger in the head to head on the economy and on national security with those very same women than the Democrats and the PLO seat\nAgenda we're moving backwards so it's it's the ultimately it's the results of the things that we stand for four versus what they stand for ... well it's not your traditional Democrats uh it's it's just socialist movement really world liberals in timers are getting beat by socialist\nBut that's not where this country is so we're a center right nation and with the polling will show you on a lot of those issues\nAh there was lost in a big fight right now in this farm bill and the big fight is over whether or not people\nAre as they're trying to get welfare benefits if there's a job out there and you're able bodied should you have to work rather than getting taxpayer funded benefits\nThat's like an eighty twenty issue especially a with a with working working moms to understand why should we be paying taxpayer benefits to somebody who's fully capable of working when there's a job out there waiting for\nThe Democrats say they should be able to still keep getting those welfare benefits instead of having to work\n[laughter] hunters and I just want to jump in here and then I'm going to go back to a guy but could push you a little bit on how you describe the Democratic candidates you are very right that in many districts they're running\nVery liberal candidate for some of whom ... she nice you're absolutely correct about that but in the swing districts in the mid west across the plains states in parts of the south\nI think the Democratic party has actually been smart in running very moderate candidates many of whom will not say they will not support Nancy Pelosi cell when you're talking about some of these districts is there a chance that maybe the Republican Party underestimating the fact that Democrats have found some moderate folks out there to run into them and these airstrikes\nWell I'll say they did a real good job of recruiting but the thing is like anybody even if you didn't have a voting record ... work real hard to to recruit a lot of people that have no voting records but then all of a sudden you dig deeper and you find out like in the case of Andy On it or out in Lexington, Kentucky\nAh here's here's somebody who sees them as a as a moderate like you're describing yet she went to Boston, Massachusetts where a lizard with Warren hosted a fundraiser for the first of all this image in your mind\nElizabeth Warren is no laughter is hosting a fundraiser for you in Massachusetts maybe you're not so conservative well she said things in that fund raiser making fun of the people of Kentucky\nAnd now she's having to confront that back in Kentucky you saw that same thing with Kirsten cinnamon Arizona where\nYou know now she's there's video of her ... going to Texas making fun of the people of Arizona we saw it and keep officers district I was in Pennsylvania just last week with Keith ... office and the only race in the country or two incumbents are running against each other and in a very tough district\nOr but you have Conor Lamb who ran and got elected last year as that exactly as you're describing pro life pro gun anti ... Democrat\nWell lo and behold on so many key votes\nConor Lamb voted with Nancy Pelosi so he's not so conservative and they just looked at a contrast vote the right to try bill something President Trump really help Marshall through Congress here's a bill that Keith Rothfus co sponsor and it allows somebody if you're terminally ill\nIf you want to be able to try an experimental that's not fully approved by the FDA but if you think it gives you a chance to save your life and you're terminally ill terminally ill shouldn't have a right to try that truck Keith Rothfus helped get that passed Conor Lamb voted no\nThere's a clear contrast so people are seeing now in the closing weeks here's where you really find out the details of what people stand for it's one thing to say you're conservative and you're against policy and then all of a sudden you find out they're not so conservative and they're not so inside policy as you're getting closer to the election\nSteve ... is our guest in one of the monitors I'm starting to see among some on line conservatives is they're trying to frame the last three weeks of this campaign has jobs versus mobs\nAnd I'm Wondering you wrote an op ed for us here in Fox News of of course we all remember the the horrible incident last year on a baseball field where you were shot and thank God survived\nA you've written this piece warning about the rhetoric and some of the ratcheting up of intense partisan rhetoric and trying to get some of your democratic friends to cool it a little bit on that front\nAnd I wonder if you think is\nI agree I was not happy with what I saw from Hillary Clinton I was not happy when I saw from Eric Holder of course what we saw from Maxine Waters we also get some pretty heated rhetoric from the president for example and I think the left sometimes tries to punish collectively conservatives for rhetoric\nAnd I'm Wondering how you're trying to draw that distinction and walk the line of trying to lower the temperature across the board\n[noise] well the difference is you know go fight for the things that you believe and express your views you know go out there and when the argument as Margaret Thatcher said and then you're when the vote\nBut it seems like on the Democrat side more and more you're seeing them losing the argument so they literally just trying to encourage almost bullying threatening harassing\nAnd even violence against people that disagree with them or you seen it with some of President Trump's cabinet secretaries where they're literally encouraging people to go and run 'em out of restaurants or you know that's not what America's about that's the difference here don't go after people personally\nAnd what you saw what last week there was a Republican candidate for governor in Pennsylvania who made some comments without a chicken or the governor with his spikes on and you know I came out against that\nAnd then he recanted and kind of backed away from his comments you're not seeing Democrat leaders come out against this kind of rhetoric\nThe left and it's frankly it's people on the left that have been a that going to the next level and actually committing acts of violence and there's no place for that in our society that's where you need to draw the line\nPhysical intimidation versus political disagreement\nOf course congressman you would disagree if either side of the aisle perpetrate it's not that I mean obviously we saw in Charlottesville someone was killed by a white supremacist at a protest and as someone on the last I myself have been screened adding yelled at I had many elected officials as well so\nYou know I I think we should just sort of do cry it no matter where it happens and and\nAll that when you got all the rhetoric down\nStick with the substance of the issue you disagree with somebody you know whether\nThe government itself or ... elected official adjust your neighbor you ought to be able to have that conversation but what you and your neighbor disagree or you're in your spouse disagree or you don't you don't threaten them personally you don't throw things at um you\nKnow the rest of the difference and hopefully then you move on and maybe you wind up that's what this should be about trying to win people over ... you don't do that by threatening them personally\nYeah house majority whip congressmen Steve ...

Christine write that down yeah that'd be a good call topic one area maybe for a friday or something post election anyway here in Studio with us as Josh cross our who's the politics editor at National Journal\nAnd one of our go to experts on all things midterms Josh great to see you agree to be on the show by the way if you are near uh television\nJosh and I are on special report\nRight now or about to be so through the dark arts of radio you can DVR\nRep air show and listen to this interview and then go watch us after ... over on the TV ... let's talk about the house first because there's a few data points out today\nThat are interesting to me so if I'm a conservative in a Republican and I'm looking for good news which you are all three of the right I'm looking at the Washington Post ABC poll that has Democrats with this big lead among registered voters nationally but in the most important toss up district Republicans are up one\nOn the generic ballot\nThen I see a New York times poll has a Republican challenger up Fifteen points in Minnesota that would be a pickup for the Republicans Democrats pulling out of a double digit Hillary one district in California\nI Know there's plenty of bad news on the house side as well but there's some cross currents here that are puzzling is there a common theme that you can spot here\nThere are demographic cross currents when it comes to the battle for the house so I'm looking at polling the national polling even that talks of polling you're talking about is it the most useful data because what we're seeing in the battle for the house is a suburban districts many of them held by Republicans\nAre swinging toward the Democrats I was just in Overland Park Kansas right near Kansas City\nAnd really well like moderate Republican congressmen by the name of Kevin Yoder\nIs is in the fight for his political wife and it's not because his Democratic challengers us early the best candidate that Democrats have but it's because he's in a affluent suburban district where a lot of voters just don't like President Trump and they want to check the Republican Party\nNow that Minnesota district that you're that you're talking about him in in upstate\nEither rural blue collar district that Democrats have held for for some time and demographically speaking if the exact opposite of of suburban Kansas City\nAnd in those districts you look at the Senate map there are a lot of other races in states that have\nA lot of small town rural population\nAnd those are the races where Republicans have I've gotten some momentum as the basis coming home as they're getting a little more excited about the mid term elections\nBut when you look at the house I mean the reason the houses so vulnerable for Republicans is that a disproportionate share of those tossup races are in the suburban district is there a long time Republican seats\nOf all of a sudden gotten a lot more democratic because of President Trump and because of this the national law does taste like\n... or ... stock in a Roskam and\nSome of those totally like Comstock Orange County all these races in orange County California line on everyone out to LA or on Wednesday so I'm going to get a chance to see how are those campaigns are going\nUp you know even within New Jersey wine I did the turnpike I did the turnpike or a few months ago and you know might be Sheryl who's running in a sort of a swing northern New Jersey district really just talented recruit a military veteran who's who's up in the polls pretty big\nBut even like like I'm Mike Coffman suburban Denver\nHe's someone who's beaten some of the toughest opponents that Democrats have thrown at him it's a swing district but he's he speaks like two different the three languages he speaks Spanish on themselves Spanish taught himself that's right he taught himself Spanish is a ... you know he really has gone above and beyond what most Republicans would do to win over new voters in his district\nAnd he's won some of the toughest campaigns that anyone else has on the Republican side\nHe's losing to to uh Jason Crow first time democratic candidate fan that's how big the suburban way is on the Democratic side\nAnd Josh a lotta people are talking about this being the air them on there and are record numbers of women running a couple of him I I'm really excited about either on my list of the tenets that really care about an election night\nUm but we also had interesting numbers in his ABC last Derek she's me Washington Post poll about when and there's always been this gender gap we've talked about this before but in the new poll registered", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Alan Colmes Show", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "16"}
