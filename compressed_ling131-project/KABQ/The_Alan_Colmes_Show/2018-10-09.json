back\nJournalist I'm only a princess hundreds of people gathered in upstate New York Monday evening to memorialize the victims of liberal crash that killed Eighteen passengers and to pedestrians over the weekend meanwhile the investigation continues or ... let's focus\nSo Rod Rosenstein flew on air force one with the President's Day down to a speech in Florida looks like he has a job for at least the next twenty nine days\nWho has this longer I've you know very good relationship yeah but he said that about everyone else they fire to this week on the ... he has not said that about Jeff Sessions\nRod Rosenstein is safe he's not going home this week on the season and The Apprentice let's see if anyone does maybe everyone will get to stay on the island you've got immunity he got immunity um I think that's a very interesting the question to me it's still what happens after the terms I think we\nPretty much agree that Jeff Sessions and probably gone after them in terms of whether Rod Rosenstein also will be voted off the island is a question\nWe know the answer to this is interesting because there's all this hype about this meeting they were supposed to have and then they didn't and then he came on the plane with them today and nothing happened and nothing happened nothing at all or the other thing about that like a collective sigh Mm yeah\nI mean it's just but this was to me maybe a bit of a\nFake news drama where you had conflicting allegations of the seriousness of what Rosenstein had said that he really suggests he was going to wiretap the president or wear a wire to capture the president and try to be kidding right than try to oust him using the\nUse of the twenty Fifth Amendment for the un fitness the twenty fourth man whichever the amendment is\n... and a lot of people in the room or say no that was clear sarcasm in a row bottled Andrew McCabe I guess Rosenstein was able to convince the president like Mr President this was not a serious comment whatsoever\nAnd hysterical guy it was a joke about your and fitness [laughter] it was a complete joke about removing from office eating the confrontation ha ha ha but I think I actually was I was\nLike wanting to do more\nI we have no idea I\nI don't I have no idea what is going on with any of this um\nBut it was just so bizarre that Rod Rosenstein flies on the plane today goes to the speech with them and then the president mentioned it at the beginning of his speech she said Rod Rosenstein with us today\nPeople thought I was going to fire and but what you mentioned is actually interesting because the day that this whole ... car fluff will happen\nWhen there is reporting that Rosenstein was going to the White House either to resign or expecting to get fired I was on a flight to New York it's like thirty seven minute flight I remember that day in between the time I took off and turn my phone off in the time I landed Rod Rosenstein with either fired offering to resign or at a normal meeting at the White House\nAnd it turned out to be during number three it was ...\nIt's a meeting yeah nothing happened so the other question that can Gratz on keeping your job well I'm sure he's pleased with me that wasn't sarcasm that was my serious but I Do enjoy the president also\nJust addresses controversies like here's this guy into at a big event and he's just like\nPeople thought I was going to fire this guy like it's just out there by people who are going to have a constitutional crisis but he's here with me and he's coming home with me I mean an\nExtremely tremendous relationship with rod always have\nA new he met three days ago so true um well and a lot of Bob Woodward's book fear is well I read the book I think a lot of it is very believable and plausible and and the one of the things he talks about something that was part of the time when it rains previous got fired\nThey had he had been on the flight with Trump is it just related because it's just so Trump than the controversy he'd been in the ... an air force one with him he now that the president he said I think it's time for me to move on\nAnd they said okay we'll work on crafting a statement over the weekend we won't announce anything tonight literally Ryan's previous walk down the stairs he gets an alert that the president has just tweeted that John Kelly will be there she has\nThe rights previous gets out of his death than gets into a car it's like\nHe just doesn't care now is the protocols up a foreign concept in some ways I\nI just that previous story can you imagine say okay we'll do a statement over the weekend and by the way it was the twenties with them and I wanted to fact check myself that flavor fact checking our mayor I didn't get it wrong so no so Rod Rosenstein was not fired over Twitter today\nOr at a rally but yeah but not over and over but one thing we you know that President Trump doesn't like to fire people in person he's very uncomfortable with it so when we heard he was going on the plane with him like he wasn't going to get fired\nOh definitely a fireman the point where he stuck at thirty thousand feet\nI also think that because we're a month away roughly from the mid ... nine days people were not going to get a Mohler conclusion Bauer the oh no no no we are not right so the question is will like is more we're going to drop this thing in the lame duck or is he gonna [noise]\nI I don't know we've got at least thirty days before we see anything out of Mahler is my guess because he does not want to draw any here on a bomb on now in either direction frankly right before the ...\nThat's right no no I think I think actually once we had September it was pretty clearly we're not going to get\nAnything from other also the question about whether President Trump will sit down with Muller is still unanswered there's been no conclusion not even an initial conclusion right not even a they shouldn't just say no we want and then if Mueller wants to take him to court\nTo subpoena him will go through that process like but right but that's the thing there's a process here we're not even we're not even at the first T themes like on on the president sitting down with Mueller question\nMeanwhile and where's your Giuliani that and if I met said where she'd been for the past few weeks you know what I'm sort of fine I Am with all of that's occurred to me I haven't\nCabinets been Kavanaugh that's true that's been the last few episodes of the season had been Kavanaugh has been ... and so some of the other storylines have been sort of taken a backseat but you know they'll be back there recurring came of our favorite characters will be back on another very important political development\nTaylor Swift God the pop star lesser has come out publicly for the first time really in waded into politics she is endorsing some Democrats in her adoptive home state of Tennessee it's causing a firestorm\nFire storms straw that was\nA genuine question because I'm not on Twitter it's hard for me to gauge how these things are ...\nYes I Would say on social media there is a fair amount of discussion about Taylor Swift doing this or would people cheering her jeering her I'm going to give the phone number out here a three three four five six Thirteen hundred eight three three four five six Thirteen hundred\nDo you care at all\nAbout celebrity endorsements of political candidates and keep in mind this has to go in both directions right so I feel like a lifetime\nYeah you've got to be okay with\nTaylor why a lot of people on the right we're like whoa looking Kanye West make America great again hat this is amazing the culture this all matter this is huge and then oh who cares about Taylor Swift who cares about a whole parade of celebrities who generally indoors Democrats [noise]\nI'm Wondering if beyond the people who shout each other on Twitter twenty four seven does anyone care that Taylor Swift has endorsed Democrats and will it affect\nEither your vote or your fandom or lack there right of terrorists were actually here in Tennessee was a three three four five six Thirteen hundred\nWhy don't we

people are very well educated voters vote should count just as much as mine does but not people that\nWhen you start engaging them in politics they don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about so [noise]\n... yeah I mean I get I get that mark but like under informed voters I mean that's what democracy entails we have a lot of people who are under informed voters and you know Taylor Swift herself maybe one of them but it's a matter of fact she can do what you\nWant to stay in her in her Instagram post she said please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represent your values and even though guy doesn't agree with it she outlined the reasons she's not voting for Marsha Blackburn talks about a couple of votes she's taking in Congress\nSo I see I mean compared to a lot of celebrities she actually did our homework she doesn't come down in a place you would come down guy but she said people need to go out and and then she

we're\nBack on Benson and ... a three three four five six Thirteen hundred we see a number of you want to talk about Taylor Swift\nWe'll get back perhaps to that topic yes after the second we want to briefly focus on the mid term elections and maybe we can talk about Tennessee with our next gas Josh cross our who is\nThe political editor or politics editor at National Journal his column is against the grain does really really good work you can follow him on Twitter I Believe it's at Josh across our do I have that right Josh ... hotline dash\nIt's actually ... hotline Josh and all the way I wanted I wanted to talk about Taylor Swift you because you know we were waiting for her to get involved in politics might turn out that she well very very close Senate race so there you go\nJade okay Josh do you think she's going to have an ... seriously have an impact in Tennessee I've been arguing that I think she might because she hasn't traditionally been involved in politics she had the massive fan base\nSo here here's a I don't think so I mean celebrities usually don't have a whole lot of impact on on the rational campaign but there's one thing that she sort of reflects in this midterm environment which is that a lot of a political sort of a moderate voters are\nComing out in and expressing their political allegiances and that tendency raises a really interesting is still Britain is one of the few Democrats that's striking a very sort of set of centrist independent minded town in the in the in the campaign that she was one of the two two Democrats who said he was going to vote for a he was in the Senate vote for\nA judge Kavanaugh so you know it's interesting that that it spread isn't that Taylor Swift decided to come out of the political closet and who's going to support because he is really one of the rare is it is kind of a rare breed one of these moderate Democrats who is not\nReally telling a lot of the national guard\nAnd could have been a situation Josh where it's like you know break glass for emergency when the brightest in campaign to like we've got Taylor we need to use her\nFamily may have been coordinated\nThe last couple polls have looked much better for Marsha Blackburn the Republican race are Fox News poll has her up five and a CBS poll over the weekend has arrived eight where it feels like the fundamentals in Tennessee might be swinging\nTo the favor of the you know on the Republican in a state that's pretty pro Trump Josh\nYeah so I I I Do agree with guy I I Do agree with that point which is Brett is in sort of on this artificial high for much of a campaign he's a very popular governor he's running on his accomplishments that he achieved in in a decade of of public service but\nNow that the race has gotten more partisan now that there are a lot of ads on on the air trying to make this a more Republican versus Democrat race those very very high favorable ratings that British and had are starting to go back to earth\nStill very good but not quite as good as they work you weeks ago so as a veteran Republican tribal identity asserts itself as Marsha Blackburn starts to rally Republicans to her side I think she's got a little more running room to take the lead and and you know guide you mentioned the Fox news polls showing her about five points at don't get me a very close race there's a lot of democratic money's still\nAren't into Tennessee even though some outside groups were or Priorities USA made a threat that they were not going to spend any money and never were planning to send money in Tennessee because of reticence position on Kavanaugh\nBut you know Tennessee in it it's a very Trump he said it's a very conservative state to probably get the push that raised to one side give Blackburn a slight advantage\nAll right so let's handicap this Morris Josh or on the Senate side of things because of the virtue or by virtue of the map\nThat we're looking at that you know the the one third of the stuff that happens to be up in twenty Eighteen is extremely favorable for the Republican Party plus the white hot political controversy focused on the U.S Senate with now justice cabin on his confirmation process it does kind of look like things are heading in different directions where\nA as opposed to two weeks ago the Republicans may be in better shape in the Senate than they already were but I'm not necessarily sure that's leading over into the house so why don't you tackle the Senate first and then Marie can ask about the house because she's going to like that answer better and have a lot of it I'm ready I'm ready for that blew away [laughter]\nSo the Senate I mean the reality is there there there's a blue wave in the house and they may be even be a red wave and the Senate and it's really misleading to look at the national numbers when you're trying to look at that Senate map because of the biggest battle grounds are by and large taking place in some of the most conservative states in the country\nAnd the reason Mitch McConnell's been so happy over the weekend in addition to get it Kevin ... is she seeing some of that ad intensity especially in these conservative states\nSo you know the only a few weeks ago showed a you know Republicans\nBy and large disengaged and a lot of people didn't even know Brett Kavanaugh was before this controversy hit and there are a lot of them that didn't even feel like showing up at the polls for the midterms and since the capital really ... you know energize the a lot of conservatives you're now seen every

with guy Benson and we are joined now by our friend in front of the program break him senior political analyst here at Fox News channel fresh off at a special report with Brett there tonight and Brett we start which\nSomething that actually feels a little bit refreshing to be talking about um on Brett Kavanaugh now justice Kavanaugh not the politics not what's happened over the past few weeks but\nWhat kind of justice he will be now on the court his judicial philosophy obviously people and I say the aisle don't uh are enamored with it I should say and people on the other side certainly were you saw that during the confirmation but say a few words about now that he's on the court what that might look like\nWell he's a Jew judicial conservative\nWhich is really quite different from being a political conservatives to overlap in some areas but a judicial conservatives a judge\nWho is hesitant to overturn precedent except when they're telling me clear\nAlso hesitant to create major new president's much of the time for example on an issue like roe versus Wade you heard him say repeatedly during the hearings that he regarded did not only is president but because of the second case would affirmed it it was president upon president that is a signal that that while they might come a time for example in the presence of new facts\nAre about the process of abortion and about you know the viability of fetuses or whatever that he might that he might be willing to overturn it under the current circumstances I think you would be very hesitant to do that\nAt the same time however if a case comes along where some members of the court wanted to find and find in the constitution and had dinner fly in and try and in law a new right it's not specifically provided for in the constitution orange statutes I think you'd be hesitant to do that\nWhen I was listening to senator Collins give her speech announcing ultimately that she was going to vote for his confirmation\nShe said at one point in the talk that he's really not at all out of the mainstream Judy Italy and she cited a statistic that in Ninety three percent of cases where they both ruled he and Merrick Garland ruled the same way and part of me was actually\nA little concerned by that statistic I was like hang on now are what are those seven percent\nRight after he got to remember a guy that when cases come to an appellate court\nThey're not always the toughest cases it's the ... it's a really tough ones that get to the Supreme Court\nAnd it's not surprising that appellate judges agree much of the time I think you'd probably find that when you I suppose you could find to judge has so far apart and never agree but I don't\nI don't I don't sense that in in in the in the U.S district court of appeals here in the district of Columbia a lot of cases the law seems to judge to be fairly clear it a lot of times the laws that are in question the legal issues that are being argued aren't don't really have to do with liberal versus conservative they're simply matters of law\nWhich don't cut particularly the direction that as a result of that is you get a lot of agreement for people who judicial he may be liberals\nAnd conservatives are great but what do you make of this theory that I've heard I'm not sure I buy it but the nastiness and contentiousness of his confirmation process may have radicalized that might be the wrong word but\nMade an indelible mark on his psyche that now where he may have gone to the court as sort of a John Roberts type consensus builder he now sees\nAn element of the political spectrum as a hub deeply hostile to him and so he's not he doesn't care anymore did you buy that at all I think\nYou can argue that flood or you can argue it around and but I mean he could go on the court and decided I'm going to get those guys right who came after me I'm there they will get no sympathy for me the other way I look at it as he may ... some might say that he would want to show them that he can be fair even on issues of vital concern to them so I my view is that he will be the same kind of judge\nOn the Supreme Court that he's been on the appellate court in the striking thing to me about Susan Collins is speeches how much time she devoted\nTo discussing his actual record as a judge that was what was totally missing from all of this discussion about his temperament is how did he actually behave on the court on the bench how do they treat the parties that came before him was he courteous was he did erupt them was a brutal to the movie courteous what\nAnd there's no evidence of a lack of proper judicial a temperament and his role as a judge\nFor twelve years I also think it showed that she was maybe not quite as undecided if people thought that speech was not written that morning at ... while research show is Sherry lane they decided that was that he or she seemed to say that I\nI agree I agree with I think she was very eager to vote for him that she she had met with him more than most senators did\nShe ate examined his record former closer than most senators did and I think she was poised to vote for him but I think she was troubled by the allegations yeah and the interesting question is being rude about now in this in this town is whether her view\nAttention business owners and independent contractors this was a money saving message

P. five opponent mhm northwestern had been shut out in the second half so we were up ugly fourteen to six at half time like oh here we go again\nMichigan State comes out in the scores the first two

because the fourth quarter happened during the mass got a plan that her and so there was a a few whispers occasionally of updates in a few knowing glasses and nods\nAnd then the high fighting we saved
