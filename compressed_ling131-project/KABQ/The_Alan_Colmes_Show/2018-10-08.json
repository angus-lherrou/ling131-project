room for aspirational politics today and he buried genuinely said I don't know oh and that uh to me is one of the most\nTelling thing to know if we're beating it out of people like that even when I

me talk about this story that that really bothers me ... ... an hour to get to the core of all this\nAre these echo chambers in these filter bubble that we create for ourselves where we live in communities surrounded by people who think unsettled like we do we go to work or school surrounded by people who think can sound like we do in our social media feeds her populated by people who think and so like we do and\n... and we get our news from media outlets that reinforce what we already believed to the point where we weren't we're isolating ourselves both consciously in subconsciously by the decisions we make from other perspectives and so when we do hear another perspective\nWe immediately invalidate it and then this happens everywhere this happens across the political spectrum here the number of my friends in the Democratic party who still can't understand why Donald Trump won because they'd never met a Trump supporter\nAnd the number of a Trump supporters out there who cannot believe why anyone would vote for Hillary 'cause they'd never met a Hillary supporter right we're we're isolating ourselves in ways that I think is incredibly dangerous and not just in politics\nAnd and I should point out you're a Fox News contributor as well you and I are both Democrats you consciously made a decision to come to a network with a lot of conservative opinion focus and have that dialogue we have about a minute and a half left but it's it's easy to be really negative\nHow how are you handling the negativity how are you talking about it with your family and your friends like

[noise]\nGuy Bentsen in New York Murray harp in DC and joining us now is how we Kurtz host of Fox News channels media buzz Sundays at eleven AM author of the book media madness you can find him on Twitter at Howard Kurtz how great to have you back yard\nSo I Want to start with just a big picture question for you all the media coverage that you have been following very closely especially over the last week involving the Kavanaugh controversy what's your assessment of an\nOverall\nI think in the early stages of those in attempt by many in the media to be fair uh particularly well we had the dramatic hearing Christie for judge Kavanaugh uh but I think in the last week or so it's completely gone off the rails and first of all have their own Raj\nOf stories about seemingly minor stuff bar fighting your book inscription trawling ice it someone\nUm and it almost seems like much of the mainstream media now became part of the stop\nKavanaugh movement and then today with the wrapping up a cookie FBI pro you almost since a bit of deflation is a kind of a total thing when you see many of these reports that something more damaging against capital wasn't turned up\nHow it's Murray here thank you for coming on again today obviously a lot of this story um well this is like the big story of the past few weeks and cable news has a lot of time to selling a lot of news anchors has\nHad panels on them with opinion folks like guy and I do so there's a lot of different things at play here\nAnd I think to a lot of people on the left they lead look at the coverage on CNN or MSNBC particularly which I Know it gets cut out a lot and say you know they're reporting things that are out there\nAnd yes some of them seem very minor but nothing nothing bake it happened right and this to end the story is the top story in part that's a that's a product of cable news maybe not their political persuasion how would you respond to that\nYou know things that are out there isn't good enough\nThat's not enough of a standard to report damaging allegations against someone opinion panels come on and say this is the end of the Supreme Court as we know at the end of civilization as we know it's like everyone knows cable I talked to so and I include a lot of the New York times or is it was as well but when you when you when the ... when NBC for example\nGets an interview with these so called sort of comes with Julie sweat the stores completely fall are art and she\nChanges her story from what you said that after big but of course of course was totally played\nOn this by Michael out but not in my view and she said well originally she saw a spike the punch but he was only near the punch and nothing that really plays them a in the center of what happened to sensational ways complicit with gang rape allegation I don't know that you put that on the air will you put that on the air you say\nThis knocked down the allegation so I understand is an effort to impugn or chip away probably a better way to put it it's a capitalist credibility and that's why you out these incidents involving due to drink too much this time really are given a bar fight that time by themselves especially stuff's like thirty five years ago it seems kind of ludicrous\nI get the point but when you have a barrage of such stories it really does reinforce those who don't trust the media thinking that\nWe collectively are on one side of this highly charged scotch\nAnd virtually none of the stories are covered goes in the other direction right it is well does it does a handful of places but not in the mainstream media how I Want to talk about the New Yorker because full disclosure I'm friends with Ronan Farrow or some of his work has been incredibly rigorous and thorough and impacts on the me too movement\nOr bringing down some very significant figures there was a story that came out about a week ago or so regarding the Ramirez allegation the Yale allegation from the woman who says she thinks it might have been him who exposed himself to hurt a drunken party in Nineteen eighty three but wasn't really sure it was him\nA and there was no corroboration at the time for people who were there they all did not corroborate people that she said we're in the room but in that New Yorker story the previous one there was one piece of contemporaneous corroboration which was an anonymous person who remembers hearing about it the next day\nThere was a follow up to that article that came out last night also in the New Yorker that\nAmong other things\nTracked down or identified rather that anonymous here say witness from the previous story and he said that he didn't want to be named in the New Yorker last time because he wanted to get in touch with the person he thinks told him back in Nineteen eighty three that it had happened but he'd been unable to get in touch with that guy\nGold and reduce your tax bed and if you owe more than twenty thousand dollars you may be at the

I'm before we went to this stupid division thing which I hate oh you don't like the division I hate that division you don't like the championship game\nUh I like the championship game we want it twice both over Wisconsin but the divisions are very uneven late ... for the last few years Ohio state's division is much better than Wisconsin's division and so like the top two teams in Ohio State division should go to the Big Ten championship you have Penn State you have Michigan you at\nMichigan State he you know Wisconsin keeps getting its butt kicked because they're just not evenly divided and it's really hard to do\nOver the long term but I think there are a lot of like fans at Penn State for example who think well you know\nEven if we we should go to the became championship against Ohio State if they went out no no I hate it I hate it and I hate the whole concept of weather league champions should be the ones to go to the football playoff by digressing grow up\nAnd if you're Alabama you don't have to be your division ... and you go to the right way up to the ad I mentioned that every time because it drives me nuts that that was allowed to happen even though they were clearly the best team in one the whole thing like you got to earn it and they didn't but then well\nThis is the problem with the champion with the way the system is right now at the fourteen playoff if there were an Eighteen playoff there would be less pressure to take the major conference champions and it would really be the eight I think the eight that keen that'd\nBe an interesting debate to

to tell you for women that are out there I've learned they believe and I\nYou don't doubt I doubt that forward that something happened to her but we have to be able to\nGet this guy and open and fair hearing and give him that present you're not in a sense because that's what the law is all about and I listen to your testimony on both sides and unfortunately for her I Believe although I Believe something happened there was nothing\nTo collaborate that was compelling to me to make me think that he had anything to do with it he could have\nBut it just didn't come down so what is the likelihood of here that he was involved naturally have to deal with and the likelihood is based on what we were able to gather from everything from her\nWe can't prove that he was\nHe was involved in any of this I Do believe hurt my heart great for her I Know what it feels like\nTo be like I said I'm a survivor myself and I do feel\nThat based on and I'm sixty nine years old and ... in my twenties by an attorney that I trust and it went on over a four year period I cried through the whole thing it made me really everything all over again\nBut the law is the law and we have to abide by that because we don't\nThen my son who's forty years forty seven years old and all the men out there have to worry that just because it will then says something happened that they are going to be presumed guilty and

lot of folks who watch who are survivors who watch the hearing and we're reliving their own memories and it's been hard for people so I'm grateful that that you called in with your story Judy\nLast time you and I talked on this program I I think I remember correctly you said you would voted for President Trump but you were unhappy with some of the things he's done and to know the tone he had taken and you were at that point that you would probably not vote for him again at that moment\nHad they have in our process impacted your support of him or the Republican Party at all\nOn the swing voter so I ... I voted on the field and not the party I don't think when you when you really when the when the dust settles and we clear the air the only thing that mattered at this point is if the Senate follows the law\n[noise] where they were able to determine because like I said this is not a bag of production and this isn't about beyond a reasonable doubt it's about what's the likelihood that he had anything to do it as what it is that my voting for Trump again\nNo he has other things that I have to think about regarding yeah behavior that would impact that by Kavanaugh was treated very badly and presumed can be guilty when he well we don't know that for a fact that's not to say that he had something to do with any of this but we don't know that\nWe don't know right and Judy ... sorry ... we

I'm In a bronco bomber he brilliantly that you're not an evil thing but he brilliantly figured out a way to break that mold by boosting up turn out from the base when he ran but um and then conservatives thought but he wasn't that he was too partisan as a president but that's that's a partisan view don't\nTry and the left side and some things like health care immigration that ... random is that what you\nCompromise here guys and but it don't drop is the first president who has come into office and actually still running like he's trying to win the base primary vote right and um\nHow do you think that's just really isn't that the strategy for about\n... best both um I think it's a strategy that fits who he is I'm going to be very difficult for him get out of fat I'm at the same time you see looking on the Democratic side you know where everybody is trying to audition to be Spartacus\nAnd I'm a everyone is trying to you know there there's this lame that everyone seems to be wanting to say who was the most authentic and plausible socialist\nAnd I think that going forward the whole idea of trying to win the sort of hold on to another all your base that if you add the center to it you will a winning coalition\nThat idea may just simply be gone for the next generation and none of us really know how to talk about politics in that sort of brave new world\nYeah guy it's that's part of the reason that I think there are reasons to be concerned about the future of our politics another one Jonah and one of the pieces that you wrote this week that resonated the most with me and I saw was widely shared among conservatives is that there is and there has been for a long time this feeling on the right that the media", "show_name": "The Alan Colmes Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "08"}
