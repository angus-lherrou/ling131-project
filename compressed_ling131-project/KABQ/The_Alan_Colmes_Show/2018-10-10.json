O. P. standard operating procedure of this administration when it comes to high level departures it is extraordinary that Nikki Haley appears to have done this number one completely on her own terms\nNumber two in such a way that everyone is saying wonderful things about her including the president who\nGave me a glowing send off in the oval office as they sat next to one another and number three\nShe has raised not only her profile but enhanced and increased and improved ... own political reputation over the course of working in this administration\nThat has not been the trajectory for very many people if any for anyone with for anyone taking you know high level positions in this administration and then have departed in the public eye there has you do not have that trifecta you either have potshots being taken or they get fired via Twitter\nAs secretary of state got fired on Twitter a chief of staff got fired on Twitter she got an Oval Office Prescott friend\nOr you show up and amazing your reputation is here and you leave and all of a sudden your reputation is has taken a hit let's say from certain elements she managed to\nNavigate this in such a way that she's walking away it appears unscathed that in that is\nHow ... how could I agree with you and I think by all accounts I was sort of perplexed by their choice\nShe studied up on the issue she pushed for things like human rights she pushed for holding Russia accountable things that are there are people in the Trump Administration don't always do I totally agree with you how do you think she navigated all of that fell out so I I think\nThat number one she has good political instincts\nSo she was she had endorsed against Trump in the primary she was a Rubio indoors her she had a Twitter spat with Trump at one point saying bless your heart to him which is\nThe ultimate is not a highway and put down yet not ... that's definitely not positive I she realize okay this guy is the nominee now he's the president I'm going to get on the team\nAnd it goes serve up a Turtle Bay where I'm not in DC in that culture an everyday I can represent\nA strength and ... sort of a\nA strengthen robustness of American foreign policy\nIn a way that I can do at that very much in line with the president's thinking an instinct would out being constantly in the morass of administration drama\nYeah I think and I think physically separate in New York actually part of that to definitely\nAnd then she also was able to straddle this line where she was on one hand especially in public performances television press conferences major speeches\nShe she performing the way the president likes to see people in his administration perform yeah she is an able\nPerformer on the national stage and sort of showing that strength she backed him up the president that is pretty forcefully when she needed to so remaining in his good graces that entire time\nAlso Trump likes a winter when she's popular that's good that's someone that he's appointed she's popular that reflects well on him right so she played that side well but then for people like me who are Trump's skeptical conservatives I'm much more of a Nikki Haley conservative let's say\nShe never lost me it never felt like she totally sold out to complete unbridled Trump ism and occasionally would throw\nA brush a brush back pay a little shade the president was it was never yeah overly aggressive it was never disrespectful but she would from time to time when she felt like she needed to whether it was on\nIssues related to Israel or you know some of the skull boat where there was already show ... Russia or even like some of the internal\nDivisiveness she basically would say here's how I see it or here's how I can take care of myself and she sent some signals that she was not just going you know completely face first into the tank on every single thing\nAnd because of that she gained a lot of respect I think from Trump's skeptical not just conservatives but independents and some Democrats went out kicking off Trump and without really alienating the White House yeah and that's how she did it and then I guess she has come to this conclusion I've heard at least a month ago\nI just started to get put into motion Trump said she may be reference it to him in a conversation six months ago\nShe started thinking about an exit strategy for herself\nShe is now executed that and she pulled it off really really impressively yeah I'm a ... just just as a political maneuver from start to finish what she has done setting aside I think are excellent policy contributions\nIn this

I'm Marie harsh along with guys and says night and we have been talking a lot about Nikki Haley the ambassador to the United nations will be leaving her post at the end of the year and in that vein guy there are a\nCouple of foreign policy stories things happening overseas that probably aren't at the top of a lot of Americans you know with the news they're reading right now but a really important and they all kind of fall into this category of\nCountries behaving badly and so I Want to talk about a couple of them because they are happening overseas but they're also related to what we're doing here in the U.S in terms of our policy in who were working with and I think they're all really interested in some ways very disturbing I Want to start with something that's happening\n[noise] regarding Saudi Arabia there is a prominent Saudi writer named ...\nWho has close relationships with the Saudi royal family but over the past few years has become an outspoken critic of many things happening in the kingdom he and he's been living in the United states writing for the Washington Post as a commentator he vanished on Tuesday a week ago\nAfter entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey to obtain paperwork so he could marry his Turkish fiance\nHe has not been seen or heard from since he had been living in the United states and had been writing for the post as I mentioned he hasn't been heard from\nAt all in that week and on Saturday Turkish officials told the Washington Post ... was murdered\nAt the Saudi conflict they haven't produced any evidence to back that up but he hasn't been heard from in a week and guy one of the things I find interesting about this story is that the\nSaudi royal family particularly this young crown prince named Mohammed bin Salman had have formed an incredibly close relationship with the Trump Administration they work very closely for example with Jared Kushner does Saudi royal Mohammed bin Salman has been pushing a pretty significant economic reform strategy at home\nAt the same time has been increasingly cracking down on the opposition in the country whether it's in his own family or in public criticism now there's been a week where we have in your ...\nDidn't they run up a bunch of people and send them to like homo erectus ... they did\nSo he arrested a bunch of royal family members who he charged with corruption and put them in confinement at the Ritz Carlton to Riyadh which I've stayed at the very nice hotel and it's not an all the prison\nBut he claimed that he was cracking down on corruption inside the royal family he's very well may have been doing that but at the same time he was cracking down on other power centers in the royal family who could challenges rule\nSo by no means that the Democratic but in small day but he had really taken a lot of western commentators sort of charm them that he was going to make the kingdom some sort of\nMore reform minded place and now this prominent writer vanishing after he goes into the Saudi conflict what do you make of this\n[noise] I mean it's it's fascinating a fun fact I was born in Saudi Arabia that's why I should mention up\nOh I've always always interested to hear about the latest goings on including that there are some women drive over there which was not allowed when my mother was there ... had me fair um\nTo me I'm a little bit skeptical of both sides on this one because it's not like I'm going to take the Turkish government's word at face value on anything I think that they were\nLike I might trust the Saudis over the Turks which is sort of an amazing thing to say but I Want I think is a bad bad actor in a bad guy and a NATO ally ooh well supposedly yeah for I mean there were there are thoughts were beating up Americans\nIn DC in Washington DC Washington DC that's right and the Turks and the Saudis have an ongoing feud so I agree with you we can't take what the Turks that said at face value but I think\nHe well he got murdered in their ... well first of all how do they know that and if they know that where's the proof\nAnd where is he I mean that part of the thing is I think they're trying to smoke them out right if you have to live smoke the Saudis out\nIs he and here's the thing if you're the Saudis and you actually want this guy dead for whatever reason\nFirst of all you know what's going to be a problem right you know that there's going to be a huge international outcry the guys living in America the guy is running for the Washington Post is not going to be some [noise]\nA small detail that no one pays attention to why on earth would you murder the guy in your own diplomatic mission why would you haven't come to your embassy or you're right ... and then murder him right\nWhy wouldn't you hire some you know some assassins or whatever I could look like and actually there's other ways to knock someone off there is no implausible deniability when he's in you're constantly yeah exactly so that's why that store doesn't really make a ton of sand where she and I have no idea and it's just and I hope he's All right well we haven't heard\nThe assistance to the to the freedoms we have here I Do think that despite the turmoil at home right now it's it's good to remember um\nYeah when I get really angry when our leader gets really angry he tweets\nHe doesn't

we pass a lot of other things with an overwhelming super majority bipartisan vote\nThere were some areas where we're going to disagree and this ended up being one of those areas where the vote split more or less along party lines all of that said I think there are some things we can focus on affirmatively now a that would help bring the parties back together at the criminal justice reform or it's a good opportunity to do that\nIn fact I had a great conversation with my colleague Dick Durban\nOr on the floor just uh uh just the other day on Saturday about that very thing and I think that would be a good bipartisan exercise for us right now\nCentered I Want to ask you a question here that sort of in the weeds but it could be relevant because I watched majority leader McConnell on Fox News Sunday a few days ago and he was asked about the hypothetical and now it's a hypothetical that let's say the Republicans maintain the Senate majority which I think is\nMaybe likely at this point after twenty Eighteen and then a Supreme Court vacancy were to open up in twenty twenty meaning during a presidential election year\nIt was McConnell's position and the Republicans position and twenty sixteen\nThat we have to wait for the election to be decided to the American people to make a choice and then that seat was filled\nHe was asked that question McConnell was would that Biden Schumer standard that we've talked about be applied in twenty twenty\nAnd he had just he said well that was about when opposite parties control the White House and the Senate do you have an opinion on whether or not these so called Biden Rule should potentially apply to a hypothetical\nA vacancy in twenty twenty\nI agree with Mitch McConnell statement that this was a circumstance in which you had a Senate controlled by one party and the White House controlled by the other quarter of ... there's nothing written into the constitution about that ah the rule that we applied in that case\nA ... in ... was a political question\nWas a political dispute between two different political parties Republicans controlled the Senate the Senate has to provide advice and consent and didn't want to provide consent case\nSo it didn't um there's there's no reason categorically to assume that if a vacancy war to a rise in twenty twenty assuming that the uh the Senate is still under Republican control at that point because the same procedure would surely be followed\nSenator I I I Am interested in that answer and I could relate a gate Merrick Garland tell my anxiety level rise but I'm trying to lower my blood pressure this week so I actually want to pick up on something you said in your previous answer to me about criminal justice reform\nBecause I completely agree I think this is one place where there could be bipartisan agreement whether it's on cash bail\nOr send insane or a\nDiversion programs can you give our our listeners a sense of what are the issues that you and Senator Durbin talked about what did they send you think could be part eventually have some kind of bipartisan effort at real criminal justice reform which could impact so many millions of Americans\nYeah here's here's my basic salt and I'm always careful not to speak for any colleague\nUm and so I speak for myself here but I think these are things that Senator Durbin would generally agree with if we start from the basic framework of the first step back which is a prison reform bill passed by the house with an overwhelming super majority vote of uh like three hundred and sixty three in sixty one votes just a couple of months ago we started with that\nAre made some very minor tweaks to it and then added a few sentencing reform measures\nUm um expanded safety belt provision a prospect of relief under section ... of

until then the only thing that the Republicans seem to\nRecognize and respect strength and you heard how the Republican members led by Mitch McConnell and the president [noise] really demeaned the confirmation process [noise] she's\nBack home stretch here on Benson and that was Hillary Clinton\nSaying that you can't be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for and what you care about and she talked about the Republicans demeaning the confirmation process which is quite rich given how the Democrats conducted themselves you look at the media and their bias\nAnd even in spite of that intense bias over the Kavanaugh fight even in the CNN poll Americans had the lowest opinion of how the Democrats handled themselves\nHeld Brett Kavanaugh is only ten points underwater in that CNN poll he's by far coming out looking best of the three among cabin all the Republicans and the Democrats he's only ten points underwater\nIndependence very displeased what they saw from the Democrats are Hillary's just blaming Republicans which is not a surprise but I think this is a really irresponsible thing of her to say\nThat you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for that is a ticket to instability for everyone\nThat is an open invitation sort of an explicit call for instability for part as soon as a partisan actors on both sides because if you're a hardcore conservative are hardcore Republican\nYou can be convinced or you might say that the Democrats want to destroy what you stand for and what you care about if you're a liberal Democrat or vice versa the whole point of civility is that you have to recognize people with whom you disagree as people who are not motivated by the worst\nMost base motivations and try to work with them and at least be polite and she's saying no you can't do that\nShe was basically saying the Republicans want to destroy what we care about and therefore we can't be civil with them that means that we will never be civil would anyone\nEver again if this is the standard but then she says I Believe that if we're fortunate enough to win back the house enter the Senate that's when civility can start again oh so our capacity for civility is\nOnly restored when Democrats win an election\nThat's what she's saying so long as the Republicans are in full control\nThere is no place no use for civility but at the Democrats win well then maybe we can get shovel again I'm not sure that's an argument that's going to persuade very many people\nWhen Democrats controlled everything in two thousand nine and two thousand ten things got heated\nThe Tea Party got riled up we had a big election the Republicans one\nWas there a single person in the Democratic party or among their friends in the mainstream media who were saying older Republicans they get a mole again on civility\nTwo years of civility can go down the tubes they get a pass they get a whole pass on civility because the Democrats won everything so they don't have to behave themselves they don't have to treat Democrats\nLike human beings\nIf they win and maybe we can reset this whole thing I don't remember that coming from the mainstream liberal press I don't remember that coming from the liberals I remember civility panics\n\nOh ringing of hands about our discourse in these horrid horrid Republicans and conservatives and what they're saying and their rhetoric\nSo once again Hillary Clinton emerges to remind us that she is the worst but she's got a lucrative speaking tour with her husband coming up after the midterm so that'll be fun I saw senator Hirono turns out to be one of the biggest tax\nIn Congress who knew was asked about the threats and harassment of her colleagues in the Senate and she said that this is what happens and then she talked about total on separate a white supremacist I it just is a jumble of nonsense words [noise]\nTrump is bad because he's not civil when they go low we

O. P. standard operating procedure of this administration when it comes to high level departures it is extraordinary that Nikki Haley appears to have done this number one completely on her own terms\nNumber two in such a way that everyone is saying wonderful things about her including the president who\nGave me a glowing send off in the oval office as they sat next to one another\nAnd number three she has raised not only her profile but enhanced and increased and improved ... own political reputation over the course of working in this administration\nThat has not been the trajectory for very many people if any for anyone with for anyone ever taken you know high level positions in this administration and then have departed in the public option\nThere has you do not have that trifecta you either have potshots being taken or they get fired via Twitter\nSecretary of state got fired on Twitter a chief of staff\nGot fired on Twitter she got an Oval Office Prescott friend\nTour you show up and then your reputation is here and you leave and all of a sudden your reputation is\nHas taken a hit let's say from certain elements she managed to navigate this in such a way that she's walking away it appears unscathed that and that is\nHow ... how could I agree with you and I think by all accounts I Would sort of perplexed by their choice but she studied\nUp on all of the issue she pushed for things like human rights she pushed for holding Russia accountable things that are there are people in the Trump Administration don't always do I totally agree with you how do you think she navigated all of that fell out so I I think\nThat number one she has good political instincts\nSo she was she had endorsed against Trump in the primary she was a Rubio indoors her she had a Twitter spat with Trump at one point saying bless your heart to him which is\nThe ultimate is not a highway and put down yeah you you that's definitely not positive I she realize okay this guy is the nominee now he's the president I'm going to get on the team\nAnd it goes serve up a Turtle Bay where I'm not in DC in that cauldron everyday I can represent\nA strength and ... as a sort of a\nA strengthen robustness of American foreign policy\nIn a way that I can do it that's very much in line with the president's thinking an instinct without being constantly in the morass of administration drama\nYeah I think and I physically separate in New York actually part of that ...\nDefinitely and then she also was able to straddle this line where she was on one hand especially in public performances television press conferences major speeches\nShe she performed the way the president likes to see people in his administration perform yes she's an able\nPerformer on the national stage and sort of showing that strength she backed him up the president that is pretty forcefully when she needed to so remaining in his good graces that entire time\nAlso Trump wants a winter when she's popular that's good that someone that he's appointed she's popular that reflects well on him right so she played that side well but then for people like me who are Trump's skeptical conservatives I'm much more of an Nikki Haley conservative let's say\nShe'd never lost me it never felt like she totally sold out to complete unbridled Trump ism and occasionally would throw\nA brush a brush back pay a little shed the president was it was never yeah overly aggressive it was never disrespectful but she would from time to time when she felt like she needed to whether it was on\nIssues related to Israel or you know some of the scuttle bug where there was All right on the show ... Russia or even like some of the internal\nDivisiveness she basically would say here's how I see it or a here's how I can take care of myself and she sent some signals that she was not just going you know completely face first into the tank on every single thing\nAnd because of that she gained a lot of respect I think from from skeptical not just conservatives but independents and some Democrats would out kicking off Trump and without really alienating the White House yeah and that's how she did it and then I guess she has come to this conclusion I've heard at least a month ago\nI just started to get put into motion Trump said she may be referenced it to him in a conversation six months ago she started thinking about an exit strategy for herself\nShe is now executed that and she pulled it off\nReally really impressively yeah I'm a ... just just as a political maneuver from start to finish what she has done setting aside I think are excellent policy contributions\nIn this environment in this administration is nothing short of breathtaking I mean it's just it's\nWell and I couldn't for her I think guy this is not the last line if you have Nikki Haley and we're going to

David Duke rod Stewart's biggest hit [noise]\nNineteen Seventy six tonight [noise]\n\n\n\nCome back to fencing harm I'm Marie harsh along with guys and night and we have been talking a lot about Nikki Haley the ambassador to the United nations will be leaving her post at the end of the year and in that vein guy there are a\nCouple of foreign policy stories things happening overseas that\nProbably are at the top of a lot of Americans you know with the news they're reading right now but a really important and they all kind of fall into this category of\nCountries behaving badly and so I Want to talk about a couple of them because they are happening overseas but they're also related to what we're doing here in the U.S in terms of our policy and who were working with and I think they're all really interested in in some ways very disturbing I Want to start with something that's happening\nRegarding Saudi Arabia there is a prominent Saudi writer named ...\nWho has close relationships with the Saudi royal family but over the past few years has become an outspoken critic of many things happening in the kingdom he and he's been living in the United states writing for the Washington Post as a commentator he vanished on Tuesday a week ago\nAfter entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey to obtain paperwork so he could marry his Turkish fiance he has not been seen or heard from since\nHe had been living in the United states and had been writing for the post as I mentioned he\nHasn't been heard from at all in that week and on Saturday Turkish officials told the Washington Post ...\nWas murdered at the Saudi conflict they haven't produced any evidence to back that up but he hasn't been heard from in a week and guy one of the things I find interesting about this story is that the Saudi\nRoyal family particularly this young crown prince named Mohammed bin ... had have formed an incredibly close relationship with the Trump Administration they worked very closely for example with Jared Kushner this Saudi royal Mohammed bin Salman has been pushing a pretty significant economic reform strategy at home\nAt the same time has been increasingly cracking down on the opposition in the country whether it's in his own family or in public criticism now there's been a week where we have a different\nDidn't they rounded up a bunch of people and send them to like home ...\nSo he arrested a bunch of royal family members who he charged with corruption and put them in confinement at the Ritz Carlton ... which I've stayed out and has a very nice so talent is not an all a prison but\nHe claimed that he was cracking down on corruption inside the royal family he's very well may have been doing that but at the same time he was cracking down on other power centers in the royal family who could challenge his rule\nSo by no means is he democratic but in small the but he had really taken a lot of western commentators sort of charm them that he was going to make the kingdom some sort of\nMore reform minded place and now this prominent writer vanishing after he goes into the Saudi conflict what do you make of this\n[noise] I mean it's it's fascinating a fun fact I was born in Saudi Arabia that's why I should mention up\nI've always always interested to hear about the latest goings on including that they're now what are some women drive over there which was not allowed when my mother was there has to have me say our um to me I'm a little bit skeptical of both sides on this one\nBecause it's not like I'm going to take the Turkish government's word at face value on anything I think that they were\nLike I might trust the Saudis over the Turks which is sort of an amazing thing to say [laughter] but I Want I think is a bad bad actor in a bad guy and a NATO ally ... supposedly yeah for I mean there were there thugs were beating up Americans in DC\nIn Washington DC and the Washington DC that's right and the Turks and the Saudis have an ongoing feud so I agree with you we can't take what the Turks has said at face value but I\nThink he will he got murdered in their ... well first of all how do they know that and if they know that where's the proof\nAnd where is he I mean that part of the thing is I think they're trying to smoke them out right if you had to live smoke the Saudis out\nWhere is he and here's the thing if you're the Saudis and you actually want this guy dead for whatever reason\nFirst of all you know what's going to be a problem right you know that there's going to be a huge international outcry the guys living in America the guy is running for the Washington Post is not going to be some [noise]\nA small detail but no one pays attention to why on earth would you murder the guy in your own diplomatic mission why would you\nHave him come to your embassy or your ... and then murder him right like why would you hire some you know some assassins or whatever I can look like and actually there's other ways to knock someone off there's no love the bull deniability when he's in your consulate yeah exactly so that's why that store doesn't really make a ton of sand where the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Alan
