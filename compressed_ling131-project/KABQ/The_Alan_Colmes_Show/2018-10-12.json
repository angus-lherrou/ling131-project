I Believe in his early nineties says\nLook we are going to set in motion beginning on Monday legislation to outlaw the death penalty and for now there's an immediate hopes to twelve hundred plans executions Malaysia a country that uses\nHanging as a punishment for a whole range of crimes including things like drug trafficking which I think we could agree does not rise to the severity of\nExecution that let alone any crime perhaps\nUm Amnesty International praising this Congress an astounding turnaround for a country that had really close to this policy I think a lot of this has to do with the fact of Malaysia has been trying to free of number of its citizens who are on death row in other countries and they found\nAn surprisingly you have little standing to make that case when you kill people in your own criminal justice system is I think a great development and in Washington state has now become the twentieth stayed in the United states plus the district\nAnd Puerto Rico to also banned the death penalty the Supreme Court in Washington today saying this was an arbitrary\nA type of policy it was not apply to kind of consistency and was often racially motivated and I have to say it's part of I think a momentum behind this unfortunately it's limited\nIt seems to blue state you know since two thousand seven we've seen New Jersey New York New Mexico Illinois Connecticut Maryland Delaware and now Washington all banned the death penalty one\nOf those states have in common so this is a trend I just would hope it leaves blue states at some point and A People's consciences is a you know peaked here uh but again a great day of progress one day on the heels of the un day against the death penalty you see\nA major state and a major country a reverse course here I think it's a great development\nRemarkable the Orthodox Church and I ... it is this the Russian Orthodox church in the Greek Orthodox Church there's the topics the the the the Egyptian Orthodox Church or have has granted auto ... fully to Ukraine's church which sounds like a genetic brain disorder and buy those\n[laughter] yeah exactly well this is a big development of for Russia and for Ukraine this is the Orthodox Church based in Constantinople their patriarch\nRuling today after years of appeal from Ukraine now just worth pointing out Ukraine one of the largest orthodox populations in the world of their church has been under the control of the Moscow based Russian Orthodox church so you see\nThe patriarchs of Moscow appointing new leaders to the church in Ukraine and for centuries calling the churches in Ukraine that don't want to be under ... influence\nExcuse Mac right they're not you know part of the faith in their parishioners are ... are not part of the communion\nUm has now been reversed a this is a lot of it has to do the interviews I've done with the fact that Russia had been using its Orthodox Church do exert types of influence on Ukraine it was sort of a political force in many ways uh in the church contends noble here\nKnowing that they will lose the backing of the Russian Orthodox church there you know patriarchy is has been already warned if you do this if you grant you know as if you turn the church of Ukraine into its own\nEnergy Russia's Orthodox Church will stopped following the Orthodox Church based in in Turkey or they went ahead and did it anyway a lot of this has to do with the fact that now when you take out the Ukrainian churches Ukrainian priest who are part of the orthodox space you take them out of the Russian church the Russian church becomes much smaller uh and\nSo it'll to ensure sort of a contest for power power it reminds me of a you know history textbook it seems like an issue that we wouldn't be dealing with in twenty eight team but there's a lot of sort of Ukraine Russia politics at play here and it seems Ukraine has come out in the winter\nYeah fascinating and then there's a Chinese spy and and all the corporate espionage against the United states what's going on with us\nYeah thank you and gene he was arrested a in Belgium earlier this year an extradited to the United states on Tuesday accused of\nEconomic espionage attempt to steal trade secrets from General Electric aviation and another from which likely is bowling I'm this is what the experts are calling sort of an increasingly common Chinese strategy as us and international firms realize they needed to be there\nCareful with their own data privacy when their executives go to China they're wary about doing sorts of\nVarious sorts of information you know sharing what the Chinese\nAnd so you're seeing an increasing pattern where there are intrusion efforts you know in America biotech defense pharmaceuticals transportation you see sort of Chinese intelligence assets trying to infiltrate those companies\nRecruit people from those companies to come to sign up for a meeting and then come up their data there um and it really cuts against the whole sort of perfect China made in China trade strategy right they're trying to say hey\nWe don't want to be relying on the U.S and other countries for some of our key industries but it seems like a one way to do that is to sort of the\nTop and the American brain power a little bit at least that's the accusation accusation let's see I mean I think we're going to hear a lot more of this between now in the mid term I don't think it's coincidental this administration\nHas been talking a lot in recent weeks about Chinese attempt to sway the election or are going to you know this guy had been detained in Belgium since March on or you know I Wonder if there's some you know timing here to\nHave another bad news story about China but just a few weeks ahead of them at her\nThat's

correctness can I ask you know what I don't read deeply therefore\nI'm a headline kind of guy we we had a white guy goes deep into the uh now\nHe breaks it down I uh we looked at the polls and that's shocking you know as someone that's lived and died by political correctness I have moons to prove it just watch your waters world but if I had known everybody was on my side I Would have done things a

it's best done over you watch the editor you watch the eight o'clock silver and then you watch the eleven o'clock\nDrunk and you compare it's\nAlways better at eleven [laughter]\nSo you were just talking about the five and we didn't get to county let's play very quickly caught one this was one of the more interesting comments from Kanye West today that got a lot of attention talking about liberals and the African American community Kanye West taken away\nA lot of times it's just an overall lack of reparations that we can be given point we say this is right that this is this is this is racist so we don't have a river races but we had a certain we open up the whole conversation so and I got to\nThe movies that I Love the liberals tried to do\nControl of the concept of racism because they know that we're very proud of most people when I said I'm like try to like someone as liberal they'll say oh what do you think of race and visible\nCan you just you just get your thoughts yeah\nUh I did not understand the first half of them at all I can but I think the second half of the soundbite was that\nLiberals use racism as a weapon against black people to keep them voting Democrat and to keep them angry at Republicans and you can see that for decades how the Republican Party has just been savagely attacked\nFor any policy they have as trying to keep the black men down whereas if you look at the Democratic policies have they benefit of the African American community there is a big debate about that\nMy point for the ... thing was this was about made in America this is a business meeting he went in there\nAs a shoe guy or whatever he's trying to sell and he's saying I Can't even open up a factory in Detroit or Chicago or in Atlanta\nBecause the costs are so high because China's out they're stealing all the jobs\nAnd he said that black Americans in some of these urban areas because the jobs of left for China are forced to do with illegal things to feed their family and they wind up in prison so it's a vicious cycle\nAnd he wants to make America great again by having things made in America again and if you can get Donald Trump black by in on\nThe made in America gender the trade agenda the manufacturing agenda that's a huge boost to the U.S economy and you're going to see a renaissance in this country and that's why the Democrats are so scared\nJesse we had a one William's on the show yesterday and we were talking about his new book why the hell do you have to lose I'm Sorry to hear that\nAnd ... and he was talking about Kanye he brought him up specifically and basically we're saying this is kind of tokenism\nFrom the Trump Administration they find high profile black people who support them whereas most black people do not and they bring them in front of the cameras to praised Trump and it makes them feel better and it's sort of this is sort of a cheap stock rather than a policy argument or a serious effort to engage the African American community ... what do you think of that point\nI Believe a lot of Democrats feel that way and it's sad because ... not a prop as one said today on the show ... is a challenge to artists in America right now he's not a policy expert but he wields a lot of influence and power\nIn his community and financially and when he talks people listen so I don't see anything wrong with the president bringing in all voices from all shapes and sizes and colors and background\nI think Trump to convene or he's a stomach guy he does deals in the boardroom he did it on guns he's done it on race and there's nothing wrong with bringing people with different backgrounds to talk to I think he was always friends with the African American community there's pictures all over the Internet\n\n\n\nCan

there to talk about in part I fully support that I think criminal justice reform is incredibly important [noise]\nI just think that ... may not because I don't agree with his politics it's because I don't think he makes any sense that that that's all I got let's go to the phone lines to Jeff in Raleigh North Carolina when you make of tiny it goes to the White House\nTanya is we've always been

to lose and that was what President Trump famously said speaking to African American communities during the campaign and one in his book runs through\nAll the ways that Donald Trump is hurting the black community in his in his argument whether it's ... you know voting rights being curtailed not supporting each BC use like he promised he would not supporting you know not working to to grow the

it's heading right now the lowly goes off the cliff yeah and he said so I I got to make these changes and so most of us who looked at the middle east for a while have wish them well\nYou know with this not only will change this country but change the countries are in the middle east and bring a degree of modernity to them that that we haven't seen in generations\nYou know I I think that's right and and when I first started focusing on Saudi Arabia king side was still alive I mean the things that Mohammed bin Salman has done where we're glimmers of hope you know and and the back of people's minds at that time and and particularly in general I think it's interesting how NBS\nHas focused on opening up to foreign investment he talked about making aramco public\nUm he had he had very much\nTried to show that came to him as a place that foreigners could feel comfortable investing in which for a long time they had not seen\nIt again it's like you said it seems to me if\nHe's trying to show that there's a new came down doing something like this would be so counterproductive and yet we have no answers more than a weekend\nYeah um I think that the president certainly I I Believe it's taken a right action in the sense that um while this is not an American citizen this as an ally of the United states\nAnd we have a a got our Federal Bureau of investigation involved in this uh and that's a good thing [noise]\nUm [noise] and ... certainly that's being done with the cooperation\nOf another ally and raised in a strained ally at the present in terms of turkey but also the president stated with the cooperation of of Saudi Arabia I mean obviously based on the Fox that we have right now\nWhich are not complete by anybody's a statement they look highly suspicious because obviously what one fact we do have somebody I mean we we saw Jamal go into the consulate\nAnd if there was evidence he came out of it believe me we would have seen it yet I'm so that alone you know we get so many questions as to what actually transpired and inside that conflict and and the suggests that while he just left by the back door and then there's no there's no surveillance of the back door\nUh that's highly unlikely um yes so it is suspicious but I I think we also have to wait and then let's let this investigation or them play out I certainly ... miles welfare is the thing that's most important that he is a\n... a dissident journalist or who's been willing to take on the regime\nOf for his his says that the regime has not move fast enough to correct\nOr some of the ills that has had and it doesn't take much to light a match and the Congress when it comes to Saudi Arabia and create a bonfire and um the suspicions alone are beginning to do that because the Congress has had\nThe challenges with the regime for some time\nI'm particularly over a human rights are justified and also a most recently they've had concern with him over Yemen and the and the killing of a of civilians up in in their judgment disproportionately so [noise]\nAnd so those concerns have always been there and I I I Believe the sort of this investigation as it gets completed in the ... of it hopefully will will be something people would have have confidence and one thing I I I'm not as enthusiastic about\nIs any proclamations coming from turkey because there's there's there are stark divisions between\nSaudi Arabia and and turkey and the ... the number of journalists that I'm Out on has on his jailhouse right now yeah\nHardly gives him any platform to point a finger at that anyone else when it comes to this kind of horrific behavior so I take what they say a guarded Lee yes and I also made it couldn't be factual but we also need to know the history of\nThat is right there are certainly not an unbiased observer you mentioned President Trump and pressure from Congress and I think that's that's where we should go next because there is pressure from the Senate particularly and not just Democrats are\nPeople like Rand Paul I think you're going to hear more of this if we find a Saturday they're responsible President Trump was asked today how the u._s. should respond let's take a listen and cut fifty\nHis response and then I Want you to to respond\nUsually they're going\nWinter still months away but the Centers for Disease Control and prevention is already out with its

out the benefits from the vaccine wear off over time and when the nastiest Lou months in January and February roll around some folks won't be protected\nThe risk is especially strong for seniors because the flu shot protection wears off even quicker for them than for younger people\nThe CDC says delaying vaccination might permit greater immunity later in the season but the world could result in missed opportunities to vaccinate it's too soon to predict how severe this year's flu season will be last year more than seven hundred thousand people were in the hospital with the virus\nFor more

really exciting things like the ... yes that's fun [laughter] let's let's start on the Senate side because that's the side that makes me happy or um it does seem\nLike a lot of these races are if not breaking turning we're veering in the Republican direction pulling out of Texas in Tennessee and some of these other red states looking pretty strong for the G O P I Want to ask you though Amy about Nevada Lucy and a couple of polls now with Dean Heller clinging\nTo a one or two or three point lead the bad news for him is that a lot of the undecided just a few undecided leftover are anti Trump the good news for him as you still ahead and his opponent is pretty bad favorable\nLife he's running a pretty tough race what do you make of of that contest and do you think if you were to put down some poker chips uh-huh you bet on Dean Heller 'cause that's maybe the toughest one of the country\nI think that I'm Glad you brought that race up to things the first is I think people assume because it's Nevada and Democrats at least at the presidential level have carried it Trump I mean I'm Sorry Obama carried it easily in\nTwo thousand and eight and twenty twelve Hillary Clinton carried it by a narrow margin that it's a blue state what it is is really it's a red state but it also has a significant\nLatino population that helps give it a blue tent so um this is a state that is a in terms of the population that is there that white it is less a fluent\nFewer college educated voters they're you know just if you compare for example the Nevada to Colorado both have significant Latino populations diverse populations in their major urban areas but the electorate in Colorado\nI think this is true they may per capita have more college graduates than any other state people who have advanced degrees so just the type a voter in\nNevada is much more of the Trump profile type loader\nThan in Colorado so that's number one the second thing I think about every time we go to Nevada and we see a close race I think about Harry Reid and every poll and twenty ten had him losing um [noise] that race obviously much\nWorst year for Democrats in twenty ten and the worst candidate and the recall absolutely [noise]\nOther polls to you this is a political ... always looks really tight and that sort of breaks open at the end the theory being that Harry Reid\nHas that machine he knows how to turn those voters out they may not show up and pulling and the other thing that doesn't show up in polling is Latino vote that it's the Tories Lee difficult to model\nTalking about how some of the polls have him in the high thirties low forties among Latinos how's that going to play out in some of these congressional race I like her Bellow or will hurt or whatever\nSo All right any Walter will

and then we sandwich cottage in there and then at the end there's a new poll that says eighty percent of the country hates political correctness and get this [noise] the people that hate it the most are Native Americans Hispanics and black Americans\nHow did it defined political correctness can I ask you know what I don't read the political I'm a headline kind of guy we we have like guy goes deep into the uh now he breaks\nIt down I uh we looked at the polls and that's shocking you know as someone that's lived and died by political correctness I have moons to prove it just watch a waters world but\nIf I had known everybody was on my side I Would have done things a little differently um so what do you have up on ladders while this weekend a live show because Trump speaking we have an culture

watch the eleven o'clock drunk and you compare it's always better at eleven [laughter]\nSo you were just talking about the five and we didn't get to county let's play very quickly caught one this was one of the more interesting comments from Kanye West today that got a lot of attention talking about liberals and the African American community Kanye West taken away\nA lot of times it's just an overall lack of reparations that we any given point we say this is right because this is this is racist racist so we don't have a reason why we had a certain kind of open up\nThe whole conversation so and I got to move from one of the movies that I Love the liberals tried to do\nA black person to the concept of racism because they know that we're very proud of most people when I said I'm like try to like someone to liberal they'll say oh what do you think of race can\nCan you just you just um at your thoughts yeah\nUh I did not understand the first half of them at all I can fast but I think the second half of the soundbite was that\nLiberals use racism as a weapon against black people to keep them voting Democrat and to keep them angry at Republicans and you can see that for decades how the Republican Party has just been savagely attacked\nFor any policy they have as trying to keep the black men down whereas if you look at the Democratic policies have they benefit of the African American community there is a big debate about that\nMy point for the ... thing was this was about made in America this was a business meeting he went in there\nAs a shoe guy or whatever he's trying to sell and he's saying I Can't even open up a factory in Detroit or Chicago or in Atlanta because the costs are so high because China's out they're stealing all the jobs\nAnd he said that black Americans in some of these urban areas because the jobs of left for China are forced to do with legal things to feed their family and they wind up in prison so it's a vicious cycle and he wants to make America great again by having things made in America again\nAnd if you can get Donald Trump black by in on\nThe made in America gender the trade agenda the manufacturing agenda that's a huge boost to the U.S economy and you're going to see a renaissance in this country and that's\nWhy the Democrats are so scared\nJesse we had a one William's on the show yesterday and we were talking about his new book why the hell do you have to lose I'm Sorry to hear that\nAnd ... and he was talking about ... he brought him up specifically and basically we're saying this is kind of tokenism\nFrom the Trump Administration they find high profile black people who support them whereas most black people do not and they bring them in front of the cameras to praised Trump and it makes them feel better and it's sort of this is sort of a cheap stunt rather than a policy argument or a serious effort to engage the African American community what do you think about point\nI Believe a lot of Democrats feel that way and it's sad because cutting is not a prop as one said today on the show ... is a challenge to artists in America right now he's not a policy expert but he wields a lot of influence and power\nIn his community and financially and when he talks people listen so I don't see anything wrong with the president bringing in all voices from all shapes and sizes and colors and background I think Trump to convene or he's a stomach guy he does deals in the boardroom he did it on guns\nHe's done it on race and there's nothing wrong with bringing people with different backgrounds to talk to I think he was always friends with the African American community there's pictures all over the Internet of him with black Americans Americans love Donald Trump he didn't\nPresident sued for racial discrimination and had to pay a lot of money to the government because he didn't want black people living in his apartment building so I think he has been mixed history and I agree she talked to whoever he wants I think what the point why make a buck and I agree with that says he\nAlso needs to engage on a policy level right not to be it can be nearby work for more African American voting rights worked for more African American educational right and that is what we haven't seen yet\nTo come full circle on the segment I did see a lot of concerns this week being like oh look today look at this ... west how exciting this was a big deal and like seven minutes ago they were like stay in your lane Taylor swift [laughter] you're out there is a bit of a an issue there right\nWell it's it's funny that you mentioned that because you mentioned that the top about those two you know intertwined historically and it's funny how the media will frame\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy one is
