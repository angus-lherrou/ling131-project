higher than the presidential election by a factor of almost four\nOh you mean like four hundred percent\n... well let's put it this way it's two hundred and Seventy five people at this past week I mean in the presidential election take a snapshot of of this past or last week the presidential election two hundred and Seventy five people voted early\nLast week same fast forward to this election

you know how to make our radio sound out that\nWe've been pro family of friends who is the first state Mike Pompeo with vice president Trump Thursday to give Saudi Arabia a few more days to investigate the disappearance of a Washington based journalist before deciding what action to take correspondent Melissa rainy has more\nI think the reason that this state gets more attention with the Ronny Jackson\nBeing six months later because one out of every and\nResidents of Montana is either an active duty military member or a veteran and so things concerning new veterans of a hospital and different kinds of veterans healthcare but typically do get an outsized amount of attention you hear that they might not get somewhere else or ... it really does seem though\nMore than talking specifically about health care or the tax reform people were just talking about Trump they Jon Tester is a lawmaker who you know Trump won here by twenty points she has said that he\nIs willing to work with the president wherever\nThey can come to agreement but on things like\nA cabinet or tax reform or the skinny repeal types or hasn't been there and so the thing that we hear from voters on both sides is they just aren't sure whether or not\nHe is going to fill court Trump if he wins reelection or whether or not the kind of it's just saying that because he's trying to convince a bunch of Republicans that he can he can go both ways and he even said today he told that he doesn't think he's ever vote but for a straight\nLine ticket he says he is very bipartisan or you know not always just voting for Democrats uh but I don't know just based on people that I've talked to hear if enough people are convinced about yeah\nYeah I mean it's I don't think it's much of a mystery of if he's not taking bipartisan votes\nOn tough issues in an election year he's up I don't think he's likely to attack more to the right\nIf he's reelected I Would point out is not just Kevin I voted against justice Gorsuch as well which was an eyebrow raiser you mentioned from being sort of an all consuming political issue in the state of Montana he's flying in some presidential treatment that of course\nGets people excited what is his of course the crowd that is showing up and sort of selective\nThey are going to be a bunch of big Trump fans but broadly speaking in the state of Montana the president wanted he carry Montana by double digits as you said Peter but how is his approval rating in general sentiment about him in Montana now\nAre the places that we have ban that people seem like they want a lawmaker who will at least consider voting with the president and that would that include\nI suppose that we were talking to at a Jon Tester of men in Butte about two hours away from here earlier today you know people the thing that people want with Trump in the White House is just to know that their senators vote means something and that that you know if\nIf something big comes up it could possibly impact Montana they\nWant to know their senators going to be able to work with the president and so again\nThat's coming from people at a drop of an added a test or a vet today the tests are that obviously a smaller sample size because uh it just time of day and the profile but it is something that ... ... you know where we have not really encountered hard\nLine people on either side or just in the last day of of driving around\nAll right live in Missoula, Montana is Peter do see Fox News correspondent the president will be there he'll be doing his thing on behalf of Republican Matt Rosendale who is trying to unseat Jon Tester in that race out there Peter appreciate your time tonight\n[noise] thanks guys thanks very\nThank you so this is an interesting race because Jon Tester is pretty popular back at home um he's pretty he's in better position I think a lot of other Democrats that are running in some states and the polling still looks pretty good for him as you mentioned Matt Rosendale isn't particularly\nWell known although the polling is kind of non existent there hasn't been a polling weeks in that race right so there's internal polling internal polling yes and I think testers team feels you know like this is a real challenge but I think they feel\nYou know cautiously optimistic um but at this point a lot of its turnout game um but this is really in just Trump's there by it that's why the president's there and if\nAnd if they felt like I think you're right that if you know to use a college basketball analogy if this were a bubble race\nCasters probably slightly on the happier side of the bone but he's right on the bubble and I think the Republicans that I'm hearing from are seeing some data that suggests it is worth sending the president back to that state is worth spending new money in that state which they are also doing\n[noise] yeah and and we will see 'em you know this hasn't gotten as much attention to some of the other line so who knows it can be what does that surprise races on election night but it's sort of feels like tester has has the momentum I mean he's ... he's just such\nA ... I don't know I don't have the right word to describe it but he really is a man of the state like he's not one of these people that comes to Washington and you feel like lizards where he came from\nAnd if you look at some of that ad they're really good and this is on line spots there just he's kinda like who he is and I think people recognize there's a lot of authenticity there even though I don't like all of his votes and I don't think that's true for every politician\nI've been I've been urging the Republicans to\nFocus in on judges and make that a central issue because tester was overwhelmingly just a yes vote for Obama's judges including the two Supreme Court justices one of whom voted against a fundamental right for people to own a handgun in that ... case\nWhere as he has voted against both of President Trump's pro Second Amendment\nJustice has a cabin on Gorsuch he's also done a lot of things to protect the second amendment right but I I think that so that's his inoculation where he's like look at my ... votes on some of these gun issues and I think the response to that is on the courts where you say okay you can do to your show votes but if you're\nGoing to show us all and there's a lot of reasons you would vote against the court jester\nBut if you're going to vote to confirm someone who wants to approve the second amendment as we know it and then voted against two people who have the proper understanding of the second amendment especially in the views of most Montanans ... a ... you know that's a serious vulnerability I think for tester and I just\nDon't think I think show votes is discounting all the things he's done and that he's done in this day I I really do I think that he has a very strong record on guns that I you know that I personally don't love but that I think we've got to the rating from an All right well the n._r._a. has become\nYeah I can campaign I think is horrified by that they thought that these had been vetted and they've apologized and he said yesterday very genuinely sort of they know B. S. like we screwed up\nUm but the fact that these names are out there now and I wonder if they think you and I were talking about in a spray quite the forget about the politics of the fact that she has a race right just forget about that\nShould be some accountability for the organization public accountability they gave these names and said they'd been vetted said they were fine to use and you literally they weren't\nYou know and so they've they've fired someone on the campaign who's also anonymous we don't know the organization\nThat was part of this giant screw All right that provided the insure me one to run an ad that has your candidates name on it\nThat out victims and some of them weren't even victims by the way they just like Facebook posts and stuff and it just it is so crazy sloppy\nAnd so that was an interview with one of the women on CNN another one did a local interview where she said that now she feels like she's afraid for her own safety so it's and I understand\nThe hiking campaign and then they don't want to look like they're passing the buck and blaming the organization like they're ... they're saying the buck stops here we're taking responsibility\nBecause you like you have to do due diligence because you can also\nThere should be some something like I Want to know what who this organization is because I also think they\nAre I mean they they share some blame but I think if you're going to put\nWomen's names who are survivors in an ad for your campaign you should make sure that they actually support your campaign and if they're okay with it\nIt's just it's I don't know how this gets published how this happened yeah and there's the other thing that's happening in the in the uh Kramer campaign the Republican is pointing out one of the candidates are one of the high camp surrogates rather is\nNow out attacking some of these women on social media being like what are you doing\nKramer also has been attacking victims of sexual assault rhetorically for the last three week well Kramer is not the person can make this argument\nThat I don't think I think what the high camp campaign was trying to do is be like look at how insensitive he can be to victims and then they stepped in\nThis python surrogate who knows how much control they have it that's the challenge with Eric gets believe me I'm a and they should that person should not be a surrogate I'm OK we're going to take a break we're going to come back right after this talk about Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan [noise]\n\n\nTheir own [noise]\nFriday October Nineteen what's new today on the radio on\nThe radio broadcast featuring a brand new episode with a legendary\nPaul McCartney no I'm In St Paul down with Joe leading to talk about his new album Egypt and then of course some discussion about a little band called beat off we were furious when we were playing music radios inside the studio by check it out now\nShe pumpkins and a new band called Pearl Jam and this week in twenty fourteen you two front man ... said he was sorry after their latest album was automatically added to the library's them all I can users\nAround the world saying the move was a drop of megalomaniac and a touch of generosity tycoons users complain that the eleventh songs they added to their music lottery without permission and then it was not clear how to delete them\nIt was a rare stumble for Apple to\nAn aquarium or in the front lines of wildlife conservation and inspired environmental stewardship amongst the millions of families that does it every year [noise]\nAnd no there isn't a bit of birth humane certified seal of approval from America will not give up until every species as a fighting chance for survival [noise]\nFind out more and help protect and preserve the amazing creatures that share our world [noise]\nOn Benson and ... [noise]\nSome bad news out of Afghanistan a deadly attack in what they call a green on blue attacks where Afghan security forces or armed personnel open fire at a meeting and actually\nKilled a couple of very significant leaders in Afghanistan they were Americans in the room\nIncluding the top us commander\nYeah tennis is not a good development at all joining us as Mike Baker who is a former covert operations officer with the CIA and he's the president and founder of diligence L L C a private intelligence firm frequent guest on Fox News good to have you here my thanks for joining us\nNo of course thank you thank you very much\nSo please tell us your analysis of\nThis attack what it says about the security situation in Afghanistan obviously does not speak highly of our ability to trust\nSome people potentially within a the Afghanistan forces to actually write do their job and was this an attack that was aimed at assassinating specific people where they coming after the Americans are the Afghans what are you hearing\nWell this is this is going to be put in context of of what's coming up on Saturday which is national elections and\nYou know there's been a series of bombings by the Taliban 'em and killings of of candidates and you know in in the sort of the the uh\nThe aftermath of that there's been a lot of civilians are killed and injured as well so\nWhat the Taliban trying to do is uh disrupt these elections or they've been postponed now for several years and primarily because of the security concerns and um so I this is I I Would look at this in that context as opposed to this was an attack purely on on U.S interests um\nThis was more of a desire for the Taliban to say this is not going to happen you are not going to get a stable somehow us influenced a pseudo democracy built here it's ... and that's what they're pushing against ... likely frankly in this jobs very cynical they're likely to succeed\nMike it does seem now they're getting so close the U.S commander a is not a good sign but but more broadly speaking to your point\nYou know we've been in Afghanistan and people can fight in Afghanistan who were not born on nine eleven that's how long we've been married you know very well\nAnd a lot of us are asking the question as I Know you are as I Know many in the government are what's the endgame what is the goal and what kind of footprint do we need to achieve that we are not likely going to make it into a functioning democracy so what should we be doing over there\nYeah no I I I agree with you a completely on that assessment ah I've been\nBeating the drum for years now saying that look we we went in after nine eleven we went and it was at a very very uh effective and efficient tactical operation there uh the Tora Bora operation um and that's what we're extremely good at\nIt and so at that point we should have my argument is we should have said fine that's it we've routed\nThe the that the core of the problem um and now if you allow outside elements like al ... or others to use your country and the same matter meeting to plot the planet and carry out attacks against the west will come back and do this or get\nRight but we're not going to stay here and nation build and try to sell you which we've been trying to do now for all these years some idea of a of a federal government\nAnd try to improve what the literacy rate by two or three percent I mean I I I guess\nI sound very cynical I say this but I don't care and that is not an ... that's not an insult to all all the incredible a brave men and women who have served there and everything that we put into that country it's just your point\nWhat exactly is our ... and where exactly do we think the Taliban are going to go they have no place else to go\nRight right and there and get their indigenous right it's not like al ... who set up shop there most you know many al ... members coming from other countries the Gulf and elsewhere and I I think it's just so hard because every administration Republican or democratic rights it's dealt with this comes and\nThey do is just a strategy review they're shifting explanations for what our goal should be and I just find it hard to to look these young men and women whether they're in the military at the CIA or the state department and say here's while you're going back\nAnd I sound cynical to I've I've moved much further than I had ever ban in terms of what we can achieve their by attacks like they should underscore the difficulty of cheating some of these so called goals\n[noise] um I've you know you kind of apologize you cut out there for a second because you're just repeat that\nOh I was just saying what's ... what's a reasonable amount of time to wait for this type of investigation to to conclude and why should we have confidence in the investigation if the Saudis are conducting it on themselves\nOh well I mean hey we're not relying just on the Saudis I mean that the folks that are claiming but you know it's ridiculous that were depending on just the Saudis to tell us what happened\nI don't understand how this this system this process works so we're working with a lot of our allies were working with the Turks were working with our own sources out there um US intel is and uh so we're not just depending on the Saudis handing over reporting saying well this is what happened that's not it's not how it was just going to play out\nAnd um I think anybody is saying that's what we're doing is just you know trying to take a swipe your part in the discussion um how much time does is take I I Would be surprised if if within the next five to seven business days we don't have a\nA an answer um how much of that comes as a parent in general to the public I think at this like almost all of it has to be made clear to the public because this has become such an important in national incident\nYeah great stuff might Baker former covert

I'm Marie harsh here with guy Benson and\nFox News has a new poll\nThat we just released I think yesterday evening\nTo you know a little under three weeks before the midterm so getting a lot of data as we head into the crucial election Chris Anderson president of Anderson Robbins research he's a Boston based democratic pollster and strategist a member of the Fox news election night decision team and the Democratic partner on this Fox News Paul\nSorry that was a very long intro but you've earned every piece of it ... is joining us on the line now to talk about this new poll thank you for being on the show\nI'm already thinks\nI can sell one interesting thing for me and this new poll crafts why is the fact that the generic ballot numbers haven't changed in the last Fox News Paul and what that indicated to me just from my lay persons reading that is that it seems like\nA lot of voters have made up their minds already is that am I reading it right or is there a different conclusion you took from it\n[noise] I well I'll tell you what I took from it which is it doesn't seem to matter too much what happens these days um you know it's been a pretty chaotic months if you think back what's happened since our last poll with the Supreme\nCourt only crafts that's ... yeah yeah so characterize it how you will but it's it's starting\nTo seem that that is being viewed as business as usual by voters so as there's the\nDaily I'm you know scandals um whatever you call it voters aren't being moved by that um yeah we did see\nPresident a President Trump's approval rating tick up just a little bit over the last month\nI'm looking underneath the top planet that's at white men largely who are a little more favorable towards them when they were last month but voters writ large at the national level they are they seem to be pretty locked in um\nYou know and of course this isn't a national election but um you know we're right in this zone right now where it does look like the midterms should be pretty good for Democrats but um it hasn't broken open either\nYeah so one thing that we've heard throughout this cycle from Republicans is national Republicans as if the president is in the mid forties\nThat's much better place for the party writ large than if he's in the low\nForties or even the high thirties 'cause you know over the summer there were times where he was flirting with on average being like thirty nine percent of real clear politics the new Fox poll has meant forty seven and the last number of polls last four polls in fact it real clear politics have him at forty five forty five\nForty seven forty seven what's the difference and is there a difference in terms of outcomes\nAre between a president who's entering the midterm cycle it let's say forty one percent versus forty five or forty six where does that make a difference if any\n[noise] yeah so where where it will make a\nDifference and where you know this election the midterms are going to play out or in you know fifty or sixty tossup districts um and we we did take a look at those we broke those out in our poll to see how they're different\nFrom a from the country overall in in general these are these are districts that went for Trump so there Ninety percent of them it's Republicans defending\nUm and ... and they're tight if if the bottom where to really fall out of Trump's approval rating like it ... it was getting towards that point um you know a few months back as you mentioned\nThan those might start to really um bread towards Democrats too and then then you're talking about a major wave\n'em you know right now that's not happening I'm you know you're seeing most models are still expecting Democrats will pick up you know the twenty four seats they need\n'em but at least looking at from the national level it doesn't look like it's going to be one of the Sioux nominees um that that folks were talking about as potential uh you know a few months ago\nChris one of the things I find interesting is that the top issue you found in this poll that is extremely important to their house vote wise healthcare fifty eight percent of people said that and that group prefers the Democratic candidate by twenty four point margin\nAnd at the same time a majority disapproved of how President Trump is handling health care you're seeing now more candidates particularly on the Democratic side talking about this issue\nAnd and a lot of us have had this feeling for months that this is really going to be a key issue given the fact that premiums are rising but talk us through um the fact that this is the most important issue in and some of the other pieces of that that piece of the puzzle\nSure [noise] yeah and like you said that is the issue that a lot of Democrats are trying to feature in their race and there's a really good reason for that which is [noise] Obamacare is suddenly popular um you know for years it was not and now it is um we we tested favorability on Obamacare\n[noise]\n\nCan you tell us this Burger King James bacteria that could cause kidney failure [noise] listen [noise]\nYeah [noise] [noise] you can't see\nIt either there's only one way to tell

investigation into the presumed murder of journalist ... the Saudi embassy in Turkey responded blustery me has\nTalking about like health care are they talking about the economy well what are they talking about in terms of other issues\nI think the reason that they get more attention with the Ronny Jackson being six months later because one out of every and\nResidents of Montana is either an active duty military member or a veteran and so things concerning new veteran a hospital and different kinds of veterans healthcare but typically do get an outsized amount of attention you hear that they might not get somewhere else or is it really does seem no\nMore than talking specifically about health care or the tax reform people were just talking about Trump they Jon Tester is a lawmaker who you know drop one here by twenty wife she has said that she\nIs willing to work with the president wherever\nThey can come to agreement but on things like\nA cabinet or tax reform or the skinny repeal types or hasn't been there and so the thing that we hear from voters on both sides is they just aren't sure whether or not\nHe is going to vote for Trump if he wins reelection or whether or not the kind of it's just saying that because he's trying to convince a bunch of Republicans that he can he can go both ways and he even said today he told us he doesn't think he's ever vote for a straight\nLine ticket he says he is very bipartisan or you know not always just voting for Democrats uh but I don't know just based on people that I've talked to here if people are convinced of that yeah\nYeah I mean it's I don't think it's much of a mystery of if he's not\nTaking bipartisan votes\nOn tough issues in an election year he's up I don't think he's likely to attack more to the right\nIf he's reelected I Would point out is not just Kevin I voted against justice Gorsuch as well which was an eyebrow raiser you mentioned Trump being sort of an all consuming political issue in the state of Montana he's flying in some presidential treatment that of course gets people excited\nWhat is his of course the crowd that is showing up and sort of selective they are going to be a bunch of big Trump fans but broadly speaking in the state of Montana the president wanted he carry Montana by double digits as you said Peter but\nHow is his approval rating in general sentiment about him in Montana now\nAre the places that we have banned that people\nSeem like they want a lawmaker who will at least consider voting with the president and that would that include\nI suppose that we were talking to Jon Tester of men do about two hours away from here earlier today you know people the thing that people want with Trump in the White House is just to know that their senators vote means something and that you know if\nIf something big comes up it could possibly impact Montana they want to know their\nCreditors going to be able to work with the president and so again that's coming from people at a drop of an added a test or a vet today the test or that obviously a smaller sample size because uh it should time of day and the profile but it is something that ...\n... you know where we have not really encountered part why people on either side trips and a lot of of driving around\nOur I live in Missoula, Montana is Peter do see Fox News correspondent the president will be there he'll be doing his thing on behalf of Republican Matt Rosendale who is trying to unseat Jon Tester in that race out there Peter appreciate your time tonight\n[noise] thanks guys thanks very\nThank you so this is an interesting race because Jon Tester is pretty popular\nBack at home um he's pretty he's in better position I think a lot of other Democrats that are running income states and the points that looks pretty good for him as you mentioned Matt Rosendale isn't particularly well known\nAlthough the polling is kind of non existent there hasn't been a poll in weeks in that race right so there's internal polling\nInternal polling yes and I think testers team feels you know like they say the real challenge but I think they feel you know cautiously optimistic um but at this point a lot of turnout game um but this is really interesting about Trump's there that you buy it that's why the president's there and\nAnd if they felt like I think you're right that if you know two years of college basketball analogy if this were a bubble race casters probably slightly on the happier side of the ... but he is right on the bubble and I think the Republicans that I'm hearing from\nAre seeing some data that suggests it is worth sending the president back to that state is worth spending new money in that state which they are also doing\n[noise] yeah and and we will see 'em you know it hasn't gotten much attention to some of the other line so who knows this could be what does that surprise races on election night but it's sort of feel like castor has\nHas the momentum I mean he came he is just such a ... I don't know I don't have the right word to describe it but he really is a man of the state like he's not one of these people that comes to Washington and you feel like lizards where he came from\nAnd if you look at some of that ad they're really good and it's an online spots there just he's kinda like who he is and I think people recognize there's a lot of authenticity there even though I don't like all of his votes and I don't think that is true for every politician\nI've been I've been urging the Republicans to\nFocus in on judges and make that a central issue because tester was overwhelmingly just a yes vote for Obama judges including the two Supreme Court justices one of whom voted against a fundamental right for people to own a hand guns in that Heller case\nWhere as he has voted against both of President Trump's pro Second Amendment\nJustice has a cabin on Gorsuch he's also done a lot of things to protect Second Amendment right but I I think that's so that's his inoculation where he's like look at my yeah votes on some of these gun issues and I think the response to that is on the courts where you say okay you can do the show votes but if you're\nGoing to show that there's ... and there's a lot of reasons you would vote against the court jester\nBut if you're going to vote to confirm someone who wants to approve the second amendment as we know it and then vote against two people who have the proper understanding of the second amendment is federally interviews of most Montanans ... a ... you know that's a serious vulnerability I think protest or and I just\nDon't think I think show votes is discounting all I think he's done and that he's done in this day I really do I think that he has a very strong record on guns and I you know that I personally don't love but that I think\nWe've got a D. rating from an All right well the n._r._a. has become a part is an organization I I'm Sorry I the n._r._a. has gone so far from where they used to be even ten years ago\nTwenty years ago so I think that Montanans aren't aren't going to take their vote you know they're not just going to take the n._r._a. and say I want to do whatever they say I think Montanans are pretty independent and they're going to look at the record and test or has a record to run on\n'em and we'll see this one though I I think you're right if it's on the bubble it's it's probably headed headed for tester but we'll see another place that those camps or pay money into the nutritional ...\nWell the national Republicans aren't but the Republican nominee is generally wealthy so he's Bob ... is his name and he is pouring in a lot of his own money into the race\nAnd he's only four million of his own money yeah it's a very expensive state New Jersey to run it yes because the media markets that you have to buy a ... yeah I mean it's breast brutal so\nHe's really pounding away and Bob Menendez who's a vulnerable in some ways for New Jersey is vulnerable incumbent I think he's going to win\nBut he'll get a blue state in this type of year a Bob Menendez would typically be up by twenty points as opposed to seven or eight points because he has lots of ethics problems and those ethics problems have been\nPart of the reason that he is struggling along although there's an interesting poll today\nTo New Jersey voters care about ethics problems well I mean I'm not trying to be funny\nBut you know so I was going to say there's an interesting poll today Chris Christie shows two thirds of the people of New Jersey\nOr or or like Ninety percent of the people are voters New Jersey say they're aware of his ethics problems but two thirds of those say this is sort of the type of corruption that most politicians do\nRight now I mean that's not true and I mean the the ethics smack down that Menendez got from the ethics committee in the Senate is pretty harsh based on what he did with that the owner of his who's now in federal prison uh but I think a lot of New Jersey voters sort of bacon into the cake\nAnd ... just making the case\nBasically not conceding that he's a crook but a lot of Democrats are saying vote for the crook she's not for Trump\nAnd that drives up Trump is like are arguably the cook as well but what's interesting guy is in some states that shouldn't be closer like Ohio where I'm from where Donald Trump won by ... he won by more in Ohio I think than he did in Texas or Arizona one of the states that that's Arizona maybe Texas\nI don't know what this up but it's definitely Georgia Sharon Brown is double digits ahead of his opponent it's not even a real race in a state like Pennsylvania\nCasey in print that's on a competitive race Minnesota so there's all these states that Donald Trump won that don't have competitive Senate races and then you have a state like New Jersey the Dutch and so it's a it's a large I call it\nCompetitive in the hopes that Texas has competitive like I don't\nFreeze the sloppy and so that was an interview with one of the women on CNN another one did a local interview where she said that no she feels like she's afraid for her own safety so it's\nAnd I understand the high camp campaign isn't they don't want to look like they're passing the buck and blaming the organization like they're ... they're saying the buck stops here we're taking responsibility because you like you have to do due diligence because you do but also there should be some something\nLike I Want to know what it would disorganization it because I also think they are I mean\nThey they share some blame but I think if you're going to put\nWomen's names who are survivors in an ad for your campaign you should make sure that they actually support your campaign and that they're okay with it\nIt's just it's I don't know how this gets published how this happened yeah and there's the other thing that's happening in the in the er Kramer campaign the Republican is pointing out one of the candidates are one of the high camp surrogates rather is\nNow out attacking some of these women on social media being like what are you doing\nKramer also has been attacking victims of sexual assault rhetorically for the last three weeks well Kramer is not the person can make this argument\nThat I don't think I think what the high camp campaign was trying to do is be like look at how insensitive he can be to victims and then they stepped in\nThis fight some surrogate who knows how much control they have that that's the challenge with African believe me I'm a and they should that person should not be a surrogate okay we're going to take a break we're going to come back right after this talk about Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan very [noise]\n\n\n\n\nCome\n\n[noise] just friday off somewhere

give us thank you very much\nSo please tell us your analysis of\nThis attack what it says about the security situation in Afghanistan obviously just not speak highly of our ability to trust\nSome people potentially within the Afghanistan forces to actually write do their job and was this attack that was aimed at assassinating specific people where they coming after the Americans are the Afghans what are you hearing\nWell this is this is going to be put in context of of what's coming up on Saturday which is national elections and\nYou know there have been a series of bombings by the Taliban 'em and killings of candidates in you know in in the sort of the ah [noise] the aftermath of that there's been a a lot of civilians are killed and injured as well so [noise]\nWhat the Taliban is trying to do is uh disrupt these elections or they've been postponed now for several years than primarily because of the security concerns and\nUm so I this is a I Would look at this in that context as opposed to this was an attack purely on on U.S interests um\nThis was more of a desire for the Taliban to say this is not\nGoing to happen you are not going to get a stable somehow us influenced a pseudo democracy build ... and that's what they're pushing against the likely frankly in the suburbs very cynical they're likely to succeed\nMike it does seem now they're getting so close the U.S commander a is not a good sign but but more broadly speaking to your point\nYou know we've been in Afghanistan that people can fight in Afghanistan who were not born on nine eleven that's how long we've been married you know very well and a lot of us are asking the question as I Know you are as I Know many in the government are\nWhat's the and the game what is the goal and what kind of footprint do we need to achieve that we are not likely going to make it into a functioning democracy so what should we be doing their\nYeah no I I I I agree with you a completely on that assessment or I've been\nBeating the drum for years now saying that look we we went in after nine eleven we went and it was at a very very uh effective and efficient tactical operation there are the Tora Bora operation um and that's what we're extremely good at\nRight and so at that point we should have my argument is we should have said fine that's it we've routed\nThe the that the core of the problem\nUm and now if you will allow outside elements like al ... or others to use your country and the same manner meaning to plot and planned and carry out attacks against the west will come back and do this again\nRight but we're not going to stay here and nation build and tried to sell you which we've been trying to do now for all these years some idea of a of a federal government\nAnd try to improve what the literacy rate by two or three percent I mean I I again I sound very cynical I say this but I don't care and that is not an ... that's not an insult to all all the incredible a brave men and women who have served there and everything that we put into that\nRich it's just your point what exactly is our ... and where exactly do we think the Taliban are going to go they have no place else to go\nRight right and there and getting their indigenous right it's not like al ... who set up shop there most you know many all kinds of numbers coming from other countries the Gulf and elsewhere and I I think it's just so hard because every administration Republican or democratic rights it's dealt with is comes and\nThey do is check and strategy review they're shifting explanations for what our goal should be and I just find it hard to get to look these young men and women whether they're in the military at the CIA or the state department and say here's while you're going back", "show_name":
