business over Nazi around and I made a point of this thing in the in the hall\nAnd they're just myself and the next day we had a meeting in our uh bachelor's residents without his back and forth and I said I've got an idea for you is about side so we're going to have this meeting\nAnd usually what happens is you say something and then somebody translates then I say something and somebody to translate take forever\nAnd it's not a good conversation we've got to set up where I Am a microphone and your microphone were both very or pieces interpreters and the other room and while you're talking I'm hearing the translation of what you're saying\nThen vice versa so we kind of a real conversation you get to know each other so that's great\nI sort of brush their brand was going to fall over again never regretted not getting something back but anyway that's what we did we got through I said how'd you like it is it's a great choice much we've got to know each other\nSo we got to know each other and going back to trust that they're kind of the ... we had lots of arguments bureau straight with each other know chapter that yes I can do that and so on so we developed a relationship of trust\nNow here's an example of what happened [noise] Afghanistan was a big issue\nThe Soviets were Afghanistan or trying to get them out\nAt one time or having a mere ... said I'd like to have a little private conversations said okay I said I just wanted to tell you that we have decided to pass that to leave Afghanistan we haven't decided when or when to announce it but we're going to leave\nI'm telling you this because I thought maybe I could work a little bit together and see how we might arranged us to minimize the loss of life as it happens\nSo that was a big time piece of information\nThat he told me that because he trusted me you know I was going to go over to the press the only person I told was President Reagan\nAs it turned out where it did work together and we did minimize the loss of life is I took Bush but that's just an example of how you can develop trust even run an adversary [noise]\nSecretary I Want to pick up on the story you just told because so much of your work at the state department wiped away then Soviet Union on a number of this year\nAnd there's a lot of discussion today about what our relationship with Russia should look like in the news is the idea that the administration may withdraw from the INS treaty a nuclear weapon that you work very hard on during your time at the state department that's just one piece\nThe relationship talk for a second about the overall relationship and this is Sheila how we deal with all of these nuclear weapons\nWell first of all President Reagan thought and I agreed with him that nuclear weapons are immoral the destructive power of a weapon is just unbelievable\nGarbage of felt the same way and the first meeting between regular garbage in Geneva they agreed quote a nuclear war can never be one I must never before\nAnd after that we had continued discussions of reductions in nuclear weapons\nIn the first one where we had an actual agreement was intermittent forces grand but aren't you notice the IMF treaty and that pretty we agreed to eliminate a whole class of weapons\nAnd that was something are covering it that nobody thought we could yet which was onsite inspections at people and they could see with our eyes what was happening there was a big do mhm\n[noise] so now we seem to be in a new era where people are adding to their nuclear weapon stockpiles there's lots of loose talk about those who are using them it's alarming\nAnd set of canceling the IMF treaty we should try to build on it\nWe say the Soviets are Russians are violating it well let's get together with them and see how we can put it back together again\nAnd let's invite other people to join us today I had I've traded start to build back the momentum that we had for getting control of these weapons before they get control of us\nDo you get the sense that ... and the Russians are interested in the kind of reduction that Gorbachev wise or or what do you think they're interested in looking at at this piece of their military puzzle\nI hardly know period I only about a month so I I don't want to try to space but he said on the record last October ... Soviet Russia was interested in negotiating for a nuclear weapons free world\nYou know everything is a sense that makes you wonder if he's up there but nevertheless he set it on the record so it's something to build on our nuclear posture review we say the same thing as a beginning\nBut then the rest of it is sort of takes it all back but nevertheless the restaurants are other record so I think we should try to follow up on them because if you have a nuclear exchange of any sort of say between India and Pakistan it's a global event\nHas very destructive to that we're trying to right now what I Would really be worried about is the north Korean nuclear program\nBecause I Would know that if that isn't got under control Japan will get a nuclear weapon South Korea will get a nuclear weapon they retire on it's not so difficult\nSo it's a very dangerous situation we're in a way out to try to get control of the\nSecretary sheltered seems like there's a lot of disagreement within America's current political parties about what\nNot just between the party but even within the party is what America's role in the world should look like and there is ambivalence I think there are some\nMoral uncertainty about that in both political realms and I'm Wondering based on your wealth and experience\nHow would you describe relatively specifically what America's role in the world ought to be in your view\nWell first let me look back\nAt the end of World War two\nSome gifted people who are names like through an addition Clayton Marshall they look back and what did they see\nThis tour of course the first one settled in rather than the fact of terms that up to the second they saw sixty million people were killed and the second World War\nThey saw the Holocaust this other Great

better world\nWho hasn't the U.S telling people what to do was collaborative there were forty four countries Britain would\nSo the smoke and I think it's fair to say that by the time the Cold War came

breath and say I said earlier what a chaotic world and we are part of it whether we like it or not so let's see if we can work to make it better than the things we can do and\nAnd last question for me you're working on a lot of these issues you mentioned official intelligent three D printing you are working here at Stanford and tackling these questions that my last question to you and can that calming you mentioned be put back together\nWell I don't know the answer to that but I Know that part of the answer is to try\nBecause it benefited everybody it wouldn't put together is actually the

guy Ben than we are broadcasting live from Stanford University at the Hoover Institution\nThank you so much to our wonderful house it's been a great week and we still have a day and a half\nBasically of show so be sure to keep tuning in and we have great cats don't lined up one of those is on the line now Tom Reynolds the Facebook spokesman he's been there for a couple of years works on election and policy related issues\nBefore that worked in Brock Obama's White House and worked on both Obama campaigns including twenty twelve or where I worked with him and full disclosure I town it's great to have you on the show\nMurray thanks so much uh I appreciate the invitation\nDefinitely well we're glad to have you we were at Facebook headquarters earlier this week where we got a glimpse of the war room\nThat isn't just focused on making sure the American elections you know are safe they're looking for fake news they're making sure election integrity is really at the top of the agenda also looking at Brazil because they have an election coming up\nTell our listeners a little bit about that effort that you are working on how Facebook is handling some of these issues just less than two weeks out from the mid term\nA happy to do that and let me start by saying I'm very sorry that I missed you guys but I Hope you enjoy the visit\nWe'd get a great great I I think first and foremost a Facebook recognizes how\nImportant elections are and and take very seriously the role of responsibility that we play um the war room that you visited\nA really represents sort of two years\nOf investments that the company has made a since twenty sixteen or in the people and in technology inside that war room we have about twenty teams that really represents a more than twenty thousand people across Facebook\nAcross what's up uh at Instagram you know the sort of Facebook family of apps weed out people they're such as our intelligence team researchers data scientist engineer's a policy experts\nAnd they're doing three things they're working on coordination or they're working on monitoring and they're working on ... response or if we should need to do that um\nThe reality is that when it when it comes to fighting bad actors we recognize it as an arms race and we didn't want to be ever vigilant and ever prepared a and that's why we stood up this initiative\nIn our war room about three weeks ago\nTom sometimes I think a natural tendency for organizations political parties et cetera is to fight the last war right so we saw what happened in twenty six ... military is quite frankly it totally\nUm we saw what happened in twenty sixteen and there's clearly a lot of distress about Russian interference and so on and so forth\nAre you guys are explain how you're trying to not only prevent\nPrevious mistakes were being replicated but also anticipating new threats and and new opportunities for people who are trying to undermine faith and institutions and that sort of thing how are you trying to have that off proactively\nYeah\nIt is a great question it's something we spent a lot of time on 'em first and foremost we look back at but what what will be best frankly in twenty sixteen because the reality is\nUm our security teams were looking for more traditional cyber threat\nOr the fishing expeditions on line now where hacking Facebook accounts are and ... and like other institutions um we did not recognize this new threats this these information operations which we later on covered\nUp so we went back and did a really robust post mortem on that\nAnd we made some strong changes including\nAuthorizations to who can by political advertising meaning you need to prove who you are and where are you are I'm so we kind of closed up those gaps are the same time we've been working on elections around the globe for the past two years and ... with everyone we're learning lessons then getting better\nWe're also doing sort of blue sky\nA scenario planning and thinking about exactly what is around the corner what are the ... that we can see and what we do is we try to try and teach our artificial intelligence and arm machine learning to better recognize some of these threats it's why we've gotten better at fighting fake accounts for example\nRight and that's important is those are big source of some of the misinformation and we see on the plot for a but it's something that we recognize it was never going to be done and we just need to continue getting better\nSo Tom what are some things that users will see right because a lot of what you do is invisible to the use your to the user you're weeding out fake accounts you are you in things on the back end but for example users now see more clearly who pays for political ads but what are some of the other things our listeners can lookouts\nWay overvalued I discussed this much more on my latest real money perspectives newsletter US Gold coins the most trusted\nAsset [noise] ...

... guy Benson here with Murray ... political editor of town hall dot com Fox News contributor she's a former State Department spokeswoman Fox News analyst so\nWe just spoke with a spokesman at Facebook on our program and we mentioned briefly that the two of us we're at Twitter headquarters downtown\nIn SF earlier today that we've been here long enough they can call it that at that although I'm not going to refer to highways as\nThe four oh five or the one oh one and that's what they do out here in Ninety five it's it's odd to me no doesn't so that I'm not I'm not going native ever California while we almost stopped in and out burger on the way that okay in and out burger might but we're running late so we did it\nIn and out burgers delicious and the weather is hard to argue I mean it's good in any case we went to Twitter and they invite invited us to speak to certain members of their workforce\nAbout cross partisan discussion how we do our show how we interact and try to have productive conversation and also a little bit about\nOur use or lack there of of their platform or people who\nFollow me on Twitter are well aware that I'm a\nFrequent user perhaps a power user at guy pie Benson can't forget the key right there it's very important that guy Bentsen as a liberal attorney who have really yeah oh my God that's amazing most of his tweets are him correcting people though my God that's amazing as I Do just just give it up give me a guy Benson but it's that guy the bench at this point\nAnd I've been part of Twitter I've been on Twitter for ten years now which is sort of credible thing\nAnd Murray as she has mentioned multiple times on the program what Twitter after leaving the Obama administration but there was an effort today and sort of fun it's like it's our Silicon Valley sweep while we're out here at Stanford visiting some of these places and when we're great great um\nBut there was a sort of a little bit of peer pressure now and lied to start\nAt so when I first had I had I went to a dinner with a small handful of people and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in Washington a couple of months ago and that was really when the peer pressure started and when it's the founder and CEO you're kind of like what do you say\nHe's looking at you with his mysterious eyes and he was like come back Murray\nAnd I'm like man I had a blank nothing in my mind to say um\nBut he made he made a good argument that because I've been Austin's January of two thousand Seventeen I Would actually be able to do a very interesting comparison from one point to another because when you're on and all the time you don't really notice all the changes\nUm but then today like in an audience in front of all these people who work for Twitter are person who is moderating it said when you get back on and I was like\nYeah kind of put you on the spot I forgot my password which is true and they're like I came to the right place will have someone help you and I was like well yeah you can't that's not an excuse when they actually legitimate excuse after that here with Jack I went home and tried to log on par or they're going to get in touch with you I think on that so we are but they're very\nThey're very nice and I genuinely think they are trying to figure out how you can have a better experience I genuinely do\nI think that's true I Would say this and I'm I'm happy that they invited us and I've gotten to know some of those folks and I really do like the platform even though sometimes it's you know it can get kind of sets poorly but I said that's not really Twitter's fault that is that is a reflection of us um and and the current state of affairs in our politics and our discourse but\nI Do think that I mentioned it in our interview just a moment ago with Tom Reynolds from Facebook\nYou can be extremely well meaning I Am concerned about the ideological tunnel vision out here at these hugely powerful institutions\nThat can just say they keep inviting you to speak to them and you're a conservative if they were so anti conservative\nI think that they're aware that they have a problem and they said that Jack in my exclusive interview with Jack Dorsey a number of months ago said that they got feedback from some of their right leaning employees saying we are a tiny minority and we do not feel free and open to actually express our views because of this culture\nAnd that's a problem and I think it's great to have\nMe show up every so often is sort of like a a relatively polite heartless conservative\nDeliver a slightly argue harmless I I think I relatively speaking I'm right and he's he's I'm the type of conservative who ... who won't rile up a bunch of angry liberals at Twitter and be like oh he seems reasonable but right you're not my low\nOr even or even people who are highly Clark more to my right ear combative like these are people that they also serve and there are a lot of Americans who\nAgree with those viewpoints and that sort of approach to debate\nAnd I just think that there is\nGoing to be some natural sort of selection of self selection of living in San Francisco big tech company it's going to be more left leaning folks but it is important to avoid group think\nAnd I think it's important to have not just tokens but a true commitment to not just looking like America quote unquote in the diversity sense checking various identity boxes but also how America thinks and I think there's a massive in balance\nI potentially I I think there is a challenge and they're aware of it I also have asked my conservative friends\nEverything is not um anti conservative fires right like every time something someone something happens or someone's the they they think they're not being promoted as much as someone else it's not all that Twitter hate conservatives writer times it's just they have to fix their algorithms for whatever reason\nI I just I think there are real issues and conservative there are focused on the real issues and not the ... like that then it's like every time they have to think that that's always where they take the conversation it's like well\nBelieve me there are plenty of conservative than what are they all used to know how to find me there's not like a lack of freedom of speech for them to me\nI I'm a conservative buddy who's gay and young and he set up a Twitter account for his own personal use and Twitter had a suggestion\nCarlos and they were Ninety five percent liberal and he's like he's like an issue and it has the antenna go well that's that's my only point and we had a

and critics of President Trump as people across the U.S on edge made while about how to find who is responsible continues when the Kenyan report\nTalk in the far right wing that these were a democratic false flag that there are Democrats who did this to try and blame Republicans right before the midterms\nI we don't know who did it yet but that kind of theory I find\nReally gross and I don't we can talk about that later but that is out there in the far right um but at this point it just\nThe rush in general to take a bad situation and find some way to cram it into your pre determined partisan narrative drives me crazy and won some people on the ... decided to do that particularly in this case\nTo blame is on the left\nIt just it ... and by the way yes after the school shooting there were some on the left blaming Trump blaming Republicans that sort of knee jerk partisanship is such a pet\nPeeve of mine particularly in these types of circumstances and you've written about this a lot yes on ... like a pretty consistent on this so\nMy thoughts on and I what I said do you as I think there's a middle ground here right I think we can have\nA smart discussion or debate about political rhetoric in this country about uh how he did things have gotten about what leaders say\nWithout knowing yet why this person did it I think we have to be able as adults and Americans to do both\nWithout assigning blame and I don't think that's like an a wink wink at assigning blame I think it's fair for us I mean look I've been defending on Fox News channel where I'm On TV on this show elsewhere\nYou know recently I've been asked to explain Hillary Clinton's comments or Eric Holder's comments or comments some on the right felt were\nUm threatening or that could be perceived as threatening by their followers\nFor just a rejection of civility in that kind of right\nAnd so that same\nThe same questions I get asked by the right on some of those comments I Want to now throw back at the right and say we don't know why this person did\nThis but we need to be able to talk about the fact that\nIn our country right now we demonize the opposition we question their motives and the leader of the country who I Want to be president for everyone calls his political opponents evil he calls for them to be locked up\nAnd I don't want to do a lot will but Democrats say bad things to I Want to talk first about the president because he's the president and he has the bully pulpit and I'm also happy to talk about Democrats but I I wanted to just focus on him for a second because\nHe came out last night didn't mentioned that CNN had also received a bomb and ... basically he the one group called on to be better\nWith the media\nI thought that was tone deaf at best\nHe criticized that and then this morning tweeted that the anger out there is because of\nThey didn't just call up and maybe talk that political figures and he talked about the ...\nBut the one group he criticized and said you guys need to do better and then this morning on Twitter said the anger out there is because of you was the media not even acknowledging that the media had in fact also received a bomb and had to evacuate so\nThe president\nI think has a responsibility not to say his opponents are anti American they're evil lock her up all pay your bills if you're if you get arrested for beating up protesters because he's the president and he had a\nHuge bully pulpit that people will listen to and if you say something that's so out there and you don't like all of his language either but if you say something that's so out there that that your followers here I mean his campaign sent out an anti CNN fundraising email two hours after they received a bomb\nPeople see that people who are who have\nProclivities towards violence see that and think oh I see the enemy\nThey're the enemy of the people like the president said and what do you do to your enemies you try and destroy them\nAnd so I think we need to be able to have the conversation even though we don't know all the facts about discourse in this country yeah I I I think it's a cop out to say we can't have it so we know all the\nOr the facts are important of course because we had a huge conversation about civility and discourse when Gabby Giffords was shot and it turned out to about\nShooting at nothing to do with civility or discourse it fit a narrative on ... I mean joining someone as well but he was a schizophrenia who was obsessed with her for completely a political reasons but we have this job\nI agree with our evil he says they hate America he said that they want\nGang members to come in and kill people and our and our policies are going to kill people we get that all the time and again I I I just I think that they\nDidn't give free and and I know you know that intellectually Trump is what we got a brand he we had a break but I Want to respond when we could you give friend and I just we have to be able to talk about this without assigning blame or being you know we have to be able to talk about it as as an adult I think\nWe have to break and you also have a drink and then I'll respond in the next second oh we're going to break\nIt might take me yes it is okay sorry we're going to break we'll be right back stay tend\n[noise] blood your voices be heard it called a three three four five six Thirteen hundred and talk to me

lesson in that um but anyway thank you for joining the show we are talking a lot today of course about\nThe what's happened in the past twenty four hours with bombs being sent to a number of democratic officials or celebrities who are credit\nCriticizing President Trump I'm sort of twenty four hours out now twenty five thirty six hours from when we first learned about that how are you viewing this situation what are your thoughts I just sort of want to get a level that from from you about about higher looking at what what's happened here [noise]\nWell you know in this case hits me I'm In a lot of ways I guess just because I have some sort of a I guess I have personal experience that that touches on a lot of aspects of it so I'm more interested in it from an investigative\nStandpoint than anything else yeah I mean I think that it's um as far as motive is concerned\nI I always think it's a mistake to get out in front of what we know number one and number two I I tend to look at this stuff as a lawyer who prosecuted terrorism cases it's not as somebody who does political analysis and I know in the\nIn the world of um of of political talking points and rhetoric and all that jazz um you know there's a lot of cavalier chargers being thrown around in\nA courtroom or incitement to mass murder attacks is a pretty serious thing is pretty serious business and your common sense tells you that\nYou know you may get riled up by somebody who is an expert demagogue but nobody goes out and commit mass murder on account of something that they heard at a political rally and that goes for you know political rallies of both sides I actually happened to be\nProbably one of the few people you'll\nDeal with it was actually convicted somebody of incitement\nAnd I can tell you it's really difficult it's a very hard proof of all the cases the all the charges that we hadn't or terrorism case it was probably the toughest set a charges in the case because of the value that we put on free speech in America\nUm you really have to you really have to satisfy a very hard burden 'em to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody a incited other people to mass murderer tax and we wouldn't have had the\nProof necessary to do that unless we could show that the\nThe the incendiary commands were being addressed to people who were steeped in an ideology that actually council violence\nAs part of the deal of moving the agenda without that there's no way we would have gotten um this guy convicted so I I kind of tend to tune out\nThe incitement stuff because I just think it's silly and well\nWhat I can I have been here for a second yeah of course on to that to the investigation I really want to get your thoughts on where the investigation heading you've done this for a living as you mentioned there though I'm not\nI'm not familiar with any Democrats at least I'm not arguing that like Donald Trump for example would mean a legal threshold for incitement\nIn there now a special responsibility that you think the president any president has two\nMore responsibly use language right and not call his political opponents opponents you know anti American not say that they should be locked up I mean is there a responsibility to fall short of legal responsibility in your mind can I Would argue that area [laughter]\nAll right but you're ... I think you're conflate in two different things um yes there is absolutely a responsibility\nOn the part of the president and I think it's a responsibility but this president of fall short on a very often not to engage in reprehensible rhetoric it's beneath the office and it shouldn't be done and even if it weren't\nLike go to class\nGo live in New York you can\nRead more\nThan I can play a game\nIn town to\nFrom your bank\nAccount\nAnd evidently mine\nMine close to me family\nThe mainland cannot find\nTime man\nNearby one\nGentleman how would you like to be able to order via guerilla vitro or see Alice in the comfort of your own home now just quick and easy as a phone call too meta med dot com just call eight hundred nine to nine twenty six Ninety nine and a couple of minutes over the phone will ask you a few questions pertaining to your health\nYour medical information will be reviewed by a doctor and upon approval your product will be shipped to your door\nIt's simple discreet and will save your time and money for as little as six dollars a dose you can order by ... or see Allison have it delivered to your home and three to five business days\nGone out eight hundred nine to nine twenty six Ninety nine or go to ... dot com ... dot com call eight hundred nine to nine twenty six Ninety nine call now and ask about the new revolutionary sibling or tablets the quicker and easier way of taking by I grab isn't it about time you drive by I ...\nJust called met them ads that eight hundred nine to nine twenty six Ninety nine that's eight hundred nine to nine twenty six Ninety nine or go to any da ... dot com [noise]\n\nAnd I try to have you traveled you waiting for them\nNot only by black person it puts on white Halloween fighting that kid that was okay as long as you're addressing other character Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry [noise]\nWas making Kelly our former colleague here at Fox News who's now for now at NBC it's the home stretch on Benson and ... thanks for listening back to back flips there one from earlier in the week on Megan this morning show on NBC and then the follow up the next day\nThe beginning of a lengthy apology they were having a discussion about Halloween costumes and black face and\nThis woman on a bravo reality show who was apparently dressed as she was not a black woman but she dresses Diana Ross and Megan Kelly was sort of defending it in asking about you know is it really so bad on Halloween where the whole point is to dress up as a character that created a firestorm\nIncluding inside NBC where they ran multiple segments on their shows attacking what she said including on the NBC nightly news which is sort of extraordinary she was ... by the president of that network of her OWN Network\nShe apologized the next day so that she did not fully appreciate the gravity of the history of blackface when she posed a question about Halloween\nBut the damage seem to have been done\nAt least ostensibly so at that point and after really dragging her for more than twenty four hours reports started to emerge from within NBC that\nShe's on the way out at that network yeah and they're gonna have to pay or a lotta money tens of millions of dollars as they reportedly cancel her morning show and severed ties this is not yet all confirmed but multiple sources\nAnd a lot there's a lot of leaks coming out about this which is sort of characterized her tenure there and she was a friend who she is a friend of both of us and she's a big part of the reason I'm ... I'm ... and\nYes it's important that we point out like we are fans\nWere friends she absolutely and uh since she's been an NBC it just feels like\nPeople haven't treated her while there\nAnd I don't I'm not going to face on I should just point out conversations with her I'm from the leaks that have come out from the sort of back stabbing that anonymous sources put out to various trade you know reporters who cover media even before she got here before she got there it just sort of feel like they didn't set her up for success\nAnd the guy we're talking about today I Am one of the most liberal people on issues of race on issues of what we say and how we talk about it I'm deeply offended for example by\nThe Elizabeth Warren the way people talk including the president about Elizabeth Warren like I Am very far including guys and yeah I remember I Am very far to the last time there\nI Am surprised and disappointed if this is the reason NBC is letting her go and I don't um\nI don't think it is I think this is excuse I think that's the reason they'll they will give\nUs which I think is a BS and I\nDon't think that that's fair um and I said you say I I think I Would feel that way even if I didn't know her and like her right I I just I I think we need to be able to we need to figure out how to ... issues of race when we talk about them publicly and this doesn't seem like if she's punished\nFor this in this way it doesn't seem like that's helpful to that conversation\nEspecially given the apology that she then put out on the air\nOn her own show and to have her own the tell to me was her OWN Network running multiple segments attacking her from inside the tent right the attacks were coming from inside the house\nOf NBC and I think the knives have been out for her there since before she arrived they didn't like her as a Fox a llama they didn't want her to fit in they were attacking her and grumbling and leaking to the press they were mad that she was not a sequel is enough\nAbout Matt Lauer who was accused of rape and left the network hit a button to lock the door on women under his desk she didn't do the whole\nFond farewell thing and NBC was mad at her over that so I think they were looking for any reason\nTo dump her yeah and\nIf they can dump her wall calling her a racist all the better yeah I think that's really gross I Do too\n... regardless of the fact that we know and like her I Do too and I'm a liberal like I'm not one of these people that um doesn't take these charges seriously I I don't you listen to\nAnd it's like really their people say much worse things\nOn television all the time and she apologized and she's\nI I don't know about hitting us again we were both kind of fire and I'm the hot topic but for now the lights are on the show is over thank you for listening to Benton Harbor\nLast night we put on an ethical light the crowd loved us we love the crowd and the only people than either for faces all eight of their eyes lit up brighter than ours\nAnd we're firefly\nThat one girl showed what she'd never seen glow in the dark like this before we invented glow in the dark and we're going to be out here every night Moroccan out our light showed a forest near you\nDo come out and bring your kid all ages show with a don't bring any of those glass jars 'cause they make a kind of nervous like last year whether\nYour ... your memories never face come alive with the forest cover the forest or to find a forest near you discover other cool thing to do when you have like ... or even\nThe fourth time for me to\nRun by the U.S Forest Service ad council\nTell I our radio you want to hear [noise] use the thumb up and some down by to let our programmers know how to make our radio sound our bed\nRemarried and pastime of baseball to new heights during his career and define the term sports hero in the forties and fifties Joe and Joe is known for the power of his daddy after World War two he became a national hero and even people who didn't like the New York Yankees like Joe the announced his retirement in Nineteen fifty two\nI said the last thing I did my last year I Wish you\nThe last year had ... and said you're much had been ...

was ever tripping out say\nWe're about to have a big meeting in Helsinki and we learned that he was bringing his wife [noise]\nSo my wife and I said we're going to have lots of arguments are these people at least we can be friends so she went out of her way to show Mrs Shriver Nazi around and I made a point of this thing in the in the hall\n... myself today we had a meeting in our best his residence we had this back and forth and I said I've got an idea for you is about side so we're going to have this meeting\nThey usually what happens is you say something and then somebody translates then I say something and somebody to translate takes forever\nAnd it's not a good conversation we've got to set up where I Am a microphone and your microphone we both area pieces interpreters and the other room and while you're talking I'm hearing the translation of what you're saying\nAnd vice versa so we got to have a real conversation and get to know each other they say that's great I sort of brush their brand was going to fall over and you never good at getting something back but anyway that's what we did we got through I said how'd you like a it's a great we've got much and we got to know each other\nSo we've got to know each other than going back to trust that they're kind of the ... we had lots of arguments bureau straight with each other you know I Can't do that yes I can do that and so on so we developed a relationship of trust now here's an example of what happened [noise]\nAfghanistan was a big issue\nThe Soviets were Afghanistan or trying to get them out [noise]\nAnd one time for having me he said I like to have a little private conversations said okay I just wanted to tell you that we have decided to pass that to leave Afghanistan\nWe haven't decided when or when to announce it but we're going to leave I'm telling you this because I thought maybe I could work a little bit together and see how we might arranged us to minimize the loss of life as it happened [noise]\nSo that was a big time piece of information that he told me that because he trusted me\nYou know I was going to go to the press the only person I told was President Reagan as it turned out where it did work together and we did minimize the loss of life is I took Bush but that's just an example of how you can develop trust even run an adversary [noise] Mr Secretary\nI Want to pick up on the story you just told because so much in your work at the state department white with then Soviet Union on a number of next year\nAnd there's a lot of discussion today about what our relationship with Russia should look like in the news is the idea that the administration may withdraw from the treaty a nuclear weapon that you're working very hard on during your time at the state department\nThat's just one piece of the relationship talk for a second about the overall relationship and this issue is how we deal with all of these nuclear weapons [noise]\nWell first of all President Reagan thought and I agreed with him so nuclear weapons are immoral the destructive power of a weapon is just unbelievable garbage of\nFelt the same way and the first meeting between regular garbage in Geneva they agreed quote a nuclear war can never be one and must never before\nAnd after that we had continued discussions of reductions in nuclear weapons in the first one where we had an actual agreement was the intermittent forces grand but I Do notice the IMF treaty that pretty we agreed to eliminate the whole class of weapons [noise]\nAnd that was something are covering it that nobody felt we could get which was onsite inspections that people and they could see with our eyes what was happening there was a big deal [noise] mhm [noise]\nSo now we seem to be in a new era where people are adding to their nuclear weapon stockpiles there's lots of loose talk about those who using them that's alarming\nSet of canceling the eye and after we should try to build on it\nWe say the Soviets are Russians are violent and well let's get together with them and see how we can put it back together again\nLots invite other people to join us today I had I've traded start to build back the momentum that we had for getting control of these weapons before they get control of us [noise] you\nGet the sense that ... and the Russians are interested in the kind of production that Gorbachev life or or what do you think they're interested in looking at this piece of their military puzzle\nI hardly know period I only about a month so I I don't want to try to space but he said on the record last October [noise] that's a Soviet Russia was interested in negotiating for a nuclear weapons free world [noise]\nSo everything is Simpson makes you wonder if he's up there but nevertheless he set it on the record so it's something to build on our nuclear posture review we say the same thing as a beginning\nBut then the rest of it is sort of takes it all back but nevertheless the restaurants are other record so I think we should try to follow up on them because if you have a nuclear exchange of any certain time between India and Pakistan it's a global event\nHas very distracted [noise] does our China right now what I Would really be worried about is the north Korea's nuclear program\nBecause I Would know that isn't going to under control Japan will get a nuclear weapon South Korea we got a nuclear weapon maybe Taiwan it's not so difficult\nSo it's a very dangerous situation we're in a way out to try to get control of the\nSecretary sheltered seems like there's a lot of disagreements within America's current political parties about what\nNot just between the party that even within the party is what America's role in the world should look like and there is ambivalence I think there are some moral uncertainty about that in both political realms and I'm Wondering based on your walls and experience\nHow would you describe relatively specifically what America's role in the world ought to be in your view\nFirst let me look back\nAt the end of World War two some gifted people who are names like through an actress in Clayton Marshall they look back and what did they see\nThis or too old wars the first one settled in rather than the fact of terms that up to the second\nPlace or sixty million people were killed the second World War\nI saw the Holocaust this other Great Depression and the currency manipulation of protectionism that aggravate a center themselves what a crummy world we are part of it whether we like it or not\nSo they set out to build a better world\nWasn't the U.S telling people what to do was collaborative there were forty four countries that Britain would [noise]\nSo the smoke the law and I think it's fair to say that by the time the Cold War came to an end there had been created a lot of leadership from the United states security and economic comment benefited everybody including us\nComments is falling apart and we also have a world that is being\nHit hard by the huge demographic changes are taking ...\nBy the emergence of artificial intelligence free printing which is out of the manufacturing these are revolutionary techniques are changing strikes at the same on all the information flows\nGovernors harder and harder actually have a big problem of\nUs and other countries in the world\nIt was time for us to talk to a preference I said earlier what a chaotic world\nAnd we are part of it whether we like it or not [noise] so let's see if we can were drawn measured better than there are things we should do and\nAnd last question for me you're working on a lot of these issues you mentioned artificial intelligence three D printing you are working here at Stanford on tackling some of these questions but my last question to you is can that calming you mentioned be put back together\nUm why we're back on air and we didn't talk about with campus wide I'm ... we didn't get to talk about the big news yesterday of these bombs were going to get to that today because guy and I've been thinking about it a lot\nYeah and it was in a huge news of the day we got to do it a bit with Amy Walter we ... we mentioned it I think in passing with ambassador McFaul yesterday but overall we couldn't really tackle it and we will very much\nIn the next hour of this program we also any McCarthy joining us who was a federal

to do that and let me start by saying I'm very sorry for the next you guys but I Hope you enjoy the visit\nWe'd get it All right great I I think first and foremost a Facebook recognizes how\nImportant elections are and and take very seriously the wool responsibility that we play um the war room that you've visited\nA really represent sort of two years\nOf investments that the company has made a twenty sixteen or in both people and in technology inside the war room we have about twenty teams\nThat really represents a more than twenty thousand people across Facebook across what's up uh at Instagram you know the best or Facebook family of apps\nWeed out people they're such as our intelligence team researchers data scientist engineer's a policy experts and they're doing ... things they're working on coordination\nOr they're working on monitoring and they're working on respond or it we should need to do that um\nThe reality is that when it when it comes to fighting bad actors we recognize that this was an ... and we didn't want to be vigilant and ever prepared a and that's why we stood up ...\nIn our war room about three weeks ago\nTom sometimes I think a natural tendency for organizations political parties et cetera is to fight the last war right so we saw what happened in twenty six ... military is quite frankly it totally\nUm we saw what happened in twenty sixteen and there's clearly a lot of distress about Russian interference and so on and so forth\nAre you guys are explain how you're trying to not only prevent previous mistakes were being replicated but also anticipating\nThe threats and and new opportunities for people who are trying to undermine faith in institutions and that sort of thing how are you trying to have that off proactively yeah\nIt's it's a great question and it's something we spent a lot of time on\n'em first and foremost we look back at what what what will be best frankly in twenty sixteen because the reality is\nUm our security teams were looking for more traditional cyber threats\nA fishing expeditions on line now where hacking Facebook accounts are and ... and like other institutions um we did not recognize this new threats this news information operations which we later on covered\nUp so we went back and did a really robust post mortem on that\nAnd we made some strong changes including authorizations to who can by political advertising\nMeaning you need to prove who you are and where are you are I'm so we kinda closed up those gaps for the same time we've been working on elections around the globe for the past two years and ... with everyone we're learning lessons then getting better we're also doing sort of blue sky a scenario planning\nAnd thinking about exactly what is around the corner what are the nets rats that we can see and what we do is we try to try and teach our\nArtificial intelligence and arm machine learning to better recognize some of these threats it's why we've gotten better at fighting fake accounts for example right and that's important is those are big source of some of the misinformation and we see on the platform\nOf but it's something that we recognize is never going to be done and we just need to continue getting better\n[noise] there Tom what are some things that users will see right because a lot of what you do is invisible to the use your to the user you're
