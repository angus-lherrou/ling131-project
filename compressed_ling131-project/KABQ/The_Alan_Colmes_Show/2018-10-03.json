probably right about tomorrow for town hall but I'm going to bring it to you guys here first and you probably recall on friday on the show\nI had gone to tweet storm friday morning and then wrote a piece for town hall more or less advocating the avenue that Jeff Flake ended up pursuing about calling for a limited duration discreet investigation by the FBI\nTo help erase certain public doubts or at least deal with them right confront them and deal with them on some level\nTo try to let some of the steam out of the pressure cooker because things really felt like\nOur politics was on the brink of exploding and ramming through a vote at that time was some wavering senators and a lot of independent voters not sure what to think in all the Kavanaugh polling there'd been a lot of undecided or not sure people and I just felt like this was a relatively harmless idea\nThat could help legitimize the process for some for a lot of casual observers and some lesson casual observers who happened to serve in the United States Senate there's a new poll out from Harvard and Harris\nThat asks about cabin on a bunch of other questions and one of the top line number as Murray was that sixty six percent of the American people support the decision from flake\nTo ask for a brief unlimited FBI investigation that sixty six percent includes eighty percent of Democrats sixty nine percent of independents\nAnd forty five percent of Republicans so almost half of Republicans are in favor of this idea and a super majority of independence to me I think this is\nSomewhat vindication for flake and I feel like it's backing up a lot of the logic an instinct that I brought to all of you guys on friday\nBecause I suspected that the polling numbers might end up looking like this and for people and I'll let you ... for people who might be saying on the Republican side of the conservative side saying well what does this achieve what does this get us in this poll\nIf the FBI does not turn up significant new corroboration support for Kavanaugh's confirmation jumps by roughly thirty points now there'll be you know narratives encounter narratives and I it might not be quite that clean but\nIn a lot of people's minds if the FBI comes back with nothing particularly new or damning\nThere will be an up tick in support for Kavanaugh and there will be much more I think comfort\nBroadly speaking with the process than if this had not happened and so there was a lot of negativity being directed at flake and to some extent or Chris Coons on the Democratic side they sort of brokered this\nI was supportive of it and I feel based on these numbers that are more convinced that it was the right thing [noise]\nYeah and I I heard and Jeff Flake this morning and Chris can speak at this Atlantic festival in Washington D. C. and I I think that beyond the specific\nDetails about the cabinet case that both of them felt setting aside again this is if the details that\nThe process was so broken and the Senate and that for both the Senate's\nCredibility and also for the Supreme Court's credibility [laughter] I'm like everyone\nNeeded to take a deep breath and they needed to take a step back and I you know you\nHear Jeff Flake and I think in the next day when I'll probably play a little bit of the audio from what he said this morning um he seems really greatly pained by all of this and I think he has been for some months I think he feels like a man without a party\nIn many ways and he's been quite honest that he could not have done this brokered this compromise if in fact he was running for reelection which is such a depressing thing to say Chris Coons this morning actually also said guy\nUm he was talking to his wife recently and said is this for say he's not up this year but he's up in tears I think and said like\nIs this war isn't it like what are we all dealing here and he came down the side of it is you have to keep trying to make it better but I think that\nUm [noise] there are a lot of reasons that our politics is like this now and I think it'll be interesting to see what happened to them in terms but just listening to flake ... this morning it they just like such a dying breed\nAnd I think that's depressing um but I think in this specific case they'd actually done it quite a surface to the country to the process\nUm to everyone involved I actually think they did the right thing it just shouldn't be this hard it felt\nSo hard and it shouldn't be I guess\nI also saw something intriguing the tunes said at that gathering you attended which was he floated the idea that we need to go back to an Arab and you know Ginsburg Justice Ginsburg um said something like this similar as well we could go back to an era where people from across the aisle vote\nFor appointees or nominees who are clearly qualified\nEven if you disagree with their philosophy he wanted to go back to that in a lot of people\nJumped all over that called and said well you voted against Neil Gorsuch who was you know on tainted by any of this and totally qualified and but ... and that's fine I think that's a fair critique of Coons but if he's looking ...\nTowards how we might get to a different place\nThat to me is one of the ways that we might be able to do it and it's useful and healthy I think for a democratic senator to be saying that out loud and in public and I bet you he'll be attacked on from the hard left for saying so just like Jeff Flake has been attacked by elements of the right for doing what he did um\nWhat was the I just have to I'm curious Murray before we move on being in the room with the two of them was that like a planned thing in advance or did this come together quickly because of this sort of alliance that formed in the last week and you\nKnow it's really interesting to the Atlantic magazine does this festival this Ideas Festival every year and I love it um I have some good friends who work there and I think it's just a wonderful event and the lineup has been set for weeks and Jeff Flake and Chris Coons are very good friends legitimately in real life and they work on a lot of issues together and they sort of do this road\nShow and they had signed up to do that I think they can from like a month ago oh wow this morning they actually made a joke and said I'm well you know thank you for giving us or something to talk about but no they they had agreed to do this a while ago\nBecause they are legitimate you know just like it has its line where he says you hear a lot of politicians say my friend on the other side right before they gouge you and he's like Chris ... and I are legitimately friends and you can tell that and they like having these conversations\nAre but obviously it took on much news ear a tone also a way because he spoke today Hillary Clinton spoke today I Kellyanne Conway spoke today I think when the grants tomorrow morning so it's just it's really interesting gathering of\nOf people here in Washington I'm Talking about you know some of these issues and actually I think yes addressing Kavanaugh but the whole goal is to go beyond the news of the day and that's hard sometimes but we'll see we'll see if it can happen\nAnd it's going to repeat for people out there for the doubters and it's okay to doubt me I'm not always right in fact I'm often wrong at least sometimes on this one I really feel like I got it right because one sixty six percent of the country favors hitting the pause button briefly\nThat can give a lot of solace to people or at least a sense of like OK\nThe deliberative body did something a little bit deliberative I understand all the context and background with the Democrats railed against it on the air I've written about it I just think it was the right thing to do and it has potentially\nBeneficial effects politically and also for the legitimacy of the court and if Kavanaugh is confirmed for his reputation and legacy so but we shall see and again the the number is also show if the FBI doesn't produce something significant or knew his support shoots up also in the ...\n... asks or the question to respond and ... mentions that the named witnesses body accusers do not corroborate\nTheir stories the some of the support rate also goes up by I think roughly twenty points you had to ... to fifty seven percent supporting confirmation so we're going to know soon enough\nWhat is in this FBI report I Hope maybe an assuming the both of the money is because it would be you I mean it would be a leak storm Murray\nOn everyone would be spinning it right at room would be picking out that things are helpful to them for their cause I think it would be a complete nightmare\nYeah so I I really do mental from Benson and horror to McConnell and Feinstein yeah like\nCome on let's and what what have we just gone through with thanks come on All right we'll take a break we'll come back and he wants to talk more on Jeff Flake\nOr I Want to talk about NBC and an

little bit from this story that Marie referenced before the break that I touched down at the very top of the show New York times came out on line just moments ago headline trope engaged in suspect tax schemes as he ... which is from his father is\nAlmost forty pages long I'm not going to read all of that just a couple of paragraphs here President Trump participated in dubious tax scheme during the Nineteen nineties including instances of outright fraud that greatly increased the fortune he received from his parents an investigation by the New York times has found\nMr Trump won the presidency proclaiming himself a self made billionaire and he has long insisted that his father the legendary New York city builder Fred Trump ...\nI'd almost no financial help but the times investigation based on a vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records reveals that Mr Trump received the equivalent today at least four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire starting when he was a toddler and continuing to this day\nMuch of this money came to Mr Trump because he helped his parents dodged taxes he and his siblings set up a sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents records in interviews show records indicate that Mr Trump helped his father take improper tax deductions worth millions more\nHe also help formulated strategy to undervalue his parents real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns sharply reducing the tax bill when those properties were transferred to him and his siblings the maneuvers met with little resistance from the Internal Revenue service interesting\nUh oh the story goes through in the Donald Trump's tax returns on the New York times printed denials\nI'm from Trump's lawyer and from the Trump family\nAre they going to say according to tax expert it is unlikely that Mr Trump would be vulnerable to criminal prosecution for helping his parents evade taxes because the X. happened long ago in our past the statute of limitations there is no time limit however no time with them I'll just repeat that no time limit on civil fines\nFor tax fraud last point here before we get to our guest\nTrump did say over and over again on the campaign trail talking about this joined successful business that he's built his empire he said I got a one million dollar loan\nFrom my dad that's it here's what the times finds\nBy age three by age three\nMr Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year and today dollar's twenty Eighteen dollars the father's empire he was a millionaire by age eight by the time and his father had given him part ownership of a fifty two unit apartment building\nSoon after Mr Trump graduated from college he was receiving the equivalent of one million dollars a year from his father the money increase would the years to more than five million dollars annually in his forties and fifties so I'm going to stop their\nUm we're going to probably have a big political debate about\nThe implications of this story if it goes anywhere in terms of civil penalties are but it will certainly reignite the argument that Marie has already made in\nThe background and yet it still want the tax return to all of them and\nJoining us now to help break this down and other things is Adrian ... former Clinton campaign director of strategic communications she and I were on Fox News channel or earlier today we tangled a bit on Kavanaugh Adrian welcome to the show\nHi guys great to be with you good to have you so let's just start here are you just heard me read a number of paragraph from this New York times story Murray\nInstantly went to the taxpayer tax returns point and I have to say your dream\nAs one of those annoying Republicans who said all along yes of course he should release his tax returns is was longstanding precedent to avoid exactly the sort of thing yeah I kind of like well you know this was a talking point that was repeated ad nauseam because\nThe kind of had a point at nausea Mm right\nRight yeah you know what guy we're going to agree on that slipped here's what we're learning wet or seemed to actually come to light now it's true is that Trump is not the self made billionaire he claimed to be during the campaign trail and that he continues to claim to this day\nI'm you know we had sort of looked into this on the campaign because first of all we didn't have access to the tax returns of course which he is still not released so we we we tried to sort of piece together a thrill you know various public facing documents real estate\nRecord on the you know any any sort of public basing document that would somehow you know cobbled together might give you an idea what his income status is and how much money he's made over the years and how much of that with self made versus how much he\nOn you know generated from his inheritance it was really hard to do but this this report an extent it's not surprising and I would bet that I have\nCalms uh eight and she's a former director of strategic communications for team Hillary Adrian thanks for joining us today\nThank you both so

finish line in a state where Republicans have a you know seven hundred fifty thousand million vote edge registration\nWe don't know um but certainly you know what's going on there was real I think so some of that stuff in in North Dakota I'm Israel as well but the reality is that the state that Trump won by twenty five points is well liked\nI think and respected by folks I I honestly I think this Kavanaugh stuff is really um is going to come into play particularly in those red state um you know where the Democratic incumbents\nAre so let's talk about that I'm just for one second I hate talking more about the cabin ice you and the patch songs out\nOf everything she signed the gossip I I I Want it to be over whatever happens but my I keep saying maybe this is splitting hairs too much that I think if he is approved if he is confirmed that that will help Democrats because I think that it's going to make people so angry\nThat they'll go out and vote I think if he's not\nRight and he's taken down by what seen is that is left wing conspiracy and then there was an open seat that's going to really fire Republicans because I feel like Republicans vote more on judicial issues than Democrats but this is my like back in the napkin theory how might this play I Know it's hard to say with specificity\nYeah signs look it it's certainly the case we've never even by sort of the new Trump being standards we haven't seen when we saw last week I sort of ... you saw liberals and progressive saying they were sobbing when she was testifying to touch them so deeply and then you heard\nConservatives and Republicans ... men and women saying that they were sobbing when Kavanaugh was defending himself\n'em and grandma and grandpa link and when you're going to guess oh so so it was a it was a real flashpoint moment right and you can argue round or square how it's going to affect the elections because you could say look if Kavanaugh goes down for whatever reason I suppose it depends on how he goes down sure a to a certain degree\nBut if he goes down the conservative base will be sued to spirited so upset that here they have they have control of the house and Senate and the presidency and they can't get their nominee through and these dirty tricks that they feel you know the the Democrats were were um is orchestrated dirty trick campaign succeeded\nAnd Republicans caves and rolled over its address and they'd be dispirited and it would be a bloodbath Republicans\nI'm or there's a theory that you say which it could fire them up yeah or the other interesting thing is so they're they've been fired up now\nBut Mitch McConnell is going to hold a vote on friday or Saturday or maybe it's delayed a day or two yeah and if he is confirmed input on the bench does that\nAnger dissipate for Republicans are they satisfied that they actually got their nominee through and they go back into sort of a ... comfortable mode less less angry less frustrated and how does that and you know hurt them perhaps in November ... electric soul you know five ...\n... it is that is five weeks away and and I think in the Senate races this is so directly related in the house races I think it's probably a little more\nI'm totally agree you know 'cause they don't vote on and obviously I Want to point out one of the real clear politics pull average it you have up on line right now direction of country fifty four percent say wrong track thirty nine point five percent say right track\nHow do you all look at that one specific question because I think that you know a lot of Republicans say the economy's great we got tax cuts and they're moving the right direction a lot of people still feel like they're not\nNo but if you look at that number it's as high as it's been in ... which one it is high the well the gap between the two the spread between the two right yes is as low as it's been in five years okay since Obama was reelected and twenty twelve basically almost six years um [noise] and so more\nPeople feel like it's on the right track now that yes there are still underwater more people\nYes um that's interesting and certainly you know you look at the NBC News Wall Street journal poll that came out last week sixty nine percent of people\nFeel the ... I'm very good or somewhat good about the economy that's the highest number it's been since Nineteen Ninety eight when Bill Clinton was in office midterms we saw what happened there right that number by the way that thirty nine percent spread between those two has tripled since Trump since April of last year\nIt's clearly the problem for Republicans is\nAnd I say this whole time voters don't vote out of gratitude they bowed out of fear and anger\nRight mhm and and frustration Democrats have all three of those and it's not going away yes I I feel all three of ... and Republicans don't and the other the other piece of it is that it's a double edged sword when people feel better about the economy feel more comfortable in their own personal situation\nThey start to turn their attention to other issues like health care which we've seen rising as the election mix like my education\nAnd so that's that's also why you've seen Republicans now changed their messaging from hey the economy is grateful for us to have the economy is great but if you vote for Democrats it goes away right and you'll see higher taxes and where he lives in Trump's been doing this Republican candidates have been doing is\nTrying to tell that messaging to something that will motivate their voters and their base which is fear\nWhich is fair and I think that motivates both parties quite frankly sure um I I think it's a human motivator in some ways I I Want to ask before we take a break here one race or\nOne state is that something you're focused on maybe even getting enough attention but you think it's a really interesting interesting wine whether it's a place where you think Republicans will win the Senate and a Democrat won the governor of that sort of my production on a place like Florida for example is there something near focus on\nWell so I Am going to I'm scheduled to and hopefully this you know\nCongresspeople schedule you know I'm scheduled to go a walk the district in campaign with Peter Roskam in Illinois sixth congressional district next week okay now he's a guy who is\nIf she loses his race and he's in a very tight race against shock cast and the Democrat yes remember Roskam one and two thousand six when Republicans got wiped out across the country and he beat Tammy Duckworth in that district she didn't live in the district but has backed by rama manual who was head of the DNC at the time or had tons of money tons of recognition\nAnd he's frankly worker and he's ... he's a great candidate yeah um but he's in a dog fighting\nSo I'm gonna go get a bird's eye view of that which I think is going to be really interesting\nI've seen a dog fight is it is it the wealth all tax today is that part of it\nIt's part of it it's it's a suburban district ... well educated voters they're so Trump has a problem but frankly and you mentioned this ties in to your point earlier his biggest problem right now is not necessarily Donald Trump it's Bruce Rauner oh interesting because Bruce run around getting killed by GB Pritzker right running for governor running for governor of Illinois\nAnd Bruce Rauner is a guy who he signed the century state law he uh was in favor of taxpayer funding for abortion I mean he has literally\nAngered the conservative base of the Republican Party new Illinois to to the extent it's still exists right that he got this challenge from Janine I was back in the primaries rice beat him and he spent or you know gobs of money dancing and so Republicans aren't motivated to turn around and so I think Republicans in or are gonna\nDown ticket are going to suffer because um because of that Governor first\nThough he loses if he is is that that says something right at my face shipping Michigan Liz Ryan rock\nAnd loses its it's going to be a bloodbath\n... yeah I think so so you're going to go out to the district and get a bird's eye view of what's happening on the ground talked to ... exactly how the fascinating it's going to be

Benson is in New York City where he'll be for most of this week and we are all both of us glad you're joining us tonight\nWe didn't have a chance yesterday to really dig in to the announcement from President Trump about the updated trade agreement with Mexico and Canada the new NAFTA\nSo we're going to take some time today to dig into some of the details because I think it's really important and a worst getting some answers on what exactly happened\nTo give us those answers we are joined now on the line by Scotland sitcom using the international trade attorney scholar at the Kato Institute check him out on Twitter at Scotland succumb he has been tweeting quite a lot about this and other trade related issues but specifically on this we're going to ask you about that tonight Scott thanks for joining the show\nIs reading about\nSo I'm going to quote from and you have a big tweet storm\nA that you ah put out on the new NAFTA the U.S and the a desert with one of those tweets you say big picture\nBy no means is is a perfect even great update to an old free trade agreement\nBut it's not devastating maintains free Amish trade in most goods and services modernize is and reduces uncertainty yes Trump cause the uncertainty but it's better than where we were two months ago\nThat is seems like a fairly a sort of common sense rational look at what happened yesterday can you expand on that a little bit for our listeners\nYeah sure I mean are they you know it's really important to understand where we where we're coming from a and there's really are the three three benchmarks for that the first is a a Trump world which NAFTA one point oh\nUp there and a TPP which was a very uh up an update to NAFTA 'cause Canada Mexico rent in agreement [noise]\nUm and I had a bunch of other countries as well like Japan and others um then you have to think about the the second is where we were just a few months ago um and um you know that was a a very tense period um where it really looks like and then I might not be anything I'm\nUh in terms of NAFTA um and that you know we could be I'm heading down a rather dark road of of no\nTrade agreement at all and then finally this this kind of half deal we had with us and Mexico and and so you know the\nIt with those in mind then you know our job\nOr is try to figure out what it what what is this agreement actually do and then how does it compare to those benchmarks are and you know I think honestly we're still working through it\nBut you know the big picture a ... you know remains as as you mentioned um if there are there are some some bad things in here there are some good things in here or whether you compare them to NAFTA one point oh or the TPP I'm\nBut I'm there you know unfortunately it took a lot of pain to get to where we are and we really you know we have to ask the question about well oh you really better off going down this road um than we were um you know without the TPP withdrawal\nYou sort of answer that ... well you answer that question you say it seemed obvious to me that the answer is no doubt\nExactly um and at that and the reason for that is that when you look at the deal and you compare it to what he did\nUm which is a lot of modernizing of a very old NAFTA which and then um some improvement in market access in Canada and Mexico I you realize that the the Trump in NAFTA to point no\nUm is a little bit better than TPP and a couple of places a little bit worse than the BPA in other places but all of those are pretty modest issues and overall\nGiven the tremendous amount of hostility and uncertainty and tariffs and the rest we we've had to go through and we're still going through quite frankly um to get\nA you know what is your point three four percent additional dairy market access in Canada which is the number I really just doesn't seem worth it\nYeah so we can debate whether it's worth going through all of this or a deal to get where we've landed I you know I think the three of us are mostly in agreement on this and we spoke to a few months ago on the show from a very critical posture these would be the president and his trade policies we're all free traders you especially\nI'm more than than either of us in terms of at least passion and expertise I guess the question would be if you could\nAnd I know it's not a perfect comparison but based on everything that you know so far and there's a lot to digest\nNAFTA one point out the previous agreement that Trump has really criticize harshly for a very long time versus what is shaping up to be\nDo

caught both of our attention Jason Kander is a young a\nDemocrat in Missouri he's a veteran he ran for US Senate two years ago in the twenty sixteen cycle\nAnd what's interesting about twenty sixteen is in almost every contested state the Republican Senate nominee out performed Donald Trump on the ballot in terms of votes or vote percentage one of the few exceptions to that was in Missouri\nWhere I think there is a good case to be made without Donald Trump Roy Blunt the Republican\nSenator would have lost because Jason Kander was running a very good campaign down there a but Trump shortage lifted all boats on the red side of the oil and blunt won reelection relatively narrowly\nSo Kander even in defeat was flagged as an up and comer within the party and he was going to be running for mayor of a city in Missouri and he made a person can do it in in Kansas City um\nHe made an announcement\nEarlier today that was very personal it also applies to his political career and Murray I Know that you brought this to my attention at first and I know you have that letter that he puts his supporters are put out to supporters in front of you\nYeah and I'm going to read a little bit from it and and Jason Kander like you said guys really I'd seen him speak at a number of democratic event he's really\nAn up and coming moderate democratic star um and this letter today is really heartbreaking I'm going to read a little bit from it he writes about four months ago I contacted the VA Veterans Affairs to get help\nIt had been about eleven years since I left Afghanistan as an army intelligence officer my tour over there still impacted me every day so many men and women who served our country did so much more than me and we're in so much more danger than I was on my four month tour I Can't have pie TST I told myself because I didn't earn it\nBut on some level I knew something was deeply wrong and that it hadn't felt that way before my deployment after eleven years of this I finally took a step toward dealing with it but I didn't step far enough\nHe talks to how he first went to the VA but then realizes that it's worse than he saw it and he said by all objective measures things have been going well for me the past few months his first book became a best seller he's been running this let America vote organization registering voters\nBut he writes I'm done hiding this from myself in front of the world when I wrote in my book that I was lucky to not have pie TST I was just trying to convince myself and I wasn't sharing the full picture I still have nightmares I Am depressed instead of dealing with these issues I've always tried to find a way around them\nBut he goes on to say after eleven years of trying to outrun depression and P TST symptoms I finally concluded that it's faster than me I have to stop running turn around and confront it\nHe says he went to the VA in Kansas City yesterday started the process to get regular help he will not be running for mayor\nAnd he says guy that he made the decision not to run for mayor but his next question was whether he would be public about the reason why and he said he decided to be public for two reasons first being honest will help him through this and second he helped hopes that helps veterans and everyone else across the country working through mental health issues\nRealized that you don't have to try to solve it on your own\nAnd guy as we both know there are so many Americans that have served in Iraq and Afghanistan more people are surviving wars but they're unseen often scars of war that really remained with these folks for for many many years in fact their entire lives so entertaining and heartfelt story coming out of Missouri\nNow and prayers to him and good for him that's right I Know it's tough for someone of that prominence to lay him so they're like that and he did it in that way for him on that note will say goodnight thanks for listening to fashion or\nOkay gang so chances are you'll never be an emergency ever ever again ... just in case let's talk about a plant okay so who's going to do what anyone uh yeah OK perfect we'll figure it out as we go so who is going

I Want to talk about their new polling out now that will probably right about tomorrow for town hall but I'm going to bring it to you guys here first and you probably recall on friday on the show\nI had gone to tweet storm friday morning and then wrote a piece for town hall more or less advocating the avenue that Jeff Flake ended up pursuing about calling for a limited duration discreet investigation by the FBI\nTo help erase certain public doubts or at least deal with them right confront them and deal with them on some level\nTo try to let some of the steam out of the pressure cooker because things really felt like\nOur politics was on the brink of exploding and ramming through a vote at that time with some wavering senators and a lot of independent voters not sure what to think in all the Kavanaugh polling there'd been a lot of undecided or not sure people and I just felt like this was a relatively harmless idea\nThat could help legitimize the process for some for a lot\nCasual observers and some lesson casual observers who happened to serve in the United States Senate there's a new poll out from Harvard and Harris\nThat asks about cabin on a bunch of other questions and one of the top line number as Murray was that sixty six percent of the American people support the decision from flake\nTo ask for a brief unlimited FBI investigation that sixty six percent includes eighty percent of Democrats sixty nine percent of independents and forty five percent of Republicans so almost half of Republicans are in favor of this idea and a super majority of independence\nTo me I think this is\nSomewhat vindication for flake and I feel like it's backing up a lot of the logic an instinct that I brought to all of you guys on friday\nBecause I suspected that the polling numbers might end up looking like this and for people and I'll let you ... for people who might be saying on the Republican side of the conservative side saying well what does this achieve what does this get us in this poll\nIf the FBI does not turn up significant new corroboration support for Kavanaugh's confirmation jumps by roughly thirty points now there'll be you know narratives encounter narratives and I might not be quite that clean but\nIn a lot of people's minds if the FBI comes back with nothing particularly new or damning there will be enough chicken support for Kavanaugh and there will be much more\nI think comfort broadly speaking with the process than if this had not happened and so there was a lot\nOf negativity being directed at flake and to some extent or Chris Coons on the Democratic side they sort of brokered this guy was supportive of it and I feel based on these numbers that\nAre more convinced that it was the right thing [noise]\nYeah and I I heard and Jeff Flake this morning and Chris can speak at this Atlantic festival in Washington DC and I I think that beyond the specific details\nAbout the cabinet case that both of them felt setting aside again this specific details\nThat the process was so broken and the Senate and that for both the Senate's\nCredibility and also for the Supreme Court's credibility [laughter] I'm like everyone\nNeeded to take a deep breath and they needed to take a step back and I\nYou know you hear Jeff Flake and I think in the next day when I'll probably play a little bit of the audio from what he said this morning um [noise] he seems really greatly pained by all of this and I think he has been for some months I think he feels like a man without a party\nIn many ways and he's been quite honest that he could not have done this brokered this compromise if in fact he was running for reelection which is such a depressing thing to say Chris Coons this morning actually also said guy\nUm he was talking to his wife recently and said is this for say he's not up this year but he's up in tears I think and said like\nIs this war isn't it like what are we doing here\nAnd he came down the side of it is you have to keep trying to make it better\nBut I think that um [noise] there are a lot of reasons that bar politics is like this now and I think it'll be interesting to see what happened to them in terms but just listening to flake ... this morning it they just like such a dying breed\nAnd I think that's depressing um but I think in this specific case they'd actually done it quite a surface to the country to the process\nUm to everyone involved I actually think they did the right thing it just shouldn't be this hard it felt\nSo hard and it shouldn't be I guess\nI also saw something intriguing the tuna said at that gathering that you attended which was he floated the idea that we need to go back to an Arab and you know Ginsburg Justice Ginsburg um said something like this similar as well we could go back to an era where people from across the aisle vote\nFor appointees or nominees who are clearly qualified\nEven if you disagree with their philosophy she wants to go back to that in a lot of people\nJumped all over that called and said well you voted against Neil Gorsuch who was you know on tainted by any of this and totally qualified and but then that's fine I think that's a fair critique of Coons but if he's looking ... actively\nTowards how we might get to a different place\nThat to me is one of the ways that we might be able to do it and it's useful and healthy I think for a democratic senator to be saying that out loud and in public and I bet you he'll be attacked from the hard left for saying so just like Jeff Flake has been attacked by elements of the right for doing what he did um\nWhat was the I just have to I'm curious Murray before we move on being in the room with the two of them was that like a planned thing in advance or did this come together quickly because of this sort of alliance that formed in the last\nWeek and you know it's really interesting to the Atlantic magazine does this festival this Ideas Festival every year and I love it um I have some good friends who work there and I think it's just a wonderful event and the lineup has been set for weeks and Jeff Flake and Chris Coons are very good friends legitimately in real life and they work on a lot of issues together and they sort of do this road\nShow and they had signed up to do that I think they can from like a month ago oh wow this morning they actually made a joke and said I'm well you know thank you for giving us or something to talk about but no they they had agreed to do this a while ago\nBecause they are legitimate you know just like it has its line where he says you hear a lot of politicians say my friend on the other side right before they gouge you and he's like Chris ... and I are legitimately friends and you can tell that and they like having these conversations\nAre but obviously it took on much news ear a tone also a way because he spoke today Hillary Clinton spoke today I Kellyanne Conway spoke today I think when the grants tomorrow morning so it's just this really interesting gathering of\nOf people here in Washington I'm Talking about you know some of these issues and actually I think yes addressing Kavanaugh but the whole goal is to go beyond the news of the day and that's hard sometimes but most will say if it can happen\nAnd it's going to repeat for people out there for the doubters and it's okay to doubt you know not always right in fact I'm often wrong at least sometimes on this one I really feel like I got it right because one sixty six percent of the country favors hitting the pause button briefly [noise]\nThat can give a lot of solace to people or at least a sense of like okay [noise]\nThe deliberative body did something a little bit deliberative I understand all the context and background with the Democrats railed against it on the air I've written about it I just think it was the right thing to do and it has potentially\nBeneficial effects politically and also for the legitimacy of the court and if Kavanaugh is confirmed for his reputation and legacy so but we shall see and again the the number is also show if the FBI doesn't produce something significant renew\nHis support shoots up also when the question asks or the question to respond and ... mentions that the named witnesses by the accusers do not corroborate\nTheir stories the some of the support rate also goes up by I think roughly twenty points you had to go to fifty seven percent supporting confirmation so we're going to know soon enough\nWhat is in this FBI report I Hope maybe of assuming Haley both of these 'cause it would be you I mean it would be a leak storm Murray one\nEveryone would be spending it right out room would be picking out the things that are helpful to them for their cause I think it would be a complete nightmare yeah so and I I really do\nMemo from Bentsen in ... after McConnell and Feinstein like come on with less than what what have we just gone through with thanks come on like All right we'll take a break we'll come back and he wants to talk more on Jeff Flake\nI Want to talk about NBC and an interview they did last night so much to get you on the program this evening

this story that Marie reference before the break that I touched on at the very top of the show New York times\nCame out on line just moments ago headline Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father is almost forty pages long I'm not going to read all of that just a couple of paragraphs year presidents\nAnd participated in dubious tax scheme during the Nineteen nineties including incidences of outright fraud that greatly increased the fortune he received from his parents an investigation by the New York times has found Mr Trump won the presidency proclaiming himself\nA self made billionaire and his long insisted that his father the legendary New York city builder Fred Trump\nProvide an almost no financial help but the times investigation based on a vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records reveals that Mr Trump received the equivalent today of at least four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire starting when he was a toddler and continuing to this day\nMuch of this money came to Mr Trump because he helped his parents dodged taxes Keenan sibling set up a sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents records in interviews show records indicate that Mr Trump helped his father take improper tax deductions worth millions more\nHe also help formulate a strategy to undervalue his parents real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns sharply reducing the tax bill when those properties were transferred to him and his siblings the maneuvers met with little resistance from the Internal Revenue service interesting\nUh oh the story goes through in the Donald Trump's tax returns the on the New York times printed denials\nI'm from Trump's lawyer and from the Trump family\nAre they going to say according to tax expert it is unlikely that Mr Trump would be vulnerable to criminal prosecution for helping his parents evade taxes because\nThe X. happened long ago in our past the statute of limitations there is no time limit however no time with them I'll just repeat that no time limit on civil fines for tax fraud last point here before we get to our gas [noise]\nTrump did say over and over again on the campaign trail talking about this giant successful business that he's built this empire he said I got a one million dollar loan\nFrom my dad that's it here's what the times finds\nBy age three by age three Mr Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year and today dollar's twenty Eighteen dollars to his father's empire he was a millionaire by age eight\nBy the guy and his father had given him part ownership of a fifty two unit apartment building soon after Mr Trump graduated from college he was receiving the equivalent of one million dollars a year from his father the money increased would the years to more than five million dollars annually in his forties and fifties scientists stuff there\nUm we're going to probably have a big political debate about\nThe implications of this story if it goes anywhere in terms of civil penalties are but it will certainly reignite the argument that Marie has already made in the\nBackground and yet it still want the tax return to all of them\nAnd joining us now to help break this down and other things is Adrian ... former Clinton campaign director of strategic communications she and I were on Fox News channel or earlier today we tangled a bit on Kavanaugh Adrian welcome to the show\nGuys great to be with you\nGood to have you so let's just start here are you just heard me read a number of paragraph from this New York times story Murray instantly went to the tax or a tax returns point and I have to say your dream\nAs one of those annoying Republicans who said all along yes of course he should release his tax returns this has long standing precedent to avoid exactly the sort of thing of like well you know this was a talking point that was repeated ad nauseam because\nThe kind of had a point at nausea Mm right\nRight yeah you know what guy we're going to agree on that slipped here's what we're learning wet or seemed to actually come to light now it's true is that Trump is not the self made billionaire he claimed a during the campaign trail and that he continues to claim to this day\nI'm you know we had sort of looked into this on the campaign because first of all we didn't have access to the tax returns of course which he has still not released so we we we tried to sort of piece together a thrill\nYou know various public facing documents real estate record on you know any any sort of public basing document that would somehow you know cobbled together might give you an idea of what his income status at and how much money he's made over the years and how much of that with south aid versus how much he\nAnd you know generated from his inheritance it was really hard to do but this this report to next and it's not surprising and I would bet that I have", "show_name": "The Alan Colmes Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "03"}
