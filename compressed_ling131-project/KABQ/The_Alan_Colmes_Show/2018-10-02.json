[noise]\nFor further I'll bet almost and they say that after it runs its course and the shooters ... electric short of a totally on about the Fisher no tradition of indefinite duration\nThere's two for two or three or four so I'm a social world all those calmer if you're listening carefully Mr President practically here the files of the Democrats moving with ... [noise]\nI agree with that but I still support the decision that was made\nFrom Senator flake he has the backing of a number of potentially undecided senators on both sides of the aisle\nI wouldn't call Kuhn as undecided but he was the one who struck the deal and the Judiciary Committee on friday with flake who was on television over the weekend he also made a few appearances over the weekend I Want to play Murray\nTwo clips Eighteen or Nineteen here they're both short where it's just explaining Jeff Flake explaining why he decided to go this direction and interestingly saying that he would not have done so if you were up for reelection listen to these two clips back to back from sixty minutes\nI don't think anybody expected him to um [noise]\nYou know what happened on friday to happen to a cancer that are that are there are just knew that we couldn't move forward that I couldn't move forward without having the pause button [noise] um because I Want to say\nFor instance elevator and watching it in committee and just thinking this is we're up in our country for Senator Flake you announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running or not attract a lot of church\nBecause politics has become too sharp too but there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for those anymore there's no incentive\nMurray today not all of the Democrats on the committee signed a letter saying that they don't think a week is going to be enough but notably absent from that list was Chris Coons who was the partner with Jeff Flake and all of this what do you what do you think of those answers there from like\nA I think Jeff Flake an incredibly honest uh he was at a couple of other public events today including one in New Hampshire tonight we should point out I Will actually be an event where he's speaking um tomorrow here in Washington DC\nI think Jeff Flake is speaking his mind and he's on the income bird by having to run again he was very honest when he says there's literally no way I could have done this if I was up for reelection which is a shocking admission and it depressing one\nUm I think you can see on his face both when he was confronted by those protesters and in these interviews that he genuinely\nUm ... conflicted in frustrated and and pain by what's happening you know this is the latest in a series of things he's done he wrote a book um that that he really thought was going to um lay out at a real\nConservative a point of view a following up on his ah work in the Senate but really laying out what he thought with a true conservative point of view and I think he's very critical of President Trump\nAnd I think he started that process just as an aside on that book when he assumed the next president was not going to be Donald Trump right then you have then you have to revise the book because the\nPrice drop on its and he just like whether you not or not you like his policies and I don't like many of them he's quite conservative I'm and I'm I'm clearly not he has a decent person it seems like from\nAll accounts he cares about the institution he cares about and I think we know also one of the things he said was he cares about the institution of the Supreme Court not just the Senate so\nTaking the time to do this with important not just for the Senate but for the Supreme Court and Jeff Flake is what more senators quite frankly should be like and I guess Chris Coons a lot of credit to you mentioned he didn't signed that letter today I think Chris Coons is also trying to find\nA some common ground so everyone can take a deep perhaps can look at the information can do their due diligence and then decide whether or not\nThey will vote for Brett Kavanaugh um I've actually been very impressed by Jeff Flake and I think that the fact that he doesn't feel like he has a place in the Republican Party today in terms of a lecture tour early in his own state I think is is sad and a lot of ways\nI Want to play also for you Murray or a statement here from Senator Hirono who is on the week on NBC on Sunday and here's what she said and cut twenty three talking about the state of play which she is called the FBI investigation is underway a sham here's what she says\nAgain they're not focusing on the credibility of the the these kind of all reports and it's all about why did somebody wait so long and all of that of the crux of the matter is\nThat these are serious allegations and we have been calling for an FBI investigation for ... months\nBut it wasn't months it has been days but they could have called for investigation months ago it's just really hard for me to swallow that from her also when she says that the Republicans don't seem to be focusing on the credibility of these reports it's all about why did someone wait so long I really I\nI agree with that well you just led a waste of why did they wait so long and not what the credibility a lot of Republicans and the hearing focused exceedingly\nOn the process and I said I don't think the process was done right um but if if Republicans who say well if we'd known two months ago we could have done an FBI investigation okay well then I Wish we had done two months ago but that doesn't negate the need for an FBI investigation of\nThe Democrats are so I think we're I think we're miss communicating on this merry because when when I hear him I Know I think we disagree on it [noise] let me explain why I think we're missing you know [laughter]\nWhen her owner says that the Republicans are focusing about why did someone wait so long I took that to me and that she was talking about Republicans questioning Dr Ford waiting Thirty years to tell anyone about the allegation\nWhich which goes to the substance of the question she might've been referencing Feinstein there\nWere no I don't think she was referencing Feinstein\nI don't think she was ... I think that Republicans have kept referencing the process\nSo when Iran was talking about why did someone wait so long she's referring to the Republican complain about Democrats not the questions about Dr Ford waiting Thirty years\nOh no I I wasn't commenting on her own oh\nSorry okay so I think we have missed communicated here we don't need to talk over each other and that's my point though is that I think um well I and I want to get into some of the details that I think we need to be resolved by the investigation maybe I can do that as a second\nBut when you brought up when you started that question you know it's hard when Democrats today say you know we need an investigation when we could have done in two months ago if they come forward with these allegations that is true but those two months don't suddenly negate the need for one is my point so if you would have supported it two months ago you should still support it today and I guess\nMy point and I do support this additional week to do it and I wish this had been done discreetly improperly long long ago instead of drop the way that it was after the hearings prior to the vote in a set of timing that very much smell suspicious to many many people um\nOkay so we're up on a break here Murray we're going to keep talking about this I Know you have some issues are that you want to have resolved ice\nOh I have a piece today a town hall dot com [noise] about some of the\nDiscrepancies and inconsistencies and Dr forwards story are going to the credibility and the substance of the claim\nMany of my points have since been buttressed by a memorandum put together by Rachel Mitchell the career prosecutor um who went through all the evidence and put out a five page memo that I think is extremely compelling and dispassionate so a lot to get you on this front we will get to it when we come back on Benson and ...\nYou can watch Jay marine for listening anywhere phones are dark um [noise] I'm On the air\nIs over there [noise]\nThat idea for an adventure new product do you think companies would be interested in your idea do you want to try to get a patent total bread help no your ... your idea confidential mother explains every step of adventure prosperous recreate professional materials representing your idea and submitted\nTo companies were looking for new ideas we\nHave more than nine thousand companies agreed to review ideas being confidence if a company shows interest in manufacturing your adventure we can negotiate on your behalf we have helped over ten thousand players was the ... we also offer services including breathing modeling an animation demonstrating\nYour idea typing services and we used to be our technology to show it been helpful I used to additional companies joy but dozens of people just like you you chose that helped to\nAround the the biggest thing I've\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell\nWhat we call\nRock and roll a Virginia west splitting take a trip back to this week in rock and roll history start off in Nineteen Seventy eight where the members of Aerosmith bell thirty bans out of jail after they were arrested for smoking pot during an Aerosmith concert at Fort Wayne coliseum soften them\nThis week in Nineteen eighty six popular news anchor Dan Rather was attacked by a man who hit them from behind him repeat the phrasing Kenneth what is the frequency prompting R.

C. today we're talking about\nKavanaugh and the controversy around his Supreme Court confirmation process which is still under way the FBI is interviewing a number of individuals over the course of the last few days with a vote coming up no later than friday according to Senate Republicans\nSo Murray and the previous segment you were talking about some of your questions that you have about cabin on terms of what he said about him anymore besides that\nSo is your son to start with about what he said about his drinking [noise] um I also have some questions or I have a piece out today a town hall dot com where I run through a number of\nDiscrepancies between a doctor for this story and previous generations of the story or things that were written down during her twenty twelve therapy sessions which is the only\n... hard corroboration we have of her talking about this uh which was Thirty years after the fact we're now thirty six years after the fact\nSome of these actually all four of these are outlined in a memorandum put together by ritual Mitchell the veterans sex crimes prosecutor who participated at the hearing on Thursday\nAnd to me I I feel like some of this stuff like you said some of this stuff going back to Kavanaugh goes to it feels a little bit nitpicky and silly but when you are trying to establish credibility and trying to evaluate some of the very little actual evidence we have in this case you have to look at this stuff\nSo an example being the Washington Post saw redacted elements of those therapy session notes\nAnd in those notes a Ford told her therapist with a therapist at least wrote down at Ford said that for boys had attacked her\nFor now says it was too and she says that was a mistake by law they're pissed who misunderstood the she met for boys at the party to attackers she has changed a number of people at the party and her recollection is well boys and girls how many of them were there several times she also said according to the Washington Post that this happened\nBack in twenty twelve she told her therapist that this happened to her in quote her late teens she now says it was when she was Fifteen which does not qualify as you were late teens\nThe Washington Post I mean okay that seems pretty flimsy I mean that is\nOne piece of this a different number of accusers late teens versus Fifteen in her first contact with the Washington Post back in July she texted to the post that this had happened to her in the mid eighties\nShe said to Feinstein that had happened in the early eighties\nShe says now is Nineteen eighty two and when she put together her statement that she was then going to read it for her polygraph test she wrote down early eighties and then crossed out the word early to just leave it in the eighties and then finally the fourth point as she said in her letter to Dianne Feinstein\nIn July that one of her memories of hiding in the bathroom was hearing her attackers talking to the other party goers um after the attack and under testimony under oath the other day she said that she does not remember that these are for\nDiscrepancies with in the timeline and details of the account based on the only thing we have here which is the memory of the accuser\n... making it up I don't think she's making it up then what do you think it is what what it is like what you're doing right now is trying to cast doubt\nOn her credibility and many sex assault and crimes prosecutors and attorneys and investigators were ... will tell you that there are certain memories they're indelible\nFor people and that some of the details are fuzzier and that that does not mean someone's not credible like what are you trying to prove here that she's making it up you\nKnow as I've said several times throughout this entire process Murray I Do not think this woman is coming out and lying and making something up out of whole cloth I think that human memory is a very tricky thing\nAnd because the only thing we have is her memory changes to the story within the last few months as accounted by Ford herself half to matter more than\nPerformance on the stand more than the emotion of all of this\nGoing through and looking at the differences\nAbsolutely is extremely relevant to this\nBecause it goes to human memory and my analysis of this was backed up at great length in this memo from Rachel Mitchell\nWho spent a career putting people behind bars for committing sex crimes and who was hired by the Republican yeah and she goes through and she says the word I've written in this memorandum or mine I fully stand by all of them\nCountered by multiple people who went to high school and college with him\nNo they said that he got drunk no one can know if he was blacked out that's all I can name my friends that blacked out from drinking so can you know they told you that they were blacked out process pow on out and blacking out is different Murray you Keith ...\nNo you haven't narrowed either\nNo you have an airedale you like cabin on the court no matter what it takes ... this is the deal Republicans made because they have Trump they got tax cuts and they got the court my point is passing out and blacking out motives motive in ... interesting no no no it's not motive and joining us now Jim exactly me too I think it's a\nPolitical not you it's a Republican political calculation I think they're so I guess black you know and passing out from drinking both mean that there are things you don't remember\nOkay and he was asked about both of them and when he was asked if he ever passed out he said no I fell asleep there are people on the record saying he wasn't truthful they're so again we have a bunch of people saying one thing and him saying something else and he wants to be on the Supreme Court

furious and is visibly furious response and they take that theory and say well now he doesn't have the temperament\nOr to do this job I think it's a very very cynical line of argument but I'm going to ask you this I went back and I watched it again over the weekend because this is something that's weighing on my mind\nI in retrospect agreed and understood why he did what he did the way he did it it resonated with me and I related to it\nGoing back I Wish he wouldn't have been wide as partisan in a few of the statements that he made clearly an anger about the Democrats about this being vengeance for an election that they didn't want to lose the Clintons so on and so forth\nIs there something of a point even if you say does not disqualifying did he go a little bit too far and should he at some point walk a little bit of this back\n[noise] I I must say I'm not I'm not their guy I mean it to my mind you know there's a lot of on attractive\nOr aspects of the of the human character a lot of things that we do where if we could be like perfectly objective and totally an emotional or we'd be unhappy with but you know I mean not to go all of a\nCollege philosophy right but but the\nAristotle tells us so you know you don't get it when when something is I'm a part of our\nCharacter in a part of our reality we ask what it's for right we don't say that it's bad enough that if ah if being furious as part of our character um we have that attribute because if it's useful for something and I think in this instance it was called for I mean you got a guy who was called a serial rapist\nOr some of the stuff that was put out about him forget about the stuff that just came out in the in the Senate hearing some of the stuff that was put out about him was just atrocious\nI thought that the moment I frankly thought that after I'm Dr Ford testified and the\nProsecutor that the Republicans brought into question her not confront the incoherent aspects of her story\nUm but he I I really thought he was not going to be confirmed I thought that ah she'd come off well enough\nThat it was pretty much over that I that I thought these wobbling senators would do\nThe other way and I thought his opening statement which ran for almost an hour\nGot him back in the game I mean I Know that uh that everybody's talking about Lindsey Graham speech and it was something of a a barn burner for sure but I think if if Kavanaugh had not given the opening statement that he gave\n'em we wouldn't even be talking about Lindsey Graham\nUm because the moment called for what he provided which was indignation and passion and a and a more shoveling of the facts that only somebody who was a good lawyer is he is\nA would be capable of doing under those circumstances so I don't I I really didn't have a problem with it\n[noise] and they ask you a question about what\nWhat could come what are the kinds of things that could come out of this investigation that would make you change your mind\nAbout whether Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed for example if it's proven that he was not truthful about something another network right now reporting that Brett Kavanaugh was trying to marshal friends and supporters that has to come out against the Vermeer is allegations before the New Yorker story published\nHe testified before Congress at the first he heard at the allegations was after published so we'll see it that proves to be true but are there are things they could come out of the investigation that might is there anything that might give you pause about Brett Kavanaugh\n[laughter] sure I mean if he if it if it emerged that he gave false testimony about something that was critically important sure and if it turns out that there was anything\nUm\nI think that if it turned out that there was anything to these allegations at the moment I think that they're they seem to be disintegrating but obviously if there was something to them uh then he shouldn't be he shouldn't be a ... in the uh on the Supreme Court he shouldn't be a federal judge\nOr I don't expect that to happen but I you know I I I ... I did this for a living for a long time and\nYou know what we always tell jurors you know people who have to decide as opposed to you know people in them than the peanut gallery like me [laughter]\nUm what we tell jurors is that they should hold their tongue\nAnd not express opinions even though there are many times during a trial when something will happen that you'll have a strong opinion about we always encourage jurors not to express themselves until the end when they've heard all the arguments and gotten instructed by the court because when you plant your feet\nAre just a in a human way it's very hard to walk it back when you see evidence that refuge what you thought was true so I think you know for people who are have to decide this\nUm if we're going to have this investigation I mean I wouldn't have had the investigation but if you're going to have it then you have to consider everything that comes in a way it and make a decision\nAndy you looted just a moment to go to the fact that you work for a long time a federal prosecutor\nAnd I referenced earlier in the show and I have a piece of a town hall dot com referencing this as well the five page memo put out by Rachel Mitchell who is the sex crimes prosecutor\nWho was there for the for the hearings last week she has gone through this\nEvidence backwards and forwards and she came out with the uh in my view a very compelling case about the weakness of the case against judge Kavanaugh have you read the memo do you agree with her analysis um and I'll leave it at that\nI've read about all I agree with her analysis but what really I must say annoys me about a guy is that\nUm [noise] I think that\nAmerica was riveted to this testimony this what turned out to be a TV event on I guess it was Thursday right\nYes um\nThink you know having just done this for a living it seems to me that she was conducting this hearing which was much more like a very contentious hearing or trial she was conducting it is that she was taking a deposition\nAnd it seemed to me in the moment that while the Democrats on the committee were showing that five minutes can be used in a very effective way you know you asked two or three pointed questions do you know they had the advantage of being sort of friendly questioner so they were taking\nMe to home tech makeover Best Buy is here to help them starting with the free and home confrontation once you find you the perfect tech we can deliver it makes a lot\nOf voices crepes on the bus [noise]\nWith open arms from career readiness to save space for why there\nNow more than ever donated vocal\nWah for better or read [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nUses Marilyn toward terrifying attractions one location designed to get by\nMembers of the law\nWhich showed that transfusions of blood products from younger animal could improve the health of older animals these articles also talk about research paid for by a California company called ambrosia\nThe company is offering to sell you for eight thousand dollars infusions of blood plasma taken for teenagers come to think of it maybe Buffy the Vampire Slayer needs to hear about this for more Health News go to Fox News health dot com how's call for help I'm joy Piazza Fox News [noise]\n[noise] ...\nCan you put the video game controller down for that\nI can talk and play oh I'm totally annihilating just punctured Nebraska\nI just feel like you're not acting like a grown up in our relationship to him to well you know yes still ride your keyboard to work there the comic book collection raise carbon\nLook I'm new at heart but I put money into my four one K. every paycheck I picked up a few savings tips that feed the pig dot org I have control of my financial life now and that feels pretty grown up\nAnd put away a few black via like a million bucks putting some money from every paycheck into a savings account alert contributing to your four O. one K. can make a big difference later for free ideas and easy tips on way to pay to go to the ...

Washington DC guy Benson to New York usually it's the reverse but uh this is what this week looks like for us I'm rocking Bruce I Know ruse we love our Bruce [noise]\nUm we are lucky to be joined on the line now by friend of the show and our brand ab Stoddard associate editor and columnist at real clear politics ab thank you for joining tonight\nThanks for having me guys so we're at the beginning of a week that um\nIs going to be I think a very tense there's going to be a lot going on uh the focus obviously of course a lot on Kavanaugh it felt like we all needed this weekend to sort of take a breath\nAnd recharge after the intensity of last week but give listeners a sense for how your viewing how this week might play out with the investigation to folks that might be interviewed by the FBI how do you sort of lay out what what we might see in the next few days\n[noise] right well I Do anticipate that we're going to see this come to a close on friday I think that we heard the majority leader or Mr McConnell today talking about how uh I mean he was very Vatican or they they made that clear last friday when they accepted this one weeks away an FBI investigation so it's\nGoing to wrap up there's been some discussion about maybe at wrapping up earlier than that and somebody you know some people suggest tomorrow with interviews are done\nIt really is going to come down\nTo the three senators I'm Jeff Flake Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins and whether they're comfortable with um the investigation and uh it can help them vote yes on friday and so they're going to have to be able to defend that process and that probe\nI'm In support of a yes vote to their constituents many of whom are\nUm you know begging them to vote no he is also many supporters obviously in their states who want to get across the country what about those\nThere's the well is Jeff Flake to vote yes so I I Do think we're going to have a long week it's going to drag out I don't think it'll just conclude rather quickly I think it'll go to friday but no longer than friday or the Democrats of course will you know they'll have\nLong list of people that the FBI should talk to you and they'll ask for extensions but it really comes down to the three senators and until and unless Mitch McConnell has their word that they can vote for\nJudge Kavanaugh um this has to be an investigation that they can defend\nRight maybe I Want to take a bigger picture look at this in terms of cause I think the details of this case in the facts matter immensely I've been writing about it quite a lot\nBut I'm looking at the polling today and it's almost exactly a pure partisan test at this point with virtually every Democrat believing the woman virtually every Republican believing the judge and the various questions at emanates from those judgments are rather predictable based on the our versus D\nYou also have a number of Democratic senators now seeing over the past week plus the burden of proof is on the accused I just see a very poisonous and toxic process I eat the judicial confirmation process getting\nMore divisive and toxic under this nominee and I'm Wondering if you see any way out of this spiral for the future\n[laughter] well I did think that an extension of a week with an FBI investigation was the right thing I thought that it was the quote due diligence that was required for senators\nMurkowski Collins and flake and senators hide camp and match it on the Democratic side to be able to get to likely yes votes because they could defend the process I agree what people don't understand\nWhen they're in our fishbowl following it at a granular level the way that we do with partisans all around us is it and most people who watch last week although the polling bears that what you're saying about the reactions to the testimony and who they believe people learned\nFrom watching that whole day people who are not partisans and are not\nIn this bubble they learned about mark judge and they learned about an FBI investigation they and so it was very hard\nFor the three senators I keep referencing to defend a vote last friday through committee and then a Saturday or Sunday or Monday vote for final passage final confirmation and swearing in of Brett Kavanaugh early this week after after all those questions were raised about the process so\nIt this ... this extension and this sort of bipartisan\nYou know deal to to do due diligence 'em and take a pause and follow up on on speaking mark judge not in a public setting not a subpoena but you know he was what who she

harbor guidance from the New York tonight I'll be on Kennedy show on Fox Business network coming up very shortly so pleased tune in on the TV screen\nI mentioned earlier and I want to revisit a piece that I wrote today at town hall dot com entitled discrepancy Kavanaugh accuser has said she was attacked in the mid Nineteen eighties and in her late teens differing from her account and I go through really for a significant\nInconsistencies\nIn her story in her memory this is not to attack or this is not to call her a liar this has to examine the only evidence that we actually have\nHer memory and her therapy notes and the contradictions between those two things are what led me to write this piece I wrote most of it\nYesterday I spent a lot of the weekend on this wasn't really much of a weekend frankly for me\nAnd then late yesterday out came this memorandum from Rachel Michel ... career sex kind crimes prosecutor from Arizona who did the Republican questioning for Dr Ford on Thursday\nShe put out this five page memo four Republican senators and I read through it and I found it extremely compelling and precise and measured and clinical\nIt was just passionate it was not a partisan document as some people have tried to dismiss it out and I just want to read for you I Know that I've made some of these points already but I I Want to read for you some of the most important things that\nThis prosecutor rights and may I remind you this is a woman who is dedicated to and a half decades of her life to putting people in jail\nWho commit crimes she was a prosecutor\nIf anything she's inclined to\nGo in that direction right not to be a defense attorney for judge Kavanaugh ... for anyone else she prosecutes\nSo here's what she writes this memorandum this was her opening contains my own independent assessment of Dr forge allegations based upon my independent review of the evidence and my ... nearly twenty five years of experience as a career prosecutor of sex related and other crimes in Arizona\nI was not pressured in any way to write this memorandum or to write any word in this memorandum with which I Do not fully agree the words written in this memorandum are mine and I fully stand by all of them while I'm a registered Republican I Am not a political or partisan person [noise]\nSo then she goes through she said here's my bottom line a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them\nFor the reasons discussed below I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard\nWhich means not only is it not cruel beyond a reasonable doubt which is the criminal standard the preponderance of standard is the civil standard\nIn other words the bottom line from Mitchell is this is not a case that could have been pursued criminally or civil e based on the evidence\nAnd then she goes through with bullet point after bullet proof point Egypt wishes really specified carefully\nDr Ford has not offered a consistent account of what of when the alleged assault happened Dr Ford has struggled to identify judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name Dr Ford has no memory of key details of the night in question details that could help corroborate her account\nDr Ford's account of the alleged assault has not been corroborated by any one she identified as having attended including her lifelong friend\nDr Ford has not offered a consistent account of the alleged assault Dr Ford has struggled to recall important recent events relating to her allegations and her testimony regarding recent events raises further questions about her memory\nIs a really thorough document I linked\nTo a town hall dot com facts and

I think Jeff Flake an incredibly honest uh he was at a couple of other public events today including one in New Hampshire tonight we should point out I Will actually be at an event where he's speaking um tomorrow here in Washington DC\nI think Jeff Flake is speaking his mind and he's on the income bird by having to run again he was very honest when he says there's literally no way I could have done this if I was up for reelection which is a shocking admission and it depressing one\nUm I think you can see on his face both when he was confronted by those protesters and in these interviews that he genuinely\nUm ... conflicted in frustrated in and pain by what's happening you know this is the latest in a series of things he's done he wrote a book um that that he really thought was going to um lay out a a real\nConservative a point of view a following up on his ah work in the Senate but really laying out what he thought what a true conservative point of view and I think he's very critical of President Trump and I think he started\nThat process just as an aside on that book when he assumed the next president was not going to be Donald Trump right then yeah then you have to revise the book because the price\nDrop all its and he just like whether you not or not you like his policies and I don't like many of them he's quite conservative I'm and I'm I'm clearly not he has a decent person it seemed like from\nAll accounts he cares about the institution he cares about and I think we know also one of the things he said was he cares about the institution of the Supreme Court not just the Senate so\nTaking the time to do this was important not just for the Senate but for the Supreme Court and Jeff Flake is what more senators quite frankly should be like and I guess Chris Coons a lot of credit to you mentioned he didn't find that letter today I think Chris Coons is also trying to find\nA some common ground so everyone can take a deep breath can look at the information can do their due diligence and then decide whether or not\nThey will vote for Brett Kavanaugh um I've actually been very impressed by Jeff Flake and I think that the fact that he doesn't feel like he has a place in the Republican Party today in terms of a lecture tour early in his own state I think is is sad and a lot of ways\nI Want to play also for you Murray or a statement here from Senator Hirono who is on the week on NBC on Sunday and here's what she said and cut twenty three talking about the state of play which she was called the FBI investigation is underway sham here's what she says\nAgain they're not focusing on the credibility of the the these kind of all reports and it's all about why did somebody ways how long and all of that the crux of the matter is\nThat these are serious allegations and we have been calling for an FBI investigation for ... months\nBut it wasn't months it has been days but they could have called for investigation months ago it's just really hard for me to swallow that from her also when she says that the Republicans don't seem to be focusing on the credibility of these reports it's all about why did someone wait so long I really I\nI agree with that well you just led with why did they wait so long and not what the credibility a lot of Republicans and the hearing focused exceedingly\nOn the process and I said I don't think the process was done right um but if if Republicans who say well if we'd known two months ago we could have done an FBI investigation okay well then\nI Wish we had known two months ago but that doesn't negate the need for an FBI investigation\nThe Democrats are so I think we're I think we're miss communicating on this Murray because when when I hear my young I think we disagree on it let me explain why I think we're missing [laughter]\nWhen her owner says that the Republicans are focusing about why did someone wait so long I took that to me and that she was talking about Republicans questioning Dr Ford waiting Thirty years to tell anyone about the allegation\nWhich which goes to the substance of the question she might have been referencing Feinstein there\nWere no I don't think she was referencing Feinstein\nI don't think she was ... I think that Republicans have kept referencing the process\nSo when her own was talking about why did someone wait so long she's referring to the Republican complained about Democrats not the questions about Dr Ford waiting Thirty years\nOh no I I wasn't commenting on her own now\nSorry okay so I think we have missed communicated here we don't need to talk over each other and that's my point though is that I think I'm ... and I want to get into some of the details that I think we need to be resolved by the investigation maybe I can do that as a second\nBut when you brought up when you started that question you know it's hard when Democrats today say you know we need an investigation when we could have done in two months ago if they come forward with these allegations that is true\nBut those two months don't suddenly negate the need for one is my point so if you would have supported it two months ago you should still support it today and I guess my\nPoint and I do support this additional week to do it and I wish this had been done discreetly improperly long long ago instead of drop the way that it was after the hearings prior to the vote in a set of timing that very much smell suspicious to many many people um\nOkay so we're up on a break here Murray we're going to keep talking about this I Know you have some issues that you want to have resolved I saw a piece today a town hall dot com [noise] about some of the\nDiscrepancies and inconsistencies and Dr Ford's story are going to the credibility and the substance of the claim\nMany of my points have since
