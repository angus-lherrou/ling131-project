welcome back\nTo Benson and ... on this Monday that was the voice of Geoffrey Myers the rabbi at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh where eleven people were murdered in cold blood at a baby naming ceremony on Saturday\nAnd I've been reading about some of the victims not going to say the perpetrators name we don't need to know\nMuch about him it's important for law enforcement to know what drove him and that sort of thing but these these people do not need any more notoriety\n'cause I think that's part of what inspires some of this stuff but some of his victims there was a doctor who was on the front lines of the AIDS epidemic in the seventies and eighties before age even had a name he was treating people with the disease\nShe'd devoted much of his life and his career to helping that community there was another would be victim who was running late that God tardiness in\nThis case saved her life she was a big Trump supporter and Republican there were people from across the political spectrum gathered in this house of worship on Saturday for a joyous occasion which turned into a nightmare because this\nHorrible beget decided that his conspiracy fueled hatred was reason to come in and exterminate some lives\nBecause of the background and the religion and the heritage of these victims and if that doesn't turn your stomach I don't know what will and\nYeah go ahead and go ahead no I was just going to say reading it's very difficult to read the stories of the victims they were all um there were no young victims right these are people who have lived a

air and getting choked up and that's a completely human reaction to have\nI mean can you can I mean is just unfathomable that you have a Ninety seven year old woman\nWho survived the systemic extermination of the Jewish people by the Nazi regime she comes to America where she is safe where she is free and in the very twilight years of her life\nShe was murdered by someone who share the exact same prejudice murderous prejudice as the Nazis did those decades earlier\nAnd there's there's I really really really struggle\nTo understand it hating an entire group of people so much that you're going to go kill them at random in a house of worship where they're celebrating the naming of a\nTrial I there's right then I Know and I have nothing\nIt's heartbreaking um there's not a lot of words to describe it\nAnd you will you know we're going to learn more about the gunman as this trial plays out as Matt sin told us we've learned more already about the man who sent fourteen pipe bombs which thank God didn't kill anyone or injure anyone\nUm but the the gunman in Pittsburgh any fueled by conspiracy theories about\nWho about this caravan heading towards the U.S it was all over social media about who is funding\nIt and I just think\nWe in the media we in public life you know there are people out there like that and they we cannot pedal in conspiracy theories or use them for political gain or or put them out there just as oh well what s\nBecause people hear them and take the crazy people hear them and take them seriously\nAnd I hope that the FBI as they would with any

for quite some time uh when it comes to this immediate point scoring and finger pointing part of me feels like it's easier for people to process being angry at their political opponents than it is for them to actually grapple with what has happened which in these cases are horrific\nSort of blood grumbling events are and I also think that some of it goes back to the apocalyptic nature of our political discourse which is absolutely not\nRelegated to one side of the other where you have political leaders and top commentators routinely\nBasically arguing that if the other side of the other

and then once the dust settled it just back to the same old demonization in ... motives and I wonder is there any way\nThat voters can signal that they actually care about this and one things to change in a way that's meaningful or durable I\nThink there's a lot of truth in that and uh I think going back to the earlier part of your comment\nIt's also true and and we know this historically that when people are confronted by a horrible event or they want to impose some kind of orderly this on them this is why people are attracted to conspiracy theories because\nIn in a weird way it's

always been attracted to conservatism because I thought about it stoic\nAnd and I'm less emotionally driven than liberalism I always thought it was kind of like a natural division between conservatives and liberals that conservatives tend to be kind of all all brain and no heart liberal tends to be all heart no brainer I mean that's a generalization but you know\nI think conservatives were an emotional and sometimes cruel\nAnd liberals work too emotional but not sometimes not logical\nThey've completely switch places I mean ... conservatives and Trump supporters in particular are are the most easily trigger human beings I've ever encountered in politics I mean they they fly off the handle\nAbout almost anything and I I'll just end this by saying\nI think it's because of their hearts they know they're wrong\nI mean I think a lot of this snowflake is among Trump's supporters is a guilty conscience uh because I had I saw a certain subset of Trump supporters I think now that

joining the shall again like you were\nSo we do that from the terms and I'm sure we'll probably get to that in a little while but um let's start with\nWhat we've seen over the past week or so um and not the question about blame because it as a lot of us have said blame life at the people who undertake the weather is sending pipe bombs or walking into a synagogue with Adam adequate and the blame lies that those people but\nI Want to get your thoughts on the broader question of discourse and specifically what you would want to see from the president in terms of a response he's been tweeting already again today about the enemy of the people being the press\n... dire who received one of the bombs if you are inviting him ... what would you tell him to do\nWhen it would be nice to think that the president could um\nFor oil and troubled waters here and be coming in unifying influence in the country [noise]\nI'm not sure that's in his skill set and I'm also not sure that given the uh the feelings about him among so many people\nIs that if he had a unifying message it would be heard now all I think he can do is to say soothing and unifying things denounce anti Semitism as he has no uncertain terms\nAnd hope for the best um I don't think the fact that he's going about his business being you know complaining as he does about the news media all the time and and I'm not sure he's on that he's correct in the way he phrases that\nBut I'm not sure that that's really relevant to the question of whether he's unifying the country are not um why not ... well for this reason [noise] um\n[noise] I don't think it's right to call to press the enemy owe them nine stream media the enemy of the people but I think it is correct acidity and they're the enemies of Trump because they most certainly have shown that\nUm there is a kind of coverage in a style of courage today Murray that we never used to see a in mainstream media outlets are the normal neutrality which used to govern coverage\nIs kind of out the window now and we see the most extraordinarily bald expressions of opinion in ordinary news stories um and it I think is is is very unfortunate\nBecause we're dealing with

and I have a disagreement on some level with our previous guest Tom Nichols about this even though I agree some of his points about Trump I think are very well taken at least for me I just think that\nIf you cannot recognize\nThe serious issues on your own side that have been stirring up this pot for a long time then you're a blind partisan and I'm I'm having trouble getting through to some

think it's the truth [noise] well\nI don't disagree with that guy I think one of the issues was Trump is that he thinks everything is about him right\nTo speak with a local senior living advisor

[noise]\nAnd Murray you know on\nA somewhat lighter note because there was a very\nTough show after another difficult day in America over the weekend I was actually in Napa Valley California on Saturday and my phone started blowing up with alerts about what happened in Pittsburgh and I had to make a choice in that moment because I was with the\nDear friends and people very close to me and I was either going to get sidetracked and sort of devote my attention to the breaking news or I was going to\nHave a special day that I had planned with some people that I Love and I decided to follow the news loosely on Saturday and then really read up\nAnd get engaged the next day and that's difficult to do but I think sometimes we're a mental health we have to compartmentalize some of this stuff even when you know\nA horror has has occurred and I ended up on Saturday managing to have a pretty cool experience in Napa with\nA number of folks including friend including family and you would have appreciated I think some of the wine\nOr the one portion of the day which was basically the ... the whole day um there was there was not much of a break in the wind drinking uh fortunately I was not driving and we talked on friday about as we always do about college football\nAnd I was able to find that so that I was able to watch the second half of the northwestern Wisconsin game\nAt one of these wind stops along the way so you can probably imagine as you were texting me you can probably imagine how guy Benson several glasses of wine in while watching northwestern upset Wisconsin to move into the\nAt least for now driver's seat in the Big Ten west how I was reacting to this and uh if if you can counter that up and your mind your probably exactly correct\nWell I hadn't seen the score because I flew home from San Francisco on Saturday afternoon and\nI had spent the morning I went for a really nice running around Stanford University was beautiful but that always Iranian ram yeah it's really a lovely and then saw the news and my heart just kept breaking I'm a very good friend of mine is is his family is is in\nThe Jewish community in Philadelphia and other friend and said they were sort of helping with that religious support for their friends and family in in Pittsburgh and then a number of folks that I Am close to have people that are in that neighborhood so it was a really terrible day\nUm and I get to the airport and I walk past a bar and they had your game on and I I actually think I screamed at sanity [laughter] um and sort of had to do a double take and then I ...\nUm and then I actually think they got to spend five hours on a plane where I didn't get news which was really nice um [noise]\nYeah I watched ... to the New Jersey and I watched an episode of Silicon Valley and that was a nice break from a really awful day but I Am really glad you guys had a nice time in Napa which I still had nothing to\nYeah well we're going to obviously change that at some point and death and lots of plans were being made this past weekend for exactly that but what a win and now\nNotre Dame this coming week and then a huge huge contests at Iowa the week after so

begin having those conversations where they should start because there was a lot of different directions to go I Know we are awaiting\nA correspondent here at Fox News who is in Pittsburgh who give us they live update as soon as we have that but Murray one of the things that has been\nHeartening to me is in the midst of such disheartening developments you've seen some really powerful uplifting statements for example from the rabbi of his congregation from a nearby Islamic center which raises raised right tens of\nThousands Seventy thousand dollars for their brothers and sisters and the Jewish community um there's this ongoing passed all ends of anti Semitism that I Want to talk about more later on\nThis ancient hatred that is really difficult for me to comprehend I mean any of these irrational hatred are very hard for\nNon hateful people to understand that anti Semitism\nIn particular is just baffling to me I saw a statistic over the weekend Murray that the Jewish population in the U.S constitutes less than two percent of our overall population and yet roughly fifty percent of all hate crimes\nYeah and no crime ridden substantially in the past ... days then number that they track has gone up quite a bit yeah\nAnd this is a problem thank God it's a relatively\nLimited problem in the United states which is no comfort whatsoever to the families of those grieving up the tree

depressing\nProblem and puzzle and one that there are not easy answers to and we're going to try to talk through them in a thoughtful way on the program tonight we begin though before we go any further\nWith a report from our friend mat fence Fox News national correspondent he is on the ground in Pittsburgh with the very latest on what is happening in that community Matt thank you for being here albeit under terrible circumstances what can you tell us what\nGuy today forty six year old Robert powers the man who police they shot and killed eleven people at a synagogue here in

of the complaints were quote Bowers commenter to one law enforcement officer\nThey're committing genocide to my people I just want to kill Jews sours repeated comments regarding genocide desire to kill Jewish people and not Jewish people must die tonight right now by ours is being held his federal custody without on\nSet to appear in court again on Thursday\nNeighbors of ours described them as a loan or sell it did not socialize with people that way because of his trucking job at people who have say he did not exhibit any signs of this pending massacre but according to police powers frequently expressed as extreme anti Semitism on line that I one website the forty tacky commented\nOn going in we're in Pittsburgh right now it's heavy\nIt's dark we talked to people who lost loved ones and friends they say there's nothing more cowardly than walking to a synagogue and shooting the place up President Trump and the first lady are scheduled to visit Pittsburgh tomorrow\nPresident Trump has condemned the mask or calling it a wicked crime Pennsylvania governor Tom with all the shooting at absolute tragedy and the mayor of Pittsburgh has asked people around the city to think first responders at police because officers on being stopped the heavily armed gunman that they\nUh come killing everyone anyone else when he exited the dog [noise]\nMatt I this is Marie thank you so much for joining a the show tonight I Know this is that really tough story to cover I Want to ask you about something you mentioned which is the gunman social media presence he was on a\nPlatform called gab I think that it's sort of like an all Twitter um and there are a lot of clues that the police are now looking through I mean it seems like the motive is fairly clear but they're really digging into his social media preference presidents now [noise]\nYes for sure you currently a you know was frequently commenting making extreme anti Semitic marks on Fox News we have not been able to independently confirm a lot of his social media presents because it's hard to\nSay how so afterwards exactly what was it was not coming from him but you know for example that last comment or as far as I said well you know we've already heard critics said well how could you ever um suggest that that would amount to what he was about to do so of course we're hearing that debate all over again over how um\nYou know how scrutinized people's social media should be or how how ... it should be an even the PC comic ongoing at well what does that mean right\nMind going anywhere right and to to to do what Matt uh you mentioned it's a very heavy\nAtmosphere understandably in the city of Pittsburgh and the surrounding area western Pennsylvania what are we hearing from faith leaders um Jews Christians Muslims what are the efforts that are underway to try to unify after something this mind bending Lee horrific [noise]\nNo I have to say on my way here on Saturday I was hearing the neighborhood of ... he'll be described as\nDiverse inclusive 'em up a place where everyone was accepted and when we got here there was an interfaith vigil where people are all denominations go I'll eat together and clearly\nEveryone was hurt and then you know at the synagogue yesterday we saw members of the Catholic Church nearby church come by and drop off flowers and so it seems like people of all they are deeply hurt by this we are seeing\nPeople of all ages nationalities orientations comic together in school on neighborhood and they are deeply hurt by this so I have to say to this table at least from my experience has lived up to its reputation of being diverse and inclusive as they are they are scarred by this body\nFox News national correspondent mats in live in Pittsburgh we appreciate your time and I met\nAny time that you're having it okay we're going to step aside and when we come back we're going to continue this discussion when we talk about anti Semitism going to talk about violence want to talk about reactions ah you know it's [noise]\nIt's so hard to hear that someone was professing this bio so openly\nAnd then acting on it and that's sometimes gets people thinking is this preventable and you know where can you wear kill authorities legitimately\nConnect hateful starch to the potential for hateful action is it possible to predict I mean these are really thorny difficult questions with civil liberties [noise]\nQuestions and concerns that get tied up into it we're going to try to tackle some of this stuff as best we can it's a new week and already a difficult one on Benton Harbor we will come back right after this break\nEdge and so without assigning blame I think it's incumbent upon everyone to do some self reflection and say okay are we covering stories right are we talking about issues correctly today Donald Trump tweeting the caravan is an invasion\n... they're sending thousands of troops to the border even though it's not going to reach the border if it ever does for two months\nUm and I I just I I Want all of us to have some self reflection\nOn how we talk about things because there are people out there who can be radicalized and\nI I just I think we need to treat this like any terrorists we would treat them and figure out how they get can become violent\nYeah and we know that this guy is attacked the president as well he thought the president was a Jew lover and the global list and all of that it sounds like he was a raging anti Semite for a very long time\nYeah I'm at the caravan appears to be what put him over the edge in terms of this violent act according to his own words\nYeah I mean it's the end but also he was he was rambling about genocide or the Jews committing genocide which is just such a deeply backwards and the Jews have been victims of genocide\nAnd I I really just keep coming back to the the question of anti Semitism such a tiny tiny fraction of the globe is Jewish and yet for centuries\nThey have been attacked and stereotyped and stigmatized and scapegoating\nFor all sorts of insane reasons for people looking to blame a group of people and you know so many of my very closest friends are Jewish one of my good buddies at Northwestern is rabbi\nAnd it's just beyond comprehension that someone would habits show twisted in his ... brain\nThat it's the Jews who are committing some sort of genocide and therefore as an act of quote unquote self defense of his people do to go shoot some elderly Jewish people for defense in a synagogue it's [noise]\nIt's it is crazy

know what drove him and that sort of thing but these these people do not need any more notoriety\n'cause I think that's part of what inspires some of this stuff but some of his victims and there was a doctor who was on the front lines of the AIDS epidemic in the seventies and eighties before age even had a name he was treating people with the disease\nDevoted much of his life and his career to helping that community\nThere was another would be victim who was running late thank God tardiness in this case saved her life\nShe was a big Trump supporter and Republican there were people from
