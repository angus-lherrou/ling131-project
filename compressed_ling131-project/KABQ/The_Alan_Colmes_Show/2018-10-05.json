a ... directs the direct response was how do we fight back against that money and that brings me to a direct question is how much money\nShould I contribute outta my modest I'm\nAll for natural resources and that was always I could never figure that out I mean how do you balance the how do you how do you measure fighting\nFor a while they're there they have more money they have had more money since uh since basically the late mid late eighties and you know when this thing really kicked into gear Reagan brought\nBrought these folks into the political world the actually the the thing that set it up for them was the Nineteen Seventy six Supreme Court decision Buckley versus the layoffs\nWhich for the first time in the history of the United states up until that point money in politics have been regulating fact in Nineteen oh seven Teddy Roosevelt got the children act passed that said that a hill corporations cannot give money to federal candidates it's illegal um ... you know this is what uh what's his name Tom DeLay down in Texas got nails four\nAnd a ... and with with the with this Buckley decision in Seventy six they blew that out of the water they they were peeled basically that decision or that or that law that federal law\nAnd stand then to see I don't even farther up and I'm Sorry go ahead\nI got it I I have a direct response here as well do you do now\nYeah

patriotism I can move past morality\nI figure it's just like the Koch brothers now I'm In the same position it's worth my while to invest one half to one percent\nBut my network ... and my wife and I shut out with an ... figure that out and not so much money we intend to country and our tribute okay to the Democratic ah either democratic candidates directly that ones that are real progress is door revolution or even to the Democratic party if I get that desperate [laughter]\nYeah if you if you're washing as worse where does that money most most effective it's most effective being given to

support political action committees ... has been very effective this is the or the remnants of the burning campaign and supporting progressive candidates all over the country and they're doing a great job there's other great organizations that are issues specific like move to amend or progressive Democrats or America pd American dot org um that are doing\nWork that are that are worthy of support

Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh writes that he quote might have been too emotional at times during his Senate testimony last week corresponded Caitlin cones reports\nHold my sources inside the White House knew this was his idea he wanted to come out and apologized for his demeanor last Thursday during that year and they got very\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs that true judge the difference between that you're kind of witnesses\nWhat depends what the issue is I mean it is the issue was he there at that party where Dr Ford says it was there or is the issue was he a heavy drinker and did he created a false impression that he was not\nYou know the worst thing that can happen to a judge has to be accused of bribery the second worst thing is to be accused of lying under oath or misleading interrogators under oath\nAnd the reason I keep saying misleading is because this two crimes here one Roger Clemens allegedly testifying falsely to a house committee about the contents of his urine that's really an issue under the constitution but that's what they asked him yeah he was indicted for perjury the indictment was thrown out why they forgot to administer the oath\nThen he was indicted for misleading Congress another crime that only applies to Congress that doesn't apply when you do this to a jury that's the issue that's here I mean Brett Kavanaugh paint himself as a choir boy in misleading way\nHe he said he drank to access sometimes and the cop to that he downplayed is drinking that is in my view not even close to perjury or criminal misleading and I think Murray one of the reasons why I think the scope of this investigation being relatively narrow speaking to mark judge for multiple hours apparently according to another network in a few other people is\nThe one of the primary arguments made by Democrats in favor of an FBI investigation which they said would be very short\nThey were talking about the Anita Hill Clarence Thomas precedent which was three days when they very limited number of people who were interviewed and this was honest and professor hill were interviewed above the FBI but it was before their testimony\nAnd so that's a very significant timeline difference one of the main arguments we heard over and over again was how can mark judge how can the other people said to have been\nSacked witnesses at this party by the accuser how could they not answer questions their letters from their lawyers to the committee under penalty of perjury not sufficient they need to answer questions as well\nYes I seemed like that was I was like All right that seems reasonable to me that's why I proposed this FBI investigation on friday that's why I support what they've done and I\nYou know I think at this point to keep saying it's not enough it's never enough it it does bring me back to my suspicion about the partisanship of\nThe heart is and now now I'm not a person I might not accusing you of being what I have that fear too that it's never enough which is why the decision about what is enough should not be made by the president or by Pat Leahy or by Chuck Grassley but by the professional interrogators themselves\nWithout putting limits on them the FBI they will tell you what's enough to somebody who has been the subject of an FBI investigation when I was nominated\nTo the federal bench by Ronald Reagan and who has ... read many of these interrogations it's amazing how open people they are how open people become in a non threatening conversational setting with a professional interrogator that's where they get their best information I Would like\nTo see 'em because the New York times reported that the White House instructed the FBI corner of the New York times sources that they could interview anyone that they saw fit and relevance\nI think that the FBI if they felt like their hands were completely tied and they couldn't do the type of investigation that they wanted to I've seen no indication of that we were told for days only the FBI can do this we must put this in the hands of the FBI the Judiciary Committee can't do it only the FBI\nAnd now you have Democrats are Democrat turning around and calling this a cover up saying the FBI's complicit in a cover up [laughter] I really have trouble swallowing that\nAt all from these people\nThese people including your friend and co host who cover up I'm not I was just going to say I'm not using that word cover up\nI think there are lingering questions about why more people were not interview\nWe have breaking news from Chad program on the healthy than Collins has come out at the care room where she's been reading she spent a couple of hours in there and what does she say had not yet reached at this age of our he can or if we continue waiting judge this is obviously have you\nI mean you've been following the court for so long you use obviously personally been involved in so much as as the judicial role your entire life\nHow do you feel just taking a step back and looking at the process of former Supreme Court justice come out today and faith based on ... ah you know demeanor he wouldn't support him being on the court things are different right\nAnd it's a good it's a good question I think this is the whole thing the way it's been handled by both parties has been damaging to the court\nI say that because of whispers that have made their way to me about the attitude of chief justice John Roberts somehow didn't speak with um personally I Am here with my own ear but a reason to believe these whispers or accurate and I know that the court terribly fears\nBeing perceived in the public as just another political institution\nWhich of course I Would argue profoundly it it's not it's not the duty of the court to do the people's will it to the duty of the court to interpret the law to talk with the constitution of to preserve our liberties from the tyranny of the majority it's the anti\nAnti democratic branch of government that's probably something oh they yeah that's probably something that the three of us agree on but I Do believe there's been an institutional damage to the court and I don't think it's going to go away overnight no matter how justice Kavanaugh rules or when he joined the other\nEnd I fear that there's institutional damage to the Senate Judiciary committee as well in this process that's another part of the judge I have to tell you the item ... Democrats who sat on this thing for two months and now and then demanded a short FBI investigation and so it's not thorough enough you did zero investigation of it during hurricane\nSat on Merrick Garland for over a year so that is so bad about\nSuch a such a completely different set of circumstances Marie\nI'm just saying this whole process has been broken for a while it just ...\nWhen you guys are going to ask Robert I'm for it started with Bork and then I went to two tier London now with Kavanaugh and we will see only\nOne of the three is likely while they got to obviously didn't make it on the quiet appears at this moment the judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed within the next forty eight hours for your protection\n... yes that was my first question and now we've got it judge Andrew ... co he's I don't want to be for Mr bent oh no no I I I've [noise] predictions are dangerous game in politics but you're going to head over to special report with Brett Baer on the Fox news channel coming up moments from now thanks for making some time for us\nAt that kind of I Love all my time with you guys who were such pros and it's such a delight to be with you better know in the same room with both of you know one of these days that's\nGoing to we got to make that happen All right thank you for your time and a tune in T.

right now and how divided our country is [noise]\nUm and I think it's a good time to talk about this and Christine and and our team who's who's on with us here I I Want to bring you guys in on this too because\nI said it's a lot of people for some reason and I have thoughts on why that is the Kavanaugh issue\nParticularly since the assault claims have come forward has been really really really hard for people\nTo talk across the political aisle right and you know I Do a show with a conservative and our whole goal here is to have debate across the aisle and to do it as friends and just stay friends at the end of it um\nBut for so many reasons this topic and and the way it's been handled has just really ignited so much passion on both sides\nAnd and you know a lot of our listeners I think support judge Kavanaugh on and may not believe Dr Ford\nI'm but I'm sort of imploring them to like ... everyone to take a step back and have some empathy for the other side here and I'm trying to do that right I Try and find grace\nAnd people I disagree with and in every situation and then and it's really hard sometimes but one of the things that bothered me the most is that for people who think judge Kavanaugh should be confirmed it there's just this anger\nAt people who don't and I know there are lots of reasons for that I'm not placing blame it's just this has been really really really hard and this morning when I woke up and went to get out of bed and I thought I just cannot do another day\nOf fighting about sexual assault on the air and what constituted it and how how much in wine and women should be believed and how we get due process and like I'm exhausted by it\nI have friends who've written columns in pieces on line on Facebook talking about their own sexual assaults feeling empowered to talk about them right now\nAnd for a lot of those women they finally feel like they can tell their story and they also feel like it's not going to make a\nDamn bit of difference you know in what happens and maybe it shouldn't\nBut some of them feel like it should and that's why this feels so personal it feels so raw it feels so emotional and I think that's also why a lot of people really recoil the how President Trump\nAppeared to mock Dr Ford the other night like the reason women don't come forward it because they not believed and they get mocked and to have the most powerful man in the world mocking this woman\nHaving the crowd laugh at her when she testified that the worst memory she has from her assault was being last that I I just the lack\nThe lack of empathy the cruelty and all of this is just getting to me and it got to meet today I think that's probably wireless nurse here like guy and are getting into some tough arguments and these are important issues we should have arguments about them but I just wanted to give a little sense for why it feels so\nI don't know\nNasty right now we on those lines are awaiting President Trump he's in Minnesota doing a rally later this evening we will follow that as well Christine ... you sent me this study that political divide in America is the worst it's ever been\nMhm none of us out that no I think I think it might be worse than two thousand Fifteen [noise] and I ...

confirmed I'm not okay with you making me and other women feel like\nWhat Dr Ford said like you have to listen to it enough to listen to it but you you really\nDiscount it and I I don't know how to\nI

mentioned in New York Murray harp in DC and joining us now is how we courage host of Fox News channels media buzz Sundays at eleven AM author of the book media madness you can find him on Twitter at Howard Kurtz how great to have you back\nYard so I Want to start with just a big picture question for you all the media coverage that you have been following very closely especially over the last week involving the cabinet controversy what's your assessment of its\nOverall\nI think in the early stages those attempt by many in the media to be fair uh particularly well we have the dramatic hearing Christian court judge Kavanaugh uh but I think in the last week or so it's completely gone off the rails it's first of all have the Raj\nOf stories about seemingly minor stuff bar ... book inscription trolling ice it someone\nUh it it almost seems like\nMuch of the mainstream media now became part of the stop\nCabinet or movement and then today with the wrapping up a cookie yard crow you almost since a bit of deflation yeah he was a kind of a total thing when you see many of these reports that something more damaging against governor wasn't turned up\nHow it's Murray here thank you for coming on again today obviously a lot of this story um well this is like the big story of the past few weeks and cable news has a lot of time to fill in a lot of news anchors have\nHave panels on them with opinion folks like guy and I do so there's a lot of different things at play here\nAnd I think to a lot of people on the left they would look at the coverage on CNN or MSNBC particularly which I Know it gets cut out a lot and say you know they're reporting things that are out there\nAnd yes some of them seem very minor but nothing nothing bake it happened right and this to end the story is the top story in part that's a that's a product of cable news maybe not their political persuasion how would you respond to that\nKnow things that are out there isn't good enough\nThat's not enough of a standard to report damaging allegations against somewhat opinion panels come onto this was the end of the Supreme Court as we know at the end of civilization as we noted for everyone knows gave up to fill and I include a lot of the stories that was as well but when you when you when the ... when NBC for example\nGets an interview with the so called sort of comes with Julie sweating to store it's completely solar or she\nChanges her story from what you said that after big but of course of course was totally played all this\nMy ... in my view and she said well recently she saw a spike the punch but he was only near the punch and nothing that really plays them a in the center of what had been the sensational you know as complicit with gang rape allegation I don't know that you put that on the air when you put that on the air you say\nThis knocked down the allegation so I understand is an effort to impugn or chip away probably a better way to put it it's a capitalist credibility and that's why you have these incidents symbolic did he drinks too much this time really again a bar fight that time by themselves especially stuff for like thirty five years ago it seems kind of ludicrous\nI get the point but when you have a barrage of such stories it really does reinforce those who don't trust the media thinking that\nWe collectively are on one side of this highly charged scotch\nAnd virtually none of the stories are covered goes and the other direction right it's you know al ... is it that a handful of places but not in the mainstream media how I Want to talk about the New Yorker because full disclosure I'm friends with Ronan Farrow or some of his work has been incredibly rigorous and thorough and impacts on the me too movement\nOr bringing down some very significant figures there was a story that came out about a week ago or so regarding the Ramirez allegation the Yale allegation from the woman who says she thinks it might have been him who exposed himself to hurt a drunken party in Nineteen eighty three but wasn't really sure it was him\nA and there was no corroboration at the time for people who were there they all did not corroborate people that she said we're in the room but in that New Yorker story\nThe previous one there was one piece of contemporaneous corroboration which was an anonymous person who remembers hearing about it the next day\nThere was a follow up to that article that came out last night also in the New Yorker that\nAmong other things\nTracked down or identified rather that anonymous here say witness from the previous story and he said that he didn't want to be named in the New Yorker last time because he wanted to get in touch with the person he thinks told him back in Nineteen eighty three that it had happened but he had been unable to get in touch with that guy\nThe New Yorker did track down that guy who says he doesn't remember this happening so the original corroboration quote and quote from the last New Yorker story is now just completely blown up by the new New Yorker story\nTo buy me anchors of Fox News radio driving out to your perspective of news you won't find anywhere I'm going to be

truck home\nOn ... thanks for listening that was just a set of highlights from last night's game the wild card game winner take all moving on to the division series the loser went home and in this case the loser\nWas Oakland and my Yankees prevailed there was a very exciting game or a I mentioned on the show last night that I was very lucky to get tickets from a friend my friend Michael big banks to him we just like contacted me yesterday and said hey do you want these I said oh and your brother went with you didn't yes he did I stuff and we had such a fun time\nAnd I've been to one Yankees game in my life with you and your brother it was and one of our colleagues here at Fox and the Yankees lost that game sadly but they won last night and I will say\nThere is something extra special about Yankee Stadium in the playoffs it was amped up like crazy the first out of the game was a strike out\nAnd the place was exploded in town and I'm like\nThat's that's the first out of twenty seven you guys like we can't sustain this degree of insanity for the entire nine innings and it did it low in the mid ... a little bit in the Yankees pulled away but that first inning and then the Aaron Judge home run it was just deafening and it was a great deal of fun um\nAnd they're just electric so that was a an unexpected pleasant surprise last night to be able to be there in person and now of course the Yankees have to go on and play the Boston Red Sox the best team in baseball and the best of five starting up at Fenway\nThe crowd was chanting at the end of the game we want Boston now but I don't know do we really want to Boston I mean we'll take Boston you know it's good that we're investing and it it would be nice to beat them but they're what they want what a hundred and eight games or something that is not a team that I think anyone should be eager to play no\nBut that's like Yankee confidence right there that is a bank and it it's like beating your rival in the play off\nAs a big deal oh it's it would it's like Ohio State Michigan right but if it was if it were possible for Ohio State in Michigan the plane the Big Ten championship game which is not because of the nation\nAnd interestingly it used to before there were divisions the Ohio State Michigan game like more often than not tended to be the pay ten championship ... right before we went to the stupid division thing which I hate oh you don't like the division I hate that division you don't like the championship game\nUh I like the championship game we want it twice both over Wisconsin but the divisions are very uneven late for the last few years Ohio state's division is much better than Wisconsin's division and so like the top two teams in Ohio State division should go to the Big Ten championship you have Penn State you have Michigan you at Michigan State\nThe Wisconsin keeps getting its butt kicked because they're just not evenly divided and that's really hard to do\nOver the long term but I think there are a lot of like fans at Penn State for example who think well you know\nEven if we we should go to the Big Ten championship against Ohio State if they went out yeah no I hate it I hate it and I hate the whole concept of whether we champions should be the ones to go to the football playoff but my digressing\nGrow up and if you're Alabama you don't have to be your division champion you go to a playwright way up to the ad I mentioned that every time because it drives me nuts that that was allowed to happen even though they were clearly the best team in one of the whole thing like you got to earn it and they didn't but then well this is the problem\nWith the champion with the way the system is right now at the four team playoff if there were an Eighteen playoff there would be less pressure to take the major conference champions and it would really be the eight I think the eighth best it'd\nBe an interesting debate to have about adding another round a playoff by the way I think it would be perfect very quickly you were at the Atlantic vessel that wrapped up fun time overall\nYes it was great you know it's a great three day event where yes there's a lot of current politics but you also get to take a step back and do a deep dive on issues like today with it the race and justice summit all afternoon had some really interesting discussions about longer term issues it's really nice to be talking about something besides Cavanaugh\nI hear ya [laughter] uh well we're going to talk about it again tomorrow though it will be friday at least ...\nLast night we put on the lights you when you can join the crowd loved us we love the crowd of people out there either\nFor faces all their eyes lit up brighter than ours\nAnd we're firefly\nThat one girl shoot what she'd never seen glow in the dark like this before and we in the glow in the dark and we're going to be out here every night Moroccan out or like show in a forest near you\nWill

talked dot com to find out more [noise]\nCombination vote blaming China runaway apprentice senators still studying an FBI report on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as they gear up for the first of two important votes when the Kenyan reporter\nI mean we know any more now than we knew we could go answer no\nJudge I ah and and you've been outspoken on TV about this today and they are coming up on special report and a few minutes on Fox News channel as well I'm sure you'll be talking about that\nI tend to agree with you on the investigation and I know that there's a lot on the right who said Democrats are always going to say this politically we were all eat we Democrats my party we're always going to not be\nSatisfied by it but I Do think there are some legitimate questions about why they did an interview the two main people and and now there are other people who said we reach out to the FBI we had information we wanted to at least talk to someone and they weren't able to how do you\nWell there are two issues here and they are whether either of the witnesses lied and whether judge Kavanaugh\nAre created a false impression before the Congress you know it is not a crime\nTo drink to excess in your use that is not a crime to become belligerent after your drink unless someone is harmed by it and it's not a crime\nTo fall asleep after you drank unless someone who's harmed by it but it can very well be a crime either lie about it or to create\nA missing impression and without interrogating the principles and they have a roadmap for what the principals are going to say because they've spray under oath right and without interrogating witnesses to home the principles would send them I don't mean I Want you to see this person but I mean ah here's what he said we've got to check this out yeah\nIt's not a thorough or complete investigation it's subterfuge it's the use of the FBI for a political purpose\nUp and down Trump's been complaining about for two years late\nLast I heard that before guy I mean I unsurprisingly disagree with what both of you were saying I think that this had to be a limited investigation that was what Jeff Flake or came up with with Chris Coons\nAnd they may not time limited right how you respond like ... where do you where you fall it come down on that issue of why they didn't rainy view half an hour for it because I feel like\nThey testified for hours under oath and were interrogated by a panel of lawyers for hours as well and so we know their\nStatements we know their story we know what they have said it seems like the people we don't know all the details obviously I think we should I think we should know you know who they talk to you but it appears based on reports that they talk to all of the fact witnesses\nThat were not brought before the committee not here say witnesses which\nAre I think of limited value if any in this case fact witnesses\nAnd they don't want to Jay ... is that true judge the difference between that she kinds of witnesses\nWhat depends what the issue is I mean it is the issue was he there at\nParty where Dr Ford says it was there or is the issue was he a heavy drinker and did he created a false impression that I was not\nYou know the worst thing that can happen to a judge has to be accused of bribery the second worst thing is to be accused of lying under oath or misleading interrogators under oath\nAnd the reason I keep saying misleading is because this two crimes here when Roger Clemens allegedly testified falsely to a house committee about the contents of this year and that's really an issue under the constitution but that's what they asked him and he was indicted for perjury the indictment was thrown out why they forgot to administer the oath\nThen he was indicted for misleading Congress another crime that only applies to Congress it doesn't apply when you do this to a jury that's the issue that's here I mean Brett Kavanaugh paint himself as a choir boy in misleading way\nHe he said he drank to excess sometimes than he cop to that he downplayed as drinking that is in my view not even close to perjury or criminal misleading and I think Murray one of the reasons why I think the scope of this investigation being relatively narrow speaking to mark judge for multiple hours apparently according to another network in a few other people is\nThe one of the primary arguments made by Democrats in favor of an FBI investigation which they said would be very short\nThey were talking about the Anita Hill Clarence Thomas precedent which was three days with a very limited number of people who were interviewed\nAnd this was a professor hill were interviewed above the FBI but it was before their testimony and so that's a very significant timeline difference one of the main arguments we heard over and over again was how can mark judge how can the other people said to have been\nSacked witnesses at this party by the accuser how could they not answer questions their letters from their lawyers to the committee under penalty of perjury not sufficient they need to answer questions as well\nYes I seemed like that was I was like All right that seems reasonable to me that's why I proposed this FBI investigation on friday that's why I support what they've done and\nI you know I think at this point to keep saying it's not enough it's never enough\nIt it does bring me back to my suspicion about the partisanship of\nThe heart is in no I'm not a person I might not accusing you of being what I have that fear too that it's never enough which is why the decision about what is enough should not be made by the president or by ... Pat Leahy or by Chuck Grassley but by the professional interrogators themselves\nWithout putting limits on them the FBI they will tell you what's enough I'm In New York times is somebody who has been the subject of an FBI investigation when I was nominated\nTo the federal bench by Ronald Reagan was ... read many of these interrogations it's amazing how open people they are how open people become in a non threatening conversational setting with a professional interrogator that's where they get their best information\nI Would like to see 'em 'cause the New York times reported that the White House instructed the FBI corner of the New York times sources that they could interview anyone that they saw fit and relevance [noise]\nUh I think that the FBI if they felt like their hand or completely tied and they couldn't do the type of investigation that they wanted to I've seen no indication of that we were told for days only the FBI can do this we must put this in the hands of the FBI the Judiciary Committee can't do it only the FBI\nAnd now you have Democrat after Democrats turning around and calling this a cover up saying the FBI's complicit in a cover up I really have trouble swallowing that\nAt all from these people\nThese people including your friend and co host who you cover up I'm not I was just going to say I'm not using that word cover up\nI think there are lingering questions about why more people were not interview\nWe have breaking nature which had program on the health isn't Collins has come out of the secure room where she's been reading she spent a couple of hours in there and what does she say had not yet reached at this age of our weekends or if we continue waiting judge this is obviously have you\nI mean you've been following the court for so long you you've obviously personally been involved in so much as as the judicial role in your entire life\nHow do you feel just taking a step back and looking at the process of former Supreme Court justice come out today and the based on ... ah you know demeanor he wouldn't support him being on the court things are different right\nAnd it's a good it's a good question I I think this is the whole thing the way it's been handled by both parties has been damaging to the court\nI say that because of whispers that have made their way to me about the attitude of chief justice John Roberts and I didn't speak with um personally I didn't hear him with my own ear but I've reason to believe\nThese whispers or accurate and I know that the court terribly fears\nBeing perceived in the public as just another political institution\nWhich of course I Would argue profoundly hit it's not it's not the duty of the court to do the people's will it to the duty of the court to interpret the law to cover the constitution to preserve our liberties from the tyranny of the majority in the anti\nAnti democratic branch of government that's probably something all of these yet is probably something that the three of us agree on but I Do believe there's been institutional damage to the court and I don't think it's going to go away overnight no matter how justice Kevin our rules or when he joined the other\nNight I fear that there's institutional damage to the Senate Judiciary committee as well in this process that's another part of the judge I have to tell you the item ...
