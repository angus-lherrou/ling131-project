that's when Nancy Pelosi could become speaker but knowing what's at stake ... pulls you do not only to reverse the tax cuts all but the older the economic world it's a move to a peach crop and try to abolish ice\nIce I mean there there are ten it's clear and our attendance clear to we want to keep working with this president to keep this great economy growing so that everybody can have better opportunities\nCongress man I I Want to ask you about a different demographic I Do think the one you mentioned is very interesting but I Want to ask you about winning in polls including an ABC Washington Post poll that just came out of the weekend the Republican Party is twenty four points underwater with women\nWho are likely to be voting I registered voters and likely to be voting this fall and three and three week samples have them down as much as thirty points and then a lot of those swing districts as you know\nThese women whether it's health care costs were President Trump's rhetoric um they're not really happy right now how concerned are you about that and and what are you doing to address that that demographic\nWill clearly you need to look closely at those polling numbers but if you dig deeper and she's pulling it a lot of these swing districts that show some of those numbers but then when you dig deeper\nUh those same women that might be moving away and the initial question they really liked the tax cuts or they don't like Obamacare they don't like seeing double digit increases in their healthcare costs or they\nDon't like the idea of abolishing ice or they want border security they want a they won national security and frankly if you look at the polling\nWe the Republican Party fare much stronger in a head to head on the economy and on national security with those very same women are then the Democrats and the low seat\nAgenda we're moving backwards so it's it's the ultimately it's the results of the things that we stand for four versus what they stand form of polo see well it's not your traditional Democrats uh it's it's this socialist movement really where liberals in any way primaries are getting beat by socialists\nOr that's not where this country is so we're a center right nation and with the polling will show you on a lot of those issues there was a big fight right now in this farm bill in the big fight is over whether or not people\nAre as they're trying to get welfare benefits if there's a job out there and you're able bodied should you have to work rather than getting taxpayer funded benefits\nThat's like an eighty twenty issue especially a with a with working working moms that understand why should we be paying taxpayer benefits to somebody who's fully capable of working when there's a job out there waiting for the Democrats say they should be able to still keep getting those welfare benefits instead of having to work\n[noise] Congress and I just want to jump in here and then I'm going to go back to a guy but to push you a little bit on how you describe the Democratic candidate you are very right that in many districts they're running\nVery liberal candidate Senate him how can I buy my she nice you're absolutely correct about that but in the swing district in the mid west across the plains states in parts of the south\nI think the Democratic party has actually been smart and running very moderate candidates many of whom will not they say they will not support Nancy Pelosi so when you're talking about some of these districts is there a chance that may be the Republican Party underestimating the fact that Democrats have found some moderate folks out there to run into these airstrikes\nWell I'll say they did a real good job of recruiting but the thing is like anybody even if you didn't have a voting record ... work real hard to to recruit a lot of people that have no voting records but then all of a sudden you dig deeper and you find out like in the case of Andy opponent or out in Lexington, Kentucky\nAh here's here's somebody who is his name as a as a moderate like you're describing yet she went to Boston, Massachusetts where Elizabeth Warren hosted a fundraiser for\n... first of all this image in your mind Elizabeth Warren is no moderate machine in a fundraiser for you in Massachusetts maybe you're not so conservative well she said things in that fundraiser making fun of the people of Kentucky\nAnd now she's having to confront that back in Kentucky\nYou saw that same thing with Kirsten cinnamon Arizona where\nYou know now she's there's video of her out going to Texas making fun of the people of Arizona we saw it and Keith officers district I was in Pennsylvania just last week with Keith Rothfus in the only race in the country or two incumbents are running against each other and in a very tough district\nUh but you have Conor Lamb who ran and got elected last year as that exactly as you're describing pro life pro gun anti Pelosi Democrat well lo and behold on so many key votes\nConor Lamb voted with Nancy Pelosi so he's not so conservative and they just look at a contrast vote the right to try bill something President Trump really help Marshall through Congress here's a buildup Keith Rothfus co sponsor and it allows somebody if you're terminally ill\nIf you want to be able to try an experimental that's not fully approved by the FDA but if you think it gives you a chance to save your life and your term Neal terminally ill shouldn't have a right to try that truck Keith Rothfus helped get that passed Conor Lamb voted no\nThere's a clear contrast so people are seeing now in the closing weeks here's where you really find out the details of what people stand for what's one thing to say you're conservative and you're against policy and then all of a sudden you find out they're not so conservative and they're not so it's a closely as you're getting closer to the election\nSteve ... is our guest in one of the monitors I'm starting to see among some on line conservatives is they're trying to frame the last three weeks of this campaign has jobs versus mobs\nAnd I'm Wondering you wrote an op ed for us here in Fox News of of course we all remember the the horrible incident last year on that baseball field where you were shot and thank God survived\nA you've written this piece warning about the rhetoric and some of the ratcheting up of intense partisan rhetoric and trying to get some of your democratic friends to cool it a little bit on that front\nAnd I wonder if you think\nI agree I I was not happy with what I saw from Hillary Clinton I was not happy with when I saw from Eric Holder of course what we saw from Maxine Waters we also get some pretty heated rhetoric from the president for example and I think the left sometimes tries to punish collectively conservatives for rhetoric\nAnd I'm Wondering how you're trying to draw that distinction and walk the line of trying to lower the temperature across the board\n[noise] well the difference is you know go fight for the things that you believe in a rush reviews you know go out there and when the argument as Margaret Thatcher said and then your window vote\nBut it seems like on the Democrat side more and more you're seeing them losing the arguments so they literally just drop trying to encourage almost bullying threatening harassing and even violence against people that disagree with them\nOr you seen it with some of President Trump's\nCabinet secretaries where they're literally encouraging people to go and run them out of restaurants or you know that's not what America's about that's the ...\nYou know don't go after people personally\nAnd what you saw it last week there was a Republican candidate for governor in Pennsylvania\nWho made some comments without a chicken or the governor with the spikes on and you know I came out against that\nAnd he ... and kind of backed away from his comments you're not seeing Democrat leaders come out against this kind of rhetoric on the west and it's frankly it's people on the left that have been all that going to the next level and actually committing acts of violence and there's no place for that our society that's where you need to draw the line\nYeah physical intimidation versus political disagreement\nBut of course congressman you would disagree if either side of the aisle perpetrators meant that I mean obviously we saw in Charlottesville someone was killed by a white supremacist at a protest and as someone on the left I myself have been screened adding yelled at I have many elected officials as well

Josh cross our who's the politics editor at National Journal and one of our go to experts on all things midterms Josh great to see oh hey great to be on the show by the way if you are near uh television\nJosh and I are on special report\nRight now or about to be so through the dark arts of radio you can DVR\nRep air show and listen to this interview and then go watch us after ... over on the TV Josh let's talk about the house first because there's a few data points out today\nThat are interesting to me so if I'm a conservative and a Republican and I'm looking for good news which you are all three of his right I'm looking at the Washington Post ABC poll that has Democrats at this big lead among registered voters nationally but in the most important toss up districts Republicans are up one\nOn the generic ballot\nThen I see a New York times poll has a Republican challenger up Fifteen points in Minnesota that would be a pickup for the Republicans Democrats pulling out of a double digit Hillary one district in California\nI Know there's plenty of bad news on the house side as well but there are some cross currents here that are puzzling is there a common theme that you can spot here\nThere are demographic cross currents when it comes to the battle for the house when I'm looking at polling the national polling even a toss up polling you're talking about isn't the most useful data because what we're seeing in the battle for the house is at suburban districts many of them held by Republicans\nAre swinging toward the Democrats I was just in Overland Park Kansas right near Kansas City\nAnd really well like moderate Republican congressmen by the name of Kevin Yoder\nIs is in the fight for his political wife and it's not because his Democratic challenger has as early the best candidate that Democrats have but it's because he's in a\nAffluent suburban district where a lot of voters just don't like President Trump and they want to check the Republican Party now the Minnesota district that you that you're talking about in in in upstate\nIs a rural blue collar district that Democrats have held for for some time and demographically speaking it's the exact opposite of of suburban Kansas City\nAnd in those districts you look at the Senate map there are a lot of other races in states that have\nA lot of small town rural population\nAnd those are the races where Republicans have I've gotten some momentum as the basis coming home as they're getting a little more excited about the mid term elections\nBut when you look at the house I mean the reason the houses so vulnerable for Republicans is that a disproportionate share of those tossup races are in the suburban districts is there a long time Republican seats that of all of a sudden gotten a lot more democratic because of President Trump and because of this the national uh this tastes like\n... or ... stock in a Roskam and some of\nThose totally like Tom's ah Orange County all these races in orange County California line on going out to LA the on Wednesday so I mean I get a chance to see how are those campaigns are going\nUp you know you live in New Jersey wine I did the turnpike I did the turnpike or a few months ago and you know make you Sheryl who's running in a sort of a swing northern New Jersey district really just talented recruit a military veteran who's was up in the polls pretty big\nBut even like like I'm Mike Coffman suburban Denver\nHe's someone who's beaten some of the toughest opponents that Democrats have thrown at him\nAs a swing district but he's he speaks like two to three different languages he speaks Spanish on himself span and taught himself that's right he taught himself managers and ... you know he really has gone above and beyond what most Republicans would do to win over new voters in his district and he's won some of the toughest campaigns with anyone else has on the Republican side\nHe's losing to to uh Jason Crow first time democratic candidate that's how big the suburban wave use on the Democratic side\nAnd Josh a lotta people are talking about this being the ... of them on there and are record numbers of women running a couple of him I I Am really excited about either on my list of the tenets that really care about an election night\nUm but we also had interesting numbers and ABC last direction Washington Post poll about when and

people think they can adjudicate what heritage is acceptable or or authentic\nAnd what isn't and and some sort of a baseline and then we can talk about some of the other issues but but you sort of slipping Lee said but she's not she's not what percentage would you say she was\nNot up to me it's up to the actual Native Americans who were put out a number of students to turkey\nIn some of them have put out positive statement will Cherokee Nation which is the one that she claimed to be a part of called this inappropriate and wrong and said gee NA testing undermining tribal interest with her continued claims of tribal heritage which she does not have she is not a Cherokee she claimed to be a Cherokee and\nTo be addressed that in the video she said I understand I'm not a part of the tribe male she says this in the video today and the news but she's she argued against her story on how she deals with all of us to talk about her story today yes I I Would like to very much so she they found in her ancestry\nOne okay ... fourth to one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American use ... definition of Mexican Colombian and Peruvian so what when and\nWhat percentage would have been enough for you not that okay but they're not even close to that well how do we are we in the business of adjudicating percentages which makes them want heritage authentic\nSo yeah I think on some level yes so I Would I be uncomfortable with yet I'm deeply uncomfortable\nWhat was it before and has done here the New York times had a really interesting piece about genetics and the science of genetics and the average white American is point one nine percent of African and point one eight percent Native American using Elizabeth Warren's definition\nI could claim to be African or I could claim to be Native American\nIf I'm just the average white DNA that we can talk about it and\nI Want to I'd actually left a debt I just think if I were to claim based on a fraction of one percent possible heritage from like ten generations ago that I was African and apply to two things and presented my so let's get to as African Americans get to that would have to like grace\nSlick ... ... if you watch the video is clearly part of her family's folklore so so here's my which which is not nothing that's her family that's fine we all of your family had that in mind that I had a really interesting and important or an authentic that clearly is authentic that her family no ... no but you know\nAgain I Believe is not truth so for example there's really\nA show is that she she she does have an ancestor who was Native American\nWell she has potentially an ancestor ten generations can surely very strong evidence I mean and what and Moran one one thousand and twenty fourth and the definition of Native American includes Mexicans and Peruvians Colombians\nIs there like a person that you feel comfortable putting on with us and are you comfortable with that I find absolutely when I saw this I was like okay you took\nIf you took a DNA test and\nIt came back that like the average white person in America according to the sciences report in the New York times that your point one nine percent African you would feel comfortable if you Marie ... presented herself as an African American\nNo I wouldn't present myself why not working American why not as someone said what's your heritage might my comparison with actually would you call yourself a minority\nA racial minority\nNo of course I went and that's what she did that's the problem is I don't know I Want to be on there I Believe me at one point there are people in the video who are directly contradicting what the point you're making an and they are and you don't like any of them you don't agree they're all lying\nWell I think some of them may be lying but there is I've done a lot of research on this I wrote about this in my book kind of discussion I followed this racial hoax of Elizabeth Warren for a long time\nGotta be careful if this is her family's heritage is super save her family and this deal heard you call it a hoax guy that when it's your family hurts sometimes she there's no evidence her DNA\nHer DNA is one one thousand and twenty fourth she is perhaps less Native American than the average American her again Donald Trump could be more Native American than Elizabeth Warren\nDNA showed that there was ... there were strong evidence that she had a Native American and our family tree six to ten generations ago that does not make her a Native American the kitten you accept that that she has Native American heritage that was part of her family\nIf we're defining Native American to include Mexican Colombian and Peruvian\nWith a one or a one thousand roughly than like one one thousand chance of being wrong yes\nThat does not make her Native American and here's the thing this was not I am not fact checking Elizabeth Warren because she had one too many glasses of short and they were talking about some family stories I have some cool family stories about who we might be related to\nAnd sometimes maybe we'll have a drink together and I'll tell you about them what I Would not do is try to get a job based on that and our little Mars itself as a minority that effect\nI Will say there are multiple people in this video who were responsible for hiring hurt a number of universities who said they didn't even hear it I mean it wasn't a factor so say two of them who know there were multiple and this video I Know\nBut I Want to get very specific there were a bunch of people attempting to this at the University of Texas when she was at the University of Texas in Rutgers before that she did not she was still white in her mind\nBack at University of Texas it was not until she wanted to get hired and the ivy league that she started checking this box in this employment for the ivy league people in the video say had nothing to do it that they say they don't remember her ethnicity being part of her hiring process right\nBut okay and I ... I think and so but you have a sense they're lying absolutely or at least not remembering and here's why God ... not a conspiracy endless crazy it has not ended isn't that what does the fence is Elizabeth Warren's saying that she was a racial minority when she was not\nAnd she helped me get buzz side no she didn't yes she did so at ... they touted her at Penn and at Harvard as a minority or they were desperate for more minorities when they were desperate for more than ... you know there were protests at Harvard at\nThe time to both higher separately women but they touted her as a racial minority in literature Marie this was a fact\nThere are okay fact guy yeah video from Penn and Harvard saying that had nothing to do with why they would hire only people who hire you think that the people that ... that were part of the committees who said it had nothing to do with our lives have\nNot heard from every person in those committees we not heard from every single person who was involved in that and here's the fact here's another fun fact she called herself and check the box white white white white wider whole life than in Nineteen eighty six she decides to become a minority\nIn early Nineteen eighty seven a few months later shock of shocks she gets hired into the ivy league she continues pretending to be a racial minority not like she was hired according to people who did it until Nineteen Ninety five\nWhen she got tenure at Harvard law school and then she stopped calling herself not a native ... she was hired according to the people interviewed who were involved\nBut the people so there's a bunch of the Boston Globe reports right yeah that the Boston Globe reports that war unless you're herself as a minority in a widely used association of American law schools directory from Nineteen eighty six\nTo Nineteen Ninety five is the tiring hiring deans often consoles ... when seeking out minority\nTitle of this story are quoting from headline ethnicity not a factor and Elizabeth Warren's arise in law\nYeah according to the people that they found some of them are her donors who said that Oh yes\nMen in the city and not a factor and Elizabeth Warren's rise in law of course it was a factor of course the evidence\nYeah besides your like intuition and don't like her no it's not my until we have a record in here says it wasn't a factor guy putting some of her donors okay but everyone here guy who was involved says it wasn't a factor so you can spin this outlet not ended\nIt or not it's I have so much evidence that she was never a Native American until Nineteen eighty six when she gets hired under the ... and then keep saying she Native American until she gets\nYou hanging over that's why she got to walk away like a cool you think it's a ... not acquaintances she wants us to believe that it was going so you know what kind of course was now you have any I wasn't born yesterday you have any any evidence that's why she got hired\nIs there anyone from Harvard or pen anyone who said that any document any email any evidence besides your theory is there any\n[laughter] [noise]\nRod Serling stories with a twist to jarring turns the standard

are debating Elizabeth Warren\nUm and we're going to go to the phone lines because they are lighting up people have lots of thoughts on that\nThere is a question about timing guy and why she decided to do this right now there are a lot of people and again can\nRemind people I'm not like a fan of Elizabeth Warren this isn't about me defending someone I think she'd be president\nSo just for folks out there who think I just defined Democrats I have a lot of issues with a lot of stuff yet\nBut on this the timing guy a lot of Democrats unhappy that twenty three days before mid term where there is a lot of democratic momentum focused on you know a moderate candidates in swing districts but also on the mid term not on twenty twenty not on someone did they said look it's Warren\nThey're kind of pissed at our performer Boston mine Jim Messina who ran President Obama twenty twelve campaign\nWas like oh my God why did you do this today you're taking all the oxygen away so I actually sort of agree with that I I don't like the timing\nI think that and here's the tell I think Warren who's not a dumb lady right she's pretty smart cookie she knows that this is not a good luck for her and sort of an embarrassment for her so she wants to rip off the ban data literally as soon as possible I think\nShe's ... actually I don't think so I think she likes that I think she\nIf she thinks this is vindication that is hilarious but I don't think that's the case my thing is she knows this is a problem for her identity politics is a huge thing on the left stealing someone else's privilege and heritage is not a good luck for her she's had a lot of people hammering her for it so I think\nShe wants by the time the twenty twenty campaign really gets going next year yeah she wants this to be old news so she's putting it out now and I didn't I didn't really notice in the video that she put out\nA constant theme of it was her and her spin versus Trump and the ... and she she attacked Fox News to get her tweet she is ironically appealing to tribalism by basically signaling to democratic voters either you by my\n... sandwich on this or you're starting with Trump and Fox News ... ...\nI I Want to read just quickly and then we're going to the front lines two paragraphs in the Boston Globe story quote in most exhausted review undertaking of Elizabeth Warren's professional history the glass globe found clear evidence and document in interviews that her claim to Native American ethnicity was never considered by the Harvard\nA faculty which voted resenting lead to higher or by those who hired her to four propositions and other law schools at every step of her remarkable riding the legal profession the people responsible for hiring her saw her as a white woman\nThe globe exam and hundreds of documents many of them never before available reached out to all fifty two of the law professors who are still living and were eligible to be in that room at Harvard law school when she was being considered to be hired\nSummer warrants allies others are not\nThirty one agreed to talk to the globe including the law professor who was the time in charge of recruiting minority faculty most said they were I Know wherever claims to Native American heritage and all but one of the thirty one said those claims were not discussed as part of for higher\nOne professor told the globe this other one that he's unsure but he has certain not if it did come up and had no bearing on his vote on warns appointment\nOn his vote there is somebody who made these decisions or dead\nI look back but you can't discount we may not like that she did it we may not approve of the fact that she did it and you may think the timing is suspect in it as I told you in the break if you come to me with evidence circumstantial\nEvidence players really strong but but the people get convicted on circumstantial lasting glow undertook an exhaustive review and they tried to talk to everyone that they\n... exam and but lately it listen they examine hundreds of documents spoke to thirty one of the fifty two professors\nFound the real evidence of played a role if you bring the evidence I told you I Will examine it and and and he's taken into account but we have to be guided by the fact that so far there's no evidence that's why Harvard hired her\nThe circumstantial evidence is extremely powerful there's no hard evidence but there's also circumstantial evidence that you don't want to address that you're you're not grappling with what I what I'm saying why that does look sort of\nYou're making a timing case you think the timing can't be a coincident until I make one more point on I say OK okay but not only that but\nLet me make one more point on it shows you good she was lifting resolve is white for her whole life\nChanges in Nineteen eighty six immediately gets hired into the ivy league which was having a diversity hiring crisis and also having a female hiring hounded as a racial minority by both schools which she claimed she didn't know about and that has changed your story on that point\nThat's I think a very important piece of evidence and then when she was hired because I'm not then she got tenure at Harvard law school the pinnacle of her career and stopped listening herself as a Native American and when she was asked why that's very suspicious timing\nBut it was a unanimous judgment of my advisors that resignation would carry a presumption of guilt sufficient to prevent a defense on the merits and I'm afraid that what I've been hearing and seeing and reading persuade me that they were ...\nPeople have got to know whether or not their president ... well I'm\nI burn everything I've\nGot news as it happens news as it happens this is talk\nFrom Fox News talk here's another sound memory\n[noise]\n\nMany loves to do be Gillis versus the earning a novel by measurements will also made it into a film and then later the TV shows are going to be involved in Denver played his allergic friend Maynard gene ... show aired for Nineteen fifty nine and Ninety sixty three\n\nI'm\n\n\nI'm\nMore sound member on Fox News talk\n[noise]\nStretch on Benson and harp on this Monday\nAnd we both had good sports weekends dish yeah I Would say yes\nI turned out OK you had the better light and see their first\nWell so first off I'm a hockey fan and the devils have started this season three un out which is very exciting including wins over to the best teams in the league Washington six to nothing then come back when they get nothing six to nothing over there are sad yeah and then come back in San jose the sharks on Sunday\nBut this was about college football\nAs most Saturdays in the fall are ... and it was north western's homecoming and we do not play well often at home but she died usually people do see other way around like I was not even fully joking with my friends that we should decline home games and like we should just play twelve or games\nUh and my perform better but we were playing oh in five Nebraska\nWould their new coach Scott Frost in late at Nebraska planted the brass getting there was all this hype about when did you get in his first win Nebraska football's never started oh and sex\nAnd the broadcast the ABC broadcasts was all about Scott ... Austin turning the corner and a milestone first when at his alma mater in the program and yada yada yada\nAnd we were down northwest and was down in Nebraska twenty eight to fourteen and the fourth quarter and then was about four minutes left we were down thirty one to Twenty one mhm kicked a field goal made a defensive stop\nNebraska punish the ball to our one yard line\nWe had the ball at our one yard line ... with two minutes to go and no time outs and we drove the longest drive in northwestern football history Ninety nine yards for the tying touchdown\nWhich over time did you think they should go for ... you know I was playing for the ... at home okay at quote unquote home 'cause it would have Nebraska fans and it was homecoming at least for us so you know\nThe fans who were there and purple were excited\nI was furious throughout almost the entire second half because it was not going well on the team was playing poorly and then they just sort of the second half hasn't been your ... it has not but they put on this Superman Cape basically came back and then in overtime with the weird college system which is different from the NFL system\nThey picked off the rescue quarterback on fourth down they were going for it on fourth down interceptions we get the ball and our walk on backup sophomore kicker kicked the game winning field goal and they walk off field goal\nAnd I was very pleased so we're now three and three and we go to Rutgers next week in God help us if we lose to Rutgers 'cause that team is a giant dumpster fire up\nWell they shouldn't be in the Big Ten but that's a whole other story I mean we might we might have\nThat's great that's wonderful you've had a couple of good games back to that\nAnd by the way I was telling Christina mhm our producer here in DC 'cause she went to Maryland and they had homecoming this weekend she had a fun Maryland weekend and she's like oh we're playing Rutgers I said oh you'll win and she was a little skeptical unlike believe me leave me against Rutgers and they won by thirty points\nI'm terrible um yeah what else lives next that I Know you should knock on wood or three in one in the conference great conference history has to be interesting Michigan State and beating Penn State yeah not enough number eight so they lost all anything because they lost to us but I think the so now Ohio State northwestern in Michigan State have all be in them\nAnd say through Penn State's some trouble oh yeah I mean there aren't that I'm terribly disappointed in a report that piece of news and\nGeorgia and number two guy trounce quashed by LSU when my best friend is a Georgia fan and she was high now none too I Know they really got be badly though hum and because of that my Ohio State buckeyes won against Minnesota moved up to number two in the polls\nNow I think ... that's a deserved move I agree I think that um the Buckeye we have some work to do before things get real with Michigan with probably a big tent championship game Michigan looked good\nOver Wisconsin yeah ah and I yes I think they did they weren't home they play well at home right um so I think that's\nNumber two we are offensive line was not great we you know we we are still missing both sides or do we know we're missing a key defensive player so I think it'll be interesting\nTo why they wouldn't have surprised that you missed the opportunity to brag on LSU quarterback well who led them to that went over Georgia because that's in Ohio State\nGuy here he transferred from Ohio State because we have two very very good quarterback including Dwayne ... she was on pace to break every quarterback record at the Ohio State university's already broken a couple\nUm ... the LSU quarterback is amazing and I at one point I turned to my dad and they said can we get him back like I Would like that so I think unless you really good\nAh the final score that Minnesota game\nI think we won by sixteen years comfortable but not like lower ... fourteen yeah no it was not a blowout blowout at all and we have to lock it up you know either by a week this week which gives me a little room to brave [noise]\nUm but yeah the big it's you know a number of people off yesterday big schools said the playoff race is is getting very interesting very interesting\nOkay so uh we'll stop and I are watching the patch win last night which is like I hate that pat and I like the chief Brady grove\nI'm hopefully all we can hope for is losing the super bowl or the rest on one show\nI mentioned in our\nDo you have an idea for an adventure interview

reach in my view the right decision and she did it in the midst of 'em really just wholesale effort to intimidate\nThere's been so much attention paid to the cabinet confirmation process in particular for obvious reasons and some of which we've gone through\nBut less attention has been afforded to the incredible carousel\nOf confirmations that have been coming through the United States Senate you of prioritize this from day one of the Trump presidency setting records for this pace and I'm Wondering if you can reflect on this I Know for many of our conservative listeners\nAt this has been a priority for them and you sort of channeled that concern and put it at the at the front burner in the U.S Senate is that something that you plan on continuing to do moving into the midterms in the lame duck and potentially beyond that\n[noise] well yeah you know I Love the tax bill and I love all the other things were done this\nCongress but the closest thing you can a path to having a permanent impact on their country is through the courts lifetime appointments and the president's been sending up outstanding a relatively young men and women who believe the job of judges to interpret the law is written\nAnd those are the kind of people are being shut up I'm working for arming them as rapidly as they come out of the committed a twenty Ninth Circuit judges that were done so far as her record for any administration this early\nIn its charm and if we're lucky enough to still have the majority after the November election we're going to continue to do that and have a long term positive impact on the country\nNow I mean I've written extensively at town hall and said here on the show that I think the number one priority for Republican voters and twenty Eighteen should be guaranteeing that Mitch McConnell remains the Senate majority leader in twenty Nineteen hopefully with a few more\nVotes in his back pocket it on the Republican side will get to the midterms but I Want to ask one more question on judges\nAnd it has to do with an answer you gave on Fox News Sunday recently\nWhere Chris Wallace push you a little bit on these so called Biden Rule that you invoked famously and twenty sixteen visa Merrick Garland where you said no no Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer said in a presidential year we have to let the people decide so that's what we're going to do\nDonald Trump got elected was a big gamble paid off for you\nIn the hypothetical but not far fetched scenario that a twenty twenty Supreme Court justice were to come up and you were or if they can see where to arise and you were to be in the position that you are now\n... how can you justify not invoking the same standard and I know it would be a difference in which party in the opposite parties would not\nGet a ... point that's the whole point of that wanted out horsing [noise]\nBut you pointed out you have to go back to the Eighteen eighties to find the last time a vacancy on the Supreme Court created during a presidential election year was confirmed by Senate of a different party and the president and I said that back in ... the the Biden situation\nWas ... Democrats in control of the Senate Republican president there was a vacancy but he helpfully volunteer that if there were one they wouldn't fill it Cornell's seven Democrats and the charge of the Senate George W. Bush and the president say\nA Schumer and read both set up a vacancy occurred Eighteen months before the end right of his term they wouldn't fill it so I was simply pointing out what the history of this is and that's [noise] that's exactly what we did and twenty six day in a Republican majority in the Senate a Democratic president\nSo if you guys were to maintain the majority after these midterm elections the argument would be this is kind of mandate you know the American people had an opportunity to but the Democrats back in charge and they decided not to sort of situation is qualitatively different than twenty sixteen\nNo to talk of the same you is under the scenario you point out uh you would not have a party or in control the Senate that was different\nFrom the uh a part of the president right oh look it's a it's an interesting hypothetical [noise] I don't know whether this will occur or not\nThe first up we're going to be able to continue to confirm judges at all levels of not just the Supreme Court but circuits and districts as for others to the senator or buying a Republican majority and we're working very hard to try to make sure that happens in a couple of weeks\nAnd what do you think you have access to really good data and information that we don't based on what you are seeing beyond what we know publicly peep the conventional wisdom is continuing Republicans are in pretty good shape probably to at least have\nFifty seats you know and then you'd have the vice president breaking the tie it'd be a nominal Republican majority do you feel like you guys are in the fifty fifty one range or are you optimistic\nThat you are a majority could actually be swelled\nFlorida I never put a number on it but I can tell you that we are very close a cliffhanger races and places like Arizona Nevada Montana or North Dakota Missouri Indiana\nA West Virginia Tennessee in Florida\nAnd we start off with fifty one of the shirt off of forty nine I'd rather be at fifty one starting this spread to the finish than forty nine and I'm optimistic we can hold us on it but I Can't give you know a production are not going to give you a production of our number\nDo you believe that if the Democrats where to defy the odds and win back the Senate the confirmation of judges even at the circuit court level would stop completely out of the\nLast question for me uh and it's a legislative question between now in the election not much is going to happen I think everyone understands that but moving forward perhaps in the\nLame duck session or in the next Congress it's been such a bruising\nFew months of political warfare we've got a tough election here is something like criminal justice reform a realistic opportunity to perhaps have a bipartisan vote particularly if you got opposite party controlling the two houses of Congress\nWe've done a lot of stuff on a bipartisan basis I'm we were in the ... we did an overwhelmingly supportive uh opioid building a five year of a bill and\nWere originally funded Seventy five percent of the government before the end of the fiscal year that are not going to want to hear so look we've had some big fights but we're also able to accomplish things that I think the at the top of the list after we get back\nFunding the remaining twenty five percent of the government and passing a farm bill and it's possible we're going to take a look at criminal justice at the Web cow chose to support the rows of for some version of it but clearly we're gonna have to fund the remaining twenty five percent of the

invited me on that is you know what that is truly blame our producer for that yeah take\nThose show really has great than I Am an avid listener and so I'm I'm very happy for both of\nYou think is very ... so you are following this story that we're about to talk about uh for really the next couple of segments which is the drama in Istanbul right and this now ten you know\nTensions that's brewing between the U.S government the western world and the Saudi Arabian government with this disappearance and apparent murder of one of their nationals who's also someone who lives here in the United or lived here in the United states contributed to the Washington Post what is the very latest\nAs we head into this conversation that you're hearing about a really this really significant firestorm\nWell we know now that that the Saudis are about to acknowledge we don't know exactly when but sometime today tomorrow they're about to acknowledge the death of ... show he\nWas in their terms and interrogation gone wrong now I'm exactly how interrogation goes wrong we don't know but but that's part of the whole method of of what we're planning to hear from\nThe Saudis at some point in time now we do know the Turkish investigators they finally got inside the Saudi constantly been winning for days remember this happened October second he walked in\nTo the Saudi consulate in Istanbul October second and never walked out we know that because there's surveillance video of him walking in there is nothing of him walking out so the Turkish investigators have been saying now for days and days let us inside let us inside so they've gotten inside\nThe consulate in Istanbul they've collected large amounts of DNA samples they won't say\nWhat the samples are but we now know they found identical samples from the Saudi conflict and the residents of of the Saudi consul general in is stumble which is an indicator without saying what it is it's an indicator that it's more evidence that he's\nWas in fact killed inside the conflict and then somehow brought out now of course the New York times is reporting today that Turkish media obtained these recordings we've been hearing so much about in recent days I mean there's been talk that that ... show he actually was wearing an iPhone watch\nAnd that the watch actually recorded his death and the torture that went along with that and the New York times is reporting and the Turkish media are reporting that that this was a gruesome audio tape\nThat was released or at least obtained by the Turkish media you know and and I hate to go into detail but but things like the fact that that his fingers may have been severed during interrogation or that he was he was beheaded and dismembered and remembered the ferry from Turkish investigators was that you walked in\nHe was killed in some capacity and then was dismembered and his body was taken out of that conflict and of course there's the whole theory of look they these two plane show up in Saudi Arabia on the very day\nThat drew marker show he is going into the conflict so the two planes show up Fifteen people on these planes attorney government cause them a hit team they've identified a number of these people a number of these people have been\nIdentified as having close ties to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia which doesn't bode well for his story well you know I didn't order this I had nothing to do with\nThis so it's kind of fitting together now and the more we get from the DNA samples and if this audio tape is released we should have a lot more information about this in the coming days\nTrees and a question on the investigation I understand the Saudis\nHave said they're they're doing on and that's what I think secretary the F ... we're talking about when he was just in Riyadh but\n... family the Washington Post other organizations have called for an independent investigation saying that the Saudis are the main suspect they probably shouldn't be the ones doing the investigation do you get the sense that there is any\nPossibility of some other outside investigation by I don't know some other you know international body out there\nWell I think Turkish investigators are really one of the primary sources here I mean the Saudis the Saudi Arabians say look we want this investigative they're saying we want to a thorough and transparent investigation but you're right Marie I mean look if you're investigating yourself how thorough and transparent can be", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Alan Colmes Show", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "22"}
