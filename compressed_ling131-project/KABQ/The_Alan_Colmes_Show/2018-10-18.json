{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "First thing I'd like to comment about is Mr ... straight to his wife up underneath his boss [laughter] yeah but also the fact that while all list is going on these\nAdvertisements against the Democrats I seen nothing about number one\nThey lost twenty two of our fighters in hurricane them Florida where did they why did they leave him there especially when the navy poor gotten your folks for ... yeah\nYeah I don't I honestly don't know Alan's calling back right now I'm sure if you want to grab 'em jak I you know I I don't know the details on that but you know to know that never underestimate the ... of the Republican Party\nDoes for the call I who is this is this is like you know people are waking up and they're figuring these things out and and uh you know how how bad all this is so\nSure can we get back on\nLet's try this again Eleanor out or hail and can you hear me do\nIt is not working okay I'm going to put that on hold and I'm going to pick up ... call in Seattle ... what's on your mind that\nHey Tom amazing I got through um I'm interested what your thought is on the wolf pack initiatives to get money out of politics via a constitutional amendment [noise] uh\nIf uh you know I've had this conversation with junk if if they're calling for a constitutional convention which is what this all started out as I you know so are the Koch brothers and the Koch brothers have thirty two out of thirty six necessary states signed up for it already\nAnd or I guess twenty eight of of the thirty to necessarily safe to start and then they need thirty ... thirty six to to finalize a I think it would be a huge mistake if that's the case on the other hand uh I understand that they have kind of overtime change this to say okay we're going to use the article five process\nTo a push a ... a a constitutional amendment up from the states but without actually having a constitutional convention where we open up the constitution take it apart tinker with it figure out what's going on all that kind of stuff and uh so\nYou know I I haven't talked to check in about a year on it so I I'm not sure where he's at right now but if they're just pushing the constitutional convention\nYou know uh and and if they have joined with the coalition that move to amend as part of and Public Citizen as a part of it was a whole bunch of organizations who are working on this and who are pushing you know really really good constitutional conventions in that case\nI I you know I Would be supportive of it so anyhow that's that's a cool Zack thanks a lot for the call do we have we have Eleanor Simon it's working\nElon around or Alan\nAnd here I Am at Katy are the are fairly it in Santa Fe Warner fail um there's a lot going on first of all they're asking the ballots that were assigned in Atlanta over a thousand of them were not allowed on ...\n... they worked discounted by the Atlanta radio station I'm Sorry by the Atlanta not radio station but the the secretary of state for and now the ACLU is suing them\nA because they're faint signature didn't match give me a break also\nUm we do know that Bloomberg is reporting that Robert Miller who of course is doing the and Russia investigation will have a full report right after the uh uh right after the ... in the midterms which of course it's going to happen in November six\nAlso now a Donald Trump says he hasn't hurt the tape he doesn't know if there's a tape a but we do know that the secretary of state or is coming back from turkey and she says he expects the full report\nFrom the folks ah in in in Turkey and what's happening with Saudi Arabia also pro public ... now says that the Trump family did not tell the truth for investors\nOr that they claim in Las Vegas that they were sold out but only twenty five percent of the units were sold by two thousand eleven and the result is that they did build a in Fort Lauderdale they entered into foreclosure uh and so there's many many stories that ProPublica has looked at\nAnd found out that they did not actually wind\nAnd in that way shape or form from that report\nWhat I'm saying as of aka why did the investors Donald lied to the investors the investors lost thirty five or fifty five million dollars or something like that and then right and on top of that members Cyrus Vance\nOh I Do you you don't you know he was a Democrat right and he and he was the prosecutor in New York who was supposed to go after and he let it go the Trump family while he let it go after ... after they made a thirty five thousand dollar campaign contribution to him so now they're starting to look into SARS faster taken a bribe\nFrom the job well that's right back in the day absolutely it's amazing ... and ...\nAlso

Merrick Garland where you said no no Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer said in a presidential year we have to let\nThe people decide so that's what we're going to do\nDonald Trump got elected was a big gamble paid off for you\nIn the hypothetical but not far fetched scenario that eight twenty twenty Supreme Court justice were to come up and you were or if they can see where to arise and you were to be in the position that you are now\nHow can you justify not invoking the same standard and I know it would be a difference in which party no opposite parties would not\nGet a ... point that the whole point I wanted a parsing [noise]\nWell I pointed out you have to go back to the Eighteen eighties to find the last time a vacancy on the Supreme Court created during a presidential election year was confirmed by set out of a different party and the president and I said that back in twenty six day and\nThe the Biden situation\nWas ... Democrats in control of the Senate Republican president there was a vacancy but he helpfully volunteer that if there were one they wouldn't fill it Cornell's seven Democrats in charge of the Senate George W. Bush and the president say\nA Schumer and read both set up a vacancy occurred Eighteen much before the end right of his term they wouldn't fill it so I was simply pointing out what the history of this is and that's [noise] that's exactly what we did and twenty six day in a Republican majority in the Senate a Democratic president\nSo if you guys were to maintain the majority after these midterm elections the argument would be this is kind of a mandate you know the American people had an opportunity to put the Democrats back in charge and they decided not to use of the situation is qualitatively different than twenty sixteenth\nNo to talk of the ... under the scenario you point out uh you would not have a party in control of the Senate that was different\nFrom the uh a party or the president right oh look it's a it's an interesting hypothetical I don't know whether this will occur or not\nThe first up we're going to be able to continue to confirm judges at all levels of not just the Supreme Court but circuits and districts as for those are the senator or buying a Republican majority and we're working very hard to try to make sure that happens in a couple of weeks\nAnd what do you think you have access to really good data and information that we don't based on what you are seeing beyond what we know publicly peep the conventional wisdom is continuing Republicans are in pretty good shape probably to at least have\nFifty seats you know and then you'd have the vice president breaking the tie it'd be a nominal Republican majority do you feel like you guys are in the fifty fifty one ranger are you optimistic that you are a majority could actually be swelled\nFlorida I never put a number on it but I can tell you that we are very close a cliffhanger races and places like Arizona Nevada Montana\nNorth Dakota Missouri and day out or a West Virginia Tennessee in Florida\nAnd we start off with fifty one of the shirt off of forty nine I'd rather be at fifty one starting this spread to the fetish than forty nine and I'm optimistic we can hold a set of but I Can't give you the production of are not going to give you a production of our number\nDo you believe that if the Democrats where to defy the odds and win back the Senate the confirmation of judges even at the circuit court level would stop completely or the\nLast question for me up and it's a legislative question between now and the election not much is going to happen I think everyone understands that but moving forward perhaps in the\nLame duck session or in the next Congress it's been such a bruising\nFew months of political warfare we've got a tough election here is something like criminal justice reform a realistic opportunity to perhaps have a bipartisan vote particularly if you got opposite parties controlling the two houses of Congress\nYou know we've done a lot of stuff on a bipartisan basis I'm we were in the big Kavanaugh firewood and overwhelmingly supportive uh opioid built on a five year as a bill and\nWere originally funded Seventy five percent of the government before the end of the fiscal year that I'm not going to want to hear so look we've had some big fights but we're also able to accomplish things that I think the at the top of the list after we get back\nFunding the remaining twenty five percent of the government and passing a farm bill and it's possible we're gonna take a look at criminal justice say what the whip couch shows so much support there is\nA for some version of it but clearly we're going to fund the remaining ... percent of the dishwasher budgeting on stage and pass a farm bill and we're going to continue a guy to process the judges\nAs you have very faithfully inconsistency I mean I've been waiting the Mitch McConnell flag for a while because of this issue um and so on from my partisan conservative standpoint I I think that that's\nThe most important legacy of this Congress and frankly if I may say some of your leadership a Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the Senate majority leader we appreciate your time this evening thank you for joining\nThank you All right we're going to step aside we will come back a lot to get you including that first topic I mentioned with Senator McConnell this scandal that's blowing up around Saudi Arabia and how our government ought to respond to it is the president doing the right thing I'm not sure\nI'm so we'll see you mentioned North Dakota we talked about it briefly on the program yesterday Heidi Heitkamp this epic failure by her campaign where they listed a bunch of women publicly in an ad as survivors of assault\nThat they had gotten from victims advocacy group right without checking or getting permission\nThey thought the group had which is a huge screw up\nUm and they put you put out a statement today I deeply regret this mistake we are in the process of issue whenever attraction personally apologized and each of the people impacted by that and taking the necessary steps to ensure that never happens again and guy\nYou'll remember during Kavanaugh's she was very emotional when she was asked about sexual assault and talked about her mother had been a victim herself\nYeah and so I mean they out at some of these women without their consent some of them that they listed weren't even victims and now some of them are saying who actually were victims saying now my abuser knows where I live it's just\nIt's a catastrophe for them I'll just say this I think that she was in very big trouble any way before this happened then she voted no on Kavanaugh then this giant misstep\nI think she'll lose and I don't think it'll be that close but her abject know BS apology I actually appreciate it it was not blame shifting or squarely she was just like yup massive screw up and the buck stops here like [noise] I appreciate that because some politician yet what\nShe's a real person at the end of the day we're going to take a break we'll come back

our producer for that and take notice my radio\nShow really has great than I Am an avid listener and so I'm I'm very happy for both of\nYou think he's very ... so you are following this story that we're about to talk about uh for really the next couple of segments which is the drama in Istanbul right and this now ten you know\nTension that's brewing between the U.S government the western world and the Saudi Arabian government with this disappearance and apparent murder of one of their nationals who's also someone who lives here in the United or lived here in the United states contributed to the Washington Post what is the very latest\nAs we head into this conversation that you're hearing about a really this really a significant firestorm\nYeah well we know now that the Saudis are about to acknowledge we don't know exactly when but sometime today tomorrow they're about to acknowledge the death of democracy Yogi\nWas in their terms an interrogation gone wrong now I'm exactly how interrogation goes wrong we don't know but but that's part of the whole method of of what we're planning to hear from the Saudis at some point in time now we do know the Turkish investigators\nThey finally got inside the Saudi constantly been winning for days remember this happened on October second he walked in\nTo the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second and never walked out we know that because there's surveillance video of him walking in there is nothing of him walking out so the Turkish investigators have been saying now for days and days let us inside let us inside so they've gotten inside\nThe consulate in Istanbul they've collected large amounts of DNA samples they won't say what the samples are but we now know they found identical samples from the Saudi conflict and the residents of of the Saudi consul general in Istanbul which is\nAn indicator without saying what it is it's an indicator that it's more evidence\nThat he was in fact killed inside the consulate and then somehow brought out now of course the New York times\nIs reporting today that Turkish media obtained these recordings we've been hearing so much about in recent days I mean there's been talk that that ... show he actually was wearing an iPhone watch\nAnd that the watch actually recorded his death and the torture that went along with that and the New York times is reporting and the Turkish media are reporting that that this was a gruesome audiotape that was released or at least obtained by the Turkish media\nYou know and and I hate to go into detail but but things like the fact that that his fingers may have been severed during interrogation and that he was he was beheaded and dismembered and remembered the theory from Turkish investigators was that he walked in\nHe was killed in some capacity and then was dismembered and his body was taken out of that conflict and of course there's the whole theory of look they these two plane show up in Saudi Arabia on the very day\nThat gym lockers show he is going into the conflict so the two planes show up Fifteen people on these planes the Turkish government cause them to hit team they've identified a number of these people a number of these people have been\nIdentified as having close ties to the crown prince in Saudi Arabia which doesn't bode well for his story well you know I didn't order this I had nothing to do with this so\nIt's kind of all fitting together now and the more we get from the DNA samples and if this audio tape is released we should have a lot more information about this in the coming days\nAt a question on the investigation I\nUnderstand that ... that they're they're doing in line and not what I think secretary to F ... was talking about when he was just in Riyadh but\n... family the Washington Post other organizations have called for an independent investigation saying that the Saudis are the main suspect they probably shouldn't be the one doing the investigation do you get the sense that there is any\nPossibility of some other outside investigation by I don't know some other you know international body out there\nWell I think Turkish investigators are really one of the primary sources here I mean the Saudis the Saudi Arabians say look we we want this investigated they're saying we want to a thorough and transparent investigation but you're right very I mean look if you're investigating yourself how thorough and transparent can be\nSo so the idea here is that U.S authorities are now working with Turkish authorities trying to get to the bottom of this and as much as Saudi Arabia says they are going to be involved they are going to handle this\nTo companies were looking for new ideas we have more than ... thousand companies agreed to review ideas being cup of recovery shows

journalist who seems safe to say now is no longer live\nAnd what the ramifications should be and guy just seems like such a miscalculation because the crown prince to convince everyone he was a reformer he was getting foreign investment he was talking about making the oil company public\nAnd it just turned and his ruthless I became clear okay so I\nAm basically on board with everything that you've been saying but there's this nagging thing that I Can't get out of my head which is everything that you just said he's really cultivated this image very carefully at great length great expense\nI'm great effort into through it all away with this unbelievably stupid gambit to off this guy who wasn't even really that much of a GED fly like you yeah what we can tell he was a sort of like\nAn anti regime it it does not make sense to me that he would order this in terms of\nIf he's not a dummy like the the downside to doing this show outweighed the upside of like getting rid of someone that you maybe didn't like for some reason I don't understand the motive and the calculation and also let's say you decide fine\nI hate the guy in up let's get rid of him\nThere were many ways for a wealthy government which you disappear someone or have someone have an accident or be assassinated public can you blame someone else logical that I'm lying on now you bring him to your consulate in this member him\nThere there so I this is my theory the crown prince has undertaken a series of increasingly reckless moves and there's been no real pushback right so he\nHas been incredibly violent toward civilians and the war in Yemen which they're also fighting an Iranian proxy there but he has basically used us weapons there has been multiple evidence piece of evidence\nTo basically bond civilian areas like he has been increasing it is a humanitarian catastrophe that he has\nPerpetrated on a lot of civilians and yet and\nHe's also basically held the Lebanese prime minister hostage in Riyadh and forced him to resign and then let him go home where the prime minister was like yeah he told me I had to resign but I'm not going to\nLike you will be back to Riyadh anytime but like that's insane\nActually and then as you mentioned he put a bunch of Saudi prince says under house arrest and the Ritz Carlton like he's been doing increasingly reckless stain that hasn't really gotten much pushback I think he underestimated the fact that cars show he worked for the post and lived in the U.S\nI think he is it is is if someone who didn't work and neighborhood coral right if this is someone who didn't work for the post and didn't live in the U.S I'm not sure that you would hear the same response Oh absolutely not right so yeah I think he that was a miscalculation\nThan I

Bush because that was nine eleven that was like a valid unusual total naturally arises right two thousand two but overall it was President Obama sixty three seats weren't in the other direction in the house alone\nSo just historically speaking it'd be tough to just painted on Trump this is what happens to any president\nBut and I think he has been helpful in a number of Republican races house and Senate where he\nIf they were to lose it could be despite his best efforts in the house you know some yes that's why he was in Kentucky recently there's no Senate race in Kentucky there was a ... so there someplace where he's being deployed at\nThe fact that he has to be deployed to Kentucky house race office as a thing but\nYeah sure oh that was a Democrat healthy for a long time in the Republican Guard a graph actually I think is a pretty good candidate to the point is it's a mixed bag of history from being helpful but it's also I think undeniable that in some districts like for example if Barbara Comstock loses in Virginia yeah it'll be because\nOf a backlash against Trump from educated more affluent overwhelmingly white suburban voters the same applies to Peter Roskam in the suburbs of Chicago there are some districts like that some of these Republicans who were sort of in the the main line area Pennsylvania like there are certain ... knew some of the New Jersey races right like\nDistricts have been held by ... New Jersey right which is which I saw a poll that had MacArthur up to the other day yet so close yeah\nBut I think that I think that so I I agree that in those districts with a lot of generally white affluent women that's one place that Trump hurts the other I think is motivating I'm particularly African American voters in places like Georgia\nI'm In other in other races there are a number of first time for example in Michigan I think the first female Muslim ever running right for Congress like there are these minorities who are running that are firing up a lot of people and registering a ton of new voters and we'll see if that works in terms of winning but\nI should I mean that's a very democratic issues ... no it is very you don't like stand ... safety\nStacey Abrams for example like like in Georgia I think you're seeing your scene because the Trump more women than ever running more minorities than ever running and a lot of people getting registered so like you said these are factors that I think are a direct backlash to Donald\nTrump another one that's weird to me and interesting and very much box the conventional wisdom is\nLatinos there but a number of pieces recently about the Democrats Latino problem hey in terms of turnout but be in terms of Trump's too many people surprisingly decent numbers among Hispanic voters\nWell there's I think there's two issues here one and this is a separate issue a little bit there was a really interesting like New York times magazine cover piece over the weekend I'm On Sunday\nAbout the Democrats immigration problem that like Republicans have figured out how to own this politically their point of view and Democrats have not figured out how to own politically their point of view they're scared of it and in many places\nHave reason to be politically but like making the case for certain things that are popular like dreamers right coming up with their own rational ideas\nBut owning the fact that they are pro legal immigration having a better system and and ... you know the fact that his this panic\nI mean it doesn't help when you have some of the loudest voices talking about abolishing ice right about that\nBut this is the point and the fact that Hispanic ... you know advocacy groups hated President Obama many of them they were some of our toughest critics because they call them that the Porter and sheets\nThey obviously have Trump more of\nCourse they do but like we were Democrats and we try to do good things and so the Democratic party has\nNot figured out how to own their piece of this issue in a way that is a good policy and I think the politics\nI just it's interesting kind of interesting NPR Marist Poll that came out just recently had trumpet forty one percent among Latino voters and a higher number among Latino men it's\nJust I I I I Do not understand trending trending positive and in some cases went because of immigration why why can you explain those numbers 'cause those numbers seem insane I think I think a lot I mean truly and\nSay I think a lot of Hispanic voters who are citizens of this country are not on board with the left wing immigration policies have sort of abolish eyes open borders a yellow\nAlert heading party doesn't want open borders though that's the thing the horse to catch and release status quo that that in some ways winds and mimics Trump\nTalks about it in such basic terms that I think they're very misleading but like when he said Democrats love MS Thirteen and it's like\nLightning and the drugs\nThat unless they're\nTalking about right and I think what Republicans you aren't Trump would say is\nThe Democrats don't love MS Thirteen but they aren't serious about taking care of border security and enforcement that would be a problem for M. S. Thirteen there there are an obstacle to progress in securing the homeland they want to talk about the dream act and the dreamers and they're\nSort of ignoring these very potent issues on the other side of immigration\nTo the point that even though I think a lot of people who have immigrated here legally resent people who are trying to get into the country illegally and Trump doesn't always talk about it in the way that I like some of his policies I've been very critical of like family separation whether that was rolled out by the way it's still happening\nHis baritone day Thursday and and I am so excited to tell you about it and I heart radio podcast where I sit with musicians and experts to talk about how DNA is changing our lives and the world around us\nI don't feel like I look like anybody else or feel like anybody else we're becoming closer together more empathetic that's what they instilled in me in the very beginning that you are part of the revolution you can make family family's liar thirties\nOn the team mobile network and check out the new metro today and discovered the smarter way to get unlimited and all this week listen to a Ninety nine ... your chance to win tickets to see DJ holy be this Friday and that goes stage presented by metro by the mobile that's genius\nElection day is that the person in the open up today don't weigh register online it only takes minute [noise]\nThat that's I'm like I my county board of elections website at seven seven seven fat or protecting legislation that that line is I covered that nine PM hope I ... wasn't seven seven\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nHe is the mayor for terrifying attractions one location designed to get older\nContinuing this sort of those legacy of academic excellence classes are held to the same high standards are consistently named the ...\nThe second season at ten nine central ... also when Sunday Jesse Buckley and then hardy starred in a British adoption of the Eighteen fifty nine mystical novel the woman in white at ten nine central on most PBS station [noise]\nMonday Night the D.C superhero fantasy drama legends up tomorrow we're transcripts fourth season at nine eight central under the W. following a new episode of arrow\nThat's your TV tip off on my heart radio\nMandela or radio you want to hear [noise] use the thumb up and some down by Gillette are programmers you know how to make our radio sound our\nService announcements brought to you by a A R P and the ad council\nThe dean's list with Janice [noise]\nKaylee foster make the dean's list for not only being homecoming queen by scoring an extra point on her football team\nHours after being named the homecoming queen at ocean springs high school in Mississippi Kaylee faced the pressure by kicking the game winning extra points\nIn overtime she treasures both moment Kaylee scored seven ever teams Thirteen points kicking to field goals and regulation and ending the game against George county with the extra points and\nThen it went in and like\nAnd I think I Know everyone is like right there [noise] nice group hug\nHer mom Randy foster says her daughter was surprised to win homecoming queen but not about the kick Kaylee says she is entertaining the idea of also playing college football she says she owes her successor to her teammates nice work Kelly a field goal\nThe dean's list Janice Dean Fox News\nHistorical Adil archives of Fox News talk to my area Jackson who died in Nineteen Seventy two is widely regarded as the first queen of gospel music although she was heralded as much loved former she lived a double life and racially divided America\nI'm On the stage in a you know television and what he was white men love [noise] and and so on the phone are so great and then when I'm walking down the street like an ordinary citizen\nThey don't [noise] a wreck or recognize it and when I go into the the ... the ...

today on the line with us now Charlie hurt Fox News contributor columnist for the Washington Times our friend\nThank you for joining the show again thank you for having me great to be with you so Charlie and I were at a we went to this book party last night for our friend Chris dire Walt who was on the show talking about his new book a few weeks ago and it was every man a king we should plug it yes everyone should go by it every man a cane um\nSo it was a very fun night we got to tell us one of our Fox colleagues seems like everyone's writing about Charlie you're going to write a book\nI'm a I'm I'm doing everything I tend to ... to uh to to avoid doing that but\nThese things are unavoidable I Would ... would start ... book is is just a tremendous a wonderful take on a populism throughout American history and and the thing I Love about Star Wars even better than he is at politics\nHis love of history and his love of the really fun um outlandish people from history he's gotta he's got a good idea for that kind of stuff\nHe dead people should definitely check it out cell\nSpeaking of current history we are under three weeks away from the mid term and someone actually last night this party described it to me that's way Charlie 'cause I feel like at this point we're all saying the thing every day I say the same thing the house looks better for the Democrats and it looks worse it doesn't seem like there's a lot of new new\nYou might mentioned the year of the woman\n... exactly like A People's mind sort of are made up um and the person described he made his party last night at that point in the evening at like eleven o'clock when you're fighting with your spouse and you've had like one too many glasses of wine and you're just going around and around and you're saying the same things and no one's winning the argument that you're just saying the same thing\nThat's what it feels like right now in pundit land\nYeah and I mean like we just need to get to the election with my point\nYeah yeah no I think that's right but but but also you know putting it into into a larger context you know in this election for under President Obama Democrats last sixty three seats so we're sitting here debating about whether or not and and I I'm always suspicious of polling and\nYou know conventional wisdom in productions and all that kinda stuff it's all kind of kind of crazy\nBut ah the fact that we're sitting here talking about a Republican's losing thirty seats thirty two seats thirty five seats that you know if that is what ends up happening\nUm I think that's pretty significant and I think it does tell us something about uh you know if if we if Democrats want to say that that that as a referendum on Donald Trump my goodness what what was the referendum on Brock Obama in his first midterm\nWell he he takes him credit for it guy if you remember he said this is\nA shellacking I Believe yeah whatever that we're not that he really changed his past your policies one bit after that we did go down on it we want a second term cell hanging and then got crushed again in fourteen out the ad and then Trump so Charlie you mentioned your disdain for the conventional wisdom what is your non conventional wisdom\nOn this election do you have one angle on this that you don't think people are seeing or that people are missing\nOut on a unfortunately I I I like Marie what you're saying I'm sort of I guess I'm sort of seeing the exact same thing um in terms of\nThe house being you know either on the bubble\nYou know whatever and and then and then with the south or with the Senate but I Do think that if if Republicans do pick up a couple of seats in the Senate I think that we wouldn't nothing's going to get done or out of out of Congress nothing new legislative stuff is going to get done out of out of Congress\nBut it does set up Republicans to a rack up some some really serious ah important wins\nOr in terms of putting federal judges or judges on the federal ... ...\nAnd I think that that's that that that should be a one of the key you know rallying points not only are you know right now but then also the day after the election going into twenty twenty or be that that should be one of Trump's a top talking points after um [laughter] immigration\nImmigration is what got the guy elected a I think is probably the most important issue\nUm and ... you know why Republicans haven't been better there was a there do the New York times story the other day that said Republicans are found surprising new tool\nIn their arsenal against Democrats immigration it's like ... ... ... what's amazing is it's only it's only occurring now to Republicans two years after Trump won that that's an important issue to and you may not like it and you may disagree with it and you may have problems with it but at the end of the day that is what\nA lot of lot of voters responded to\nWell and not only that there were reports that some of these

Saudi Arabia turkey the president and Congress hoping he has answers about the presumed murder of a Washington based journalist and sort of slow to come forward when the Kenyan report\nAnd the hard left were very distressing and completely inappropriate but if you look at public polling\nThe cabin are confirmation that Lisa approval of it is underwater and clearly a lot of the people who oppose justice cabin I was not one of them I was a favoring his confirmation I'm Glad he's on the court but there are a lot of people\nWho disagreed and surely the vast majority of them are not part of this angry mob so how do you draw distinctions between legitimate fair minded opposition\nTo that nomination and some of the ... really inexcusable excesses that you guys were subjected to\n[noise] well I mean depending on location you know if you're out at a rally that's one thing but if you're a writer and their capital they're trying to intimidate members who vote on the confirmation or ... a lot of restaurants or\nGo on to their homes so that's different from what we're accustomed to here in Washington which is peaceful protests about a whole lot of things I mean there are\nProtesters in Washington on any given day on some\nSubject and that's of course as American as apple pie but what was different about this was an effort to literally fried and intimidate our members to vote and guest judge Kavanaugh nobody felt the brunt of that anymore than Senator Susan Collins on boats and our own set of mine and then right here in the capital\nTalked about her role in the confirmation that speech that she gave sort of a Tour de force closing argument I listen to the entire thing when did you get a heads up that she was going to vote yes and why do you think of her speech\nWhile she was a profile in courage because she represents a blue state ... going for her to have done would have been to a ... a ... a justice Kavanaugh [noise] ah she ah quite land calmly ... evidence uh realize there was no core operation of the\nA story that was being told by a doctor for it and um [noise]\nUpheld the presumption of innocence and reach in my view the right decision and she did it in the midst of 'em really just wholesale effort to intimidate\nThere's been so much attention paid to the Kavanaugh confirmation process in particular for obvious reasons and some of which we've gone through\nBut less attention has been afforded to the incredible carousel\nOf confirmations that have been coming through the United States Senate you prioritize this from day one of the Trump presidency setting records for this pace and I'm Wondering if you can reflect on this I Know for many of our conservative listeners\nAnd this has been a priority for them and you sort of channeled that concern and put it at the at the front burner in the U.S Senate is that something that you plan on continuing to do moving into the midterms in the lame duck and potentially beyond that\n[noise] well yeah you know I Love the tax bill and I love all the other things were done this Congress but the closest thing you can a path to having a permanent impact on the country is through the courts lifetime appointments and the president's been sending up\nOutstanding a relatively young men and women who believe the job of judges to interpret the laws is written\nAnd those are the kind of people are being shut up I'm working for arming them as rapidly as they come out of the committee the twenty Ninth Circuit judges that were done so far as her record for any administration this early\nIn its charm and if we're lucky enough to still have the majority after the November election we're going to continue to do that and have a long term positive impact on the country\nNow I mean I've written extensively at town hall and said here on the show that I think the number one priority for Republican voters and twenty Eighteen\nShould be guaranteeing that Mitch McConnell remains the Senate majority leader in twenty Nineteen hopefully with a few more\nVotes in his back pocket it on the Republican side will get to the midterms but I Want to ask one more question on judges\nAnd it has to do with an answer you gave on Fox News Sunday recently where Chris Wallace push you a little bit on these so called Biden Rule that you invoked famously in twenty sixteen visa Merrick Garland where you said no no Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer said in a presidential year we have to let\nThe people decide so that's what we're going to do\nDonald Trump got elected was a big gamble paid off for you\nIn the hypothetical but not far fetched scenario that eight twenty twenty Supreme Court justice where to come up and you were or a vacancy we're to arise and you were to be in the position that you are now\nHow can you justify not invoking the same standard and I know it would be a difference in which party in the opposite parties would not\nGet a ... point that's the whole point of that wanted out horsing [noise]\nBut I pointed out you have to go back to the Eighteen eighties to find the last time\nA vacancy on the Supreme Court created during a presidential election year was confirmed by Senate of a different party and the president and I said that back in ... the the Biden situation\nWas ... Democrats in control of the Senate\nRepublican president there was a vacancy but he helpfully volunteer that if there were one they wouldn't fill it twenty oh seven Democrats in charge of the Senate George W. Bush and the presidency\nSchumer and read both set up a vacancy occurred Eighteen months before the end right of his term they wouldn't fill it so I was simply pointing out what the history of this is and that's [noise] that's exactly what we did and twenty six day in\nA Republican majority in the Senate a Democratic president\nSo if you guys were to maintain the majority after these midterm elections the argument would be this is kind of mandate you know the American people had an opportunity to but the Democrats back in charge and they decided not to so the situation is qualitatively different than twenty sixteen\nNotes or talk of the same you is under the scenario you point out\nUh you would not have a party in control of the Senate there was different\nFrom the uh a part of the president right oh look it's a it's an interesting hypothetical [noise] I don't know whether this will occur or not the first up if we're going to be able to continue to confirm judges at all levels\nOf not just the Supreme Court but circuits and districts as for those are the senator or buying a Republican majority and we're working very hard to try to make sure that happens in a couple of weeks\nAnd what do you think you have access to really good data and information that we don't based on what you are seeing beyond what we know publicly people the conventional wisdom is continuing Republicans are in pretty good shape probably to at least have\nFifty seats you know and then you'd have the vice president breaking the tie it'd be a nominal Republican majority do you feel like you guys are in the fifty fifty one ranger are you optimistic\nThat you are a majority could actually be swelled\n[noise] like I I never put a number on it but I can tell you that way I'm very close a cliffhanger races and places like Arizona Nevada Montana or North Dakota Missouri and day out or\nA West Virginia Tennessee in Florida\nAnd we start off with fifty one of those short off of forty nine I'd rather be at fifty one starting this spread to the finish than forty nine and I'm optimistic we can hold the Senate but I Can't give you know a production are not going to give your production our number\n[noise] do you believe that if the Democrats were to defy the odds and win back the Senate the confirmation of judges even at the circuit court level would stop completely out of the\nLast question for me uh and it's a legislative question between now in the election not much is going to happen I think everyone understands that but moving forward perhaps in the\nLame duck session or in the next Congress it's been such a bruising few months of political warfare we've got a tough election here is something like criminal justice reform a realistic opportunity to perhaps have a bipartisan vote particularly if you got\nOpposite parties controlling the two houses of Congress\nScale we've done a lot of stuff about ... the same way or the ... we did an overwhelmingly supportive uh opioid building up your of a bill and\nWere originally funded Seventy five percent of the government before the end of the fiscal year that at a Twenty years so look we've had some big fights but we're also able to accomplish things at the at the top of the list after we get\nFunding the remaining twenty four percent of the government and passing a farm bill and it's possible we're going to take a look at criminal justice ... what the whip couch ... support the rows\nOf for some version of it but clearly we're up to fund the remaining ... percent of the ... budget on stage and pass a farm bill and we're going to continue to process the judges\nAs you have very faithful inconsistency I mean I've been waiting the Mitch McConnell flag\nFor a while because of this issue um and so on from my part us in conservative standpoint I think that that's\nThe most important legacy of this Congress and frankly if I may say some of your leadership a Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the Senate majority leader we appreciate your time this evening thank you for joining deck you All right we're going to step aside we will come back a lot to get too including that first topic I mentioned with Senator McConnell\nThis scandal that's blowing up around Saudi Arabia and how our government ought to respond to it is the president doing the right thing I'm not sure I Know Murray has thoughts she will be here on the other side of this break\nSome Republicans in that state who vote and if they were sleeping before Kavanaugh's that probably change some things but look the fact that cruises favorable in these polls are ten points higher than ... is ... it's amazing to me\nYeah and I think the one thing and we're going to move on to North Dakota in a second but one thing that will be interesting as I said oh and here's an Democrats have registered a ton of new voters we don't have all the exact numbers but it will be interesting to see how many they've actually registered how many of those actually turned out to vote and what impact that\nHad I think it's probably still a seat that tankers is going to win by Donald Trump going down to Texas to campaign for him\nYou know I ... it's now it's not every year I should say that there are national Republican party has to put money into the ...\nI mean the only way cruise loses is if many many many many many Texas Republican stay home and aren't engaged and I think Trump wants to make sure that this momentum that's been built yeah\nI mean the people that I Know on the cruise campaign say they've been hovering in the nine ten range in their internal up nine up ten for for weeks now\nI'm so we'll see you mentioned North Dakota we talked about it briefly on the program yesterday Heidi Heitkamp this epic failure by her campaign where they listed a bunch of women publicly in an ad as survivors of assault\nThat they had gotten from victims advocacy grow right without checking or getting permission\nThey they thought that group had it which is a huge screw up\nUm and they push you put out a statement today I deeply regret this mistake we are in the process an issue we never attraction personally apologized and each of the people impacted by that and taking the necessary steps to ensure that never happens again and guy\nYou'll remember during Kavanaugh's she was very emotional when she was asked about sexual assault and talked about her mother had been a victim herself\nYeah and so I mean they out some of these women without their consent some of them that they listed weren't even victims and now some of them are saying who actually were victims saying now my abuser knows where I live it's just\nIt's a catastrophe for them I'll just say this I think that she was in very big trouble any way before this happened then she voted no on Kavanaugh then this giant misstep\nI think she'll lose and I don't think it'll be that close but her abject know BS apology I actually appreciate it it was not blame shifting or ... she was just like yup massive screw up and the buck stops here like [noise] I appreciate that because some politician ...\nShe's a real person at the end of the day we're going to take a break we'll come back right after\nThat [noise]\n\n\nCompelling [noise]\nAnd this week in Nineteen eighty nine during a game against his own team the Oilers hockey greats Wayne Gretzky breaks greenhouse National Hockey league\nCareer scoring record is one thousand eight hundred and fifty points Gretzky retired in Nineteen Ninety nine holding records for most career goals most career this ten most career points two thousand eight hundred and fifty seven that you're probably hard radio weekends Ford's time capsule and now look back at this week in history this week and I think\nLooking back Benson and heart for both the New York today appreciate you listening wherever you are across the fruit of plane or perhaps across the globe [noise]\nMm well it it's very exciting because we are

newsroom trace Gallagher welcome to Benson and heart\nIt's great to be her guys I mean it's been a long enough\nCome on invited me on that is you know what that is truly one will blame our producer for that yeah take part in\nThe show really has great than I Am an avid listener and so I'm I'm very happy for both of\nYou think is very ... so you are following this story that we're about to talk about uh for really the next couple of segments which is the drama in Istanbul right and this now ten you know\nTension that's brewing between the U.S government the western world and the Saudi Arabian government with this disappearance and apparent murder\nOf one of their nationals who's also someone who lives here in the United or lived here in the United states contributed to the Washington Post what is the very latest as we head into this conversation that you're hearing about a really this really a significant firestorm\nYeah well we know now that the Saudis are about to acknowledge we don't know exactly when but sometime today tomorrow they're about to acknowledge the death of democracy Yogi\nWas in their terms and interrogation gone wrong now I'm exactly how ... and goes wrong we don't know but but that's part of the whole method of of what we're planning to hear from the Saudis at some point in time now we do know the Turkish investigators\nThey finally got inside the Saudi constantly been winning for days remember this happened October second he walked in\nTo the Saudi consulate in Istanbul October second and never walked out we know that because there's surveillance video of him walking in there is nothing of him walking out so the Turkish investigators have been saying now for days and days let us inside let us inside so they've gotten inside\nThe consulate in Istanbul they've collected large amounts of DNA samples they won't say\nWhat the samples are but we now know they found identical samples from the Saudi conflict and the residents of of the Saudi consul general in Istanbul which is\nAn indicator without saying what it is it's an indicator that it's more evidence\nThat he was in fact killed inside the consulate and then somehow brought out now of course the New York times\nIs reporting today that Turkish media obtained these recordings we've been hearing so much about in recent days I mean there's been talk that that ... show he actually was wearing an iPhone watch\nAnd that the watch actually recorded his death and the torture that went along with that and the New York times is reporting and the Turkish media are reporting that that this was a gruesome audiotape\nThat was released or at least obtained by the Turkish media you know and and I hate to go into detail but but things like the fact that that his fingers may have been severed during interrogation that he was he was beheaded and dismembered and remembered the ferry from Turkish investigators was that he walked in\nHe was killed in some capacity and then was dismembered and his body was taken out of that conflict and of course there's the whole theory of look they these two plane show up in Saudi Arabia on the very day\nThat ... show he is going into the conflict so the two playing show up Fifteen people on these planes the Turkish government cause them a hit team they've identified a number of these people a number of these people have been\nIdentified as having closer ties to the crown prince and Saudi Arabia which doesn't bode well for his story well you know I didn't order this I had nothing to do with this so\nIt's kind of all fitting together now and the more we get from the DNA samples and if this audio tape is released we should have a lot more information about this in the coming days\nTrees and a question on the investigation I understand that ...\nThat they're they're dealing on and that's what I think secretary ... talking to them about when he was just in Riyadh but\n... family the Washington Post other organizations have called for an independent investigation saying that the Saudis are the main suspect they probably shouldn't be the ones doing the investigation do you get the sense that there is any\nPossibility of some other outside investigation by I don't know some other you know international body out there\nWell I think Turkish investigators are really one of the primary sources here I mean the Saudis the Saudi Arabians say look we we walk this investigated they're saying we want to a thorough and transparent investigation but you're right very I mean look if you're investigating yourself how thorough and transparent can be\nSo the idea here is that U.S authorities are now working with Turkish authorities trying to get to the bottom of this and as much as Saudi Arabia says they're going to be involved they are going to handle this", "show_name": "The Alan Colmes Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "18"}
