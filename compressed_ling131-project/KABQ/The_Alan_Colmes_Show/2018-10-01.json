I Know something along the way you know going\nBack Lee how he behaved absolutely like somebody really wants to make something over his head and then the other thing I wanted to comment about roughly ... of course related to the same um topic is that\nI thought the commentators um I happen to be watching ABC um you know I thought Cokie Roberts for example she called it a when he when Kevin was testifying and with the tears and just as our or an earlier caller Anita mentioned that\nUm you know if a woman cried that much she would you be considered emotional should not be credible and all of that\nFurther more um after Kevin us testimony done the male commentators were oh suddenly they were very swayed by his testimony which which I really didn't get further more there was another\nI I didn't see I they seem to fall for his stuff or something I I didn't quite get that\nThe other comment that I thought was interesting and I'd love to hear what other women think about this because clearly men and women\nSee things very differently every this uh this whole situation very differently ... there were comments made about how things are different now and in today's climate how this and that is different and you know I'm the situation is seen through a different lens and I would say I submit to you\nThat there are plenty of women out there who were just as outraged during the Anita Hill I'm debacle um as as they are now that that women back then find is pretty messed up\nUm and and ... Thomas says the slime ball that he was\nAnd it was you know it's no different today like not much has changed maybe what has changed is that some men are a little more enlightened than they used to be but I think women have been clued in for a long time and um I thought the seeming ignorance of these male commentators was\nIt a little bit you know outrageous and and raging and on\nAnd so it's a long slow process what we do it as real consciousness what we're doing is we're getting guys to open their eyes and to understand that to see things differently\nAnd it's been twenty seven years we have made progress we have it's slow you got to just keep working at it Ruth I Know we're in patient I'd like to get there faster too but this is just how humans are\nDanielle thanks for being with us in Arizona high\nCrime or man add that and I'm calling I'm a longtime listener eleven yeah thank you [noise] um I\nHate that piggyback off of that we're going to need it they kinda covered it all by you know we liberal or progressive were supposedly the snowflakes but there was no composure and this morning I mean absolutely none that was Senator Grassley\nOrrin Hatch I'm Lindsey Lindsey Graham for crying out loud and he just had an emotional breakdown up there and Brett Kavanaugh all the crying all the tears\nAnd I realized that this has been hard on families than that and I respect that I had known how family what am I think\nThat that point he said not fair you know mad 'cause oh cost you a a Supreme Court feet by\n... how can like oh this is ruined his life you know we've all had plenty of job interviews that we didn't get the job this is the same thing you may have worked all your life and I'm sure if you're a lawyer death you know but everybody aspires to but hey it doesn't always\nAlways get a job you want\nAnd you don't always get it and he's up there and the thing is you find that boy when Trump nominated him it's not like you know no no it might be too\nMuch and I had to be able\nTo handle it if you think yeah I think the nomination out he was complaining about all the questions\nIn all the it was blind you'll [laughter] believe me I mean you signed up for it and\nI got to leave it there because the time has run on us but I'm Glad you love the show in Arizona where justice is served\nOn my\nWay home\nSay they're rock and roll lovers this anti west wouldn't take the trip back to this week in rock and roll history start off in Nineteen Seventy eight where the members of Aerosmith bell thirty bans out of jail after they were arrested for smoking pot during an Aerosmith concert at Fort Wayne coliseum softly nice to them\nThis week in Nineteen eighty six popular news anchor Dan Rather was attacked by a man who hit them from behind them repeats the phrase Ken is what is the frequency prompting R.

leading up to the midterm elections bench Shapiro welcome back to have you\nHey thanks for having to appreciate it\nOkay um I just sort of got this ball rolling on our show tonight with my very brief thoughts of course I'll be expanding on them over the course of the next two hours I wanted his hand the floor to you ban tell us your trajectory today your thoughts on how this hearing has gone and where are we ending up\nBut I get hurt you described his roller coaster and there's no question that's exactly what this was the way that they the morning began was with the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford\nAs as you I found her her\nStatements compelling I thought that she did not get any sort of corroborating evidence you didn't get any ability to lie down her story there is significant inconsistencies in her story or you know with regard to the number of people who are present at the party that you're talking that she still can't get location she still can't give date\nLike she was inconsistent with regard to some of the statements that she made of recent vintage for example she suggested that she didn't know whether she'd given her psychiatrist notes the Washington Post the Washington Post reported that she'd done so\nBut what it really came down to was she said listen I may miss remember a lot of things but the one thing I definitely definitely one hundred percent a hundred percent remember is that Brett Kavanaugh lay on top of me and attempted to\nRip off my clothes and put his hand them out by screening they everything else changes but that's the one thing that doesn't change and she said that repeatedly which is basically all that she had to do and she said so with obviously great emotional content now my big problem with the way that the Republicans round the hearing and they didn't make clear what the purpose of the hearing loss because\nWithout any corroborating evidence there is no way to get the truth or fall city or mistaken this offer allegations there's just no way to do it all you got his or allegations which are on their face credible she seems like a credible person that the way that you expressed herself\nShe ... me but there's no way to corroborate that with any outside evidence and so the question becomes can you take down a man and destroy his life not just his career his life based on a ... an allegation alone\nThat's really all the sharing should've been about what Republicans should have said it listen\nWe may be inclined believe your story but without any corroborating evidence there is no way for us to actually achieve any objective measure of certainty\nThat Brett Kavanaugh was responsible for this particularly in the face of the fact that every witness you cited\nSays that they were not there at a party like this and Brett Kavanaugh has denied it wholesale Republicans didn't do that and so forth look like winter not only did she looked like the winter from the morning Brett Kavanaugh looked like he was basically tells you looked at looks by the end of the the poured part of the hearing like Brett Kavanaugh will come back because\nYou know I Want to want to get to that in just a second I Want to pivot to Kavanaugh in a moment but I just want to address a few things that you just said on the memory piece of it\nI don't find it implausible that someone who was sexually assaulted and had a really traumatic event happened to them many years ago would remember that\nQuite clearly even if she couldn't remember certain other things even more recently right like me that he was totally agree that it's plausible and I also I I Know there are some people on the right none of the Republicans that I've seen correctly have have have steered clear to steer clear of this but there are people on the right who were saying this is\nA con job right is what the president said um this is a conspiracy so on and so forth she did not strike me as someone ban who was coming on the stand and making up all lie to bring down Brett Kavanaugh and in fact there is evidence that she tried to reach out and get this into the bloodstream before he was never nominated\nTo me do you agree at least with that assessment that she did not strike me at all as a deliberate liar\nYeah I totally agree I I think that she believes what she's saying now whether what she's saying the objective truth is another question but she believes I think the truth of what she is saying which by the way is\nWhat the polygraph supposedly shows even the polygraphs are scientifically non ballot I'm so that that's where it stands with with regard to her you know I don't mind so let me see I find it largely credible that the only thing should remember even in question and not the surrounding details and somebody who was\nYou know actually beaten in high school pretty badly by some guys at the end of it when I was maybe Thirteen Years old I remember a lot of this around at least I remember plate I remember time remember kind of general date would be hard to ... the fact that this event happened in a public setting or semi public setting and no one remembers anything\nDoes call this and the question that again doesn't really go to the nature of for allegations as much as it does to the lack of corroborating evidence\n... so ... where I let you sort of like a leave off for a moment there was\nA kind of and I hate to liken this to a sporting event 'cause it's so much more significant these people's lives but kind of half time of this right everyone was doing their houses and the game kind of looked not necessarily over but bleak and then cabinet comes out I have to tell you a ban\nI was stunned by the tone and content of what he said and\nAt first like for the first few seconds I was like is this the right tone for him and then I just I couldn't look away I was transfixed and I went on this emotional journey with him the way that I had filled emotional about her never expected that that was going to happen with Brett Kavanaugh but it did for me\nYeah that's right I I thought before hand the only way that he's going to be able to actually save themselves here is to come out with the righteous indignation of wrong ban and that is that really did I just knew he was capable of it because if you watched his original Senate Judiciary confirmation hearing aids does dish water and then if\nYou watch his his interview with Martin like Allen I mean he's a speed bump of\nCourse that's watered down watered down dish water was that interview\nYeah that's right and and his dad and he came and then he came out today and this is the guy who obviously\nBelieves that he is innocent and as being wrong and that he's being maligned by Democrats are seeking to destroy his life and his family on debate on verified end or false allegation and he came out extraordinarily strong very powerful obviously very angry no holds barred\nTypically it's it what surprised me is I think that all of us in the political business who tend to you know be passionate about politics and our part than we thought okay that's how I Would write I was watching that I was thinking\nIf I if I Would if somebody did this to me I come out with both at flipping both bird and screening the airport and the cabinet did everything short of that right came out and he said look this is harder than Democrat nonsense they're coming out to destroy might like this is vicious crap\nI there there's no excuse for it\nI did is that I've never done any of these things it's a it it is a smear and then he talked in in really emotional tour as bad as family the impact that his family you talked about Ford at no point did he can and great for\nYou know kept suggesting that that board you know she has a lot of sympathy for her and he thinks something happened or but it wasn't him a and I think that played in his favor but the fact that suddenly you had this very calm low key guy\nBeing as passionate as anybody I've ever seen on a on a national political stage and defending himself and\nGetting toward up by the fact that this is impacted established white and they get they either this guy is the best I can remember seeing a sociopath or he's telling the truth so you have at the end of his testimony\nAnd Democrats would describe himself throughout this process and and they are questioning of of him which is continuing right now obviously has been similarly disgraceful and you had Sheldon Whitehouse literally sitting there asking Brett Kavanaugh about fart jokes in his high school yearbook because they\nHaven't been having a sort of cut into that and leaned into the forest and I think Rand circles around White House who sort of a clown there were some Democrats who were better any club which are was better Chris Coons was better it got a little Snoopy at one point with club chore and apparently ABC News is reporting that during a break in the action Cavanaugh I went over to her to apologize\nFor the tone that he took at the end of that exchange was I think actually probably on balance has the right thing\nFor him to do so let's skip ahead right now senator tell us a Republican in North Carolina during the questioning we still got Spartacus we still got ... Harris we've still got I think Ted Cruz and a handful of others\nAnd less there is some sort of enormous bombshell that drops in the next hour let's say as this thing wraps up it's very likely that we're going to end\nThis dramatic day with two witnesses who were extremely compelling where would that leave us where should that leave us\n... I mean it shouldn't leave us with Kevin loving convert because you have to witnesses quite compelling and candid and only one witness with corroborating evidence on his side and the the the accuser in this particular case has no corroborating evidence and in fact at Kavanaugh said there's rubble evidence from people that she has cited as witnesses to the vet so that\nWay just to interrupt Larry quickly I I'm Sorry to interrupt but I Want to make sure we have little time with you left here what about the other allegations somebody might say well if it was only this then maybe that's right but there was this other stuff that sort of bubbling out their Yale and the gang rape thing and what if any of that is true what's your response to that argument\nI mean I think that joke and a Democrat any really bother asking about it the the Deborah Ramirez has no al ... has no verification at all he was not a serious question about his behavior at Yale by a single Democrat he was certainly not ask any serious questions about the gang rape allegations which\nRamirez her own story Ramirez doubts Ryan story\nThat's right so none of this it all comes down to do you believe the unverified and uncorroborated allegation of one woman enough to destroy the life of a man was about to be on the Supreme Court and I think in the\nOf Kavanaugh's dairy salad and and ... it can be very hard for Republicans to to look their voters and they had the building down because I truly believe that the guys you know an attempted rape is\nAt some point or your\nStation home\nAnd now the hard way to go we can sport time\nCapsule sports fans of Sandy lasted I'm here to take you on a journey back\nTo this week in sports history let's start back in Nineteen Twenty one and the first broadcast of the world series on radio in New York Yankees beat the New York giants three to zero this week in Nineteen fifty five Baltimore cult full\nBack Alan and meet she becomes the first rookie in NFL history to top one hundred yards rushing and the first two games get a hundred and fifty three against the Detroit Lions after his one hundred and Ninety four yard performance debut against the Chicago Bears\nThis week in Nineteen eighty four Walter\n...

her mother of the re I really didn't so we played a lot of a doctor for it earlier in the show I Want to play some more of Kavanaugh he wasn't just\nAngry he was also emotional ties particularly when he talked about the toll this has been taking on his family when he was thinking about some of his very best friends thinking about his parents thinking about his daughters so I Want to start with some of the the anger yes he was furious with some of these Democrats\nI think rightfully so listen to the case he makes against them in cut let's play twenty five and twenty six back to back\nSince

physical threat against my family to send any violent email to my wife to make any kind of allegation against me against my friends to blow me up and take me down\n[noise] he went out of his way to not called doctor for an ally or to not malign her intentions and to say that his heart and his family's hearts go out to her nevertheless she was asked point blank is there any chance it was someone who was not Brett Kavanaugh and she said no chance\nThat got turned my bike on that's how you know I've been here all day she said one hundred percent right with hand and then he said one hundred percent you didn't do it correct I mean a document that we met at the definition said she said\nListen listen to ... thirty two she says a hundred percent here's his categorical denial\nI'm not

and when they were both talking about that that's what got to me like when I started to get a little bit emotional\nWhat what she was going through and I mentioned this in the last hour the idea that she was just coming up to be part of a partition smear and putting herself and her family through this I Do not buy that for one second\nRate and she didn't come across that what she did not come in any like she seemed to actually we were talking about like totally naive about Washington like totally devoid of of the D.C stuff and I also don't drink beer\nI Wonder if you agree I postulated earlier I think that her lawyers may have been doing some posturing and hiding the football without her knowledge like when she didn't know that there was an offer for them to come out and interview her in California yeah the whole I Can't fly thing it seemed like she was like of course I why I feel like the lawyers\nMight have been driving the train and sort of insulating her from some of those things that they were doing publicly or telling members 'cause she seemed\nLike she was not on board with that or was not aware of that\nAlthough she did seem like she genuinely doesn't like to fly I

hearing\nSen Lindsey Graham\nHad enough of everything she did not want anyone else asking questions on his behalf he had something to get off of his chest and Lindsey Graham is a pretty bipartisan Republican sometimes to the chagrin of conservatives\nAnd as he points that will probably play this in the audio he voted for both of President Obama's justices who are now on the bench so am I your and Kagan\nAnd he\nGot that up he got fed up with what he's been seeing and he decided to say something so he asked for his time and chairman Grassley recognized him and the next few minutes we're just extraordinary I've never seen Lindsey Graham this angry pretty happy ... go lucky guy\nNot today\nThe context of this is the Democrats were hounding Kavanaugh to personally call for an FBI investigation for the FBI to investigate this person or that person and determined to saying turn to the White House counsel and instruct gym that you want this any club which are\nOr to slap down Durbin a little bit later on implying that it was theatrical she says I'm not going to do that\nWith all this FBI stuff floating around I'm sitting here thinking\nYou know what could have been done if they really wanted a lengthy investigation into this charge they could have maybe investigated it for two months when Dianne Feinstein the Democrats had this information they did not and now they want

[noise] [noise]\n\n\nMore sound him on Fox News talk\n[noise]\nHome stretch on Benson and ... [noise]\nI Want to close tonight\nBy kind of reiterating what I said at the start\nThis was one of the most remarkable memorable days in my career covering politics\n\nI began this morning watching Dr Ford\nAnd she exceeded my expectations of what she would be as a witness not that I had low expectations she was a very good witness\nAnd I remember thinking\nShe seems credible what do we deal with that but if Kavanaugh is it credible or as credible\nHow do you weigh the evidence or the lack there of versus the statements and how compelling they are all these years later under all this pressure\n\nThat just say I I really respected her and what she had her answers for the most part as I said for good they made sense they seem to normal\nThey kind of added up there were a few false notes especially at the end some of the launch a question where we're odd\nBut\nThen Kavanaugh's comes out and give us an opening statement the likes of which I was completely unprepared for and Florida you should've seen my phone blow up\nThere were people who are texting and emailing me during the previous part of the hearing saying oh my gosh he's cooked\nAnd then the same people were like oh my gosh we did not see this coming I Believe him now\nI saw some people ... on Twitter journalists lefty is always unhinged always crying\nIf you had your life turned upside down just try to imagine if you had your life turned upside down with false allegations on this stage with people trying to destroy you the timing of this everything the way it's gone down and your children are getting death threats\nAnd not only are they threatening your seat on the Supreme Court they're threatening your ability maybe to get hired at law school without having people picketing your classroom or teach law coach little league or or basketball\nLiterally everything that he had worked towards in his life was being threatened and the people that he loved and loves were being hurt and that's why he got choked up and that's why he was angry how dare you\nHow dare you say that someone in that position shouldn't get upset and guess what if he hadn't gotten upset if he had been sort of the wooden monotone guy that we saw in Martha show remember I said he's got to do something different than that if he had done that again all look they doesn't care he's rehearsed he's a sociopath\nHe's an feeling\nThat's the problem with this whole process for me with a lot of people on the left it's just a lose lose parade no matter what he does no matter what the Republicans do lose lose\nI think most people\nListening to him saw a man who believe with every fiber of his being that he was telling the truth and I also think that is true of her and I do not know where that leads us\nRight it's kind of ... and I was talking about this earlier it's kind of disconcerting\nTo see these two people said diametrically opposite things that cannot both be true\nIn reality it ... it might be true in both of their minds in a fix sort of way but in reality it's someone who's not\nGetting it right that'd be so persuaded to both by both of them to both of the airports so to me it keeps coming back to the evidence\nFrom the time she chose not to tell anyone for Thirty years she may have had good reasons for that but it makes it hard to corroborate that her memory now is what it was thirty six years ago for what it wasn't twenty twelve [noise]\nAnd there's no other\nCooperation including from the people that she plays at that party in her letter details of what sort of changed a little bit I mean

so I sort of had this groundswell of coming together I sort of had some warm feelings about how we can work together and talk to each other yeah so I put my idea on the table on Twitter I Will read to you\nWhat I put on the table but first Senator McConnell just took to the floor guys if we can take this let's jump into the Senate majority leader probably talking about this very issue live\nForty hour\nGeorge Cabot all testified on every topic from complicated legal subjects [noise] there's some sort of\nPartial butter and then there were testimony on so much from countless personal friends qualifies coworkers former clerks\nSaid other associate [noise] so the picture that they voted for all this is clear judge Kavanaugh is one of the most qualified or most impressive Supreme Court nominees in the history of our country [noise] he's excelled at a level of wiggle scholarship\nHills tutor Rouge rail and for years is lectured\nAt the Harvard law school this year more than three hundred legal opinions from what is widely considered the second highest court in the notion\nSeveral have been cited in sub prime minister for imports all\nMajority opinion along the way is built an

peers and by renowned legal scholars from across the logical spectra\nOne self described liberal Democrat who advised him in jail or the judge Kavanaugh quote\nCommand wide and the prospect among scholars\nAnd jurors had this prize has been echoed hundreds of character witnesses who testified before the Senate\nOr written a letter to produce Joe traveled all personal character that isn't terribly to fill the strongest charge the committee is also thoroughly investigated a last minute allegations that have been brought forward\nEvidence that has been producer either ... there's ...\nForeign ... unequivocal that are in some cases\nThe accusers have been having recanted\nTheir baseless allegation all in all this is the nominees receive what many consider the gold standard of judicial qualification\nReading of unanimously well qualified\nFrom the American bar association [noise]\nMost of the nomination it deserves to move forward and that is precisely\nArgument or college on the committee for setting this impressive dominated here to the floor with fiber will recommend to show them\nThat we will keep the process moving\nThe full set of over ... considering judge Kavanaugh's nomination [noise]\nAll right sounds like we may have lost the feed there for a moment McConnell still talking um and this was when he was about to get into I think\nI did I miss the part about the week to lay in the FBI investigation\nNo I think that he is\nHe was just maybe mentioning some of that and it looks like he's now show papers that's interesting\nBecause he also put out a paper statement where he did not reference the FBI although his office has agreed to it yes they have no but it's he ... on Twitter he said today with the ... miss that part of my conference then and will proceed to nomination\nHe he doesn't even mention the week yes even mentioned the investigation so he's moving forward with the cloture vote I think he is but it's interesting that he's not talking about this deal you are just about to get into all of it yes um\nBefore you do I will say that Jeff Flake\nIs retiring he's not running for reelection he was among a handful of Republican senators who are undecided about cabinet\nAnd who I think we're impacted by yesterday's testimony from Dr Ford into the night he said he was still undecided he was really wrestling with it\nSo it seems like there was a lot of pressure on flake particularly because he's on the committee he was confronted in the hallway that the Senate today by two activists to their feet and I can make you very forcefully told him their own stories of sexual assault and said why are you asking for an investigation\nI'm so he was under quite a bit of pressure he's good friends with Chris Coons on the committee and to a gay guy we heard from each Democrat who spoke that they kept saying why can't we have\nPresidents and roll uh a week or you know just to set period of time to look into this it was clear flake\nHard questions that were unanswered from yesterday's hearing and this seems like at a compromise that that is a good wine tell our listeners exactly what's going to happen\nHave okay so here's my version of it and then we'll tell you what flake\nWe already told you what flake has put out is apparently now been agreed to ... to have\nA week at the most FBI investing\nIn limited scope so I said this morning on Twitter a relatively modest and seemingly achievable idea is to assign to FBI agents to speak with mark judge within the next twenty four to forty eight hours ask them questions take his statement in entered into the record this would respect judges wishes not to speak publicly\nWould avoid a lengthy delay\nAnd would on some level satisfy Democrats insistence that he'd be subjected to something beyond writing a letter\nYes I Know his letters were submitted to the committee under penalty of perjury and I know Democrats intentionally time leading this allegation against the accusers explicit wishes poisoned all of this\nI'm just trying to find some reasonable solution that would get at least that would at least diffuse some of the sky high rancor that would allow each side to feel like it gained something in this ugly process without surrendering are totally getting steam world perhaps this is a naive hope at this stage\nAnd then I added a little bit later on\nLet me just grow up to this hang on one second I'm I added basically that I was going to vote that I Would vote for Kavanaugh if I were a member of this committee so\nI'm Sorry to breaking guy we just got enough my producer that Chad per ground who has been covering this story up on Capitol Hill all day is able to call in a few minutes let's break we'll talk to him and then we'll come

yes with the rest of the Republican Smoot is out of committee earlier today it appears that he and the Republicans are going to vote yes on cloture to keep the process moving\nBut this is his demand after huddling with some Democrats\nAs I said a few moments ago I think in our first segment\nI had more or less suggested something like this this morning on Twitter and I also then expanded on it in my piece of town hall dot com today in titled after an extraordinarily emotional hearing here's why I Would vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh that was my peas explaining why\nOr that if I were a member of the Senate I Would vote yes on him but I also laid out towards the end of this piece this cause I accommodation in my view very modest compromise\nWith the Democrats talking a lot about an FBI investigation\nLike a full blown investigation I don't think is it sounds to me like a delay tactic\nBut the clocks no checking on the nomination\nSend the FBI out more judges lawyer said they'd be happy to do it in private mhm ask the questions get it on the record and put it into the file and there's the two other potential fact witnesses who were both sent letters to the committee as well under penalty of perjury saying we don't remember this\nFine have the FBI recorded and ask a couple of questions the reason that I thought that this was\nA good idea is not because I was hardcore committed to it or because I thought it would be terribly useful but because\nOur politics are a tinderbox right now is it feels like we're on the brink of something even worse\nAnd it disturbs me is something that I've talked about on the show this week I was trying to come up with a a compromise solution earlier in the way you might remember and do we talked about this very idea on the show yesterday\nWhat I Believe this\nVery modest away could do is number one if someone totally changes their testimony or what they've said\nIn a huge way a bombshell and it blows them up because he's been lying or something that we couldn't get more information than he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court if he's been lying or something like that I think it is unlikely that that's going to happen\nBut here's my thing this allows\nThis is not about senator Booker or senator Hirono or Brian Fallon or some of these hardcore partisans they're never going to be satisfied with this they want to defeat Kavanaugh period I see that Ford's lawyers have already rejected this saying it's it's too short it's not good enough they they said it's it's\nThey said they don't think there should be a time machine but they welcome the investigation\nSo so I just think\nThis allows some important\nBoxers to be checked in the minds of a couple of wavering senators but also almost on some level as important a significant chunk of the country that is not sure what I just outcome is for this process there's a lot of people who are sort of\nNot quite certain who to believe\nAnd they hear the Democrats going on and on about the FBI thing and they say okay maybe some of that does sound a little bit reasonable like why not just dot the I's and cross the cheese and have the FBI take a seventh wanted this guy one more time in his background investigation and if the FBI can do that in the limited\nWay the physically look at these allegations which they haven't done before I write in a in a\nDiscrete\nSensitive time limited way I think it might enhance the credibility\nOf the confirmation process and therefore justice Kavanaugh if he gets installed on the court because the cloud that a lot of the hardcore left would be pointing and sort of look at that dark cloud never an FBI investigation all these allegations there's whispers about maybe we'll try to impeach the guy\nThis could diffuse some of that left some of the air out of that balloon help\nSome people who in their gut feel like maybe one more thing might be helpful to them make peace with this is not going to appease the hard left that's not what I'm arguing that never would have been arguing yeah I think you're going to let the Murkowski's Collins flakes mentions donnelley's maybe a high camp those types of people to say All right\nThey go back to their constituents and they say he is absolutely qualified for the job\nThere was this serious allegation is now we fought for a hearing and we got it we
