I was like the peak of my life I was leaning I was me and I\nWas ready to go and so I felt great and when I took the margin on my past more exam first time it enough to do it again but I mean your point is really important one\nWhich is get some exercise get a good night's sleep on a regular basis\nRight and and and get some spiritual nurturing who surround yourself with people who are who will help you and nurture you and Michelangelo on that note the clock is looking at me saying norm new show when's ended Michelangelo I'm Sorry that is our last\nNote for this evening the good news is of course I'm back with you tomorrow let's see what the world looks like tomorrow and\nHave you noticed reelection does your graduation is a week from this coming Tuesday do you notice that once were just as there's going to be served\n\nTour deductive power now partly inspired to his character Sherlock Holmes years later this week uh nineteenth they'd be Twenty one year old girl Lloyd becomes the first African American to play in an NBA game when you take the court in the season opener for the Washington Capitals\nTwo other black players joined the NBA that season the Celtics drafted ...

and those searchers focus for debris has been found ... reports\nSo I think we're all trying to be very careful we don't want to assign blame when we don't know what happened yet I Will say just before I get into more thoughts on this there is some conspiracy theory\nTalk in the far right wing that these were a democratic false flag that there are Democrats who did this to try and blame Republicans right before the midterms\nI we don't know who did it yet but that kind of theory I find\nReally gross and I don't we can talk about that later but that is out there in the far right um but at this point\nJust the rush in general to take a bad situation and find some way to cram it into your pre determined partisan narrative drives me crazy and when some people on the right decided to do that particularly in this case\nTo blame this on the left it just it ... and ...\nWait yes after the school shooting there were some on the left blaming Trump blaming Republicans that sort of knee jerk partisanship is such a pet peeve of mine particularly in these types of circumstances and you've written about this a lot yes on ... like I'm pretty consistent on this so\nMy thoughts on and I what I said to you is I think there's a middle ground here right I think we can have a smart discussion or debate about political rhetoric in this country about ah how he did things have gotten about what leaders say\nWithout knowing yet why this person did it I think we have to be able as adults and Americans to do both\nWithout assigning blame and I don't think that's like an a wink wink at assigning blame I think it's fair for us I mean look I've been defending on Fox News channel where I'm On TV on this show elsewhere\nYou know recently I've been asked to explain Hillary Clinton's comments or Eric Holder's comment or comment some on the right felt were\nUm threatening or that could be perceived as threatening by their followers\nFor just a rejection of civility and that kind of right\nAnd so that same\nThe same questions I get asked by the right on some of those comments I Want you now throw back at the right and say we don't know why this person did this\nBut we need to be able to talk about the fact that\nIn our country right now we demonize the opposition we question their motives and the leader of the country who I Want to be president for everyone\nCalls his political opponents evil he calls for them to be locked up and I don't want to do a lot well but Democrats say bad things to I Want to talk first about the president because he's the president and he has the bully pulpit and I'm also happy to talk about Democrats but I I Want to just focus on him for a second because\nHe came out last night didn't mention that CNN had also received a bomb and blame basically he the one group he called on to be better\nWith the media [noise]\nI thought that was tone deaf at best\nHe criticized that and then this morning tweeted that the anger out there is because of\nThey didn't just call up and maybe you talked about political figures and he talked about politicians\nBut the one group he criticized and said you guys need to do better and then this morning on Twitter said the anger out there is because of you was the media not even acknowledging that the media had in fact\nAlso received a bomb and had to evacuate so the president I think has a responsibility not to say his opponents are anti American they're evil\nLock her up all pay your bills if you're if you get arrested for beating up protesters\nBecause he's the president and he had a huge bully pulpit that people will listen to and if you say something that's so out there and you don't like all of his language either\nBut if you say something that's so out there that that your followers here I mean his campaign sent out an anti CNN fundraising email two hours after they received a bomb people see that people who are who have proclivities towards violence see that and think oh I see the enemy\nThey're the enemy of the people like the president said and what do you do to your enemies you try and destroy them\nAnd so I think we need to be able to have the conversation even though we don't know all the facts about discourse in this country yeah I I think it's a cop out to say we can't have it so we know all the\nBy the facts are important of course ah 'cause we had a huge conversation about civility and discourse when Gabby Giffords was shot and it turned out that that\nShooting at nothing to do with civility or discourse it fit a narrative on ... I mean joining someone as well but he was a schizophrenia who was obsessed with\nHer for completely a political reasons but we have this giant national civility panic in which conservatives were repeatedly attacked in blamed based on a lack of factual information\nAnd I had been I think quite consistent I agree with almost everything you said about the excesses of Trump in his rhetoric and I talk about it on the show and I wish she didn't do those things and it's one of his clear flaws in my mind I Do not connect those troops and those problems with Trump\nTo something like these bombs what\nIf the person turns that huge Trump supporter right reach we'd solve this stuff on line like what if there's evidence that it is\nSo I wrote about exactly that question last summer after the school shooting [noise] so you had a baseball field full of Republican congressmen a leftist\nShot them shot up them an attempt to do a mass assassination and went back and looked at his social media profiles and all of this and it was very clear that he was\nAn office in the opposition against Republicans she checked to make sure they were Republican before he started shooting he shouted this is for health care it was in the middle of a very intense debate in which\nRepublican proposals were you know people were saying this will people will die if we pass this law was very hyper charge\nAnd then he took it upon himself to try to murder some Republicans and I wrote that day that afternoon of the school shooting this shooter alone\nIs responsible for his actions not the political left and not political rhetoric because even though I had significant problems with the demagoguery coming against conservatives and Republicans from the left about health care I think it is unfair fundamentally and I think it's a form of silencing to try to\nSocialize the blame for the acts of an unhinged individual and say well it's because you're rhetoric over here is too hyper charge so cool it I don't think there's that sort of bright line to be drawn I think it's I really don't think it's fair\nWhat if there's a fuzzy line though because I agree with you that whoever did this is the one responsible we we agree on that I completely what if there's a funny line though is my point like like if if\nIf this person says or if they are alive who knows who this person that they said yeah you know Donald Trump said the president said these are the enemy of the people that like what if there's a fuzzy line so it's not the president's responsible and I'm not going to make the president responsible for things he didn't do himself and he and he did\nNothing remotely resembling telling people to bomb\nDemocrats no but when you call them evil yeah but I don't know but like\nThe Obama administration we referred to Republicans as terrorists kidnappers arsonist suicide bombers would that not would that rhetoric not lead someone to say well my goodness they're kidnappers arsons we need to we need to kill\nI I'm I'm not I'm happy to talk about Democrats but the I Want to talk about traumatic goes both directions my point it didn't this week and we're in a different place and I think you would admit that Donald Trump is different than any other president he says things that are different except I was I was except I was defending the left on the\nDemocrats but when the shoe was on the other foot because I think fundamentally this was unfair I think we should strive for much better discourse might\nMy question is if it's ...\n... I'm trying to draw a bright line but I'm saying language has consequences it\nDoes but if someone is is so crazy that they're going to try to kill people but the guy who shot Reagan right was trying to impress an actress if we're trying to ... all of our leaders of all responsibility\nI think our leaders have a responsibility to be more responsible in the way that they talk on both sides and that includes the present the United states I Do not think that\nTrying to especially right as this type of thing is happening the conclusion was jumped to immediately in much of the media that this was Trump inspired for Trump's fault on some level and I really just reject that so\nWe don't know yet\nBut we do know that the people who got the bombs were a weird collection of people that like oh it's ... it's the only law they have in common yes no like Maxine Waters rationally rationally and mix them nobody cares about maximum\nI understand though I Am granting the point that comes out tomorrow that it was a mega dude who sent bombs my position is exactly the same\nI don't I I just I guess I disagree with the severity of your position because I just I I\nOregon our cat has fallen part-time

let there's some there's some there's some life and in that um but Andy thank you for joining the show we are talking a lot today of course about the what's happened in the past twenty four hours with bombs being sent to a number of democratic officials\nOr celebrities who are credit criticizing President Trump\nI'm sort of twenty four hours out now twenty four thirty six hours from when we first learned about that how are you viewing this situation what are your thoughts I just sort of want to get a level that from from you about about higher looking at what what's happening here\n[noise] well you know in this case hits me I'm In a lot of ways I guess just because I have some sort of a I guess I have personal\nExperience that the touches on a lot of aspects of it so I'm more interested in it from an investigative standpoint that ...\nYeah I mean I think that it's um as far as motive is concerned I I always think it's a mistake to get out in front of what we know number one and number two I I tend to look at this stuff as a lawyer who prosecuted terrorism cases not as somebody who does political analysis and I know in the\nIn the world of um of of political talking points in rhetoric and all that jazz um you know there's a lot of cavalier chargers being thrown around in\nA courtroom or incitement to mass murderer tax is a pretty serious thing it's pretty serious business and your common sense tells you that\nYou know you may get riled up by somebody who is an expert demagogue but nobody goes out and commit mass murder on account of something that they heard at a political rally and that goes for you know political rallies of both sides I actually happen to be\nProbably one of the few people you'll\nFeel which was actually convicted somebody of incitement\nAnd I can tell you it's really difficult it's a very hard proof of all the cases the all the charges that we had no terrorism case it was probably the toughest shutter charges in the case because of the value that we put on free speech in America\nUm you really have to you really have to satisfy a very hard burden 'em to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody a incited other people to mass murder attacks and we wouldn't have had the\nProof necessary to do that unless we could show that the\nThe the incendiary commands were being addressed to people who were steeped in an ideology that actually counseled violence\nAs part of the deal of moving the agenda without that there's no way we would have got the um the sky convicted so I kind of tend to tune out\nThe incitement stuff because I just think it's silly and well\nWhat I can I jump in here for a second but yet on to that to the investigation I really want to get your thoughts on where the investigations heading you've done this for a living as you mentioned there though\nWell I'm not I'm not familiar with any Democrats at least I'm not arguing that like Donald Trump for example would mean a legal threshold for incitement\nIn there now a special responsibility that you think the president any president has two\nMore responsibly use language right and not call his political opponents opponents you know anti American not say that they should be locked up I mean is there a responsibility that fall short of legal responsibility in your mind can I Would argue [laughter]\nAll right but you're ... I think you're conflate in two different things\nUm yes there is absolutely a responsibility on the part of the president and I think it's a responsibility but this president of fall short on a very often not to engage in reprehensible rhetoric it's beneath the office and it shouldn't be done even if it weren't\nThat's one eight hundred three one eight six nine three pour again that's eight hundred three one eight six nine three poor\n\nHere than you left on your favorite I hurt rainiest than\nIt does lead program resilience your feedback to make our stations than even better thanks for listening to air rainy out\nOf the temperature there were a fresh ... degrees manned perfect for a little river's dry ...\nGood ... you hear cool who who I Am look you know the drill sleep during the day scare the kids at night how\nMuch ah oak trees are still in the same place so what's your last year that's what I like consistency when I was not like I'm going anywhere but the next couple of hundred you know\nI Love it a turtle turtle is not here yet man he's late every morning you'd think it would have learned by now to lead the night before meetings okay squirrels\nAnybody's seen mothers' forest tested repairing just for you visit a forest near you today to learn more about cool things to do in the forest visited discovered the forest dot org brought to you by the U.S Forest Service and the ad council\nFrom Fox News talk here's another sound memory [noise]\nRemember the run of the talk shows on the New York undercover in NYPD Blue well one of the best of the group and YPG blue first aired in Nineteen Ninety continues in reruns today my clothes\nThey do here more sound member on Fox News jock [noise]\n\nThey're trying to get in trouble if you are away from them and what\nNot the Alawite by black person it puts out white Halloween like I ... back to a kid that was okay as long as you were dressing up as a character shall I Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\n[noise] that was making Kelly our former colleague here at Fox News who's now for now at NBC it's the home stretch on Benson and our thanks for listening back to back flips there one from earlier in the week on Megan morning show on NBC and then the follow up the next day\nThe beginning of a lengthy apology they were having a discussion about Halloween costumes and black face and this woman on a bravo reality show who was\nApparently dressed as she was not a black woman but she dresses Diana Ross and Megan Kelly was sort of defending it in asking about you know is it really so bad on Halloween where the whole point is to dress up as a character that created a firestorm\nIncluding inside NBC where they ran multiple segments on their shows attacking what she said including on the NBC nightly news which is sort of extraordinary she was ripped by the president of that network of her OWN Network\nShe apologized the next day so that she did not fully appreciate the gravity of the history of blackface when she posed a question about Halloween\nBut the damage seem to have been done\nAt least ostensibly so at that point and after really dragging her more than twenty four hours reports started to emerge from within NBC that\nShe's on the way out at that network yeah and they're gonna have to pay her a lot of money tens of millions of dollars as they reportedly cancel her morning show and severed ties this was not yet all confirmed but multiple sources\nI did a lot there's a lot of leaks coming out about that which is sort of characterized her tenure there and she was a friend who she is a friend of both of us and she's a big part of the reason I'm ... I'm ... and\nIt's important that we point out like we are fans act were friends\nHe absolutely and uh since she's been an NBC it just feels like\nPeople having treated her while there\nAnd I don't I'm not based on I should just point out conversations with her um but from the beach that have come out from the sort of back stabbing that anonymous sources put out to various trade you know reporters who cover media even before she got here before she got there it just sort of feel like they didn't set her up for success\nAnd the guy we're talking about today I Am one of the most liberal people on issues of race on issues of what we said how we talk about it I'm deeply offended for example by\nThat Elizabeth Warren the way people talk including the president about Elizabeth Warren like I Am very far including guys I'm yeah I remember I Am very far to the last time there\nI Am surprised and disappointed if this is the reason NBC is letting her go\nAnd I don't um I don't think it is I think this is ... I think that the reason they'll they will give us which I think is a BS and I\nDon't think that that fair um and I said I I think I Would feel that way even if I didn't know her and like her right I I just I I think we need to be able to we need to figure out how to shoot ... issues of race when we talk about them publicly and this doesn't seem like if she's punished\nFor this in this way it doesn't seem like that's helpful to that conversation\nEspecially given the apology that she then put out on the air\nOn her own show and they have\nFor our own the tell to me was her OWN Network running multiple segments attacking her from inside the tent right the attacks were coming from inside the house\nOf NBC and I think the knives have been out for her there since before she arrived they didn't like her as a Fox a llama they didn't want her to fit in they were attacking her and grumbling and leaking to the press they were mad that she was not a sequel is enough\nAbout Matt Lauer who was accused of rape and left the network he had a button to lock the door on women under his desk she didn't do the whole\nFond farewell thing and NBC was mad at her over that so I think they were looking for any reason\nTo dump her yeah and\nIf they can dump her wall calling her a racist all the better yeah I think that's really gross I hail\n... regardless of the fact that we know in like her I detail and I'm a liberal like I'm not one of these people that um doesn't hate needs charging seriously I I don't you let the clip and it's like really their people say much worse things

President Trump earlier decrying political violence saying it's part of his goals president to help stop it now it can never take root\nJoining the conversation here with us is Chris ... front of the program Fox News politics editor and author of the new book every man a king crushed good to have you good to be with you my friend\nAll right so I Want to start by playing you a soundbite from an exchange on our air earlier today on Shepard Smith show Shepard Smith and Chris Wallace getting into the very discussion that Marie and I had been engaged in a little bit over the last two days a lot of people are debating\nThis issue this is from Fox News channel ... thirty one earlier today take a listen\nThe president says we need to unify will that some of that begins with the rhetoric does it not well I\nYeah it would certainly be good but I think a separate and apart from the actions of this guy or this is a twist in person there are three hundred million Americans and they may be part of the political debate in the country but they don't put explosive devices and\nBut when you have this rhetoric about where you're going to talk like this the ... the concern is that that one crazy one might then get empowered we don't know what happened in this case\nBut overall current you know what happened I mean I don't know if he goes all the President Trump aides and so I'm going to go targeted\nWill do any of that kind of fun but what difference does it make Charlotte ... route or insulin hits a twist it it's a twisted individual and the whole President Trump responsible I held it when I read them all and that that's clear implication that would work either this is not now let's be fair Chris I'm there early my frame ... shop let's\nBe fair [noise] so a disagreement\nAbout rhetoric hair and balance right yeah no that was I think of a pretty good and caps elation of how the conversation we're having the IRA I didn't know you were on hello Hi Kristin thanks did hire out he was white and so I didn't know how do I know we're we're fly together out here at Hoover Institution at Stanford but at the ...\nOr is it is very fancy it's very exciting but Chris I'm not asking you to pick sides among are a lot of colleagues are between our beloved colleagues I'm just wondering if you can comment on that type of exchange and the arguments that we're hearing on both sides of that question well\nLook I'm there is no both things can be true I I think that I didn't hear the the entirety of their conversation but I think that both things can be true in the sense that um it's obvious that the disgusting rhetoric that dominates our political discussion\nA that has you know it's funny we used to dabble in this stuff\nAh lightly question each other's motives and patriotism and sniff around a little bit the edges of these things and play with it and the electric fence of social program\nPoll politicians back you couldn't do too much or you get in trouble you couldn't be too big of a demagogue you couldn't lie too much you couldn't really call your opponent is vials gum because people wouldn't go for it\nBut now they realize that if your if your election or reelection his condition on just the ... the vigorous support of a third of the people who are either gullible enough or cynical enough to go along with you if you can really have\nThirty or forty percent of the country that is white hot for you either through conniving or ignorance have you can do that\nIf that's enough then you don't ever have to worry about being doing the right stuff really and there isn't a sanctioned there isn't a political sanctioned for doing the wrong stuff now what we've seen over time\nWhether it's the shooting at the congressional baseball practice\nOr whether it's a attacking Nancy ... craze mob attacking Nancy Pelosi when she was campaigning in Florida a Mitch McConnell can't have a bus pulled pork sandwich and peace um or whether it is in fact these fake bombs we see the trend right this hot rhetoric does have consequences\nI think what the disagreement that shepherd and Chris we're having\nWas in the context of don't say that this is Donald Trump's Donald Trump didn't make this guy do this ultimately this person is responsible for his behavior but I think we can hold both of those ideas in our head\nAt the same time people are responsible they're culpable for their own conduct but I think we are coming to a point where both sides thank God or maybe I should say pray God are ready to admit that the way that we talk to each other as having negative consequences that can go beyond just living in a toxic space [noise]\nChris I that was better than I could have done it that way and I'm grateful only when you're on the show but that they can get really smart take on that but I you just said both sides are saying we should talk talking to a better way to each other\nRight I'm not sure I Would say that about the present based on what he he he when someone right down the teleprompter we shouldn't be nicer to each other and then he gets asked a question are you going to tone down their rhetoric and he said I might turning up\nPeople

I talked about this a little bit yesterday our friend Megan Kelly who now\nIs not returning to her nine am eastern hour on the today show NBC has said that she still unemployed and then be the end I think they're trying to figure out what comes next\nAnd the comment you just heard what was the discussion that she had on her show [noise]\nThat got criticized by a lot of people she then apologized on air for that said she had learned more about the history of blackface she did a very lengthy apology which which we played part of yesterday\nAnd now it seems like some at NBC are using this controversy as an excuse to fire her or to cancel her show when guys we've talked about they wanted\nTo get ready for I think for a while to show wasn't doing as well as they hoped I think they put her in a position that was designed not to be perfect for her I think a lot of that's on NBC but\nWhat I don't like is there but they're having a discussion here about a very sensitive issue she expressed them thoughts and and later then apologized for them I don't like them using\nThis controversy as an excuse to do something I think they wanted to do regardless because it it's not fair to her don't get it racialized as at\nWhich is I mean I agree with her comments either I I'm saying\nOr neither does she like hey right so she has backed away from them I think I Would not have said it this way I think there's some discussion on Twitter about like okay is there a difference between black face in the sense of a minstrel show versus someone dressing up as their favorite star\nWho happens to be black for Halloween I'm at and toward the cultural sensitivity to play there and they were having this discussion on NBC's air\nAnd she came out later and said look I did not\nFully appreciate the history of blackface and I should have approached this way that I did\nBut the fact that they ran multiple segments across multiple NBC platforms attacking her I mean they were just she said she was their teammates so to speak yeah they were piling on and punching her while she was down\nAnd I think a lot has to do with some resentment that she came in with so much money and she may have passed over other people who'd been there longer but also she came from Fox\nAnd there's people that other networks who just\nDon't believe that you should have a life after Fox if you leave Fox

correspondent ... more about his history\nThe you know the mandates gone they're cheaper plans that are short term planet now available that people like in her signing up or what do you think of the politics of Obamacare and how Obamacare looks as a policy today versus even a few years ago I think that there\nWere finally seeing in the polling generally on Obamacare on I think people's opinions of it is that the the overall population\nThe of the law finally the the components are catching up with it used to be the case if you ask people about Obamacare you know do you like these various features the fact that insurers cannot discriminate against\nPeople with preexisting conditions do you like the fact that kids can stay on their parents' plan up to age twenty five do you like all these different components people would say yes yes yes we liked them and then you get to do you like Obamacare and they'd say no no I don't like Obamacare and and I think what we're seeing now is because Democrats have done a relatively good job\nOf focusing on those popular components people are beginning to see Obama Care not as this big monstrosity but as these component pieces and I think you're starting to see some of that Democrats in this campaign there was an article in the wall Street Journal a couple of weeks ago that talked about how many campaign ads from Democrats have\nFeatured healthcare and featured Obamacare in particular something like three hundred thousand between the middle of September and the and the middle of October yes a three hundred thousand impressions and I think what that does is it puts Republicans on defense in part because the Republicans have taken so many votes to repeal Obamacare\nThe positioning of the Republican Party on health care is very interesting I think they were chastened by what happened in twenty Seventeen [laughter] and so\nWhen did they learn from that that what was the lesson they took away why should they have to well I think\nThe lesson they should have taken away was how difficult it is to come to a consensus position even among conservatives on healthcare reform [laughter]\nThere's a tendency to think well conservatives think alike on this but they don't I mean there were all of these pitfalls there's a reason why conservatives were not able to get something done on Obamacare for so long they weren't able to get things done on health care reform for so long\nAnd so coming into it it was a very very challenging endeavor already and I think what they learned is just how divided Republicans are on health care\nAnd and I I just think that's something that they really underestimate it\nAnd there I think collectively during their lawns now for a future fight over the direction the Democrats are headed which a single payer and\nAnd that frankly is much more fruitful place for Republicans because as Democrats go left as they think about medical you look in Medicare for all each of the two thousand four hundred Democrats running for president in twenty twenty has already endorsed Medicare for all\nAnd and that is a position that I think is going to be difficult to defend because you know Medicare for all single payer very interesting people kind of like the idea when you initially tell them about it but as you informed them of what the impacts will be that policy disruption ... popular so\nYou know I think it's going to be interesting because the Democratic campaign for twenty twenty is going to start November seventh and it's already it's already started right so you get to see people being there's a tendency to push leftward is is there is on the Republican side we push right within the Republican primary\nIs going to be very difficult to see any other uh outcome than the Democratic nominee having to endure some kind of single payer proposal I just think in a general election that's a very difficult position to a spouse\nAnd interestingly Democrats poll are pulling right now way ahead of Republicans on who you trust to deal with health care and one of the things I said during the repeal and replace debating twenty Seventeen wise it seemed like Republicans in Congress that convincing south you keep all the stuff people like\nYou can get rid of this stuff we don't like and bring costs down and and short more people all at the same time\nAnd it didn't seem like there was any way from a policy perspective to do all of those things at once you have to make decisions about what's more important and as you said Republicans are divided on which decisions\nCan make [laughter] yeah and I think the other the other point that you make which is a good one is that\nAh when you've taken that many votes to repeal the whole law right it's it's difficult political you see how it can be weaponized against you might have seen that in this campaign I mean Missouri's a perfect example of this where Claire McCaskill and Josh Hawley the Democrat and Republican respectively in the U.S Senate race\nHas basically been going back and forth on this issue for the last two months yeah and and it is it has now become a battle of you know who's going to do a better job of defending preexisting conditions and and this is a difficult set of of terrain for Republicans to be fighting well especially\nBecause what the Democrats have done it Obamacare is they shifted from the name of the law which was the ... CARE Act right and the affordability peace was not working out they shifted their focus to pre existing conditions and more people insured which are covered which was not\nThe main thrust of the main thrust we're going to bring down costs we didn't have those but it was called the Affordable CARE Act and so what we saw was between twenty Thirteen implementation and twenty Seventeen the average premium on the federal exchange\nThe costs doubled in raised by a hundred and five percent CNN is just put out data not that long ago that for the first time benchmark plans are going to ever so slightly come down the price is going to come down a little bit why\nWell you know the the argument that you'll hear from the administration and I think there's some truth to this is that they've actually there in the position of implementing the law they've actually made some policy changes that are helping the dynamics that are underlined the law now now fundamentally [noise]\nAh the the question becomes if this really sustainable right there are some of the changes that this administration and they've made\nIs it sustainable in terms of seeing long run premium growth not being a significant as what's been passed I I don't know the answer to that except to say that um there are still some fundamental concerns I have about how Obamacare as is architecture if you will\nAnd I don't think those are going away regardless of how this administration implements the law so while we're seeing some relief on premiums for twenty Nineteen that's absolutely true\nI don't know if that trend is sustainable into twenty twenty and beyond me fundamentally just a Detroit a little bit of health care I mean look I think that the Affordable CARE Act was properly named in the sense that\nAffordability is still a key struggle we have in our health care system\nWe still have not addressed the fundamental drivers of why health care costs more year over year direct and unless we do that we're going to be fighting this fight for the next three decades four decade I mean who knows right because if you look at a chart I can show you a chart that compares the growth of healthcare prices to prices on everything else in the economy\nAnd the gap between the two is growing and has grown\nAnd and yes from year to year it drifts in and out but the fact that people look at their health care bills every year in this I don't get why this is getting more expensive keeps the salient issue\nAnd for our listeners why does it keep getting mark that I mean what is that there's a lot of reasons but what's to\nSort of ... for for well so so there's a couple of things I went to one is a we have the most innovative health care system in the world and an innovative technology costs a lot of money especially in here in Silicon valley and pushing new cures new ... new new technologies new devices\nThese all costs money are India's expensive we are on the cutting edge of that and therefore our system is more expensive\nBut we also have much higher utilization than other countries do of health care\nBecause we're not aware of the cost of the health care workers and we know how much we pay in a copayment aggressions\nBut you don't you get these bills from the insurance company or you get these statements if say here's the care you've got his you don't know what it means I don't know what a customer is separated from the cost it we we have this this intermediate we have desegregation of the end consumer of healthcare\nFrom the cost of health care it's very dangerous and so as a result what do you see are one primary example is you see a bunch of people showing up at the ER\nTo get basic care right even if they have coverage people said oh with Obamacare now people won't show up in the ER or more people are showing up in the ER now why because they think oh I've got coverage I can go to the ER ER is the last place you want to go if you've got something that can be treated relatively easy and we got to figure out a way\nTo push care into a lower lower cost higher quality setting than the ER so I mean basically utilization and innovation or two things I point too\nWe are here with line he can at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University day five at broadcasting and the reason we're out here because they get to talk to people like ... says thank you for
