they dropped the word Republican from their name and that has been the Democratic party ever since the founding of the Republicans actually it's the oldest political party in America\nSo people who describe themselves as\nDemocrats or for that matter back in the founding era they more frequently refer to themselves as Republicans Jefferson referred to himself as a Republican and talked about Republican principles\nIt was always the small are they might using this concept of government I Believe in this form of government\nAnd and but now you say are you know are you a Democrat well yeah I'm a big D Democrat that means I'm a member of this political party I'm a small D Democrat I Believe in the concept of democracy which is by the way in peril right now sell it makes sense maverick\nWill ... couldn't you'd be able sure I'm both\nOkay All right 'cause I was trying to parse that I\nKnow they're not they're not mutually exclusive it's it's basically you're talking either about political theory or about party about partisan politics so\nKind of like a a rectangle square but it squares and rectangles type of\nDeal yeah that would be sort of and the same thing with Republican he can be a small are Republicans believe in you know republics as a form of governance or you can be at a big are Republican believing in you know being a member of the Republican Party fabric I got I'm On the line but thanks for the question I Love those kind of questions for us in a high point North Carolina or as what's up\nHow you doing I just wanted to speak about this a bombing ... um I think it's despicable\nAnd in my personal opinion I think all of that ... comes from the ... which is down\nHere now is what they are good mirror a Governor Cuomo just just set in New York state and by the way my if I can interrupt you just just for a second Horace ... within a news flash here I'm Shaun you said they just found another one where\nMaxine Waters office they just intercepted a suspicious package and Maxine Waters off his number one and number two uh you know we got a call earlier from somebody suggesting that uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz got a package because ah you know I'm Bernie people don't like her a turns out that all of these bombs have Debbie Wasserman Schultz is\nHome address or opposite dress as the return address none were actually sent to her but one was supposed to be sent to Eric Holder or somebody\nAnd uh because they had the wrong address for this person it got sent back to Debbie Wasserman Schultz which is how she ended up with one but she was not the targeted this anyhow Horace forget my interruption back to you\nLike the the things that shouldn't be doing now right now not tomorrow or next next week they should have a way to get Donald Trump\nAnd how do you stay out of work with because these in the country down she shouldn't go to jail they shoot poor on me to jail them actually Mitch McConnell all of them knew what we\nCan go to court myself and then the conviction for them to stay\nThank yours I get your passion and I am you know I I Try to stay away from salvation is thinking you know something will save us eventually but I Am looking forward to Robert Mueller's report and if it has the kind of bomb shells in it that I suspect it will\nAh ... we may be accomplishing exactly not not under the jail kind of stuff you know your eye hyperbole horse but you know the the the goal that you're trying to get to may well be happening Robert in Tyler, Texas say Robert what's on your mind today\nTom thank you for

president since this goes back to\nOr somewhere in my lifetime they started doing this and there was a big uh hope to do about it and I'm not sure if that was a if it was George Herbert Walker Bush Ronald Reagan but one of them started doing campaign things using air force one and it's just been going on ever since\nSo he goes out and he and I eat all you yell\nTo violence maybe maybe these acts

ABC Washington Post poll that just came out of the weekend the Republican Party is twenty four points underwater with women\nWho are likely to be voting I registered voters and likely to be voting this fall and three and three weeks\nSamples have them down as much as thirty points and in a lot of those swing districts as you know these women whether it's health care costs or President Trump's rhetoric um they're not really happy right now how concerned are you about that and and what are you doing to address that that demographic\nWho clearly you need to look closely at those polling numbers but if you dig deeper and now she's polling it'll wildly swing districts that show some of those numbers but then when you dig deeper\nOr those same women that might be moving away and the initial question they really liked the tax cuts or they don't like Obamacare they don't like seeing double digit increases in their health care cost or they\nDon't like the idea of abolishing ice or they want border security they want they want to national security and frankly if you look at the polling\nWe the Republican Party fare much stronger in the head to head on the economy and on national security with those very same women than the Democrats and the PLO seat\nAgenda was moving backwards so it's it's the ultimately it's the results of the things that we stand for four versus what they stand for my pillow see but it's not your traditional Democrats uh it's it's the socialist movement really where liberals and then what ... are getting beat by socialist\nOr that's not where this

push you a little bit on how you describe the Democratic candidates you are very right that in many districts they're running very liberal candidate some of whom talked about abolishing nice you're absolutely correct about that but in the swing districts\nIn the mid west across the plains states in parts of the south\nI think the Democratic party has actually been smart and running very moderate

they thought there is no way that Donald Trump can win this thing and they were overconfident ah I'm not talking about necessarily all the party strategist but a lot of the party activists\nAnd it was just beyond their comprehension and I think there is a risk\nWith all the talk about a blue wave that some activists may just think that it's a fate accompli that Democrats are going to take back the house because there's no way Donald Trump will be rewarded after his first two years in office and take they'll take their foot off the gas and I think it is paramount for the Democratic party strategist to make sure that doesn't happen\nBut I Will be honest in a lot of my conversations with the folks who are running house races across the country with the party operatives here in DC that are focusing on it [noise]\nI I got to be honest for months I have not heard a lot of talk about a wave I have heard a lot of anxiety and concern and and recognition that this thing is going to be tight at the end of the day\nWhat what I'm going to be watching for on election night or a couple of things one suburban districts that's what's going to decide control of the house right and those I think structurally are still helping Democrats yep I'm also going to be looking down ballot\n... going to be looking at state legislative races and contests which are incredibly important look at Colorado where the state Senate or right now has a one seat Republican majority and by most indications that will likely flip if we are start seeing\nIn state legislative chambers what we saw last year in Virginia where the house of delegates nearly flipped after Republicans had the two to one majority right that is going to tell you that there is something deeper going on out there but it we may not know for days and some of these places [noise]\nI I think that's right now and we just have a little over a minute left but are there any specific governors' races that you really think are interesting and that Florida and Ohio what are your what are your big ones to watch this cycle\n[noise] yeah I think Florida is incredibly interesting and a dynamic raisins been getting a lot of attention you could not have two more different candidates right then uh the the two party nominees in that race\nAnd I think it's going to have an impact on the Senate race a and some of these uh swing congressional districts I'm also really interested in Ohio which really hasn't been getting a ton of national attention but that's pretty much a barn burner right now and held on average I saw a show the Democrats up with the narrowest of of all leads\nIn Colorado which right now also tends to be trending blue a Colorado's a the dynamics of politics in the state it is very much a purple state yeah uh certainly in presidential elections\nThat one right now looks like a Democrats could hold when I Know Republicans for a while we're hopeful that they might be able to to flip it so those are just three but there's a lot of other really interesting ... level races that that people just are focused on\nAbsolutely and I would actually at Georgia to that list as well we're going to finally all of these I Know you are as well now a lay the friend of the program Georgetown University Fox News we well\nFor the [noise]\nActually working with a fossil every profile and last man standing

Hoover Institution thank you to our hosts here we are having a great time or had great get done uh and we really like the weather so we may not come back east will see\nThough I Will still up and not a west coast I let you as it [laughter] well Julie back out here\nI Know guy guy I I Am trying to make you more laid back\nAbout good luck for him to lock although being being at Stanford for the week in being at Hoover is a is a huge treat\nIt is look at that he's the same word um so we're working our way through to the show we're joined now on the line by Jonah Goldberg senior editor at the national review columnist for the LA Times in USA Today he's also Fox News contributor you all see him on TV\nFellow at the American Enterprise Institute he has a very long title it's all very impressive that's why you should listen to him\nAnd author of the latest book suicide of the west how the rebirth of tribalism populism nationalism an identity politics is destroying American democracy\nWill join that we're going to get to some of the themes in your new book because the president's been talking about then this week\nBut I Want to start with your latest piece or in the LA Times on this Saturday situation with democracy hoagie you write that the biggest mistake the Trump Administration made occurred when he was still alive letting Saudi Arabia's crown prince think he could get away with something so\nHeinous and it seems like\nThe crown prince thought they could walk us through your your line of thinking here\nSure um I didn't get to get to first of all it's great to be here this is my last night before winning mega millions so it's\nWe all never hear from you again oh you well know introduce you with the exact same intro joined except we also say billionaire Jonah Goldberg is a Fox News contributor et cetera yeah\nNot not that I Would ever disparage your motivations or any of these kinds of things but I suspect that if I come on after winning you guys will be much more generous in your introduction [laughter] and so on the ... or ... or so gee I'm\nPart of it is we don't have a lot of diplomatic personnel in Saudi Arabia [noise] um and we basically relied on a Jared Kushner as in boy and Donald Trump as this with this personal relationship\nAnd there weren't a lot of people in the room or on the ground over there to lay out a clear\nOr understanding of just how far you can take this new wonderful relationship we have with Saudi Arabia\nAnd we know that the crown prince is a very ambitious guy who's taking really some you can call them Boulder you can call them aggressive ah steps to sort of consolidated power any wreck you also say well this one you know this isn't a whole new category you know sending the assassination squads to\nAnother country to December a guy but\nUm you know this is one of these things I liken it a little bit to the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand which launched from World war one not to say the stakes are as high but once that happened all sorts of other agendas went into play World War one wasn't about vengeance Archduke Ferdinand\nBut it it it's sort of launched a decision tree or a cascade effect of different interests the turkey the Turkish or up to no good here the Trump Administration is trying desperately to find some face saving way out of this\nThe Saudis have behaved\nYou know a book foolish Italy beyond anyone's recognition you know this idea that basically they've settled on the argument that someone punched this guy so hard he dismembered himself\nRight um and and now there are no good options and it's a mess all across the board but if you take a step back as much as I think we should condemn this and we shouldn't be participants of ally I'm\nA chicken step back you know the Saudis are guilty of far worse things than this summer the Turks so are the Iranians were only dealing with murderers in that region with the exception of of Israel and maybe you could argue I'm Jordan\nAnd it is a very ... so there are no great options now it's like once you've built the milk you don't have the best options anymore once the horses left the barn\nAnd once you've murdered and dismembered this guy um you leave Saudi Arabia and the United states with no great options moving forward and so it's going to be a mess no matter how they resolve it\nJonah shifting to tribalism in our politics which is one of the themes of your book also one of the main themes of Ben Sasse his new book we had him on the program last week it's a really good important book\nUm there's this new talking point that's flying around back and forth the head of the midterms which is\nThe threat of mob action\nBy partisans and we've seen it on both sides we saw during the Kavanaugh situation from the left\nOf a rock thrown through the district office of Kevin McCarthy overnight now apparently a bomb planted somewhere near George cirrhosis house\nSentiments um but at the end of the day you know particularly in the American political tradition there is a difference between ... between nationalism and patriotism yet nationalism connotes a certain sort of central ... tendency and also often has an overlay of sort of ethnic nationalism\nUm when you hear how Donald Trump talks often it seems like he only believes his own base his own core constituency or the real Americans are my people are the best and those that was me generally does you know it's it's bizarre to me it's the first time a president as ever\nJust declined to try to expand his base and instead has just intensified his base right and I think that uh you know part of my part of my philosophical problem with nationalism\nIs that it tends to be status because the government and the central government or the government in Washington is the only institution in the entire country\nThat speaks for the entire nation and if you start glorifying the nation\nThen it means you're you're providing a permission structure to put more and more power in Washington FDR wasn't national as Woodrow Wilson was a nationalist right I'm JFK was a nationalist and um and so I think rhetorically and logically a lot of things slow from from embracing the nationalist label\nThat that bothered me I Will say that I think Donald Trump definition of nationalist in his own heart is probably pretty harmless I think it just means patriotic guy who wants to do what's best for America before doing what's best for anybody else\nIs probably I I don't think I'm going out on a crazy whim probably not to up to speed on the literature about these debates\n[noise] I think that's probably a ... a gallon that's all they want to get him\nA copy of a liberal fascism staff yeah\nHe'll he'll read it this

economy growing so that everybody can have better opportunities\nCongress man I I Want to ask you about a different demographic I I Do think the one you mentioned is very interesting but I Want to ask you about winning in polls including an ABC Washington Post poll that just came out of the weekend the Republican Party is twenty four points underwater west women\nWho are likely to be voting I registered voters and likely to be voting this fall and three and three week\nSamples have them down as much as thirty points and then a lot of those swing districts that you know\nThese women whether it's health care costs or President Trump's rhetoric um they're not really happy right now how concerned are you about that and and what are you doing to address that that demographic\nWho clearly you need to look closely at those polling numbers but if you dig deeper and she's pulling it a lot of these swing districts that show some of those numbers but then when you dig deeper uh those same women that might be moving away and the initial question they really liked the tax cuts or they don't like Obamacare\nThey don't like seeing double digits\nFare much stronger in a head to head on the economy and on national security with those very same women than the Democrats and the low seat\nAgenda was moving backwards so it's it's the ultimately it's the results of the things that we stand for four versus what they stand for ... below sea but it's not your traditional Democrats uh it's it's just socialist movement really world liberals in primaries are getting beat by socialist\nA that's not where this country is so we're a center right nation and with the polling will show you on a lot of those issues or there was a big fight right now in this farm bill and the big fight is over whether or not people\nAre as they're trying to get welfare benefits if there's a job out there and you're able bodied should you have to work rather than getting taxpayer funded benefits\nThat's like an eighty twenty issue especially a with a with working working moms to understand why should we be paying taxpayer benefits to somebody who's fully capable of working when there's a job out there waiting for the Democrats say they should be able to still keep getting those welfare benefits instead of having to work\n[noise] hunters and I just want to jump in here and then I'm going to go back to a guy but to push you a little bit on how you describe the Democratic candidates you are very right that in many districts they're running very liberal candidate some of him talk about abolishing nice you're absolutely correct about that but in the swing districts\nIn the mid west across the plains states in parts of the south I think the Democratic party has actually been smart in

Institute for International Studies here at Stanford\nHis new book is from Cold War to hot peace\nIt is a great read you should check it out every once you buy it it's a great Christmas book on and of course he served at the U.S ambassador to the Russian Federation from January of twenty twelve until February of twenty fourteen also worked at the White House knows everything\nAbout Russia thank you investor for joining us now from your back I didn't know you hear the whole week that center where here the whole week we may never leave okay um I ... coming up are you still run for the weekend or okay I Know you'll miss the festivities we have\nTo unfortunately go back and deal with the midterms which are under two weeks from now but luckily let's talk about foreign policy which is a nice break from politics today um last time we spoke to you and we were hearing June\n... summit in Helsinki between President Trump and president who had not yet happened so bring our listeners up to speed on your thought about the summit and sort of what's been happening\nSince then I Will get into some specific issues which is what is your general take on where things\nWell my general topic because I write about in the book so thanks for free money people ever as a U.S Russian relations have not been this bad since the deep end of the Cold War I think you've got to go back even to the Nineteen sixties\nRemember a time when things are so confrontational some things are better some things are worse we could go through that list if you're interested but but I'm not sure that we're better off than we were\nSaying at the end of the Cold War and in my book I lay primary responsibility for that with Vladimir prudent and his policies [noise] ah there was a project Democrats and Republicans supported it of trying to bring Russia and the integrate Russia support democratic an economic forums inside Russia\nThat projects over and now we're in this period of confrontation [noise] by the Helsinki summit to to to fast forward to that event uh I was there and they'll think you are working for another uh organization news organization um and\nI thought it was a pretty disappointing event or I did not think the president advanced his own policies that the president ... I'm a one of those ideas that they had was to swap some Russian intelligence officers for some U.S officials\nAnd your name when I was wondering\nI was wondering but I Want to point out Democrats and Republicans are on that list so putting does not have a partisan\nA less he wanted to interrogate us and then later his government I don't want to joke about it actually has a government made very clear the next day that they considered that we had broken Russian law so they think\nThey were wanting to interrogate us for laws committed against the Russian Federation in my case it was not when I was ambassador it was actually allegedly [noise]\nAnd I want to say crazily so because it was just be clear but it was when I was a working at the national Security Council\nThat was a bad idea a it was unfortunate that President Trump didn't see it as a bad idea at the time I I actually cut them some slack in Helsinki I said he doesn't know what the ... that's what ... was referring to press conference my guess is most people don't know what the treaty is a\nBuy a ... you know it took a while to get it in the right place ah but the bigger picture is I don't think we advanced our national interest in that summit that's why I'm wary\nAbout another summit that Mr Bolton and Mr uproot and just discussed yesterday uh I think so much need to have a purpose we need to know what is the objective we're seeking to advance\nAnd we haven't figured that out then maybe best not to have some it's let me add though 'cause I think it's really important for your listeners to understand I actually think the Trump administration's policy on Russia is pretty good [noise]\nA fact I think in some ways it's better than the Obama administration policy they are deterring Russia with building a NATO they are supporting Ukraine which I think is the front line states in the fight against Russia or they have sanctioned lots of Russians rightfully so\nUm I think that is all the right strategy or there's just one guy that doesn't seem to agree with that at least not always and that's the president and that's kind of the paradox I Would say of our current moment\nMr Ambassador what do you think of the", "show_name": "The Alan Colmes Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "25"}
