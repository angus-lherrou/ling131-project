Johnson an author and historian and one of the greatest minds of the twentieth on the twenty first century [noise]\nCome up author Frank ... is going to be here to explain how evangelical right it's taken America ...\nMy Kevin tonia we'll be right back with\n[noise] I\nWho do not know Monday through Saturday new to ten PM when you're sure one hundred twenty five thousand dollars by playing the games are only a casino what the down your home for winning in central\nMusic Friday Saturday and late at night Thursday the oh the NFL games in several cats horse racing daily you can even book your holiday party here only get to the north of Dallas one miles south of ab cue up town\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nMan I'm\n\n\n\n\nNa na na\nNa\n\n\nNa\n\n\n\nWorld is\nMissing journalist pastor back home I mean can't President Trump says his administration will be very angry at the Saudi Government ordered the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal stretch shook eight sixty minutes released an ex urban entered the what the president\nYou know what it that way ever change right what happened in the division from a ... material I've read from you is that\nIt it's almost like the real extreme event evangelicals that they as you as you point out\nThey renamed themselves evangelicals right cause they for from standpoint as they were they were embarrassed by what was happening they want to disguise it but nevertheless they came away pouting they came away right the embattled in in this adversarial kind of a position would rest of the world\nYeah and of course that spilled over into the religious right that we were part of it in the seventies and eighties with the anti abortion movement and then of course is the formative states that then eventually\nFull speed ahead to Ted Cruz today and you've got the Tea Party movement saying listen we don't care what it does to the world economy or if it costs America twenty four billion dollars we're shutting down the government because we are bitter\nAgainst anybody who is not part of us and that's the saved in last paradigm that's the black and white paradigm you're either you know right with Jesus or you're going to hell and you apply that paradigm to American politics and you've got the kind of delusional stuff that I've been writing about in my new book and God said Billy\nVery good stuff by the way thank you which is really an examination of this delusional quality of of American religion which essentially has not only cut it so far from fact based history and politics\nBut now fast forward to our movement with Fox News and all the rest hasn't entirely alternative system of approved communication that doesn't even relate to fact\nOkay let let me ask you about let me ask you about that okay\nWe come out of the shutdown war okay and everybody says okay who are these people who are these people\nIn with the analysis of a purely secular analysis it is well there are people who simply don't want to pay more taxes there are people\nThey're anti government people right but there's more to that and that's what I read in what you're saying you're saying that if we really just still what is this new movement about ... just like their recalcitrant about evolution their recalcitrant about global warming their recalcitrant about gay rights\nThere are also recalcitrant about increasing the debt limit and this this same group the this literal Bible group that we're talking about is that\nThat I remember where I came out of you know we had a lot to do with Republican leaders back in the seventies and eighties people like Jack Kemp ... do you disagree on policy but they weren't living in la la land now what we have is essentially the village idiots not only controlling the Tea Party but through the Tea Party and gerrymandering the Republican Party\nAnd you've got to understand these aren't outsiders knocking on the door demanding attention for their little pet peeve they are senators they are congressman\nAnd they've got a lock on the direction of our other major political party this is serious stuff\nAnd they they abide and then I'll turn it of universe and where the media doesn't get it and why I wrote and God said Billy is this and that is unless you understand\nThat America's problems are not politically rooted they're rooted in delusional religion and extremism then you don't get it I'll give you a parallel I'm not saying there's an analogy but I think it's apt\nAnd that is there's no point discussing why people put on suicide vests and blow up mosques if you're never going to mention radical Islam if you don't mention radical fundamentalist right wing white predominantly southern often bigoted racist Christianity then you're not going to have a clue\nAs to why Ted Cruz's father is a crazy man why Ted Cruz's inherited that extremist right wing mantle\nAnd why they're religious delusion that has taken the Tea Party over the edge is threatening to take so much of our country's politics down or why there's gridlock and as I say you know it's not a question of a parallel between whether it's extreme on the left an extreme on the right they're all\nYeah isn't that moral equivalency that moral equivalence has gotten so ridiculous with the media were there's well gee both know that both sides don't do the bone head things that we see coming from the right wing crazy evangelicals I mean there's no other way to describe it except do brain ignorance\nThere is and and and and I'll tell you what it's worse than that because it's willful ignorance at saying look we don't care what science says about global warming we don't care what the International Monetary fund predicts for America if we default we don't care what the fossil record shows on evolution we're going to circle the wagons\nAnd as my character billion on God said Billy did come out of a home school background that feeds on the delusion\nAnd then let's listen to the society through people like Fox News and the right wing media but the secular media and this is where I felt people like the New York times and the New Yorker and others with a few exceptions are people who write about at once in a while\nYou could read regimes of political coverage and never get to the fact that one thing fine sixty Seventy even eighty percent of all these people together their leaders the Fox news watchers and all these guys\nIt's radicalized bitter\nAdversarial evangelical Christian\nAnd the bitterness that you're talking about comes out of their last war in the late Nineteen century when you read when you had really correct think or say look\nWe can't ignore sides and we can't simply stand there and say that Darwin was wrong when he has this empirical data to show it's true right we we can't ignore the fact that the sun comes up in in in goes down in a certain way every day and and and but nevertheless what is it\nWhat is it front now again let me let me preface this statement by telling you this I was raised in the south around all of this so but if you're if you haven't been\nRaised where your neighbors are you know Pentecostal Southern Baptist right you know really extreme you don't get this you don't even know it exists right so so what is it\nThat allows these folks to put themselves in the past year where they can allow themselves to do that let's take a break and pick up with that ...\nWe stop\nLaughing on TV that's made here is underway\nI think for the good of individuals we have to be aware of the kind of things that Dr these folks for their own sex for our cousins are friends for the kid who's growing up fundamentalists now and who's gay and who's going to stand\nThere on a bridge wondering if you should kill themselves because they're telling him he's a dreadful center we need to be honest about these things to help individuals not just our politics\nThat Frank shaver thank you a great book and God said ... everybody's going to get this budget hey thanks a lot [noise]\nJust that are ready to fire James Meredith the first African American admitted to whole mess University of Mississippi in Jackson will be joining us talk about the fifteenth anniversary of the integration of all mess that's just the heads stay with us right here on ... [noise]\n\nThis is Sam seat or you're listening to the back of ring of fire radio\n[noise]\nWelcome back to ring of fire Robert F Kennedy junior it's been fifty years at the University of Mississippi old mess was forced to comply with\nWell then aggression laws and since that day fifty years ago the United states\nHas made tremendous progress in racial equality however even with that progress there are still too many segments of the population that are struggling to achieve a quality but the progress that we've made so far\nCould not have been achieved if it weren't for the courageous effort of heroic citizens who refused to be treated as second class Americans and I have one of the\nRaid figures of that age my friend James Meredith who was the African American student who was admitted to old mess and I think originally I Know you said at one point you'd been inspired by President Kennedy's inaugural address\nJames Meredith was in the United States Air force from Nineteen fifty wanted Nineteen sixties any it tend to Jackson State university for two years and then decided to enter the\nSacred citadel of old mess which had been a white enclave since its founding the brown versus board of education case had been issued by the Supreme Court Nineteen fifty\nFour [noise] and he was twice denied\nEntrance and then the U.S Supreme Court declared that old mess must admit him governor Ross Barnett who had actually supported President Kennedy and his Nineteen sixty\nCampaign became his adversary and President Kennedy's and my father's efforts to get James Meredith admitted to the state and there was a male a at that time that I and many people's view was\nHigh end of the last great battle of the civil war was over ten thousand United States troops was five hundred US marshals a hundred and sixty of them were injured\nAnd the riot as rednecks came in from ... from Birmingham and from Selma and from lounge county and from as far away as California\nLast world guidance and rocks and bricks and attack the licensing M. building\nWhere the U.S marshals had gathered for less than two people were killed\nIn the end James Meredith with the help of one of my father's closest friends John or answered the university and I think you you said in the past that you slapped very well that night\nRight you actually were in a dorm behind the licensing and building and you went to sleep early well all the while the riot was going on is that is that right\nYes that that's true that's correct because you had done your job\nAbsolutely and that was to get the government of the United states to use the middle of a force\nOf this nation to and forced rights privileges of all the black church\nWe'll talk about your relationship to the Kennedy Justice Department\nWell I always considered the Justice Department the president's brother your father Robert Kennedy and it was his decision and that decision I Believe he was to\nExtend the coverage of citizenship right everybody and I think he understood that and they carried it out for the first time it's just that to me\nHow the chief of the civil rights division at that time was my father's friend former Yale Law professor burqa Marshall and his other friend was a Republican whose name was John door had he found\nThose two sitting in the office on I think it was on a friday afternoon and he said to them I Want you to go down to Mississippi and make sure that James Meredith gets into the university\nAnd of course that's exactly what I mean you you know things I don't know but I certainly believe what you said it was what I the first time I actually talked to anybody it was to your father and I was\n... years later when he was senator from New York and I was a student at Columbia Law school\nYou met John door when he was down in Mississippi with you a new ad burqa Marshall\nOh yes I I I particularly Britain Marshall I have no doubt about it in for the reason I wrote to your father it's kind of general actually it\nWas more to the Kennedy administration but the little one yeah and that was not that cause that\nAnd how did that happen exactly did you call the Justice Department first\nWell actually that was a young lawyer just graduated from college but you can Mississippi to practice we have to agree\nWith the night and\nHe was really the one that brought the macho into the picture and you are right for me to an attorney general assistant attorney general ... much to have a conversation and and and miss the mark asked me\nTo send the letter outline and what I was planning to do and I did that\nHow well do you remember ... were were you conscious that there was a battle being fought that night and that was there were thousands of people involved in it including the U.S military\nFrankly I Would have been laid off I had not know\nWhat you know that the military was coming but that night my daughter when\nI saw I mean not not in Mississippi but in Tennessee I Will stand Miller an air force base and I saw the troops coming in actual votes on march and then you know getting them say on that\nOne was it like after that initial crisis mass what was it like going to classes and going to lunch and did you have a guard a US Marshal guard during your entire time at all mess\nEvery single day and they ate lunch with you\nKnow in the marshes now only one that they did was a John Doe\nI add was their acceptance was there a gradual acceptance of your presence on the campus\nIs Fifteen Years later and still is no except at the University of Mississippi\nOkay we'll explain that to us because this is the fiftieth anniversary well\nI ... I was not going to know more than ... Jew so I'm going to let other people speak to that my commitment to God is the future so are\nYou told me that you know it doesn't hold off and the only thing that matters when when we decide to obey we do that\nSo a lot more I'm going to try to stick to that and deal with a ... you could do I will say this about ... in terms\nOf the book and in terms of public education at the from the Pentagon three but I don't have\nAny through the ... very much work [noise]\nIn one is twelve\nAnd it was in Nineteen sixty two and my God I didn't have them\nWe need to go to break we'll be right back on ring of fire with James ... is the first African American admitted to mold mess\nHe\n\nThere are all sorts of ways in which the fossil fuel economy is damaging to communities and looking at opportunities to highlight the local issues whether it's pollution from the local refinery whether it's\nPlastic pollution for a plastic industry is tied into the petrochemical complex [noise] um I think looking at\nWays in which to make climate change relevant at the local level because it is touching every aspect\nOf the country every part of the country um and I I think political leaders should have to be smarter about the way they were they screen on the opportunity to be have to shift away from an economy that has incredible damage and she was a couple of calls me and I met on and one that doesn't work for a lot of people ensure quality\nOn and how might we kick the I'm In charge of an upper ... to transition into it I have an army that both works for people\nYou know um I I Hope\nThat that is the case that that can be a compelling picture but I Know just in from the perspective of of of being someone in the media\nWho you know talks about climate change to the extent that I can um it it does not seem to capture people's imagination in some way or maybe it's just too overwhelming to disturbing\nBut I'm you know this report is I I Hope it's another wakeup call a and you know that in some way or we see a society react I fear the worst though are but Joey ... thanks so much for your time today\nA walking us through it thanks for having young so a carpenter is the associate Washington editor for the nation magazine [noise]\nThat shit but as we rent a fire radio I Want to say thank you everyone who is taking the time to support the show by becoming a member of our pocket\nIf you aren't a member ... help support independent media by going to ... dot com Johnny ... for the full show commercial free is the best way to help bring fiery\nDon't forget to follow us on Facebook Instagram and Twitter watch our videos on YouTube you can go to ring of fire radio dot com to find out more jak out my Daily Show the majority report head over the majority ... my daily life dream covering all the biggest news stories of the day\nSam cedar this has been a ring of fire waiting [noise]\n[noise] for\n[noise]\n[noise]\nHello hello hey yo hey or Latin\nIt takes a lot of voices cream sound the boss why what comes out\nCareer readiness to have space for why there\nFor better or read by members of why this is Albuquerque for granted talk aims Thirteen fifty ... is available everywhere you want to let them on our free I honestly can't download it now [noise]\nKnow but ah well\nA way they\nWould\nMan I\nMe to\n\nSay oh\nMay\nNa\n\nNa you\nA job\nMe hold me close\nIs a is\nOnly ... na\nNa na na\nSaying you know\nJust by na\nNa na\n\n\n... ...\nTeam is\nThese [noise]\nMissing journalist pastor returns I'm an Kate President Trump has vowed that Saudi Arabia will be penalized if it is behind the murder of a missing Washington Post columnist corresponded Sam Kiley\nI mean you can't you just like the other than a couple of\nBig money Benedict ... got to be good for a couple of big Macs himself I mean that was his this preferred meal back in the day to big Macs no fries and wash it down with the chocolate shake\nNo exercise yeah real healthy guy anyway\nOne other one other note if Kanye West is that the White House and he was using the White House today and he was speaking and he was saying ridiculous things and and he dropped and M. F. if I got this right he dropped an M. F.\nRight there with Benedict Donald there I this is restoring dignity to the White House right we've got Milan yeah they're doing what Milan is done right we've got Kanye invited to the White House jacking up McDonald's sales I guess Jack in the box and McDonalds\nAnd and and so is this restoring dignity to the White House with with ... dropping really really nasty cuss words right like right there and and and you know and bombs and all this kinda stuff [noise]\nSo anyway I don't think we have restored dignity to the White House I'm just going to go on a limb there and say we we have not restored dignity or to the White House\nBut if there was going to be justice if there was going to be justice in this world that Taylor Swift should have run on to the White House grounds grab that microphone out of Conyers' hand and say you know beyond\nSafe should be here today in not you [noise] and then ... had to cry because he made her cry you see I'm learning all the pop culture stuff missiles or ten years ago is that I'm just learning it now anyway\nI'm catching up on camels slow but any way that he made her cry it turns out I didn't know he ran up on the states can us I don't know if you're you are I'm sure you know this much better than I Do kind of run up as they some award show grab my phone's beyond the should have won the award and Taylor Swift cried\nAnd that's not nice so that's not a nice thing to do right I tell you don't do it not a nice thing to do and\nI think they're doing you All right so I just I I I just I feel better if your feelings are important and it's important to be in touch with your feelings and so watching this back tickle at the White House and going back in my memory banks saying I seem to remember these labels and all of our White Houses so undignified now we've got\nTo restore dignity and just just opposing ... is a good word for it that's where the G\nYou accept the best words juxtaposition\nCompare and contrast right I I don't think we're restoring dignity to the White House\nAnd so I'm going to leave that there because there are much more important things we've got to discuss for example senior legal analysts time is in the next hour\nAnd I want to thank everybody for the emails to norm norm and Goldman dot com because this topic that we're going to do a senior legal analyst on at the beginning of the next hour\nNorman Norman Goldman dot com was very instrumental in getting me to do this\nI don't know if you saw it in the news but\nA whole lot of complaints judicial complaints have been filed against Brett Kavanaugh about his conduct his performance there at the what the Senate or do\nYou think in my opinion of it I think it was\nFair to say oh a lot of people were not impressed with his performance in the Senate so they've launched judicial complaints and yes you can\nHowever I Know the real question everybody's asking is can we get them off the bench with this let me answer is no constitution says how you get a judge off the bench\nHowever I've gone I look we can't keep thinking that we can use these prophecies that were never designed for what we wanted repurposed them for now to repurposed them just as we want to get to a result it doesn't work that way anyway\nSenior legal analysts time at the beginning of the next hour a group of complaints have been lodged against Brett Kavanaugh and the chief judge the so called quote unquote now I'm I'm questioning the legitimacy of the court I'm Sorry this is what Mitch McConnell the Republican state that speaking of spectacles that spectacle\nI'm Sorry it drained away my last vestige of respect for the Supreme Court just a bunch of political hacks now sorry that's what you guys do\nThere are consequences to your actions and so it's a shame it's a shame that a license California attorney has to be on public airways saying I question the legitimacy of Supreme Court by the way Brett Kavanaugh is already speaking up on the Supreme Court\nAnd get hey take a wild guess which side he's supporting in his argument [laughter] yeah he's all over the ... Benedict Donald side so they stuck him on there and he's already paying dividends\nWell Brett Kavanaugh has all these judicial complaints against what's at all about what's gonna what's gonna be the outcome\nWill do with a senior legal analysts time because the chief justice has referred that batch of complaints to the tenth circuit court of appeals which is based in Denver, Colorado if memory serves me right in addition to that\nRachel Maddow last night did a really nice job on a story that a lot of people need to know about and leaving Rachel's excellent reporting aside or in Georgia in Georgia there is a massive conflict of interest because the secretary of state there who's the guy who runs the elections is also the Republican nominee for governor\nAnd he is not recusing himself from anything and in fact he's helping himself to the governorship by purging voters and take a wild guess what skin color is of the voters that he's purging so they're they're really needs to be a lot of attention there and we will give some of that and with that in mind\nVote dot O. R. G. is a website I I Hope you've heard about if not allow me to say it again V. O. T. E. right vote dot ORG vote dot org is a really amazing website it's a nonpartisan and nonprofit\nAnd it'll let you registered to vote if you're still you're within the window but you can also and this is why mentioning it here you can also checked to verify that you are in fact registered so in Georgia\nIt would be very nice if all of the African Americans and any and all Democrats maybe are words the Republican in our purging you I mean that's just reality\nAnd so if you're a Democrat if you're an African American or if you're African American Democrat there are some African American Republicans are you got to go to vote dot org especially in Georgia but generally everywhere else it could be as you can verify your registration and it doesn't take long and so there you go there is vote dot org and it's a shame now\nThat the actual machinery of our elections his has been so corrupted to ...\nThose in George W. Bush Katherine Harris Florida any that bringing back memories this is not new they've been doing this a long time now messing around with the machinery of the elections to influence the outcome\nOne eighty three two one six zero zero one however with all of that set the thing the corporate media is fixated on today\nOne word for hurricane Michael store this was a category for hurricane and keep in mind it was just shy of a category five and it made landfall winds up one hundred fifty five miles per hour and the scope of the devastation now with the sun coming up here this morning is really staggering\nThat is David newer of ABC News and we think ABC for then yeah it is a massive massive hurricane and it's done an incredible amount of damage\nHurricane Michael ... is our hated us by\nThe British sell the way to get half of his way\nThat what we're files drive\nTerrifying Windsor torrential rain\nCarry a pothole filled\nUp for its way all free throw your real rounded ... fares\nDavid mirror again we think ABC News for that and my my continuing view of the matter is nature was fearsome enough before all this climate change and we ended on top of in turbo charged the matter so to me we're just seeing the evidence all the time\nMore and more the fearsome our natures and turbo charged and that can lead to good results\nOne Tripoli three two one six zero zero one is our number and and\nYesterday in the last hour\nI brought up a topic that I wasn't sure if it would go anywhere and Frank because it's a common overseas international\nThing although there's a really big white house tying so at the beginning of the third our yesterday kinda tentative as to whether this story would be of interest to you I did this story about a man named ... ... I think it's in the past tense got to be now Jamal to show he's a he was a Saudi national\nMeaning he was born and raised Saudi Arabia he self exiled to the United states and he was a contributor to the Washington Post the reason he self exiled is he was afraid for safety because he was critical and not as scathing we so he was re moderate critic of the\nSaudi regime the Saudi regime did not like that he was being critical they didn't like that he was in self exile and so he apparently was murdered he ... he had been divorced and he was getting remarried\nHe needed gives a Saudi nationally need to get some papers\nAnd so he went into the consulate in Istanbul, Turkey right the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey Saudi Arabia is pretty far away from turkey right a lot of miles between the two so Saudi Arabia's over there in the middle eastern turkey is kinda you know south east I buy a lot\nAnd so Saudi Arabia has a consulate in Istanbul and Mr to show he goes in there any vanishes and we covered this yesterday in the third our [noise]\nAt American home furniture andme address you can enjoy no how's your shopping with no more shoppers status following you differently than I can tell them side located throughout the dark to help when you're reading American how when did you imagine [noise] [noise]\nI was very glad to see that when I brought up the story yesterday it really got a lot of a ... of interests\nU.S intelligence intercept show Saudi officials had discuss a plan to lure show gave that to Saudi Arabia and detained him\nNow that sounds and camera out and we think CNN for that and that's new reporting today we didn't have that yesterday it turns out our own intelligence agencies hit by the way how badly they friends with Benedict Donald these days anyway our own U.S intelligence agencies ... of course there spying on everybody even our allies and they knew\nThat all the way up right to the very top in the Saudi Government that they wanted to leave their hands on their national and so\nTwenty Republican and Democratic senators are calling on President Trump to order an investigation and the ... disappearance there is a law that authorizes sanctions against the country for extrajudicial killings torture and gross human rights violations even though President Trump has said he would not stop arms sales to Saudi Arabia that\nCounty McCormick we think CBS News for them let's finish this story and then you and me next where justice is served [noise]\nHere's the cold hard truth about hard water in our home nearly Ninety percent of America is affected by it hard water contains harsh mineral that can try outs in hair hard water can raise our electricity bill by up to forty eight percent it even create filled out the pie second\nLead the pathogenic bacteria stressed out yet they'll be\nSalt based water softness can solve all your hard water as you\nGet the full scoop up a little ...\nHere's the story of who wants to play parents love of the game will come in and\nPro scouts came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing\nThe trumpet but\nWas never that good at football\nBut in terms of code\nBut he also learn how to save him a lot of money on a car and drove through ... which is your story has a happy ending after all\n\n\nI'm\n\nReally strikes me as kind of the stuff of of novels of international\nMystery intrigue you know John le Carre or wherever that is a lot of people that write this kind of stuff where you know the industry goes right into the White House well in this case the intrigue really does go right into the White House so you have to understand the way Saudi Arabia is they claim it's a kingdom right there's a royal family well\nThere's been a lot of turmoil in the family lately and\nThe current state of affairs appears to be this one guy like thirty three years old they call him M. B. S. because his name is Mohammed bin Salman he is the crown prince in other words he is their version of Jared Kushner [noise]\nSo basically and by the way he and Jared Kushner had become really really good bugs oh they're they're so close they're they're like\nBlood brothers by now so Jared Kushner and NBS Mohammed bin Salman are really really close and\nI Can't imagine a world where Jared Kushner and Benedict Arnold would not be aware that MBBS was about to assassinate one of his own citizens on foreign so they had to know they had to know\nAnd they had to have given the green light that do said don't worry about it were cool can you imagine if block Obama were still president an MBA as that hey I'm going to go do this they always living in America now and he's a contributor the Washington Post and all but I'm going to just do kill them in the council it and and use a boat so to have\nCome up and and make them disappear that's okay with you isn't that Mr Obama you're good that President Obama that's right President Obama would say you know I think\nWe need to have some more meetings with Iran that would help\nSaudi Arabia of course is the mortal enemy of Iran and vice versa they are the two big heavy weights in the middle east they're combating it out and so the way to make a Saudi Arabia upset is too cozy up to Iran and the way to make a rod said as the cozy up Saudi Arabia and of course everybody plays game but\nBenedict ... of course not playing that game what Benedict out there was this you're going to kill the guy and the reason bent and now of course I by the way I have to confess I don't have facts to back this up but Benedict Arnold has been selling our government\nAnd basically privatizing it and essentially selling you know going to Russia China wherever saying hey\nWhat do I get for this and ... you know they get they monetize so the United Arab Emirates is decided has figured out that the way to Benedict Donald hardest through his wallet and through his son in law's wallet\nAnd so this is the kind of corruption going on here we now have we now have a sitting United States senator a Republican a well respected foreign policy Republican\nFeelings are there probably\nWhole heck of\nA yeah that's Bob Corker he's retiring Tennessee Republican he's on the foreign if it's chair of the foreign affairs to me he's a foreign at a tell all just kind of guy foreign affairs guy and so when he saying I think he's probably been murdered at the previous significant statement although you know\nI Hope he turns up somewhere that was his last line anyway this is the voice of corruption because Benedict Donald is compromise because he's in the\nHe's in the pocket he's on the payroll the Saudi royal family he and his no good son is good for another son in law they're not going to do anything about this but they have to save some words\nI think there are other ways if it turns out to be as bad as it might be there certainly are other ways of handling the situation but I Will tell you up for us right now and I'll say there for the senators [noise] they're spending a hundred and ten\nAnd then dollars purchasing military

I was listening to a a nationally syndicated conservative talk show earlier the host who hails from here in the Seattle area I won't mention his name for the most as does new movie reviews but never mind\nI'm was reporting and I haven't read the story the actual facts so but if you'll see it doesn't matter I don't have facts got it\nRight but the Washington state Supreme Court I think in some kind of a murder definitely conviction appeal has found that somewhere in Washington state constitution fires intended that the death penalty was unconstitutional\nSo that are ... are we\nPerhaps others made Washington the state of Washington can do that\nBut that the state of Washington that yes the\nThe guy on constitutional for the purposes of the constitution of the state of Washington would be fine nothing wrong with that\nBut this particular office that's not the way [laughter]\nFor a few words [laughter] and then he said this is why we need Kavanaugh oh my God you're on hold\nOver at least ... will do with me our one is just ended ball you and I will start new senior legal analyst time with this by the way that was preposterous and it was worth laughing where justice is served\n\nFederalism recognizes that the government that governs best governs locally the idea of federalism is to keep government as much government as opposed to the people as possible that's why the states are really important and then inside the states your local town your village your community your city also\nHas power over you the ideas the smaller and smaller the group that has power over you the more and more you have a chance in a democracy to have an impact on your the governance of your own life so I get to deal with the Los Angeles city council in my city councilmember over the quality of the streets in the city of Los Angeles I don't have to go to Washington for that\nI don't have to Benedict Donald about the streets in Los Angeles it's a local issue the reason it's a local issues because of a federalist system of government that's blitz responsibility for various things amongst the different layers the federal government handles international fares\nBankruptcy see a uniform bankruptcy laws across the country to facilitate business so\nAs and natural incidence of federalism each state is its own kind of like a mini nation in many ways it can't really have an army can't negotiate international treaties that's been given to the federal government but the state still have tremendous power with in their own state borders and\nFor example in Kansas yeah\nThat state Kansas a few years ago\nThe state Supreme Court got into a big fight with the governor then governor Sam Brownback and\nThe legislature because the Kansas City state Supreme Court said under our Kansas State constitution they're off formulas for funding public schools and you cheap skate Republicans\nAre not funding the schools to the minimum required by the state constitution so you've got to do it and they had a big in ...\nKansas State constitutional crisis where the governor was an open defiance of the of the Supreme Court and the legislature saying we'll work it out and everybody's trying to make deals and everybody's posturing that was all in the state of Kansas because the state Supreme Court said under their state constitution they're public education system was screwy and that to fix it\nIn Pennsylvania just a couple of months ago the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court said\nUnder the state constitution that the district lines for Congress were written illegally because they were gerrymandered and therefore they had to be rewritten and because the legislature wouldn't do it to court when did it themselves and all that went to the U.S Supreme Court in the U.S Supreme Court said we don't have any jurisdiction air that's a state that the state issue\nState constitution states report state laws inside the states boundaries\nAnd so when a Republican talk show host is\nGetting upset because exactly the stuff that they say they love doesn't hurt to their resulting advantage they get mad that just exposes the ridiculous is of their views because all they're doing is they're creating ridiculous theories\nThat they think will likely get them to the outcomes that they want and when they get home based on their own pet tarred when their own thing boomerang back on them and exposes them because they lose on the issue then they get mad and yell and scream and tribal everybody into submission and Paul that games got to end\nWell okay so and and what what he's hoping is and the cat\nThat somehow the United States Supreme court and actually didn't live to okay so we talked about getting the United States Supreme court will step in and say\nWashington state's Supreme Court you have to abide by what the legislature says because he's saying if you can't get it through the legislature the court has no business doing this I don't know the court first of all our our Supreme Court is what the body as much as the legislature is\nAnd the ... and the United States Supreme court has no business\nIn any capital case that has to deal with a state law\nThey kept talking about they they have nothing to do with it but what what they're hoping is that here is a short while they're in power they will use the Supreme Court to only the Democrats states\nInto and when they're not in the Supreme Court Dr states' rights days right so they're going to play both sides of the coin\nHim the case that he went into is that a I'm a Washington state capital murder case went to the Supreme Court and he said and the court heard the facts of the cave and said no he doesn't deserve the death penalty and I don't even have to know the case ... noted noted not hear the facts of the case because the Supreme Court does not fight fracking murder cases\nAnd all those and I said OK if there's nothing wrong with this decision screaming wrong with this judge of the song it's the fate deserve it so it was a lie it's faces a high presented that Supreme Court with such a way that could on it but what happened right on Supreme\nCourts don't do trials spree oh it says I cried for report so I don't do trials they don't find facts\nThey accept the fact that were found in the courts beneath them they way the law they say was the jury instruction a proper statement of the law did this jury instruction mislead the jury and would there be a different result is the law were told to them differently that's the job of the state Supreme Court's not to weigh facts and say people deserve it or not\nPaul here's the problem here's the problem you are taking them at\nTheir word that they are principles people they are not principal people they are lying sacks of ... and you know it as well as I Do\nThese are the most insincere people we ever come across you know it and I know you know it even John Boehner knew you know it and I know what this is the most insincere inauthentic group of lions sacks\nA you know what that we've ever seen\nIts own results oriented and we should just stop with the nonsense about this principle involved and I that's my suggestion\nPoll thank you for the call I got to move on to other senior legal endless time but my suggestion is appalling to you is that we just say that I'm stopped trying to address this stuff up his principal we all know it's just wrong naked brute force politics would you please stop insulting my intelligence I mean for\nNow what I see what you're doing you just want to get to the resulting you pre selected and you're looking for a way to get their stop with the stop with the highfalutin notion it's only making you sound silly one eight eight eight three two one six zero zero one\nI'm Still in senior legal analysts time and once we're done I Will have time for you I Will have time for you the rest of this hour one eight eight eight three two one six thousand and one but let me set the scene let's just set the scene so that we get the basic fact right so that we can do this segment of senior legal em all the time but let me get their\nSupreme Court chief justice John Roberts has selected the judicial council of the U.S court of appeals for the tenth circuit to deal with a current or pending complains of judicial misconduct against new associate justice for Kevin [noise]\nBroadcasting cable dot com reports that the Circuit Appeals court where governor used to hold court so that members of the public had begun filing complaints with these circuits that statements he had made during his contentious confirmation hearings in the Senate Judiciary committee\nTraditional cows that are composed of judges and lawyers that deal with court administrative issues\nThat is watching news they've been good to us and we thank them W. O. C. H. I. T. is how they spell it W. O. C. H. I. T. watch it news they're big on YouTube they're big on the Internet and they've been kind to us so thank you and that is again an accurate summary of the facts\nBrett Kavanaugh was until a few days ago a United States court of appeals judge for the DC circuit which means he was one layer below the Supreme Court but still there and Washington DC\nThat means the judicial conduct rules applied to him\nOne look where senior legal enlist I'm here there are federal rules of judicial conduct they do not apply to the Supreme Court and I'm not kidding [noise]\nSorry for the drums thing but the Supreme Court is is literally a way is\nA mess ridiculous hour Brett Kavanaugh was a member of the court or the two layers but he's a sprinkler very much are subject to all the federal rules of judicial conduct and when Brett Kavanaugh\nDid his disgraceful performances in front of the U.S Senate when he said well goes around comes around and you destroyed by live and they do you drink I mean all that horrible stuff\nRight a bunch of people make complaints against him and they are allowed to\nWear a member of the constitution starts our discussion article three regard the courts in it does not\nSeem much it basically says is the Supreme Court the judicial power the United states is in the Supreme Court and whatever else Congress wants to do pretty much you fellas go about doing it and and so Congress and given a really really wide broad set of uh of discretion to deal with the court system and in Nineteen eighty\nCongress used that discretion to create the judicial conduct and disability act of Nineteen eighty\nAnd in the judicial conduct and disability act of Nineteen eighty any citizen any person can make a complaint against the judge\nAnd you're supposed to do it for a judge in your own circuit\nAnd people took that opportunity and there were about a dozen complaints made about Brett Kavanaugh because of his his performance right we know what his opinion\nIf I get my opinion of what I think it was [noise] was it\nWas a really disgraceful performances and a lot of people that are really really negative opinion of that performance and so they filed complaints\nThere was a lot of buzz on the Internet about whether uh whether the chief justice John Roberts was going to do anything well it was actually the chief judge of that circuit the DC circuit of who said you know look this is I\nCherry earlier loving\nOr to our nation is going to make that kind of [noise]\n[noise] and\nI had to say the constitution as the Supreme law of the land and under our system the U.S Supreme Court decides what the U.S Constitution says as blood to cases that's just how our system has been for a very long time and if you want to get rid of an article three judge in articles re judge means\nA judge that has been nominated by the presidency and they confirmed by the Senate once that\nHappens that judge take a look at article three of the constitution\nIs on the court for is in the federal courts for life you can't reduce their pay\nAnd the only way to get rid of them it says in articles three while while in good got wallet under good behavior walk conduct themselves good behavior the spring quarter said it's it's impeachment at the same process and some federal judges lower court judges have been a beach them remove from time to time\nBut what happens when a complaint is made against one for their judicial conduct certainly that has to be an investigation well there's actually a process for that it does not end with the removal where justice wouldn't be\nServed [noise] here's the cold hard truth about hard water in our home nearly Ninety percent of America\nThat could buy a hard water contains harsh mineral that can dry out skin and hair hard water can raise our electricity bill by up to forty eight for from eighty to create Hilda pie second lead pathogenic bacteria stressed out yet don't be felt based water softening can solve all your hard water as you\nGet the full scoop up a little ...\n... here's the story of Laura ... who wants to play parents love of the game will come\nPro scouts came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing\nBut\nWas never that good at football gave up by the time it gets cold\nBut he also learn how to get to see them a lot of money on ... which is your story has a happy ending after all\n\n\n[noise]\nBecause the U.S Supreme Court\nIs the final word on\nThe U.S constitution and because the U.S constitution is the final word on US law we need to pay attention to\nThe Supreme Court and we need to pay attention to the fact that record is not covered by any rules\nAnd this is really important because Brett Kavanaugh's now sitting on the Supreme Court so what do you do\nWhen you've got the Supreme Court of the United states which literally has no rules that apply to me the standard rules of federal employees apply but the there are rules of judicial conduct\nThere were rules that apply to judges like you're not supposed to GO Campaign for a politician right I mean that that that rule applies to a district court judge at the bottom of this relates to the to the ... circuit court judges right they can't go out\nAnd start campaigning for partisan politicians they can go on to raising money for politicians for campaigning for office\nThe Supreme Court can technically yes they can and by the way Antonin Scalia back in the day or as Clarence Thomas these guys I Believe Samuel Alito to have been seen like Koch brother e events technically the rules don't apply to them they can\nDo it so what happens when you have Brett Kavanaugh sitting on the Supreme Court in my opinion it legitimately but I my opinion doesn't carry the day\nWhat happens when he's sitting on the Supreme Court you've got all of these ethics challenges a lodged against him and by the way the law allows it the ... there was a judicial council is you're from watching the news\nThe judicial council is comprised of lawyers and judges there's judicial capitals everywhere there's one in California for the state courts the federal judicial councils into various circuits and so\nWhen a citizen avail themselves of the judicial conduct and disability act of Nineteen eighty\nThey make they can make a complaint against the judge and then it gets investigated it gets investigated\nVery often it is dismissed on grounds that it is really just the sour grapes of a lid again who lost a case very often\nIt when they when they complain his launch against the judge it it's a sour grapes lit again who's who lost a case and that is expressly in the law that says this is not a thing when you're upset about losing an appeal Oric case so very often the complaints are dismissed\nHowever let's assume that the complaint has merit and in this case I think the case does that mirror Brett Kavanaugh why at that time is that the time he conducted himself disgraced he was subject to the rules he was a court of appeals judge the middle layer the rules apply federal judicial rules apply so\nWhat can they do remember they can't kick the judge off because the constitution says the only way you can get rid of a nautical three judge and he was an article three judge them he was confirmed by the Senate for his court of appeals judge chip that\nAll of these judges Supreme Court courts of appeal district courts they're all article three judges their own nominated by the president's eons confirmed by the Senate to Brett Kavanaugh when he was sitting there trying to get on the Supreme Court was already sitting federal judge\nAnd so they can censor him\nThey can't kick him off the can't kick him off I'm ...\nI'm Sorry to be the bearer of bad news the judicial council cannot kick ate a federal judge dirty been confirmed by the Senate has to be nominated by president the only way to do with his impeachment announced remove all by the scent short of kicking them off the bench what they can do is it put a form of censure out there\nIn extreme cases if it's like a district court judge that they can just simply stop assigning cases to the judge and there's a procedure in the long to get a new judge the Congress will approve a new judge and so you can get you basically have a sitting judge you're not doing a whole lot you know that's a rare case that's a very rare case\nBut basically most instances\nThey just dismiss the complaint and even when they find the complaint as merit there's no way they can kick the judge off\nSo you know basically if it's a bankruptcy judge you can kick the bankruptcy judge dropped as a bankruptcy judge is not articles three judges\nBut they can or judge to retire they can wave the rules and kind of help a judge to retire there are ways to deal with this without\nThe judge off the bench and so the remedy for all of these complaints\nAgainst Brett Kavanaugh\nA letter center at most I Would think and I'm not sure even that because now he's a sitting Supreme Court judge\nAnd I got one more and this is kind of the punch line which is when the chief justice of the United states the so called illegitimate chief justice religion or the United states I got to get used to say that now thanks Brent and Neal anyway\nOr when he decided to send this for investigation he said that to the tenth circuit which is in Denver and the judge of the center too is that George W. Bush appointee who is one of the judges Benedict Dahmer was considering putting on the Supreme Court and Brett Kavanaugh's place\nSo I don't think we got us a fair and impartial judge we got us one of the bowl is one of the inside the mole was one of the friends\nAnd I don't think anything's going to happen to those complaints basically what the judge will say my thought is not a prediction but my thought is gonna say well I really don't have any jurisdiction anymore sitting on a Supreme Court not subject to the rules but even if they did anything they they they issue a letter\nSaying in the moment it was probably not the best display of judicial demeanor\n\nHigh as the leaf thanks for calling the norm and Goldman Joe\nHi non thanks for taking my call your um yeah you were talking about a civility um and they've been talking about civility in the White House or whatever but um if you think about it\nThat dream granted the government right\nNow with the White House\nThat Congress and the uh the well to show this highly and its ability that if you look at the things that they are doing and so um to me when\nThe last administration the Obama administration has civility because you had people who for a simple to want to know the civilized in who that was in the you\nKnow like you know tip tip attach all like that in the White House they weren't part but they weren't like this going on so I don't know if how they expect the country the people in the country\nTo be so simple and you know\nAs a whole is not feel that you know what I'm saying\nWell not only do I understand what you're saying but I think it's even worse than what you're saying because if you remember during the Obama years the Republicans in Congress treated him so disrespectful you\nWe intend to her over how this all works did not intend to happen women were given the sole an exclusive childbearing responsibilities and\nThat's just the way it is man sorry you don't get to be a human being monkey and around with God's will and Jesus in nature and impose human rights you're just a little nothing human being nature is what nature does and nature says my body my choice\nAnd that applies to guys and wants to cancer and everybody in tattoos and everything else it's just the way it is it's just like the U.S constitution\nIt's got a feature in it then that's the way it is what do you think\nI think that the difference between the way you and I think and I do respect your opinion and what the hell they arm right I\nJust think that we made\nA lot of people just in the ... ... overwhelming disagreements seems to be on the white or is it not\nNot that I don't have a sewing I didn't I don't know whether it's a fact that he was ... to get into that side and I got a power like look\nYou
