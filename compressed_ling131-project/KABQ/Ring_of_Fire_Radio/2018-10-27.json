S. is too but the U.S says no and there's really no evidence that the U.S has\nWhat the original tree did there was one the first thing they did was very very important in that they ended up destroying over two thousand missiles the two countries this was huge right I mean we\nHad the ... this idea of trying gradually over the years to destroy as many nuclear missiles and prohibit anybody from building new ones was a very very big deal and it worked this was they were both countries have been a compliance\nBut what it basically says is is that you can't build any kind of of miss land based missiles that can fly between three hundred and thirty five hundred miles something like that\nAnd so you know that there have been a lot of cheating around the edges what this really is for its protection of Europe the Soviets and now the Russians\nAre you know this was considered a big threat to Europe and Europe of course you remember all the anti new stuff that happened in the eighties in Europe the Persian missiles and I mean they went nuts because they wanted to station a bunch of\nNuclear weapons in Europe to defend against this and the people of Europe didn't want any part of it so this is a very big deal and it worked\nI worked out pretty well now as I said there is cheating going on and the thing is the Russians have one of the U.S to be the ones to terminate the agreement right they've been provoking it so that the U.S will pull out\nAnd they've been trying this for years and it ... the Bush administration even Don Rumsfeld went in and get outta here we're not doing that and the Obama administration the same thing we're not going to terminate the agreement so that you you know you get you off the hook here\nNow you just you have to comply well all that's changed because John Bolton wants to terminate all agreements and Donald Trump is you know I mean let's face it he's an essay moron particularly when it comes to nuclear\nAnd which he claims to be a big you know believer in arms control and he wants to bring peace to the world and eliminate all arms but his philosophy of how to do that is for us to build up so many nuclear weapons that everyone else will be scared\nAnd they'll ... they'll destroyed theirs because there'll be so frightened and I'm not ... that is not hyperbole either right that is actually what he says he says that outright I mean it's the most sophomoric view in the world but you know and you know what really happens right the U.S builds up everybody else builds up to is what happens so\nI mean it's the exact opposite of what we should be doing but that's his view of it you know he's this very you know schoolyard bully method of of running the world\nAnd so that you know they're they're planning to do this now my suspicion is that you know maybe I'm way off base here but my suspicion is Trump and and and putting have been chit chatting\nOn the ... about arms control from the beginning this seems to be a little tough topic that the two of them talk about but they don't talk about publicly\nRight and in fact the meeting in Helsinki supposedly you know that there was some you know some evidence that they talked about it then so I have a feeling so Trump has announced that he's withdrawing from the treaty he's terminating it and then he's going to meet with putting personally now in Paris next month right after the election\nI have a feeling that the two of them are going to come out with some kind of an announcement sort of on the lines of the Kim Jong un announcement\nWhich will be meaningless and will totally benefit the uh the Russians but Trump well stretch around like his you know the big you know peace maker and that that's how this whole thing is going to come out\nAnd and and the ideas that ah they need to clear the the the\n... of any type of nuclear agreements right\nDo hair up all the old bad ones that were bad for America and that you know that's how Trump will sell that\nThat these were all bad they knew nobody knew what they were doing we're going to do a new one and it's going to be a lot better and now science in agreement to them I mean I could be wrong but I just have a feeling that Trump said some stuff this week\nAbout putting that was totally out of character he says they can't gain need and we did this big trash talk you know world wide wrestling commentary\nThey can't gain me thinking if he thinks he can get away with this he's got something you know he's got another thing coming kind of talk it was very strange when I heard it I went oh that's weird\nAnd it made me think that this is a game that this actually is a game that this is some kind of a thing that they're they've cooked up sort of to create some sense I mean I could you know putting putting isn't a genius and he's not ready you know he's not some bond villain whose trying to take over the world but\nI think he's got Trump's number one way or the other and I think he gets how to manipulate him and I could totally see this happening I could be wrong but it just occurs to me that I could see Trump thinks that the north Korean um pageant over there was a big success and that really\nReally helped him and he helped his image and I could see him thinking that he wants to do something like that with Russia\nYeah uh well I guess we'll see I'm a ... is the time after the midterms I think is going to be perhaps\nThe most consequential and dynamic a lame duck session that we've seen in a long time ... Heather a fact\nLet's let's take a quick break when we come back we'll talk about that and the uh not just the what we can expect in the lame duck session but let's talk about the election itself a

Heather obviously now we are about um less than two weeks out from the mid term elections\nThings have been tightening the opportunity for the Democrats in the house and Senate are becoming a little bit more clear broadly speaking I think\nPeople um think that the Democrats taking the house is likely certainly plausible and possible the Senate much less likely in fact likely that\nThe Democrats do not take the Senate it's very\nTo know because we're talking about turnout and we don't really have particularly good models\nSo we're seeing records across the country we saw records a mid week in early week\nA record or early voting in a an all or you know multiple places in Texas we saw some in Florida but I also remember on the night of the election or the day of the election and twenty sixteen hearing some report that\nFlorida's numbers some pollster has indicated that this is going to be the biggest sweep ever a for Democrats in Florida of course went heavily Republican\nI'm\nAt least in the context of Florida so we're going to be talking on this program\nA to a about a Gillum and what's going on Rick Scott and I'm\nObviously a the the the Senate race in Florida but broadly speaking as you look across the country um what races are you watching most particularly\nWell I mean uh obviously that\nYou know one of the big ones is the governor's race in Georgia with the Stacey Abrams against um\nDisney camp um and that one looks like you know it's it's definitely a flagship rates for a lot of reasons one is that you know she would if if Stacey Abrams were to win she'd be the first African American woman to be coming governor and the other of course is that you know camp is a low life scum\nTwenty eight when the Soviets announced they would dismantle and remove all

missing out on what could be an incredibly important election every day there seems to be a news story coming out about a candidate running for US Senate and governor and here to explain what's going on down in the sunshine state Rick outs and editor of the in weekly\nSo Rick let's let's just start with for our audience who are not uh from uh Florida and maybe aren't familiar with it you know Florida for a long time was always sort of the a turning point of at least our modern presidential elections I'm\nNot to mention that uh there was a little bit of a discrepancy back in two thousand I don't want to dwell on that any more than a hat do at the moment um\nBut uh in this last election in at least in twenty sixteen Donald Trump made a Florida was was was pretty much out of play wasn't it it\nIt it was in Florida is a true swing state uh there were a lot of people believed that Clinton was going to win it in twenty sixteen but the poll started to come in and as they came in at every county turn red except for a handful\nOf Obama was able to win both times here primarily by strong push in the central part of the state where the where the universities are and and that just didn't happen to the Clinton campaign didn't galvanize that same group\nOf voter out there well I mean what I Do have a sense of what that was about in other words was this a um was it a unique\nUm was it unique in the sense that Donald Trump really spoke to Florida values or was it unique in the sense that Hillary Clinton was just not particularly inspiring to a certain populations in Florida for some reason\nOr or or is it was it is it part of a sort of a trajectory I mean what what was behind that\n[noise] well I I think that um a lot of it was just the overall warning you know change\nYou you had the same type of government essentially for eight years and the feeling of change in the Washington was in gridlock I think that was a factor it made people open to to try and something different\nI think that that hit the Clinton campaign even though they brought star power to the state\nAnd had a lot of people going around for ... she just never galvanized motivated people to to to go to the polls as much as the Obama campaign did a and a lot of African American stayed home they didn't get out and vote\nPart of it part of some of the mix messaging that was happening over social media there was a there was a certain amount of you know this is in the bag we don't really need to vote who is going to win I think there was some of that happening some apathy there I think the other half of the was\nThe ... ... she just didn't connect with them at the same level or as a bottles that with their\nOkay so would that um I mean with with with that knowledge\nUm in our mind let's let's turn to this mid term because\nI you know the if I was to put myself in my mind where I was a year ago let's say and I was thinking about the um\nThe Senate race a Bill Nelson and a Rick Scott I think we knew at that point Rick Scott was running I'm not sure if we knew who was going to be a running in the Democratic primary in fact I think we probably didn't right I mean we\nLet's start with the Democratic primary or a democratic or I mean excuse me the the race it for a governor\nElected are there for a moment because I'm\nThat Andrew oil and that's the one well that is a fun one to and let's start with that because I think in some respects I get the sense that\nIf um if if the Democrats a drive the governorship and the Senate at least in Florida\nIt's going to because people pulled um people's I I guess choices were sort of almost in that order in other words that the governor you know we don't see this too too often it seems to me but a new governor pulling across the line in a common\nSenator is I think not a dynamic that is typical raw and tell us about Andrew Gillum because I don't know that a year ago people would've guessed that he would have been the nominee no he would\nUm he was running against the the favored candidate was a ... ram Bob grams daughter a former congressman very personable uh and we were a lot of us are newspaper included sort of looked at at her as well this is the year the woman\nThat this would be in and she was very good on issues but she was not that different from what the Democrats have run in the past down here Sam uh we've had very uh\nBonilla candidates or to to say the least Jim Smith\nA Alex Sink who was a state CFO chief financial officer who lost to Rick Scott the first time the last time they had the governor's race it was Charlie Crist the former governor running hit switched parties\nAre and they were all calm level candidates that didn't excite voters Andrew Gillum is a is I think the new type of candidate that the Democrats really need\nA lot of bold ideas he done back off of an idea they he won't let himself get labeled by the other side he responds to attacks immediately uh\nAnd I want to talk to you I mean I just want to put a pin and that for the moment the I've seen some of those debate clips and that was that was stunning it um and I want to talk about that but continue he's he's got a lot of bold ideas and um and he's I mean is he the first African American a candidate for governor in ... Florida as history\nWell outside probably reconstruction I Believe he is definitely the first of a major political party are to be their nominee going into the general election\nAnd uh he is dynamic he is a he meets people well and he had a really good pitch\nA win win was go in and that we had a lot of other candidates to fill a vein of popular mayor from a Miami Beach was in their Jeff Greene a billionaire that put his money into the campaign\nIn ages sort of seemed to be on the edge of this but he would go around and say we can do what we've done in the past he would tell the Democratic uh people in all the communities we can do what we did in the past and we could lose again I Will wet\nAnd it's a he got a real good influx of money about ten days before the primary and you could just see that the the campaign flip that just see the Suzie as I'm starting to come out that Obama type enthusiasm a and it is carried over\nEr into this general election and and\nA disastrous was slightly hit coming out of the primary in fact Republicans I talked to a lot of Republican powerbroker is a lot of consult us and they were they were excited that Andrew Gillum was was the opponent they thought that he's going to be so easy to beat it has been just the opposite and and their candidate Rhonda Santa's\nIs turning out to be more and more of a one trick or one note a singer and uh with not an empty suit\nOr ... or so or this dynamic we have someone who is I mean a\nRun to citizenship and he's not an old person I mean he's the only both\nAbout the same age I think once forty forty one the other one's thirty nine they're young both of them\nRight and and but Guillen comes off as just simply um he just seems to be a different in the sense that\nA dissent is is saying the same thing that a Republican running for office could have been saying for four years ago six years ago ten years ago Fifteen Years ago\nAre but ... the I ... the idea that uh that can garner a such popularity really I think speaks to\nI'm a dynamic that people are only now beginning to understand in terms of\nOf how voters vote right um you know and you know as I I don't know that as Florida goes the rest of the country goes but I'm Florida is going to be a very different state for the Democratic candidate who's running and twenty or twenty twenty it seems to me in terms of the presidential elections and I would imagine\nThat a a guy like Gillum is going to get in and he's not going to be a cherry picking which people who are going to get their right to vote ballet run that state\nRight well and we're getting Gillum is is important because this is another democratic candidate that doesn't fit the mold of democratic candidates that we've had over the last Twenty years\nObama broke that ... but we didn't have a whole lot of other the same people stayed in the Senate and house seats in and we saw Democrats lose state houses in lose\nA legit state legislatures and and ... the way I I think he is a it's it's still a tight race we're we're talking about five points separate him and ... got a week to go\nA but a little less than a week really but just a few days but uh it is is generated excitement that I haven't seen since when Obama first ran into a which was very exciting for the state\nWell obviously we are now just a days away from the election right or is there early voting in Florida we have thirty seconds\nLand is and I know it it's it's a much higher rate than it was in twenty six day and that's that's the early returns coming back we're having a high number of early voting I think Republicans are voting a little bit more an early voting than Democrats right now but that doesn't mean that they're voting for the scientists and Rick Scott\nInteresting well our folks are if you're in Florida go out and vote in fact if you're anywhere go vote or whether it's um as you hear this or this coming Tuesday I work out in a thanks so much for your time today I really appreciate\nThat you ... recounts in is the editor of in weekly you can buy his latest novel city of grudges wherever books are so [noise]\nHey that just to this week's ring of fire radio I Want to say thank you to every one is taking the time to support this show and become a member of our pocket let's see if you aren't a member us both favor and help support independent media by going to R.

animals\nThe idea that this is at the hands of the president is absolutely\nMrs laughable\nI'm laughing and Sarah Huckabee Sanders face the president feels like we should call out despicable act which is exactly what we're doing die while we're doing we're our\nYou are just principles there are going to be a Pollyanna despicable act and you don't get the thing that I don't get to do that that's not how Americans are you and your good for nothing that you go to Russia where you belong to\nThe president's condemned violence and all forms has been going on you to do a field that everyone has a role to play\nYeah hey hit that guy and I'll pay your legal fees I mean come on a question is pending\nOh are you a real American or are you not Benedict Donald is presenting the issue front and center he's not an American he doesn't know the first thing about being an American he's never read the constitution I don't think he's ever read anything and he doesn't understand the role of a free press\nThey can say whatever they want\nAnd vis vis encouragement of violence against the press\nAgainst your political enemies\nNot an American want eight eight eight three two one six zero zero one one eight eighty three two one six thousand and one\nThis is clearly an effort to terrorize people politically thoughts of choose people for political purposes and attack them because of their beliefs that is the kind of thing we're seeing before and we reject it and we will not be intimidated by\nThat is New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and I was hoping we wouldn't be here I was hoping and begging before November twenty sixteen that we didn't do this now that we're here let's try and make the best of it see we can make some lemonade out of these lemons so here's the lemonade that I'm seeing now\nWho's an American issue is presented justice clear and front and center if your with Benedict Donald you're disqualified as an American you're disqualified as a patriot you're disqualified as a Christian you're disqualified as anything associated with the red white and blue it's very simple the fight is on now\nWho's an American and we're getting to make a really clear choice Benedict Donald foreign Nazi\nMe and you real red blooded Americans who is an American that issue is presented front and center\nThis nation's coming apart at the same it's being torn apart at the seams there's only one way it's going to be held together if the normal people band together and felt the Nazis\n'cause that's what this has become now it's time to some the Nazis because the Nazis or out they are presenting themselves and they're really gonna take it further and further and further or going gonna stop 'em in their tracks\n'cause this is unacceptable sending a\nPipe bomb from some people are political enemies this is what we have some\nOne eight eighty three two one six thousand and one is our number one triple a three to one six zero zero one and believe it or not that's really not the biggest story of the day\nI Know that's hard to believe let's say\nFive years ago twenty Thirteen let's say a story was published in the New York times five years ago that President Obama was using in Unstuck Your cell phone that was being listened to by China and Russia\nChinese and Russian Spies are reportedly listening in on some of president Donald Trump's phone calls that's according to the New York times which report to U.S officials were made aware of the intercepted calls from people working with in foreign governments that time the sources that China is trying to use information from the president calls to help and it's ... feet with the U.S\nThat country has also reportedly using businessmen to pass along the Chinese government's used to people President Trump talks to regularly and hope they will then relay that information back to him\nThat is the u._s._a. today audio service and we think USA Today for that it was about\nHillary's emails you remember Hillary's emails mishandling classified information\nRight so now we go from halftime Hillary's emails to hash tag Trump's cell phone\nSo the idea here in this new New York times report that just dropped tonight is that the president said around talking on his personal phone\nAnd on any given day for any conversation spies for China are listening to those calls they're totally not secure cost totally open to foreign countries listening to them and recording all of them\nFor similarly since they're recording them they could also Dr those recordings and release them to the world as if the president said something he didn't actually say\nOr they could release what he actually said who knows what would be more scandalous but what U.S intelligence has further turned up is that China is using what they're hearing on these calls to come up with new ways to manipulate the U.S president to China's advantage\nI that's Rachel Maddow I trust you recognize the voice that's last night's Rachel Maddow show last night the New York times published on their website this story that Benedict Donald is using a private personal cell phone that is not a\nSecure and that it's a it's back when I was a kid they used to have their remnants of a thing known AS Party\nLines you remember party line there's such a genius back\nI don't know if they're in the west I was in the east back then but you know back in the earlier days of of commercial telephones it you know multiple people could use a line right and you pick up and there were other people's conversations they get off on it was a party line and when I was just growing up as a little kid they were they were on their way out there weren't too many of them left\nBut I got the concept and now you've got the time's up then the kids that they are going what are you kidding me there was a everywhere yet the idea one line shared by multiple users okay that's\nThe concept that is what Benedict Donald got going on right now his personal cell phone is a party line basically when ... when he finishes a conversation what do you ought to do is say goodbye everybody\nTo be just got a whole bunch of people listening in\nWhat it comes to like this is what American\nSpy agency is the official said has learned that China and Russia were eavesdropping on the president cell phone calls from human sources inside foreign governments and intercepted

nor am it's parents in Albuquerque and thanks for being we're losing a beach you\nYeah I'm I'm calling because you were talking about Robert Bork and how the Republicans are all up in arms because the Democrats sabotage pork\nAnd I wanted to give you some background but I haven't heard very much and that that Robert Ford was Richard Nixon hatchet man on the Saturday Night massacre\nYes all the others the attorney general the deputy attorney general they were trying right rather than find\nAre locals house there was ... house\nElia Richardson I think it was a special counsel anyway those names are deep in my memory banks but yes but there there's a there's another thing about Robert Bork though and you're right Robert Bork when Richard Nixon did the Saturday Night massacre\nWhere's your next and said to the attorney general fire the Watergate special prosecutor\nThe attorney general said no and quit and then next and told the deputy attorney general fire him and the that'd be Thursday no equipment Nixon just went down the line and Robert Bork was the guy who finally said sure I'll fire the dude and he did and so we're Robert Bork there was a hero for the Republicans\nBut there's something else more did that got him torpedoed in my legal opinion you want to hear that one\nYeah what's\nThe reason Supreme Court nominees since Robert Mork never talk in detail about their policies and theories of the law they speaking generalities it's because of what happened with Robert Bork\nRobert Bork in his testimony laid out he's legal theory of basically roe versus Wade I mean it was being applied to roe versus Wade he sent\nOut in next wiz Italy detail I think it was like a four border five part test where he said if a wing of the Supreme Court is a B C D any then it gets a pill live it's not a B C D or eat it gets overruled and everybody especially\nThe Democrats said hey wait a second you just sit out a new legal test\nFor over ... roe versus Wade and that's why the Democrats went after him because he said he's being installed by Ronald Reagan to overrule roe versus Wade\nAnd the legal test that he's going to import Jesse manufactured this series is loaded up out of his brain and and it's going to import it into the laws the Supreme\nCourt justice with all his fellow Republicans and so the Democrats said you just gave us the formula to defeat you because you showed us how you're going to overrule roe versus Wade and it is my humble legal and political opinion that that's\nWhat ultimately torpedoed the guy\nA a A N and so since then all the Supreme Court nominees that don't ever do are boarded don't tell them what you plan to do that's my theory on the matter\nI absolutely that I heard that absolutely so they\nYou know what I'm Vince but since then but since then Pam since then basically the Supreme Court has been\nA giant battleground old vote only lately has become the massive better run I mean even Alina Kagan was was confirmed and Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed by some big numbers so it's it's gotten so toxic now the the whole institution is illegitimate and that's sad Pam thanks I think that was born with justice was

remember the name Brett Kavanaugh that's who we're talking about\nBrett Kavanaugh has been on there and what a couple of weeks now and I have been asking have we forgotten about Brett Kavanaugh and I'm very happy to report that no we have not yet forgotten about Brett Kavanaugh and I am from my part will never let us forget about Brett Kavanaugh\nThis is a disgrace and that's nicely put that's putting it nicely okay you'll recall I Know it wasn't that long ago your call that the the overriding theme about Brett Kavanaugh was can we investigated\nAll these complaints that are coming in right that was the whole point was there are people were popping up everywhere and they were making allegations that I have no way of evaluating them it's not my job nor is it your job we have no way of evaluating the stuff people pop up they make allegations\nBrett Kavanaugh denied how the heck do we know whose line is telling the truth that's why we do investigations\nSo everybody was saying can we please take some time and investigate it now of course let's not forget the politics Democrats trying to run out the clock the republic trying to jam through right it's all about the election coming up so you know there's no point to to to have any claim to principle by anybody here it was just a Ron naked political exercise we understand\nAnd so when the Republicans refused to investigate right Dr Christine Blasey Ford's allegations when they you know they had the F the FBI do the most slap dash\nComical ridiculous non investigation and as they see it's okay now\nRight when they did that what the Republicans did was say we refused to investigate we won't investigate the claims of a lot of these claimants and there were people you'll remember popping up saying I knew Brett back then and I can say listen I have this information right now\nAll these people just ignored and then of course we had Julie sweating it do you remember Julie sweat neck I Know that name sounds familiar and Michael ... we all know Michael I have an oddity right okay Julie sweat neck remember this one she alleged that back in the day\nShe was at a party where she was basically fed and Micky right you slip to make you somebody got a very very drunk and she was taken advantage she was a fat gang raped that is her story Julie sweat and he says she was gang raped\nAnd she said that Brett Kavanaugh and his buddy mark judge we're at the party but me to her knowledge did not participate in her gang rape which to me sounds very\nHonest I mean you know if you're going to lie why stop anyway so\nThat to me was a a a credible enough allegation I mean she was in school and the play and there were all these associated facts around Julie sweating it that that's screamed out\nVery Rapid City truth I mean she was in the place right there it's not like she was from you know Nevada or Nebraska you know or some place and there's all of a sudden like\nHow did you get into Maryland at this time me she was out of school at that time she had friends who could verify she was part of that social said she was at the the parties there around I mean she was obviously somebody who was in the place at the time to in a place in a position to tell the story she was telling\nSo all of those what I call associated or background facts right that to to get us to the point where her actual allegation of this is what happened to me that night in that house and this is who is in the room to me it's like okay go investigate and Michael ...\nWell the Republicans of course as you as you know as the historical record will now reflect didn't investigate\nCharles Grassley here senior legal analyst I biggie Charles Grassley who is not a lawyer he's a farmer so they say he's actually he's actually a money he's the mummy who's been shipped from Iowa and I don't think they want him back\nBecause he's been in Washington for about six years now and I think he's mummified but and he's not a lawyer back you know maybe when he was a teenager you know back in the Eighteen ... or whatever I you know he was a farmer but for my part part now or sound smog I really don't I mean I\nI go after other people from being smog I don't want to do that but I just think as a matter of wise public policy making is probably a good idea to have a lawyer in charge of the Senate Judiciary committee may have just helps because you got to it's like being a quarterback in the NFL you have a broader view of the playing field you see all the nooks and crannies the nuances\nThat's why lawyers run the legal system because it's complicated and there's a lot of reasons why it's complicated and it's not just a milk people for legal fees to protect their rights anyway before I go down that tangent overrode Senator Charles Grassley who is not a lawyer\nWho presided over the the debacle that was a whole Brett Kavanaugh experience uh Charles Grassley now has found a new interest investigations yes I'm not I'm not making this stuff up I mean Mitch McConnell going to help me a message I mean you can make this stuff up and and I am not\nSenator Grassley is now demanding an investigation of Julie sweat neck and Michael ... saying that they made false statements before the Senate Judiciary committee\nAre so I'll let you fill in all the punch lines and the ...\nYou want cars that situation Senator Charles Grassley demands investigation of Julie sweat Nick ... this comedy material just waiting to be had there I Will go with the law part and that is this\nWe have seen this in the past where\nCongress for political reasons uh demands were makes reference to the department of justice to say investigate and prosecute and the answer is yes they can ask but they cannot compel they they cannot directly compel\nThey can sort of compel I mean the department of justice is funded by Congress so when they senator who happens to be the powerful senator of the Senate Judiciary committee or the ... they mentioned the chair of the Senate Judiciary committee whether he's a lawyer Nazi relevant he's the chair of the Senate Judiciary committee at the very powerful position and if he gets mad\nAt your agency or your little unit within the agency he can go over to his buddies on the on the budget committee and\nAnd and take out a giant chunk of your budget and so that's kind\nOf how you know the Congress can coerce the bureaucracy to do with Congress once but not directly can't directly forced them to do this\nAnd so this kind of thing\nGoes over to the department of justice and they have the right to kind of back pocket the thing and say yeah OK Senate write him a letter saying we acknowledge your request for an investigation will certainly take a look I Will get back there and then they back pocket the thing and and you you don't hear from it ever again\nThat happens and it is the right of the department of justice and more to the point the prosecutors because what Charles Grassley has really asking for is not an investigation he wants to prosecution he was punishment\nAnd he wants it images and so he doesn't want investigation with prosecution and no senator can force a U.S attorney to\nProsecute a case that's the the the independence of the you know checks and balances right the different branches because the prosecutors during the executive branch and the Senate during the legislative branch so the to the extent of the legislative branch has as influence over the legislative branch is through the money is to funding the agencies and all of that\nBut in terms of who's the boss of the U.S attorney\nLike for the district of Columbia it ain't the Senate it's it's it's the guy in the White House\nRight part of the executive branch through the through the attorney general right to the U. S. juries are part of the department of justice like the FBI is part of the department of justice and the attorney generals in charge of the department of justice and you know who's in charge of the you can hear me smiling you know who's in charge of the department of justice right now he's a little guy\nWas with ... years he's a little elf he looking guy if I were key blur I'd file a lawsuit he sees a trademark I Am not a right as well you know he is All right one Tripoli three two one six zero zero one is our number and David I'm really glad you waited in Minnesota you're on the norm mingled mattress\n[noise] Oh thank you show the machine Norman thank you what\nThis feels cut out my fish or a lawyer I was I heard something about um gone Arizona that the Republican controlled legislature just passed a law or trying to pass a law\nThat will take away your free speech and if you think about they will ship out put you in prison\nNoted author forward chief medical correspondent and salon policies are Dr Bob are not the human body has billions of pain receptors block those receptors with the anesthetic spouting salon ... plus and\nYou'll have relief slump ... plus two dates to anesthetics including the maximum strike lie to gain available that are prescription they numb aggravated nurse for effective lasting relief for only try what I use salon ... plus in the silver box\nWith blue wage\nAn official message from Medicare open enrollment ends and so now for the time to reopen mark [noise] look at everything my prescription drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans have insurers why because climb straight soak in your house I found lower cost for benefits aren't saved my\nOpens with something better Medicare got a call one eight hundred Medicare today open in on the on the phone [noise]\nPaid for by the U.S department of health and Human Services [noise]\n\nOh no the heart radio we can sports time capsule\nHay fell a sports fan than us and I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in sports history that started way back in Eighteen fifty seven where the world's first soccer club or football club Sheffield vaccine\nWas founded in England [noise] this week in Nineteen Twenty one the Green Bay Packers play their first NFL game\nSeven six when over the Minneapolis Marines\nThis week in Nineteen thirty nine NBC becomes the first network to televise a pro football game the Brooklyn Dodgers beat the Philadelphia Eagles twenty three to fourteen Brooklyn's Ebbets Field [noise] this week in Nineteen sixty six ice hockey legends body or of course his first career goal I guess Montreal Canadians\nAt the time of his retirements she was the leading defence ministry history\nWith two hundred and Seventy goal this week in Nineteen sixty seven and New Jersey Americans who later became the New York and New Jersey nets played their first baby a gas and jumping ahead this week in Nineteen Ninety three Joe Carter has only the second baseball World Series winning home run\nAt the Toronto blue jays when game six of the world series defeats the Philadelphia Phillies four games to two\nAnd I can still remember every fossil moment yeah I'm a Phillies fan ... radio weekends for its time capsule\n\n\nThe next nearly our is you and me on the phone at one triple eight three two one six zero zero one and that means Jeff on W. CPT in Illinois Geoff good evening [noise]\n... did you learn a first time I ever called in a radio show a jury or show\nI'm honored boy that's quite an honor you'd never called a radio show before\nNo wow uh what do you want to talk\nAbout is um [noise] do we have anarchy if there is no law or people in the upper echelon\nYes I mean well we have we have the Rouge and of institutions when it appears that there's two systems of justice and the the rich get away with everything and everybody else has a different set of rules then everybody says why why why why abide by these rules and the whole system falls apart that it leads to that I Would go ahead\n[noise] [noise] well the thing of it is um these guys have a\nUm\nThey've ... they've destroyed the law are mean poor people have trouble they get they get thrown in jail sure ... when they get in trouble they they ask them or did you do this or you know [laughter]\nNo I didn't do this ... what do you expect somebody to say yes [laughter]\nTo their guilt [laughter] I agree [noise] I had a guy on the show let me jump in real fast that I had a guy called the show Jeff use couple few years ago and he said the reason the black people are all in prison is because that's where all the crime is\nAnd after I stop laughing in his face I said OK if the police went into the wall street firms they wouldn't find any cocaine\nIf the if if the if the securities Exchange Commission was really really doing their job and audit these firms they wouldn't find financial fraud\nYou don't remember what happened when George W. Bush and his and his criminal friends on Wall street brought down economy none of these things are crimes so I hear you loud and clear Jeff and the problem is is that what we saw when George W. Bush and and the criminals on Wall street brought down the economy was exactly what you're talking about\nTwo systems of justice this country is still upset\nAnd I believe one of the big reasons Benedict Arnold got as close as he did steal and his way in was because we didn't hold Wall Street accountable they stole all the money they rig the economy they took it all it came down crashing down\nPeople lost their homes lives were destroyed they got bailed out then they were left in place and they're all still they're making even more money now the the depths of the thing\nOf the air is still not understood by the political leading this country and so a lot of people saw that and see what's going on and say why am I not get my head against the wall here to do live under a system is rancid in corrupt they you know the rich are getting away with everything the boys on Wall street are getting away with every snorting cocaine by the bucket\nFull right drinking champagne while they're doing it making all this money and ... you know I got to be worried about going to jail for a dime bag of pot\nYeah that is that what you're afraid you buy an ... [laughter]\nExactly ... and the other thing is that when they say the corporations are people shouldn't they be prosecuted what they do what a corporation does some work should they be prosecuted like a person\nOf racial or people in my ... how do you put a corporation [laughter] in\nA few throw the city or the corporate and go\nThere you go no I agree with you Jeff as a matter of my personal opinion of course I agree with you a hundred percent I mean what do you think in my opinion of anyway\nHere's the thing is if the CEOs and\nActually the seat owes if all of the cold the control group in the law they're called the control group and it makes perfect sense if you think about it for a second who can cause a corporation to do something you know who could make Exxon\nInvest in this oil well who can make Exxon decide whether to give its workers are raised who can decide whether to build a new facility here or there if you're if you're Exxon it's the control group is the chief executive officer chief operating officer board of directors\nThese are the people the small group of people at the top that can cause a company to do things that\nAnd it or who's cleaning the bathrooms after hours isn't the in the control group that person doesn't do it\nSo my argument has been all along put the control group and put a whole lot of ... president all of them are ... you know that they put the board of directors in there too that will send a signal\nTo the to everybody that you got a mind your p.'s infusing you got to do things right where are you going to be held accountable and and so if you just start doing some kind of group incarceration or I Want to have to do too many before they wake up\nExactly\nExactly what what are the odds of that ever happening Jeff it's never going to have well let me ask you let me ask you how it can be made to happen\n[laughter] [laughter] well if like eighty percent of this country started voting\n[laughter] if Bernie Sanders where president or Elizabeth Warren were president ah and we had a strong democratic uh you know group of people with a bunch of spines in the house and Senate and we had you know then ... you know that kind\nOf trickled down if I can use the phrase to the regulatory bodies right and then it could happen if we can just this is a point I've been trying to make and you seem like a smart guy so you get it\nWe can have whatever we want we really got under the United States Constitution as it exists now we can have\nWhatever we want we get a Medicare for all we can have free college we can do the transaction tax on Wall street we can do any ... any policy that any liberal or progressive is ever proposed on this show we can have it there's nothing standing in our way except Powell\nAnd to have power you need to win elections and to win elections you gotta work really hard and once you wind power you're going to use it the way I look at how the Republicans are using it\nYou've got to be tough and they're tough and the Democrats don't know how to win elections they don't know what to do once they won the election I mean it's it's sad to watch but the truth is if if if the citizenry\nDot angry enough and got aroused enough and was willing to stick with it long enough and have no short attention span and engage in truly a you know listen to the show for example is that oh this is how the system works\nThey wouldn't need to be socialists they wouldn't need to be democratic socialist they wouldn't need to be arguing with me about Hillary's too close to Wall Street they would understand that the real key is to take over their county their village their town their city first their county\nFirst and everything beneath the county the city the village first then the state then the members of\nThe house in the Senate and US Senate from that state\nDoes Hillary in Wall Street stuff is irrelevant the way the system works as a state based system and you take over your state and the Republicans know this look what they've done their clothes their close to having enough states under their control the coal brand new constitutional convention and if they do that
