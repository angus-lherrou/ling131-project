E. I. T. Z. W. A. L. D. you can find Alex ... great reporting at NBC News dot com MSNBC dot com and I see him on TV on MSNBC which means you can do and now it's another crazy we we'd given up trying to rank them thanks would come back on the norm in Goldman Joe\nAnd armed good to be back next reading math\nWell Alex ah we have rain weeks in this era we we have to talk about violence we have to start with the ... case\nAnd I have trouble believing that this one's actually happening\nThat appears the highest reaches of the Saudi Government intentionally plotting to assassinate murder bodily one of their own citizens inside their own consulate on foreign soil in Turkey and\nA ... job you went in there he didn't come out at least not alive there's all kinds of evidence and there are lies and different admissions Nikki backtracking\nWell Alex obviously it seems to me that from my perspective we have corruption everywhere the Saudis own Trump and so we use in their pocket and Alex ... you're in Washington and how is this how is this playing in Washington [noise]\nWell this has gotten a tremendous amount of attention and it's really dominated the news and conversation here all week and people are are not ready to tell to let it go I think part of that is because it's a evolves the press so you have\nThe press corps which already feels very much a threatened by this administration and the larger\nKind of climate that a trumpet have credit\nAnd then you also have the foreign policy community which new cars show he well he was a an exile\nOr or self uh self exile but but I just sit in and day are very animated by this and they have a long standing before the tremendous rushing to and thinking that he's too soft and too cozy with the stick to ... ...\nLike a Saudi Arabia and Russia\nSo I've been actually surprised at how much support has been running around us and and how unwilling the ministry has been to just kind of do the most basic expectations of of any US President and you know saying this is a is a U.S resident as a journalist to let's get to the bottom of this Trump is to shown no real interest in that no\nEven ... even the lip service to to getting to the to the bottom line is basically just given the entire benefit of the doubt to the Saudis here who have denied it\nAnd it's a fascinating a kind of moment that a ... you know he he says the Saudis deny it they strongly denied so therefore\nI have to believe them when Vladimir couldn't says he doesn't enact elections Trump says he says you can I really strongly denies it I Believe that\nOne Brett Kavanaugh says I didn't must anyone or harass anyone in in high school he says he denied it I Believe that when Roy Moore says he didn't do that with teenage girls Donald Trump says I Believe it and yet when rock about says I was I was born in this country Trump doesn't believe it when\nYou know Hillary Clinton says she she didn't use costs on its mission or email he doesn't believe it and and so on and on and so it it's just an incredible moment about you know who Trump sees as his people and and he will\nBasically believe even the most obvious lie he will believe it at taken at face value hook line and sinker meanwhile for somebody who doesn't like for whatever reason who often uh you know there's certain demographic characteristics that those people often are there's not that you can do\nTo get him to believe that the cold hard fact\nAlan's it's really amazing that an American president is so beholden to foreign interests\nThat are we are seeing this spectacle now and uh Bob Corker the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair retiring senator Republican from Tennessee is nowhere to be\nThese complicit all the Republicans are quiet this is really amazing Lindsey Graham on a week ago said there'll be hell to pay and now he's out there apologizing Israeli shameful and Alex following up on on a map out on the heels of that we have Trump last night in Montana\nEncouraging violence in celebrating violence or a sitting Republican congressmen a guy named Jim forte beat up a a reporter and Donald Trump\nSaid it was good and encourage and everybody was cheering Alex To me is a distraction these trying upset people uh it's pure tactic but everybody's going forward so Alex it does that a bad example I mean having a guy who claims to be president saying was beat up reporters and\nUse violence to advance our political Jenna not not an American thing I mean definitely not an American\nIt's not as it's not a ... a democratic thing I mean it's a it's a\n... of the the basic premise\nOf democracy is that we work our conflicts out through the political process in so that we don't have violence as the entire purpose of this that we don't have a a a a dictator or any kind of autocrat who uses violence to get their way and that we don't have you know a mob rule or\nA street battles between various factions we have a system where peacefully people can make their voices heard and conflicts I worked out so this is ... it's really dangerous stuff\nAnd I think going after yeah reporter you know the the they put it in the the First Amendment for some reason the very first one and it's a the the this is something that you know bridge that Trump is not cross before even though he has said everything else enemies of the people to about it\nReporters he has never actually explicitly condemning the violence against our border and that's I I've been to a lot of Trump rallies when they scream at us they yell at us and it's a little scary a knock knock on the line and this you know who knows somebody I don't think he's telling people to do this but somebody who is maybe a little bit off a little bit\nYou know prone to violence for whatever reason that they have their own issues somebody could take that and see the president had saved and see that as a go ahead a green light to to go ahead and do this and um [noise] you know it's it's not good at it as you said that to say the least\nWere dog into our friend Alex sites wall we've been recapping weeks with Alex science wall virtually since the beginning of the show check out his great reporting at
