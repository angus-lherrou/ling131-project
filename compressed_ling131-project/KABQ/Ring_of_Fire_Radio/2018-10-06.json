Kavanaugh with demonstrators in the gallery\nTheir box you'd have to have on there but he had dinosaurs and all the rest of it as far as they're concerned because then the young artists and all the rest ridiculous\nThing six hundred years well let me back up just a second I'm first of all we saw it was almost there was an effort in the nineteenth century\nTo adjust to the real world we we saw it happen was Judaism as well right you know you had Judaism says look we can't be so extreme in the little nature of our beliefs\nThat we don't have broad appeal so the nineteenth century you started developing that same kind of divide words right with the brain started saying look we want to attract people to Christianity therefore we have to abandon the idea that no one showed up with dinosaurs\nSome did but others just did a cheap thing that is very American and that is they kept their beliefs but they re branded them and they called fundamentalism evangelicalism they gave it a nice spin they kind of separate it off from the racism that had gone with the\nFundamentalist movement often in the south and folks like Billy Graham Christianity day magazine and my own father Francis Schaffer who became one of the founders of the religious right\nEmerged to say no you know we're not fundamentalists although they didn't change the theology we are evangelicals and that's a nicer kinder gentler version of the same thing but it's still exclusionary and God love you but by the way if you don't accept Jesus he's going to burn you and how forever\nYou know what is it that way ever change right what happened in the division from a ... material I've read from you is that\nIt it's almost like the real extreme event evangelicals that as you as you point out\nThey renamed themselves evangelicals right cause they for from standpoint as they were they were embarrassed by what was happening they want to disguise it but nevertheless they came away pouting they came away the embattled in in this adversarial kind of a position where the rest of the world\nYeah and of course that spilled over into the religious right that we were part of it in the seventies and eighties with the anti abortion movement and then that of course is the formative states then eventually\nFull speed ahead to Ted Cruz today and you've got the Tea Party movement saying listen we don't care what it does to the world economy or if it costs America twenty four billion dollars we're shutting down the government because we are bitter\nAgainst anybody who's not part of us and that's the saved in last paradigm that's the black and white paradigm you're either you know right with Jesus or you're going to hell and you apply that paradigm to American politics and you've got to kind of delusional stuff that I've been writing about in my new book and got said Billy\nVery good stuff by the way thank you which is really an examination of this delusional quality of of American religion which essentially has not only cut itself off from fact based history and politics\nBut now fast forward to our movement with Fox News and all the rest has an entirely alternative system of approved communication that doesn't even relate to fact\nOkay let let me ask you about let me ask you about that okay we come out of the shutdown war okay and everybody says okay who are these people will those who are these people\nIn with the analysis of a purely secular analysis it is well there are people who simply don't want to pay more taxes there are people\nThey're anti government people right but there's more to that and that's what I read in what you're saying you're saying that if we really does still what is this new movement about ... just like their recalcitrant about evolution their recalcitrant about global warming their recalcitrant about gay rights\nThere are also recalcitrant about increasing the debt limit and that's the same group the this literal Bible group that we're talking about is that\nThat I don't remember where I came out of you know we had a lot to do with Republican leaders back in the seventies and eighties people like Jack Kemp Bob Dole you can disagree on policy but they weren't living in la la land now what we have is essentially the village idiots not only controlling the Tea Party but through the Tea Party in gerrymandering the Republican Party\nAnd you've got to understand these aren't outsiders knocking on the door demanding attention for their little pet peeve they are senators they are congressman\nAnd they've got a lock on the direction of our other major political party this is serious stuff\nAnd they they abide and then I'll turn of the universe and where the media doesn't get it and why I wrote and God said Billy is this and that is unless you understand\nThat America's problems are not politically rooted they're rooted in delusional religion and extremism then you don't get it I'll give you a parallel I'm not saying there's an analogy but I think it's apt\nAnd that is there's no point discussing why people put on suicide vests and blow up mosques if you're never going to mention radical Islam if you don't mention radical fundamentalist right wing white predominantly southern often bigoted racist Christianity then you're not going to have a clue\nAs to why Ted Cruz's father is a crazy man why Ted Cruz's inherited that extremist right wing mental\nAnd why they're religious delusion that has taken the Tea Party over the edge is threatening to take so much of our country's politics down or why there's gridlock and as I say you know it's not a question of a parallel between whether it's extreme on the left an extreme on the right they're all\nYeah it's a moral equivalency that moral equivalence has gotten so ridiculous with the media were there's right well she both know that both sides don't do the bone had things that we see coming from the right wing crazy evangelicals I mean there's no other way to describe it except do brain ignorance\nThere is and and and and I'll tell you what it's worse than that because it's willful ignorance at saying look we don't care what science says about global warming we don't care what the International Monetary fund predicts for America if we default we don't care what the fossil record shows on evolution we're going to circle the wagons\nAnd as my character billion on God said Billy did come out of a home school background that feeds on the delusion\nAnd then let's listen to the society through people like Fox News and the right wing media but the secular media and this is where I felt people like the New York times and the New Yorker and others with a few exceptions are people who write about at once in a while\nYou could read Marines of political coverage and never get to the fact that one thing fine sixty Seventy even eighty percent of all these people together their leaders the Fox news watchers and all these guys\nIt's radicalized bitter\nAdversarial evangelical Christian\nAnd the bitterness that you're talking about comes out of their last war in the late Nineteen century when you read when you had really correct think or say look we can't ignore science we can't simply stand there and say\nThat Darwin was wrong when he has this empirical data to show it's true right we we can't ignore the fact that the sun comes up in in in goes down in a certain\nWay every day and and and but nevertheless what is it\nWhat is it right now again let me let me preface this statement by telling you this I was raised in the south around all of this so but if you're if you haven't been\nRaised where your neighbors are you know Pentecostal Southern Baptists right you know really extreme you don't get this you don't even know it exists right so so what is it that allows these folks to put themselves in the past year where they can allow themselves to do that let's take a break and pick up with that sure\n[noise] checking out the

[noise]\nWelcome back to rent a firearm Robert F Kennedy junior it's been fifty years at the University of Mississippi old mess was forced to comply with federal immigration laws and since that day fifty years ago the United states\nHas made tremendous progress in racial equality however even with that progress there are still too many segments of the population that are struggling to achieve a quality but the progress we've made so far\nCould not have been achieved at weren't for the courageous effort of heroic citizens or refuse to be treated as second class Americans and I have one of the\nRaid figures of that age my friend James Meredith who was the African American student who was admitted to old mess and I think originally I Know you said at one point you'd been inspired by President Kennedy's inaugural address\nJames Meredith was in the United States Air force from Nineteen fifty wanted Nineteen sixties any attempt at Jackson State university for two years and then decided to enter the\nSacred citadel of old mess which had been a white enclave since its founding the brown versus board of education case had been issued by the Supreme Court Nineteen fifty\nFour [noise] and he was twice denied and trends and then the U.S Supreme Court declared that old mess must admit him governor Ross Barnett who had actually supported\nPresident Kennedy and his Nineteen sixty campaign became his adversary and President Kennedy's and my father's efforts to get James Meredith admitted to the state and there was a male a at that time that I and many people's view was\nKind of the last great battle of the civil war was over ten thousand United States troops was five hundred US marshals a hundred and sixty of them were injured\nAnd the riot as rednecks came in from ... from Birmingham and from Selma and from lounge county\nAnd from as far away as California last squirrel guns and rocks and bricks and attack the life Sam building\nWhere the U.S marshals had gathered for less than two people were killed\nBut in the end James Meredith with the help of one of my father's closest friends John or answered the university and I think you you said in the past you slapped very well that night\nRight you actually were in a dorm behind the lights and building and you went to sleep early well all the while the riot was going on is that is that right\nYes that's that's true that's correct because you had done your job absolutely\nAnd that was to get the government of the United states to use the middle of a force\nOf this nation to in the rye privileges of oh citizen blacks\nWill talk about your relationship to the Kennedy Justice Department\nWell I always considered the Justice Department the president's brother your father Robert Kennedy and it was his decision and that decision I Believe he was to\nExtend the coverage jumps citizenship right everybody and I think he understood that and they carried it out for the first time it's just that to me\nHow the chief of the civil rights division at that time was my father's friends\nTo a former Yale Law professor Burke Marshall and his other friend was a Republican whose name was John door had he\nFound those two sitting in the office on I think it was on a friday afternoon and he said to them I Want you to go down to Mississippi and make sure that James Meredith gets into the university\nAnd of course that's exactly what I mean you you know things I don't know but I certainly believe what you said this is what I the first time I actually talked to anybody it was true your father and I was\n... years later when he was senator from New York and I was a student at Columbia Law school\nYou met John door when he was down in Mississippi with you a new ad burqa Marshall\nOh yes I I I particularly Britain much all I have no doubt about it for the reason I wrote\nTo your father it's kind of general actually it was more to the Kennedy administration but the little one yeah and that was not that cause that\nAnd how did that happen exactly did you call the Justice Department first\nWell actually that was a young lawyer just graduated ha what became Mississippi to practice William Hague ugly\nWith the night and\nHe was really the one that brought the macho and to the pitcher and you're ready for me to an attorney assistant attorney general ... much to have a

Joe Donnelly of Indiana said he's voting no now they may flip and vote yes I don't see it happening they've already announced so they're voting if they flip it just looks ridiculous it looks very political so it looks like\nTomorrow will be the final vote will know tomorrow what the final vote is but the day was a preliminary vote what they call cloture to get to the final vote so\nToday's vote was kind of a a a preview\nAnd one Republican voted no Lisa Murkowski of Alaska one Republican one Democrat voted yes that's Joe Manchin of West Virginia so with one Republican oh and one democratic yes that's fifty one to forty nine and so there you know\nSenator voted if they want to forty nine to advance the Supreme Court nomination effect cabinet that is as slim majority and margin as you can get\nIn the United states that now the final vote is expected to be held at some point tomorrow\nIt is not over yet all eyes are on three senators who voted yet today on that procedural measure Republican Susan Collins and Jeff Flake and Democrat and Joe Manchin any of 'em could vote the other way when it comes to the actual vote to confirm\nThat is Dana Bash of CNN and we think CNN for that but I don't think it's going that way and nobody else seems to think it's going to go that way it looks like the final vote will be tomorrow and the final vote will be fifty one to forty nine when one Republican knowing one democratic yes our\nLet's assume that you and I\nFind Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S Supreme Court and they just jam through despite all that we have seen and gone through in these last days okay [noise] the way I approach this\nWhen I was considering it earlier today was to say\nLet's put the shoe on the other foot write letters do what the law school professors torment law school students with endlessly all the time and forever they give you a case right there is in law school you're working over the facts of a case can be any case\nProduct liability criminal it does not matter so you've got a case in the law professors leading this class discussion about this case\nAnd the professor you know you're pretty far into the discussion you got a good handle on the case on the facts in the law and all this and then the professor has the fun part and says okay now let's change one fact\nAnd then the professor course picks one really personal fact and changes in says how does that change if if at all the analysis the outcome let's change one fact and it's a very very useful tool not just in law school with law students so very useful tool\nWhen you and I apply this to just ordinary current events right\nWe saw the New York times blockbuster report this week on Donald Trump's tax fraud alright\nHow bout of a middle class black family tried that stuck you think the Irish let him get away with that how about all the shootings of white by white police officer let's change one fact what's making black police officers or ... and white victim right change one fact and things change you can see how things changed that tell you expose issues\nAre so that's what I did today and I said let's change one fact\nFlip it that's it would change that one fact that that fifty one forty nine Democrats Democratic president Jimmy through a Supreme Court justice that has been accused of being a drunk and costing women and and the lying under oath and was belligerent to the Senate change one fact\nDemocrats doing it Republicans in the minority Democrats than majority and once I did that and I started to look at it from that angle it all fell into

presentation in my view of the Republican Party they would simply there they would be so incensed at what we've just witnessed if if we change one factor versus and it was a Democratic president who got in with two point eight million less votes right I mean that just no facts change except one\nDemocratic president Democratic Senate fifty one forty nine jamming through somebody with all these allegations you know the Republicans would be\nApoplectic I have the best words they would be so melting as the best word\nThey will get the right and so you know they would go and destroy the U.S Supreme Court and here's how they would do it they attack its legitimacy the Supreme Court does not have a police force right there were US marshals right I mean the the the U.S Marshal Service been around since Seventy nine ... but that that how are they going to how they're going to do\nThe Supreme Court lives\nOn our acceptance of its legitimacy and the Republicans know that Mitch McConnell knows it and now you and I know and so\nIf this situation can reverse and there were you know Democratic president Jemma democratic or judges Amir after holding a seat open with a Republican president boy they would have freaked out right think about this the situation just flipping Democrats or Republicans Merrick Garland right withheld for a year the Republicans\nWould go after the Supreme Court and de legitimize\nThey would they would have infiltrators saying you're not you're not a real court they wouldn't call him chief justice Roberts right they would do everything they would it would it'd be like South Carolina before the civil war passing\nResolutions of nullification senor federal laws don't apply on our land this is where the Republicans have taken us they're getting us back\nTo to the question of what does it mean to be an American\nAnd what does it mean to be America and\n... over there kept playing and by the way he didn't do this boot and didn't do this\nThe Republicans started this is my president Obama was inaugurated when Mitch McConnell got 'em altogether and you know that meeting the night President Obama became President Obama January twenty two thousand nine there was a Republican leaders meeting and they said we will obstruct everything right and you remember what they did during President Obama's turn okay well booed and said hey\nI'm a turbo charged that thing he hijacked their movement he he joined in with them and they know it may have joined in within the Republican Party has the lead with Russia and I'm Don Donald Trump is ... and here's where we are so\nSeems to me if the Democrats want\nTo do something other than accept red cabin on the Supreme Court forget about impeachment forget because the word impeachment does not mean removal okay in removal means two things to things impeachment announcing and remove all by the Senate\nYou need sixty seven and it ain't happening so if you want to get rid of him I'm Sorry you're going to have to do with the Republicans were doing hound him out of office and I mean how look what the Republicans would do\nThey would not let the Supreme Court function they would disrupted they would deny the legitimacy of its rulings they would be in the public I always just throwing battery acid on the court saying these are legitimate this so called court you know it and I know\nYou know what else John Boehner knows it to you know\nAnd I know what we all know so if you want to do something about it my suggestion would be do what the Republicans do however I don't see it happening Democrats are like Republicans Democrats are not at all like Republicans so what do you do my thanks for calling from Chicago Hi uh my\n... doing I'm I'm getting through the day what's on your mind\nOkay first of all I mean just come out and say I'm a Republican from Chicago let's talk about America early or number Nineteen Ninety to Joe Biden Senate for any president as last year should not nominate Supreme Court let the voters decide\nHe said that you're not if you said it right he said it was whether they were on their way no no no no no no no no way go way\nYou're going to have a conversation with me or we're going to not do this okay here goes Joe Biden said it didn't do it Mitch McConnell went and did it okay here's my question to you and I'll give you back the airways is it only for presidents or does it apply the senators to\nGo ahead\nWell this is a presidential year no no no no no no no no no does the rule that no lame ducks put Supreme Court justices on is that only presidents who is it only is it for senators and presidents are only presidents\nBecause you're saying you're saying that Joe Biden saying this in Ninety two sat there and then okay rate Mitch McConnell then wouldn't follow the rules I'll go along with you one of those great so does it apply to senators to replies that would be really great\nAnd why is Jeff Flake and Orrin Hatch and Bob Corker voting for this guy they can't they disqualified from the Joe Biden Mitch McConnell world and you just agreed with me\nActually shut shorts at the same thing or two thousand eight\nSo great ... so we're all on a statement so we're on the same page if you're a lame duck president or you were a lame duck senator you can't participate in the process of putting a Supreme Court justice on because the rule is lame ducks don't leave lifetime ... just behind\nRight okay that's great so we're now so I get by so Brett Kavanaugh so you're gone and so with Brett Kavanaugh you'll just through rent cabinet off the Supreme Court\nYou're you're such a troll you're so interested in being a knocked that you just lost the argument bro on the merits here's what you should have said if you were if you were a better role than that what you would have said was known on it only applies to presidents this president's pat Simmons only\nDevices that can sense and my response would have been it takes two\nIn the U.S constitution it takes to\nTo get someone on the Supreme Court they are constitutionally equivalent a president to nominate but as we saw with Merrick Garland it doesn't work that way if the Senate doesn't do its part right it takes two to tango\nSo if we're talking about the lame ducks leaving lifetime Supreme Court judges on there is no logical commonsense\nReason why it doesn't apply to US Senators the only reason it's being applied to presidents is because right now Republicans rent control and they want them to stop Obama and Jim is do through so they were OK with lame duck senators like Orrin Hatch of Utah Jeff Flake of Arizona Bob Corker of Tennessee that's three if the if the McConnell\nBiden Obama rule applied Merrick Garland Merrick Garland forgetting are gone with this current do Kavanaugh wouldn't be there\nRenowned medical correspondent and endurance race champion pop are not empty people asked me\nHow you keep eating at the age of Seventeen healthy

right I mean we're not you know people like they like to get out to march but they only want to do it once a year and then have a big big march and then but not do it on a daily or weekly basis so I have got to sit to proposes for you [noise]\nWhat Congress should do and we can do it once we get a hopefully a Democratic president and Congress and Senate is to increase the size of the ... of the house of representatives by at least a hundred maybe a hundred and fifty because it was set back in Nineteen eleven and do you know what the population in the of the United states was in Nineteen eleven\nHundred million a close Ninety three there you go and today is what three hundred and thirty twenty or something like that\nSo you know I think it's perfectly justified to increase it significantly\nAnd that would then go give a lot more weight to the large states you know and to help to help to um overcome the advantage of the Senate that the Senate gives the small states were guarding the Supreme Court [noise]\nThe only way that the Supreme Court is going to get back and stop being the institution it is it's going to become very rapidly\nIn a ... and take it from the forces of darkness an evil or into the forces of goodness and light is one of one of two things has to happen either a if there are things happened happened simultaneously which are a Democratic president Democratic Senate and then Clarence Thomas dies\nOr if that does not happen and I think the odds you know all of a trifecta like that are small when we became when if and when we ever have a ... you know a unified democratic you know administration or government a presidency and Congress and Senate\nIf we increase the size of the Supreme Court to eleven and you know I realize you're going to say that's going to the Republicans are going to come back and do it so what\nGenerally agree of course this point I'm ready to destroy the Supreme Court I'm ready to turn them into a partisan rank institution because that's what the Republicans do look they've destroyed the presidency they've destroyed Congress they've destroyed the states they're destroying everything\nThey liked destroying government and they relish the value of the Democrats don't want to destroy government well I'm One Democrat is willing to destroy the Supreme Court's because right now the Supreme Court the enemy of the people\n... and we're ... was in robes so I and why would use the Republican play book Chris and destroy the Supreme Court\nTurned them into a joke turned it into a joke just say they're ... and just go on a long sustained campaign Chris I got to leave it there and that's the end of the first hour however\nWhat I Want and what actually happens are never the same thing because I don't get to control things I'm not the Koch brothers I don't have all that money I don't get this fund armies that go besieged the Supreme Court anyway if you want the guy off the street or if you want Kevin ... gonna have to hound them out and the way to\nHound them out of town to Supreme Court chief justice I don't think it's going to happen with justice won't be served\n\nNo one wants to be in an accident

the months by fifty three thousand over the year employment and leisure and hospitality were little changed over the months that's mine is Seventeen thousand but that's because of the impact of

to live in the eating that what goes on your bank right get some health care I mean what good is the job of its inadequate\nIt's about the quality of the jobs and that doesn't get measured very well by these governments stepped in any event the issue is\nBrett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court now I don't think it was a smart choice to put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court and I would have made other choices but as we just heard about the economic situation here jobs are\nTight so you got to be smart so if you're an employer and you're living in these jobs numbers and I just did or if you

to me the way to get Brett Kavanaugh out of the Supreme Court has not impeachment in the house to remove all in the Senate it'll never happen the way to do this to hound them out and I don't mean I don't mean show up at his house and prevent him from sleeping I'm not talking about criminal harassment\nNo none of that no no no no I'm not talking about harassing Brett Kavanaugh\nFact I'm not talking about harassing anybody I'm Talking about going after the chief justice of the United states to see you sir our presiding over a kangaroo court that is illegitimate and you have a really big group of Americans who do not recognize you as legitimate and\nA lot of it's because of that do Kavanaugh so if you want to have\nA nice smooth Supreme Court live where we just listening to your opinions of follow along you'll get him out\nYou will hustle this dude off the Supreme Court and you will get Merrick Garland on their otherwise you've just found chief justice Roberts that basically every day when you go to work is going to be protesters outside the Supreme Court\nCalling you will legitimate\nSaying we're not obeying rulings you will find us in our democratic states telling our state legislature towards to ignore and disobeyed Supreme Court decisions and to do it with resolutions of nullification Jeff like South Carolina did before the civil war if this is what you boys one

each way to advance the gateway Hillary's emails we'll just slapped me I think it's rather than ... Democrats\nThe Republicans\nWould go after the Supreme Court I don't mean physically like burn it down although I wouldn't put it best some of their followers however in the main what the Republicans would do would be to quote unquote destroy the Supreme Court\nBy bringing it down and everybody's eyes as they know they're dirty\nInstitution full of politicians who can't be trusted you know that's exactly what the Republicans would do I don't think the Democrats have it in a in fact I'm back in the production business I guarantee the Democrats don't have it in\nThe Democrats don't have the money they don't have the organization they don't have the infantry the Democrats are are are different species from Republicans and\nI have lots of facts to back it up you know why take a look at America now I\nDon't have facts to back this up the Republicans are clear minority and they've got all the\n... Lin wood Lin wood in Virginia I'm pronouncing your name right Linwood\nYes you are wherever you are wherever town here in LA area when would you should move here and you can be limited in what

anyway I'm Sorry thank you for calling and give a clever neither would I ...\nI was telling the screener I'm a Democrat photo we I mean yeah the Democrats put the effort up I thought it was filling the fact that they turned around and waste all that political capital and trying to stop this judge from getting on that court um\nHow I Would their voters have reacted if they hadn't put up that kind of\nHad the truth is they have the momentum you know they have the momentum all they need it would stick stick to the game plan now I Would I Would say yeah\nThey get it and that can Republicans that disagree with me I said they've already fundamentally\nThis country has already lost faith and its institutions yes do you really want to change it down that path of they they were saying\nThe Supreme Court is illegitimate um where okay we're not going to your bank rolling on something okay we'll just remember against you\nKnow I didn't have any more it will just ignore it will just ignore it and go about our business and and good luck and forcing you're really and by the way in some some places they may be able to do it and other places they will have a hard time what I'm suggesting dealing with is this is a very very dangerous thing for America\nThis is civil war break up the union kind of stuff but I'm not the one who brought us here I'm not the one who brought us a year it's about time the Republicans learned they really really large got a really large dose of their own medicine what they do is when I was Troy the government's so let's now they're in control of it let's destroy it they said the FBI is illegitimate and the FBI is rigged\nGreat look at this thing this spectacle and just deal with the Senate\nThe FBI is it legitimate is rigged the up and I have no respect for the FBI they're not a legitimate law enforcement groups there Joe a bunch of political act\nThis is what the Republicans want let's give it to them\nAnd let and the chief justice chief justice of the

got to go do you've got to go you have brought this\nThat you don't like pig pen from Neil peanuts comics you brought to stick with you and they have a higher court is messed up now you got a God
