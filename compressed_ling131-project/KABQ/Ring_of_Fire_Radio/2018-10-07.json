A. R. I. S. S. virus object runner and they are ...\nOkay David Ferris has a book of good ideas I have a three hour Daily Show good ideas from callers so how do we bell the cat how do we take power how do we organize the Democrats to march to the polls every election\nThe boy we aren't doing it the ... this is this is the problem is already feeling it no no no\nEverybody's assuming it everybody assumed Hillary would when everybody assumed were going to take the house and maybe the Senate and and what I see is\nDemocrats don't understand power I'm very I'm being as as honest and streaming weren't as I can\nDemocrats don't understand power they don't understand how our system works and they don't have the the the intestinal temperament to learn from my perspective and I've been looking a long time I've been doing the show for nine years now\nDemocrats don't have a long term perspective they don't they don't they don't have the patience to sit and learn how the system works they don't have the patience to sit and work to make the system works for them\nThe Republicans have a couple of advantages they've got money boys on their side stoked them with all kinds of funds to them the resources they need the\nRepublicans also have the luxury of time because they represent the rich and the comfortable they're not out there saying\nLooked at all these homeless people are still you know and the Democrats live in the moment because the Democrats feel everybody's paying all the time and I know how to do about it now how\nDemocrats never ever planned for the future Democrat for the Democrats are the most pathetic bunch of people I've ever seen\nIn my life and I'm being very serious about it you can't get them organized they refused to organize everyone knows what's best for everyone else and I suspect David Ferris is one of them as well so very with all that cold water I just threw all over everybody my question remains Hattie a bell the cat\nThat very weird and we get a weird way you\nGet the political will to take power\nAnd then explain to the people who've now what the Democrats in power that they need to\nPatiently work block by block day by day minute by minute to implement this over decades they'll never say never stand for it they'll call you a corporate shill you're too close to Wall Street journal stumble bombs you're a moderate get outta\nHere where Bernie I Puntland\nYour hard on that more\nManned government we have to focus on the positive and assessment of the Democrats it's inaccurate America that progress I don't think we are not the corporate Democrats went on\nTo the guy the guy's your the guys who stopped us from winning and twenty sixteen\nI couldn't go no such thing I voted for Hillary thank you very much\nAnd I and I voted for Bernie in the primary but you understand that you understand very because you're educated that it was Seventy seven thousand votes spread across three states with as few as eleven thousand in Michigan out of four million cast\nThat gave this I said that gave all the yes voters upbringing why were the voters suppressed in Michigan because the Democrats in Michigan or a bunch of bombs who sat on their ass\nAnd didn't do anything and they let the Republicans take over the states so that they could Reagan same in Florida same in Pennsylvania seem in Wisconsin because the Democrats don't\nWork the Democrats don't work day in day out understanding that it's bad that it's election cycle after election cycle the Democrats are purists to say I didn't get what I Want in a system where there is an\nOcean of apathy with Ninety million people never participating to them the system rules them\nThey are ruled by the system Ninety million people have no faith in the government in a registered to vote they they don't care they don't know to care\nThey don't give a rat's rear end and then I'll never reached Ninety million people they don't want nothing to do I start talking politics they're gone tuned out forget it they don't understand this is about their lives and the reason they're life sucks so much because they're they don't get involved in politics I you can explain it to them so you you take Ninety million voters off the bat\nNow you down to a hundred and thirty million and or a hundred and forty million and you take a bunch of people who are in Brazil's who fall for the stuff the Republicans give you this half now you've got a half\nSitting there going okay what do we do and then a slice of them says no you're not good enough\nThat's how you lose elections in Florida by five hundred and thirty seven votes because you'll let these people take power in the states they rig the states the state's run the elections they take over the legislatures because the Democrats don't know how the system works they won't do the work to get it done and the evidence is everywhere look at it\nI Julian Minneapolis Hi Julie\nHi may not find me don't hang up on our McCray something but I'm going to make a very gentle sweet quiet request regarding\nJudge Kavanaugh when he's on the Supreme Court he's not going to show up at the waffle house okay but if you happen to me at a rarified restaurant where he's paying twenty dollars sure his beer just quietly walk up to the table and a very sweet and snide and Ninety quiet voice day you know I don't appreciate paying\nSalary just walk away nobody else\nWhy we're here I Would I hang up on her why would I I I\nI Would do even more I Would do even more I Would I Would just walk up to him as a dude I got a keg outside come on let's go party time Rob how long they look at the gutters out their mental accommodate lots of vomit come on ... brother and then I'd walk away then I'd walk away\n[laughter] [noise] you know I Would like to say I listen chair we feel that\nI'm listening going [laughter] okay I got a weird phone I Would just like to say that I Hope\nThat Susan Collins got a big fat that is well known that let's say the last seven and then at the first speech I listen to it all that with the small that's slicing and I think our whole life and gracious hair job out of sexual assault and ask them that I've ever seen in my life\nShe was going to get to ... just the opposite of ... sad and I quote well Kavanaugh was in a chair and how we all done things and teenagers which right away shows you that he thought Kevin all his life\nOn the line and she got to get the prize don't you think\nI I Do believe that Susan Collins has ended her political career today I'm not kidding around there Julie I'm ... I got to leave it there but thank you very much uh I Do believe the Susan Collins ended her political career today I'm not joking around and the reason for that is is that the people of Maine are really really really upset\nHe did the people who are going to probably pretty upset with what happened today I Dave in Oregon\nOr outgoing swelled what's up well like\nYou I'm having a great day because I Do see this as a as a some sort of a of a of a necessary awakening a for people who believe in what we believe and I'd like to I'd like to give you said with an\nEnd to quotes the date is April twelve Eighteen sixty one are you familiar with that\nApril twelve Eighteenth sixty one was that was that that's what I noticed the civil war was that when the civil war goes up they attack on Fort Sumter\nExactly right and I see this is nothing less than the openings\nOr ... homeowners insurance can be noted author former chief medical correspondent ... or Dr Bob are not the human body has billions of pain receptors block those receptors with the anesthetics mountain salon ... plus and\nYou'll have relief slump ... became plus contains two anesthetics including the maximum strength lie to gain available that prescription they numb aggravated nurse for effective lasting relieve relieve try what I use salon ... plus in the silver box with a blue wave [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThis is a very special day because not only is it a one topic interview with our friend now like science wall but it's a very very rare day because we've got\nThe not now we know we have a new Supreme Court justice coming in this one is very special but not in the best way any way it is the day we review the week\nWith our friend alec science wall who reports great work at NBC News dot com MSNBC dot com and Alex ... on TV on MSNBC and now it's a special week indeed thanks for coming back on the norm and Goldman show\nAn armed thanks are me back\nWell it's a you're in Washington DC you're a reporter at NBC News we're in Washington I'm In Los Angeles we got people all over the country and all over the world so\nNow that we know what the final score is it looks like Kavanaugh is getting through on a bare majority ... what is the final score and are there any Democrats involved here\n[noise] yeah I think uh the we're we're in the end game now too and Congress just went to the Senate floor and a metric big reveal she had been playing cards close to the chest and this is the key swing vote\nA but she came out and then his lengthy speech not only said that she would vote for Kavanaugh but basically suggested she had been there from day one and gave\nActually probably the most Folsom\nA and cogent argument in ... in Kevin saver that I've seen anyone get let the White House or the you know conservative legal scholars she was really out there going point by point and saying basically she feels in for confidence that or she is going to vote for Kevin\nThe vote is set for tomorrow now that they have the votes and then right after she did that Joe Manchin\nCame out and said he would too so they have fifty one votes it's a basically a done deal these are mccaskey is the only know of of the swing votes but it's not enough and barring some kind of you know crazy divine intervention or it looks like this will be rammed through like half and I will be\nA a Supreme Court justice elect or whatever you call it a sometime tomorrow evening\nWhile it so that's so basically Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nGets to go home and tell the native tribes who were very much against cabin I voted against him she can tell women I voted against him Lisa Murkowski is to be a hero to Alaska and two women generally Susan Collins is now the villain but also one democratic crossed over\nThat's Joe mansion he's kind of irrelevant because with Susan Collins it would have been fifty votes anyway and Mike Pence would've broken a time Alex\nIs Joe Manchin doing this just result politics was re elected this November\nI it's a little hard to say with Joe mansion or I mean we should say first of all that he didn't show a ton of a backbone here he he put out his statements according cabinet literally minutes after his and cons came off the Senate floor so he's not\nFifty fifty which is the ... vote because the vice president Mike Pence can break the tie he's fifty one so it was already basically done and when he came out uh but yeah I think part of it is it certainly is reelection\nA but we'll we'll have to wait and see what Joe Donnelly in uh Indiana does because he's also in a in a tough state\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota it at a state justice Trump is West Virginia just about said that she is a no so I I think there's you know other stuff going on here\nAre withdraw mentioned in it it's kind of from people who have been close to him that I've talked to it's kind of seemed like from day one that he wanted to get to a yes and it was just looking for a way uh to get there but needless to say he has infuriated a lot of people on the left which she is prone do and I'm seeing a lot of people are on\nTwitter a lot of liberals on Twitter ... who did switch parties or that they help he loses in November ... I think they would probably regret saying or if it actually happened because\nYou know keep in mind that yes he voted on this but he also voted to keep a the Affordable CARE Act he voted against the repeal bill he voted against the Republican tax bill and more importantly\nYou know regardless of how you look and individual bill he he he it's targeted for control of the Senate and so you know one senator is a big deal uh when it comes when you have a fifty one forty nine Senate breakdown like we do so you need him to keep either McConnell out of power to keep that margin\nSmall and you know West Virginia has no right having a democratic senator that Trump's biggest margin in the country so I I think if anything he's about as good as you can hope for a Democrat out of Washington yeah\nWe're talking to our friend Alex science wall check out his great reporting NBC News dot com MSNBC dot coms on TV and MSNBC TV and I'm following him on Twitter\nAt ... ... S C I F easy\nWALDS at a sites walled on Twitter and you'll see all the great material put out by Alex science Walden alec since we were doing a a one topic interview because\nThere's only one topic than anyone cares about this week\nUh you're there in Washington seeing it up close and personal we're seeing it on TV out here the hallways of the Senate or all the lost millions of filled with people as protesters being arrested famous people being arrested there's a lot of rage death threats have been flying around\nAlex how bitter is the environment there especially amongst the hundred senators themselves\n[noise] it is very bitter and arm I have never really seen anything quite like I say I've seen a lot of anger is in a lot of protesters got arrested in the capital but this week has really taken things to another level\nOr to the point that I've talked to some Trump voters who are supporters who are\nWorried about violence and you know they're probably overeating at a little bit but I don't think they're that far off the protesters have just been button hauling senators everywhere they go or they've tried to you know sneak past the Capitol police which is something that we don't usually see usually they're they're more cooperative\nAnd senators have taken to being escorted a by Capitol police wherever they are going inside the complex because the way it works the capital there's the capital where they actually have to go to a vote but their offices are a little bit further away so they end up having to spend a lotta time moving\nThrough hallways and there have been a big tensions around this and fights around this with what they've closed off as her always wished that the ...\nBut the senators say that they really fear for for their physical safety so people are are furious a meanwhile on on both sides we've seen people donors rewarding and punishing a Centers for both ways what Heidi Heitkamp\nAnnounced that she would be a now I'm having a\nA her online donations shot through the roof from from liberals who would probably have never donated to hide it Hi Kevin the past\nAnd just now well Susan Collins was speaking there is a fund on line where you can donate to whoever emerges as Susan Collins is democratic nominee in twenty twenty and she's not even up for re election right now but they're just saving this money and a pool that will go to\nWhoever is that the Democrat and they had to set a goal months ago two million dollars", "show_name": "Ring of Fire Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "07"}
