President Trump says they will pull the United states from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Russia accusing Moscow mile of a deal\nTo develop weapons are less Russia Russia China gums or was and they all ... when they say let's really get to serve our let's none of us did all of those weapons it rushes doing it and if China is doing it and we're hearing the agreement that don't accept the\nThat they have it's the one where they stood on the steps of the capital and you know they all grand than glad hand didn't cheer Donald Trump and called him a genius and all this stuff I mean and it is it is lethal to them and so I think you know there is\nA sense that maybe they're shtick is not working anymore in a lot of ways I mean if the economy should be enough\nFor them to win a or at least do better and certainly Donald Trump's approval rating should be higher but the problem is is that I think you know people have come to sort of see what the scam is now maybe I'm being too optimistic here but I mean this is a con that they have run for nearly Thirty years\nWhich is that they run up deficits with huge military spending and tax cuts for wealthy and corporations [noise]\nThen they end up you know screwing the pooch in some way and the the ... they ended up losing the White House and often a you know the one or more houses of Congress at that point they turn around and start screaming about deficits\nIn a in an attempt to get that to force the Democrats to cut spending and by spending they almost always means signature programs of the Democratic party which are the safety net programs\nSocial Security Medicare Medicaid and now will undoubtedly be Affordable Care act is part of that too so that is their method of trying to you know at the very least contain Democrats from trying to do anything more to help people like Medicare for all\nAnd at ... at most to hopefully get them on board to try and it just start cutting these social welfare programs\nOr the the big ones that that are across the board and you know they've actually had some success in some ways I mean Bill Clinton talked about privatizing Social Security at one point rock Obama put cutting Social Security\nOn that on the agenda as part of his grand bargain and each time it didn't go through for a variety of reasons mostly because Republicans wouldn't take yes for an answer but it's a weapon\nThat they have deployed over and over again and so one of the reasons why they do these big tax breaks aside from rewarding their big donors in corporate sponsors\nIs to put the Democrats in this kind of a bind where they are stuck as they inevitably will be because you know maybe in this case they actually knew Donald Trump was you know hardly going to be a successful president otherwise\nThey would stick the Democrats with this big bill\nAnd then they would have to be in this position of you know to talking about cutting programs again you can already see it happening and the media by the way are the worst enablers of this scam because they love to sit around and talk about how you know the people really need to understand they've got to tighten their belts and take their medicine and we can't afford it and they need to sacrifice and\nYou know all this stuff these rich celebrities on television and sit there and lecture the American people about how they have to give up Social Security Medicare and Medicaid\nSo they helped the Republicans every time and I thought just happened this week when Mitch McConnell came out with his\nUh comments that said well you know when when asked about the soaring deficit which you know a deficit hawk like him should have been\nA pie by and he said well if not a Republican part problem is\nThe bipartisan problem driven by entitlements right so\nI mean this is ... and the media\n... we did we raise a the Social Security benefits Medicare benefits or by Seventeen percent in the past year I mean it's you know it was absurd knocking point but then that's what it would mean\nYeah I mean that's exactly what it would mean and that's you know and and the thing is is that you know everybody went well but what about the tax cuts and it turned into another one of those arguments\nBut it doesn't seem to me that that the voters are buying it if you look at polling and the way that they're sort of responding to this economy they're giving Republicans a very tiny within the margin of error\nUm advantage in approval\nFor running the economy which seems odd to me you know we're two years in Trump should be able to take ... you know some credit for all this\nAnd they're really not getting it and they're not getting a you know they're they're not doing well with their with their tax cuts\nI mean and you know that they are afraid of what's happening with the health care about this 'cause they're all lying like raw eggs in all their ads saying that they're going to protect preexisting conditions when they're the people who voted to repeal Obamacare\nAnd they're on the on this we we are there's a slew of governors races where you see a candidates talking about that in their own attorney general's\nAh have joined a lawsuit to literally strip from the CIA or things like\nA covering ... um the um you know a pre existing conditions and\nAll of the other patient protection aspects of the Affordable CARE Act I Will listen to get a chick could break 'em but I Want to talk about something that is a ... that probably does not have much in terms of implications for the midterms but it certainly will\nIn or could in twenty twenty and that is I'm a Elizabeth Warren this week uh came out with an announcement that in many respects has a I don't know I Want to get your take on it um and we will\nExamine that when we come back plus we also have to touch on the other implications about these midterms and has to do with Robert Mueller we'll be right back after this I'm

time capsule\nBack or in foreign radio I'm Sam seat of regulations to the show we'll remember my pop\nAntonio's case against dupont that involve the dumping of cancer causing chemicals the aid into the Ohio River valley system now that story has made its way to I tunes and other video retailers here to discuss the film award winning documentary filmmaker Stephanie so tech\nSo Stephanie I of course em at least a somewhat familiar with the broad strokes of this story I'm working with the bike path Antonio but the devil we know let's just start with the the story that it tells because this was one that I think I'm\nImpacts um a lot of Americans and they probably don't realize it um and and to what extent they it impacts them\nYou know I don't know if we we know a but certainly for a a a smaller subset of Americans it was a incredibly a difficult but but tell us the broad strokes what the what the story is in this documentary\nShort sell and the gambling now as the story of a farmer and a gym teacher who took on one of the world's largest chemical corporation\nUh when they found out that the company was knowingly polluting the air and water with a chemical called the eight [noise] um and you know while it took place in this small town Parkersburg West Virginia this chemical\nOr as now found in the bloodstream of Ninety nine seven percent of American so\nYou know what we see is that\nParkersburg and see a really end up in the cell being like or ... for this much larger issue of how business is done in America um the fact that you know the chemical companies tend to operate with impunity and can put things out on the market place with no\nOversight or anyone checking to make sure that it's not going to\n[noise] All right so let's let's talk specifically um and this is an amazing story that really um spans\nOh you know close to twenty five years in terms of like you know this aspect of the story um when we talk about ca ca is not a chemical that is ostensibly in tough lawn it as a chemical that's used in the process of making tough lawn\nSo tell us tell us how the ... we we we as a as a society of first got wind that there was a problem with this chemical my understanding is she ate was made by three and a provided to du pont\nOr to make their ... stuff and at one point three and said we're going to get out of his business because stuff is bad\nRight right yeah I mean you know the three and and do hot new\nYou know very early on that there were problems with this chemical\nOn finally reached a point where three and said we're going to stop thinking as you said and rather than saying okay then you know we're going to switch to get hot\nWho was you know buying ... found three and rather than stopping and switching gears to find something they are they just think I ... the chemical themselves\n[noise] show you know three am\nYou know objectively did the right thing and clicking whereas some might argue that they should have done so earlier um but they will stop you have a lot of making up our own group aren't they just go to their portfolio of them are going to go with al ... and other money maker for them\nNow minor ah three I'm at the time had basically said du pont listen when you're working with this chemical\nThe only way to get rid of it is the only way to get rid of it is to burn it uh because it doesn't have a half life it just it doesn't go way doesn't diminish you got to burn it and dupont went ahead and said and\nThat may be a little bit too pricey let's just dump it\nYeah so I mean the documents clearly state uh you know whatever you do do not washing us into the water do you not get it in the water and and I was just dumping it into the water that eventually ended up you know contaminating much at the Ohio River valley\nAnd so All right so how do we first get when I mean this starts this was one of those stories that is is pretty amazing it starts with just one farmer who notices that his cows are dying in a very strange way tell us about that\n[noise] yeah so I'm pro tennis at a farm in Parkersburg West Virginia and he issued a permit to do that they could run their waste water by their string but they had\nYou know in their description of what they would be running it never included anything that would be toxic when he started noticing was that um\nWater was being filled with this phone me it looks it looks like so sad to Central Asia ... substance and suddenly a couch started dying off one at a time and there were here on the property and fish were dead and you know he\nHe made several calls and you try to get help and nobody would listen to have a ... you know in his own words he says they sort of wrote him off as an old dumb farmer\nAnd he was anything but an old them farmer he was really persistent and he started documenting these I mean insofar as that he would autopsy\nThat cows and sell 'em and he thumbed at all it's all on them um and\nYou know dupont got wind of it and we know that is because of the depositions of the do pot lawyers who were in you know none too pleased that he was making a stink about that and they you know sort of hope that they could discredit him as you know a disgruntled or [noise]\nOr you know just it's just kind of a crazy old man but they knew something was going to happen and and\nYou know they from their own words that one of the lawyers Bernard Reilly says you know that it's just about to hand because the farmer is on to us um\nAnd indeed he was so eventually he settled with dupont and we don't really know the terms of that settlement\nBut what we do know is that normally the case would end there and things would sort of go quietly into the night but\nWhat happened what to do contest to send out a letter to their residence saying hey just the you know there there's a little bit of this water that this chemical in your drinking water and don't worry we've measured it totally safe for you know we're basically required to let you know that\nAnd that was on death row Parkersburg but one of the people that got it was a gym teacher by the name of Joe ... and district didn't sit right perhaps you know initially he sort of put it aside and he's like a you know it it's like the letters you get in the mail about your eyes so that you never read right on\nBut he bought it and it kept sort of\nSticking in his mind one started seeing that people in the neighborhood or disproportionately sick or you know testicular cancer and rotten teeth and\nAh he started digging around and he did what I think very few people would do is he was relentless about making phone calls and he's calling the EPA and just I mean really you know really going above and beyond the call of duty to try and figure out what this was\nThe it and kept on aren't that didn't pan um it's in you know if it's water truth or Greece proof\nUm it it tends to be kept on or or some version there and so this is in our rug says is in our tooth boxes and the lining of fast food rappers and popcorn bags this is everywhere so it's not just about changing your pet but it's it you know your hands is is really a very pervasive\nIngredient and and and things that we are using everyday that we're letting our you know children's sleep on and and that we're walking on them if it's everywhere\nWe we just have a minute left or Seventy but what is that we always want to get the devil we know when they say um you know this is causing cancer but something else we could develop could also cause cancer we should just stick with the one that we know what the ah da da da da da da da\nDe incentive structure for corporations\n[laughter] I mean I think when it says we need to max out our profits on this right group ... you know we're we're in it for the bottom line and sell till they until their feet were being held to the fire they were going to continue manufacturing cottage it didn't matter if it made people sick it just mattered that it made them money\nIt is absolutely shocking and when I have an opportunity to talk to a tort lawyers like this they all have stories about a smaller cases bigger cases that involve this type of\nComplete lack of of humanity in the pursuit of profits and I think uh your film the devil we know captures that are incredibly thank you so much for your time today ah stuff and

to start to gin up or to uh take when ever higher peak as it were the the anti immigrant and racist for that is so much the basis of the Republican Party today and look\nI'm not making it up I'm observing what they're doing\nIn reporting the facts and if that doesn't work for ya hey that's just the way I perceive it we perceive what we perceive our own way so there is a lot going on today\nAnd they do have time for you of course it won eight eight eight three two one six zero zero one norm at Norman Goldman dot com and thank you so much as always for the emails lots of them I Can't answer them all but I Do my best and they all get red Norman Norman Goldman dot com\nNow I don't want to spend a lot of time on this I really don't because to me it's it's that gas lighting thing the gas lighting is is from the movie and the idea is to drive someone crazy intensely dry someone crazy and that is what Benedict Arnold is doing and so I have really tried to develop the skill\nOf identifying his intentional fought through cold blooded league intended efforts\nTo try and get us all the meltdown of freak out and get everybody yelling and screaming and get us off the important news distractions distractions and so why he did was he went\nOut there and he said some horrible things are crazy Democrats [noise]\nWhereas here's the support any for [noise] a border security legislation defects our absolutely horrible old fashioned loophole Ramsay immigration laws so of\nCourse his party runs everything he's a liar but he uh he the thing he did was he your Greg GM forty the Republican congressman who beat up and Jacobs a reporter\nAnd a guy that took your body slamming my time\nAnd that's what everybody's going for my argument is is it Benedict Donald doesn't give a rat's rear end about any of this stuff it's all done quite intentionally you get a soul melting down\nI see it as a tactic I'm not falling forward I'm smarter than am I was smarter than him when I was six years old and I'm just I'm asking you to just look at it and say he's not an American and that's the way to really deal with this guy\nIt oh did I say that this guy this guy here's how you deal with this guy All right when he does a stunt an aunt that like this what we do instead of falling for we say oh you're not an American you're not a patriot\nBenedict Don old you are just shown us again why you are fundamentally anti American why you're so unpatriotic because what you have done is you have used violence\nAs a tool and you of encourages violence as a tool against the press\nAgainst anybody else or many find people in Charlottesville that is so radically fundamentally on American because in America we settled law disputes at the ballot box and we're supposed to count the votes accurately and we're all supposed to know the rules of the system out in the open and play by the rules what he's doing his rigging and fixing the system\nAnd that makes him on American because one of the ways he's regained fixing the system is using violence as a tool of intimidation\nAnd that is so radically on American ... so that's my argument is when he starts in with this stuff to say more proof he's not an American and whoever supports them you're not an American either you don't have the right to call yourself a patriot I'm the Patriot and with that\nWant to get to the main point here which is I've been telling you that this is the place where you learn how the system works and every time it was almost everyday lately I've been saying I'm telling you out of the system works All right let me tell you how the system works\nAt its most fundamental\nUnderstand that there's four\nLayers of government four of them that you and I need to concern ourselves with and we pay taxes to four layers most of us have four layers of government think of them is layers from top to bottom that's at least semi brain views it anyway it's called the federalist system\nThat's overall includes all the four layers the whole thing it's like the universe the name of the universe is the federalist system and that's why they call it over there on the Republican side the federalist society they're trying to wrap themselves in the flag\nAnd patriotism and all this stuff a federalist system says there is a federal government\nAnd then there is a state or provincial level in Canada the provinces writing in Japan there prefecture as there are different names for them but it's the lead it's low or second layer of government it is the moral local layer it is the is taking the nation and breaking into\nPieces we broke our nation at fifty pieces and we call them states so a federalist system as we do it\nAs a federal government and then state governments there's two layers of government right there and we pay taxes to both so we ought to know what they do now\nWithin the state there are generally two more layers for everybody there's a county to county you live in you're paying taxes to them\nAnd they do stuff too so that's a county layer and for many people I live in the city of Los Angeles if people who live in a city of San Francisco the city of Oakland right that is the fourth way or the one closest to us that\nAnd for some people they don't live in a in a city they don't live in a village they don't live in a township in New Jersey they have townships and so this is a way within the state to organize localities\nIn some places enforce some people they live in what's known as in unincorporated area\nMeaning they don't have a city or town or a village they have the county so they only have three layers of government because the county functions as the local and the county government why oh why oh why do we have this system why we have four layers government why is it just they want to focus for taxes in the answer is no\nThe theory the overall theory the whole point of a federalist system and doing it with all these different layers is to keep us much of government as close to us as possible\nIt's about self governance\nVis is designed to be self governing system\nWhich is a federalist self governing system\nThat is designed to give minority views substantial protection that's why there's this electoral system right electoral votes and that kind\nOf stuff and and as slaves were three fifths of the people I mean the idea was to protect the minority views and in those days and what's in the constitution as a minority views are Republicans and and you know slave owners and that's just the system we're stuck with like I say\nI'm here to teach the system I'm not telling you it's a wonderful perfect system I'm telling you we can work with it if we understand it and we can make it work for us\nHowever we need to understand for if we understand that there is no chain\nThat's the whole point we kicked out of king we got rid of the king there's no king there's no one to come and set the whole thing right it's up to us who ever happens to grab the machinery of government gets to exercise the power that goes along with it and today you know who is in charge of\nSo we have multiple layers of government because the theory is the people ought to be able to have as much influence as possible on the local conduct of their local lives in their ordinary daily existence\nThink about it in Eighteen hundred right when this nation was first getting do and people didn't travel\nA lot they were concerned about their local lives in their local areas they're state mattered a whole lot what state you lived especially back in the old days right before the civil war we in a slave state or a free state right knows life that's a big difference now today\nA you know look California has lots of different laws that that you know governor in my life as opposed to people live in Texas or Alabama and so we see the variation and the idea is that that's not a bug that's not that's not an unintended consequence that's a design feature that's an intended saying\nLet the people move freely among the states they can live wherever they want freedom and liberty right and the states have a lot of room under a federalist system to make lots of different adjustments and and so\nWithin a state you can live in different places is rural areas and all the states is urban areas right and you get to govern yourself or have some influence there I have the Los Angeles city\nOutside and go grab it them if I'm if I'm Upset about something right but I Can't do I make the right to go into one of the rural counties in California and give them a piece of my mind but they look at me and say what are you doing here you don't live here you don't vote here you're not a stakeholder you don't go back to Los Angeles a good way to them\nHere as the story of or who wants to play parents love of the game to\nPro scouts came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing\nThe trumpet but\nWas never that good at all by the time we go to\nBut he also learned how to save them a lot of money on ... which is this your story has a happy ending\nAfter all an official message for Medicare open enrollment than so now's the time to be open mind smoking everything like prescription drug plans on Medicare Advantage plans have insurers why\nBecause climb straight soak in your house I found lower cost extra benefits aren't saved money for something better\nWith Medicare or call one eight hundred Medicare to the opening moments in the forefront\nPaid for by the U.S department of health and Human Services\n\nAnd now look back at this week in history\nThis week at Eighteen sixty seven us formally takes his action of Alaska after purchasing the territory from Russia for seven point two million dollars for less than two cents in Anchorage, Alaska which compromises five hundred and eighty six thousand foreigners to square miles or about twice the size of\nTexas was champion to be purchased by William Henry Seward enthusiastically expansion a secretary of state under President Andrew Johnson\nJumping ahead almost a hundred years this week in Nineteen fifty nine or New York city's Fifth Avenue thousands of people lined up outside the bizarrely shape white concrete buildings\nThat resembles a giant upside down cupcake was opening day at the Guggenheim Museum home to one of the world's top collections of contemporary art [noise]\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy three after Fifteen Years of construction Sydney opera houses dedicated by Queen Elizabeth the second the eighty million dollar structure designed by Danish architects you want to listen and funded by the process of the opera house lotteries\nCurrently presents an average of three thousand events a year to an estimated two million people\nAnd this week in Nineteen eighty five the first blockbuster video rental store opens in Dallas texas\nAt a time when most video stores were small scale operations featuring a limited selection of titles blockbuster open with some eight thousand tapes displayed on shelves around the store and a computerized checkup process the first or was a huge success in blockbuster expanded rapidly\nApparently there is only one blockbuster video store the left today and it's in Bend Oregon ... look back at this week in history\n[noise]\nTo the civil war the United states government really wasn't that powerful and\nIt was very controversial whenever the federal government tried to do anything that was reasonably powerful if you remember your American history where you want to go back and take a look at the old fight at the fights over the old\nBank of the United states could there be a bank of the United states there were some pitched battles over that people were very very concerned about the big bad federal government taking over their lives and that still that goes of course through to today however\nAfter the civil war and the expansion of the government certainly after the great depression now the federal government's very big and very powerful and very intrusive in our lives and a lot of people don't like that but it is what it is and so we need to understand\nThat there is a system that covers the federal government says the same system that governs the state\nAnd that is is an executive with Governor in a state president and the federal system to house or the legislature in the state legislature in your state capital or in Congress except for Nebraska where it's only one house\nAnd there's a judiciary state judiciary in each state and federal judiciary and there are lots of rules and laws as to which gets to do what when the federal government does not collect the trash\nRight the federal government does not run the police or the fire service in your area the federal government has its own errors right the bankruptcy court to run through the federal government that then the constitution and so\nWhat we have is a system that has\nA lot of discretion and open space and breathing room minute there's politics there for everybody the whole idea is a skeletal system of government was created in the constitution it is a federalist system\nIt reserves a lot of power to the states the states and get to do a lot of freelancing on their own to fashion\nLaws that the people there want and\nIts politics that decides who gets to run all of this and by the way the system was built with all kinds of advantages for minority viewpoint that was to protect this you know the slave owners and all but that's what we're stuck with so I'm trying to teach the system here the point of it all his take over your state\nAnd to take over your state you got to take over your county and to take over your account you've got to take over your city and to take over your city you've got to take over your neighborhood start low bowling build up from there\nThe Congress people and the senators who go to Washington come from your state you have a house district and you get two U.S senators but everything happens in your state\nI wanted to live in California and I love living in California one day I decided that I Want to live in New Mexico or Minnesota or wherever it's one of the great features American I can move there but one of the main factor is in me deciding where to live is what laws do I want to govern me\nAnd I really like those in California governing me all ah more than the laws of Mississippi or Arkansas one of these on American states\nThese are not accidents these are features designed by George Washington and the boys to give us the opportunity to band together and to as an organized group\nMaintain and a choir maintain and exercise significant influence over the laws and the and the forces that govern our lives and that's self governance\nAnd if we ignore the system if we just drowning an ocean of apathy and we just say eyes\nTo a board and is not a boarding it so I was too complicated it's corrupt whatever justification we manufacture in our own mind to give us the psychological comfort to say I don't have\nTo participate I can just watch TV or whatever and not do anything about it well then when somebody else grabs a hold of the machinery right the bare bones or the machinery says okay my politics is different than yours I'm a woman now because you let me Abbott\nAnd then we get upset well\nI can only say one thing when you say you gotta know how the system works and if you don't grab a hold of it and make it work for you or someone else will you may not be so thrilled with the results are\nThat is how the system works and I'm Glad I put it in just one straight simple place now let's talk about this poor man who got chopped up\nWe had from the Turkish foreign minister and then let's have a Shelley De ... people shattering felt an investigation into the parents' economic I shall see with the world I I did wake back he had the inside out on your hearing it on ...\nAnd also you say it out the consul general's residence a few hundred yards away and there have been some report which we cannot independently verify that demolished Chelsea body may have been disposed off in the car you'll generals resident\nThere you go that's highly Williams of CBS News and we think CBS for then I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised that it was all premeditated they they had the bone saw they had the the doctor that does the forensic autopsies Ryan investigations and the doctor that that has now been identified as the guy\nHe's really Well hi highly placed politically and ...\nOr he apparently accomplished like a you know an autopsy Dr who's very good with a bone saw they assembled this assassination and dismembered ... team with great care\nAnd New York times reported we talked about it yesterday the New York times reported that several of these uh suspects had been tied directly into the top reaches of the Saudi royal government I mean they're busted they've been busted it's obvious what happened here\nThe tech his foreign minister let's have a child I had to have you had not shed any audio recording with any us if they show including secretary of state Mike on\nThat contradict proposing by at least one other news organizations that you think that ... may have these audio recording when he was in ... Elliott weight\nAgain highly Williams of end of a department of CBS News are going to get my networks rally Williams of CBS News thank you CBS by the way they're reporting that Pompeo is heard this evidence compare these so called secretary of state by ... heard nothing\nI've seen a trend [laughter] than networks\nThe headline says I have\nAnd palm pale I say this to you for that the average words ally and so\nSeconds media is reporting that investigated have expanded that to a forest on the at least on both as well as a farmhouse in a nearby\nAnd that is highly Williams of CBS News yeah they're looking for the remains and my suspicion I don't have facts to back it up and my suspicion is\nThat they're never going to find and it remains those were disposed of it was also that well in advance and so Benedict Donald is is compromise he fully in the pocket of the Saudis and he's still helping them concoct lies and this is where we are\nA strategy is it it was a long term strategy absolutely help the Trump get in and it's so\nTrump's overtures wore a catalyst but it it has been in strategy [noise] um you know that they're really good and stole it has also played out you know the same type of race baiting a ... minute\nYou're still now Germany and our our ally I'm\nGetting a little Merkel is experiencing a lot of her oh what was it to you and then the sister party you and it's all based on race here in the sex in the region of the worst [noise] North West areas of Germany but it's not just that area\nOh it's all over Europe Europe looked at ...

better President Trump said he will pull the United states from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Russia and says Russia is not living up to the agreement\nAnd yes it's in the eastern district of Virginia which means it could easily be assigned to that crazy judge we saw in the Manafort case the judge who was a pain in everybody's rear end if you get assigned ... there are plenty of other judges in that building however\nHowever the chances of they're actually being a trial are slim and none probably more like none because as you heard from the Williams she is not in custody\nWe don't have physical jurisdiction over her she is in Russia and she and going anywhere where we can get our hands on her SOS unlike Maria Butina ride Maria Butina to leave that infiltrated the ah the n._r._a. on behalf of Buddhism\nOr she is in custody and then the judge said you ain't going nowhere lady you're in jail and you're not leaving because they know the moment she's out she's going to vanish\nAnd so what we have here is another one of these cases like the one we saw you remember this one months ago with Thirteen Russians were named in diamond and all Thirteen of em are safely back in mother Russia right with it when they never left I guess they never came here\nBut the idea of these indictments from the special counsel or in this case not from the special counsel to the point is in my humble opinion is to alert the public ... why would you filed a criminal case and make them public you know point of filing a criminal case\nIf you don't have the defendant the one you're you're trying to put in Britain you don't have them in custody and you don't have no chance again why would you do it obviously the prosecution is sounding an alarm the prosecution is trying to tell us\nHey hey\nIt isn't the special counsel that you just worried about this\nThis is not raw fire Robert Mueller prosecutors this is not part of the special counsel investigation\nFor a couple of reasons some of the ... the main one is we're told by federal officials this involves attempts to metal in the twenty eighth Tina lecture or the special counsel's job is to investigate potential uh meddling in the twenties sixteen presidential election\nThere you go that is Pete Williams we think NBC News for then yeah\nThis is also outside the scope of Robert Mueller's investigation and so the U.S attorney in my humble opinion is basically sending a warning flair to America saying they're still here\nAnd they're still messing around and please remember they're not taking a a a rigid consistent idiot logical position these troll farms these ... farms and\nAnd this woman here is Elena\n... you know I'm not going to try and pronounce it right but in any event she was creating hundreds and thousands of fake identities right to try and make it sound like they're Americans and make it look like they're Americans rabbit pictures making up names that kinda stuff and\nThe whole point was not to take a rigid idi logical position this is not ... not to just help Benedict Donald know what they're doing is they're observation is and by the way\nPut yourself in their shoes looked at the world through there on yourself and measures are going\nThrough their eyes they look at America really put yourself in ... look at the world to ... he looks at America and what does he see a never ending bar room brawl that's been true since before the revolutionary war George Washington and the boys this nation was always\nFighting with itself and so if your vitamin ... and you say wow these people just love tearing themselves apart\nMaybe I can help turbo charged that so that they will tear them apart so much that we can tear apart America and if we if me ... ... turbo charged what they're already doing over there and get them to break up America then that weakens America they don't get the boss me blender ... around\nThey don't get the be all pompous and pontificate about all my human rights abuses and then I ... can become a big strong world leader and restore the old Soviet Union empire because America won't be there to stand on my way Vladimir Putin wants to weaken and destroy America\nTo to make Russia strong again right to make Russia great again and he's got his own treason is you know puppets here in America Benedict Arnold one of them but let's understand the facts and the law here okay\nWhich is what Vladimir ... is doing is largely illegal foreigners ally not allowed to do this stuff\nBut but he's doing it from abroad where we can't get a lot of his people you know a A R MIT's on them to put him in prison and we've got the the current party that's empowers actively in bed with the guy helping them\nThey don't care about breaking up America apparently they just want to when they want power and money and so we've got a bunch of ...\nComplicit quiz ling treasonous Republicans and they're the ones who ... who were doing the worst of the damage ... is just helping them out they started at ... so we'll go out and said oh\nLet me see if I can help out and make it really bad and by the way we're between Republicans a boot in their women they're doing a nice job because here I Am now saying that the United states reports illegitimate we should fashioned ways of of of ignoring them and by the way I got one for this this is going to upset a lot of people for that I'm Sorry but\nWe got to work with the facts and live with the truth\nBut the Republicans have been doing look we're still a senior legal endless time with the Republicans have been doing has been\nPlaying a two to standard game\nThey destroy an institution like the Supreme Court they destroy it so that they can take over the Supreme Court but then they immediately turned around to us and they say you must respect it and you must obey the don't respect it they don't obey\nWe say oh my God look would you know but then we respect I mean I'd be forgotten about Brett Kavanaugh already okay\nHere's the problem\nWe're leading to the breakup of the United states and I'm One of the ones helping to do it because the Republicans are forced me to do it\nI Will not respect the current U.S Supreme court I Will not respect Neil Gorsuch corporate cabinet I think they're both illegally and unconstitutionally there and Merrick Garland should be there and just I have no choice but to declare the U.S Supreme Court on ... ... it was a gentleman and unconstitutional and and\nCheck this out if you want and I look I feel compelled to have to do this I'm Sorry to have to play the ... his hands but this is what the Republicans have forced me to do look at the look at the power\nLook at the power from a Republican perspective you remember that put yourself in their shoes to yourself and measures are going through there are now if you're going to get mad at me for giving them ideas I'm not giving them any ideas they're already thinking about this\nIf\nSomeone in Texas ... Mississippi stand\nAlabama staying Oklahoma Stan Arkansas snakes and all those on American unpatriotic states if they sat there if they really not I don't think right now I'm In the brain so they don't think but if if somebody's then they're going you know\nThis guy on the radio they're saying that this to the Supreme Court's illegitimate you know there's some real power to that argument let's let's take a look at what we can do with that if the Supreme Court is illegitimate\nThat means they're rulings are real legitimate\nThat means a tech says they can say you know what let's pass\nA resolution of disapproval\nBoth houses of legislature the governor signed it saying that roe versus Wade isn't it legitimate decision and it kept me if worst in Texas and because the Supreme Court's illegitimate\nRoe versus Wade has no application now we tried the south Carolina led the way with that before the civil war and it got us into the civil war school no vacation right in the state no vine federal laws\nWell this is where is leading\nBut look at the choices that we had been presented either either we tolerate and stomach and accept the Republicans breaking the Supreme Court rigging in ... and we still respect the decisions\nOr we say look all we're doing is acknowledging would you guys have done which is destroyed this report so diligent image and then they say wait a village intimate no gay marriage in Alabama woman who's right we just don't want to be the Supreme Court and what happens if that starts to happen what happens\nWhat happens if the if the Democrats somehow get control of the Supreme Court and the Republicans say which is not going to be your ruins doesn't that lead to the breakup of the United states\nAnd is not what people want and is now where the Republicans gave them the opening\nAnd they're working it looked so let's let's in senior league one was ... up during the rest of the hour over to you at one eighty three two one six zero zero one one eight eight eight three two one six thousand and one but this woman here and and all the\nHooliganism that she was doing she didn't have a rigidity logical view all she wants to do is just stir the pot that's the point of who was actions here\nAnd he's helping Republicans do it what ever they can do they'll take they'll be pro Bernie if that'll help get people upset there'll be anti Bernie there'll be pro this and that is it doesn't matter\nAs long the only measuring stick they're doing that they're using the only standard that they're measuring their own conduct by is are we causing more dissension and fighting in America that's the standard whenever they need to do to cause more dissension or by the Republicans are helping them and you and I have to rescue the snake\nBecause look where we are you got me and I'm I'm a licensed California attorney and I'm sitting here saying the U.S Supreme Court is illegitimate and we should this'll be there really is and I know for let's giving the Republicans an option to say oh great well just opt out of the to rush river we lose weight the most\nSo what do we do I ask you what do we do do we sit there and let them destroy this report and yet we have to accept their rulings I mean I Know how they how do you do that or do we go down the road you got a third option one triple eight three two one six thousand and one of your on

triple eight three two one six zero zero one that is our number and Georgia's welcome back of course any time I need to share with you though some really really significant breaking news and I mean this is really odd stuff the Saudis are now\nWith meeting yes they are there now admitting that they killed ... [noise]\nThey're admitting it I'm not kidding the check out CNN dot com you see any other other outlets are reporting it as well as and Saudi Arabia saying\nYes we killed it but it was in a fight it was self defense that's what they're saying it was self defense there\nAre now reports Saudi Arabia may ultimately blame a high level intel official for the show is that both the New York times and Washington Post say a top general may be accused of Going Rogue an explanation that would just like to blame some crown prince Mohammed bin some on that is Laura\n... CBS News and that's exactly what they have done the problem is that general they want to get rid of him for other reasons so this is what this is now the Saudis saying yeah we killed them but it was in self defense 'cause he was fighting with us\nHave you seen a picture of this guy he's a middle aged pudgy guy he's like me I wouldn't\nBe getting a defense fights with guys with bones ... and all that stuff I let's remember that if first Saudi Arabia\nSaid what do you mean she left the embassy All right so then now we're meeting that's alive right they said he met there are we to just forgive you people for lying about this then they said oh\nWill cooperate with any investigation as if they didn't know what happens\nNow and they've been lies little lies in between every time retreating another step back towards the troops now they finally admit the truth\nIs al ... we killed it [noise]\nBut it was self defense right because we were scattered am added on and just see him look what a break\nThey have proven that they are giant pack of liars and that they have purchased the guy sitting in the White House and he's in their pocket and he's helping them cover up and this is a complete

I'm here with you on the phone\nAnd I hear you you're on the air with many things I'm Glad I've owned Avon collapse guy [laughter]\nThink thanks for having me back on a well you know I have a a another angle on this whole thing and I have it on good authority that just after the election illegitimate president elect draft dodging Donald visited Saudi Arabia on business was official or you know a government\nOf president trip where he was criticized by this turtle it's your show and apparently because of the shot southern culture of tolerance criticism and the new crown princes reaching an ongoing your approach of the opposition and that combined with Donald ... your ego maniacal narcissism\nIt would've been they apparently conspired to assassinate showed mom do they plan this from way back in the king of the draft dodging Donald itself was involved from the beginning\nNow let me see if I got this right you're saying that and that the alleged so called the illegitimate president elect Benedict Donald went to Saudi Arabia during the transition\nOne day when did he do that I mean do we know the dates or the trip I don't recall that that doesn't mean it didn't happen\nWe gotta look up today if it was it was after after the election but before he took off shift is my understanding\nWell if they're reporting on that was it a secret trip I don't recall that at all\n[noise] All right let me let me do this they deem is I well let's hold on one let's hold that one let's see splits with we got to work with the facts and live with the truth I mean I I you know so anyway how 'bout this one\nThere is reporting and I do believe it's credible and it makes sense that cushion or the no good son in law the good for nothing son in law Jared Kushner that he met\nWith NBS Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince the guy who's running things now\nAnd pushing her used American intelligence sources and methods and and evidence\nAnd said here are your enemies and handed MBBS a list of those that our intelligence agencies through spies right and and you know intercept and stuff we know ... apparently our agencies know at least some of the people in the Saudis sprawling royal family\nThat we did not like NBS right they pick the phone calls saying you know people complaining about him so pushing her hand it NBS soda reporting goes a list of his enemies NBS and him were staying up till all hours of the morning plotting in planning\nMy suspicion is is that cushion are used our public resources to give Mohammed bin Salman a list of his enemies Mohammed bin Salman gave then then gave jerk cushion like a hundred million dollars as a pay off and then my ... been some and use our nation's intelligence to crack down on his enemies and they all killed a\n... because they're this is their plan to just take over a silence all descent and\nJust kill all the money what do you think of that\nAnd this is part of that this is part of the original agreement cooperation between the Donald and the crown prince dealt with this ... this is the kind of thing that would follow the intelligence that was necessary to be able to crack down et cetera and doesn't live\nWell and you know I'm rambling Chris Christie shut down the bridge lanes to the George Washington bridge to punish the local mayor there or not endorsing him what was fundamentally the most wrongful thing about that\nWas it was taking public property a bridge that we all paid for with our taxes\nAnd continue to pay for to maintain and the stuff that's public property he used it as part of his own
