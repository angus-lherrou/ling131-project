I went to his house to intervene and just before he died\nDavid ... three times Pulitzer Prize winning journalist out mine of course one of your colleagues over the decades you say ten in your piece on he's giving us some sense central Frank Trump flash back go back to the beginning um and talk\nBaby ... baby Donald Trump and how he started to look for it as well something very different than he has told\nYeah so how does the three year old end up making two hundred thousand dollars a year right that's a good question um here's how it worked um ...\nYou know she ... she ran is absolutely right that he was\nUm a really great builder in the outer boroughs um\nBut much of his building was actually made possible through federal housing subsidies he was actually one of the country's biggest recipients of cheap building loans basically made possible by the federal government and he used I'm twenty six million dollars or so\nOf those cheap loans to build two of his biggest um apartment complexes in New York I'm a place called BJ than another place called shore haven both out in Brooklyn\nUm these are massive massive apartment complexes thousands and thousands of units and and so he's building those in the late forties\nAnd what he did was something quite clever he he he um he put the land underneath the buildings\nInto a trust and made his children the beneficiaries of that trust and then he had the company's his companies that were actually building the buildings on top of the land\nSigned Ninety nine year leases to pay rent to the landlords\nHis young children\nAnd so what that meant was that Donald Trump starting at age three was for Trump's landlord he was collecting rent payments um from Fred drums\nAre companies and it was um this kind of maneuver right setting up the sort of mechanisms these financial mechanisms that were just\nKind of create this automatic streams of money that we're just sort of month by month by month with trickled into trust accounts or into partnerships and find their way ultimately into the the pockets of his children for Trump was just a genius at\nComing up with new ways new revenue streams to funnel into the pockets of his children so he didn't just make his children um his landlord she also made his children his banker\nHumid Donald Trump not just didn't just put them on the salary as vice president of Fred Trump's\nCompanies he also then pays him separately to be as consultant\nWho pays him separately to be a property manager he played them pay them separately to be purchasing agent and on and on and on it when in in the course of\nAll all of us as we gather up all of this the the records from inside of his uh for Trump's real estate empire we started counting up how many how many different revenue stream says he created for Donald Trump through the years\nAnd we got up to two hundred and Ninety five what we found and what we were able to document\nSome of these things you know they weren't in and of themselves big money like for example ... funnel the laundry revenue from his buildings to um to to Donald so a lot of money but when you sort of start aggregating it putting it all together\nIt's this just this mighty endless river of money flowing constantly into the bank accounts of Donald Trump\nI mean one of the things that you do in your piece as you give a very strong sense of the extent to which ... seem to have a special relationship with Donald Trump can you explain that so much of the money I accrued to Donald Trump against uh\nOther children so you know what did you learn about why that would be the case and also that the principal of illegality I mean what you spoke on the beach haven in show I have and the responsibility for that in a ... ...\n... is it actually technically illegal when he did\nSo in that transaction there's nothing illegal about that transaction that we've uncovered that's not what I'm that's not the point that I'm trying to make their that's an example though of one of the many different ways that Fred Trump was enriching Donald Trump starting from a very early age and continuing on a forward\nUm your your your um I'm Sorry the other point\nAbout the relationship between fat Donald because why does she give some money\nSo he for Trump had 'em in a an older son\nFor Trump junior who um initially it was kind of going to be the heir apparent right in ... I was interested in you know she she she really wanted to pass this dynasty on to um to uh to one of his children\nAnd Fred junior was sort of the first\nKind of natural Arab ... as the oldest son but um he didn't have the passion for the business\nUm he had other interests he liked to fly airplanes he loved music he he he for Trump the father considered Fred from the sun\nTo be a little too soft\nI'm a little too nice um and before long um it became clear that she was not going to be the Arab parent\nThe Arab parent was going to be Donald Trump and Donald Trump was very aware of his father's disapproval of Fred junior he witnesses spread could senior\nCould be quite cruel and I think what we see in terms of this is really from interviews with people who worked closely with Fred from you\nIt's they witnessed this young man Donald Trump sort of watching what had happened to Fred junior and almost forming himself into for juniors opposite Fred junior was soft too nice will Donald was going to be a shark he was going to be a killer\nSo that that I think is sort of at the core of this father son relationship which is very much with the story is about it is about a father son relationship these two men were extraordinarily close Donald Trump said we we quote him that he felt that he knew\nHis father better than anybody else in the world I'm In and they they they talk daily they spent\nYou know many a weekend together they were in constant communication Donald Trump was a constant presence when Fred Trump would have strategy sessions with his\nHis top lawyers his top accountants I'm figuring out what his next moves were a Fred Trump was often this sort of silent lurking presidents at Donald Trump's big flashy press conferences\nAnd so they were this there was a it was more than just a father son relationship it was also a partnership\nAnd it's interesting you talked about the amount of federal grants that he got that Trump got an interesting night Jesse Donald Trump came into the business and they were simply because they're getting federal support and they're discriminating an African Americans\nBut I wanted to go back to read from your point David vice down he\nWrites unless over friday ... West Palm Beach County building supplying maintenance company formed by the Trump family in Nineteen Ninety two all counties the sense of purpose was to be a practicing agent for ... buying everything from ... to cleaning supplies\nNo such thing recognition interview shell and set off county ... millions of dollars trying Frank Trump's empire by simply marking purchases already made by his employees\nThere is nearly as effectively ... cents load all counties down your Donald Trump siblings in cash and fried shrimp than Unifi\nPadded all county receipts to justify think Iran increases for thousands of tennis game\nYeah um I mean this is something where [laughter]\nI'm when Donald Trump says this is old news I can tell you that\nThat no one had ever heard of all county building supplying maintenance it's never been written about described anywhere um and this is actually a kind of a remarkable in a way it's a\n... gold and paid his way to being a Somali able to escape the kind of scrutiny and prosecution he deserved\nAnd honestly if a lot of people in New York state had done their jobs he would never been part of the United states it's clear to me that uh there are a real ramifications right now to what has been disclosed that there's a\nEither a potential violations of the law or in the cases where the statute of limitations has a a ended that uh there may be very serious civil penalties that can be applied by both the state in the city\nSo that's Mayor Bill de Blasio responding to your investigation what can New York recoup New York city New York state and are there are criminal charges at all here\nUm [noise] rounded returns which I think um I think that that clearly the such limitations is the big obstacle to any kind of\nA a criminal charges however um you know we actually don't know what ended up in Donald Trump's tax returns and so if there are things that she misreported\nUm that have their roots and some of the transactions that were describing in this article and those miss representations carry forward into future tax returns um from from Donald Trump that could be potentially problematic because that could maybe\nI'm a type of sexual imitations off the table as an obstacle\nI'm there could be a criminal\nOr a prosecution potentially although like look you know let's be real here I mean the Ira is a much weakened as in C I mean it's been quite devastated\nBy um budget cuts over over the years um and um and certainly the the IRS I'm Talking about talking about state authorities now talking about the federal Ira has said absolutely nothing in response to this article um I think the more the more I'm\nLittle more realistic uh accountability that's there is this potential for civil um fraud\nUm there's no statute of limitations for civil tax fraud um and so both this year on this because the state tax authorities that can be a very powerful weapon um if they decide to actually use it um to go back and look at these um uh transactions\nWell let's go to um some of the mechanism that you point to a uh in the piece that Trump a and used in order to avoid paying taxes explain what Gratz thought G. R. A. I. G. S.\nS. and how they were and how they were used in this video accompanying the New York times that the day you are co authors on crack explains how Trump and his siblings came to own nearly all of their father a fact Trump empire\nWithout paying at state taxes\nGraft trust designed past wealth between generations in Nineteen Ninety five Donald Trump and his siblings began to take ownership of most of their father's real estate empire while avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes [noise]\nThey did so by creating to ... retained annuity trust also known as ... one for died in one from um [noise]\nTaxes are paid based on the final value of the garage and escaped the trumps every incentive to low ball the value of the ... that's exactly what they did\nTake for instance the phone totally apartments in Nineteen eighty to the Trump value to hundred and sixty for you to complex it's interesting point three million dollars but for the purposes of the ... they said it was worth of just two point nine million dollars\nThey broke up the ownership of the apartments giving almost half married Trump Fred Trump's wife [noise]\nDisallowed dumps you tell the IRS Fred Trump who would exercise iron fist control over every breath of his empire for Seventy years was a minority owner with no real say over his buildings\nSo David that's your co author who's on crack talking about ground could you comment on whether this instrument is what essentially gave legal cover a to a ... action\nKnow I mean for grants are um you know a well established in ...\nYou can rent that's used by the wealthy 'em to pass um assets onto their children in a way that allows them to avoid estate taxes and in fact\nUm if you watch TV often see these commercials from video um that are actually ... commercials they don't say the word grab\nBut when you see this video video is this patch consider this consulting firm I'm I'm that is that is actually on CNBC MSNBC and CNN is running commercials that are effectively commercials for Gratz\nI'm a I'm and I'm and so it's a it's a it's a um it's a technique that when you talk to tax lawyers\nYou know the kind of they have this they almost got a little misty eyed about Gratz they said this is like magic\nThese things are these incredible devices that assets go in all kinds of financial gymnastics occur inside of them and then they sort of assets come out and they're like free of taxes\nI wanted to go to another of your former colleagues and that is David Cay Johnston also fellow Pulitzer Prize winner and\nNow editor in chief that they seem apartheid aren't keynoter MSNBC that Trump sister who is a federal judge has heavily implicated in these charges of tax fraud\nMuch keeping my sister now I Am Trump Barry is a shooting judge on the third circuit court of appeals she's a senior judge am I treated today though I think she should immediately remove herself from the bench we should not have a tax cheat in the White House or on the federal bench [noise]\nWhat do you think of the facts David Cay Johnston\nSo I'm a I think the important thing to to say about this is that\nFor Trump's estate tax return it was a very important document\nUm and there were three executives there were three people who signed off on that the state tax return one was judge Barry one was President Trump and the third was Robert Trump the president's younger brother\nWhen you sign an estate tax return\nYou're responsible for the accuracy of that tax return you're responsible for accurately describing the assets and you're also responsible for describing all of the gifts that were given by the person the person in the state so\nWhat we describe in our story is that the estate tax return that the three of them side but the three of them vote for that tax return is grossly inaccurate news all of the same kind of techniques that we describe in other parts of the story\nAnd it did so in order to make what was left of for Trump's empire look like\nMiniscule um and so I think that actually that the fact that she put her John Hancock on that I'm a state tax return um I think that's an area that is is potentially problematic\nWhat most surprised you and what you and David as we begin to [laughter]\nThe thing\nThat I think continues to surprise me about Donald Trump is if this is this guy who has been so much in the ... of our culture and our media for so long and yet\nThey're so little that we actually know about him and his finances you know ... ... does this mountain right mountain of books and and interviews and you know it's just it's it's daunting 'em to look at but when you kind of put all of that side aside\nAnd just trying to get to ground truths with this guy it's\nIt's every time we have done that we've been we feel like oh my gosh the idea of whatever the idea was that we saw um about him is it's quite different when you pull some more layers back\nAfter Trump staffing you write his empires most valuable asset with an eye OU from Donald Trump and you say he betrayed his father and what he wanted his empire\nDifferent Trump really wanted the empire to say in the family Donald Trump words in some financial disclosure difficulty again in two thousand and four and he was the one\nWho came into a family meeting and so it's time to sell dads buildings and so they did and the irony is\nThe price that they got for all those buildings was actually hundreds of millions of dollars less than what the actual property was worth according to banking records that we have uncovered\nDo you think this will force somehow lead to seeing Donald Trump's tax returns ... and the political um blowback from it [noise]\nYou know it's hard just to say it depends so much on who's actually in control of the subpoenas in Congress\n\nSpecial report Kevin confirmation vote to send it will make its final decision thirty minutes from now on the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh\nNever kept many stressful weeks here on Capitol Hill following allegations that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted at least one woman decades ago Democrat Mazie Hirono said cabinet testimony where he denied the allegations just late further evidence that he has not fit to sit on the nation's highest court that Kavanaugh's\nIs that in each case the\nWere caused by the crust of the earth being either penetrated her cracking open and in the process releasing enough greenhouse gases to produce radical greenhouse gas driven global warming which render the the the planet\nIn hospitals in hospitable for the currently exist in species so most of them died off in the few that could adapt to the new uh temperature normalcy became the the you know the next ... you know that the dinosaurs died off into mammals came along because mammals were warm blooded and they could deal with\nWith the you know the new temperatures post Katie\nSo I'm ... when ... when they ... up until the Nineteen sixties really nobody knew what\nAny of these extinctions will caused any of them on there was this theory that they had all been caused by media writes hitting the earth and puncture in the earth's crust and then that would you know let enough of these gases ... escape from from the earth but it would produce this global warming that would kill things off\nUm they they nailed down in the media right theory for the Katie extinction one sixty five million years ago it was apparently a meteorite that hit the earth around there were Kan coon is where the ... that basically made the Gulf of Mexico and\nAnd uh you know that punched and a big enough hole in the earth that enough carbon containing and and other greenhouse gases were release but\nIt wasn't really until around two thousand two thousand two that they nailed down will cause the permanent the worst of all of them and they had always assumed it was a media right it turns out it wasn't it was it was it is happening during a time when when the earth had only one continent on it\nAnd this that Khan and started moving and splitting into two and all these other process is but it's actually preceded that it it kind of a pre stage that there was this huge volcanic corruption went on for thousands of years ... in an area and that we now call Siberia the regents called the Siberian Traps\nAnd over a period of time this volcanic eruption produced enough greenhouse gases that had raised the temperature of the earth I'm ultimately you know when the whole thing was all done by probably somewhere between twenty and thirty degrees Celsius which just you know wiped out everything\nNow is when we talk about um the the inability of species to adapt as it is simply a function of a change in temperature or temperature or is it a function of what the change in temper temperature does to the the access to things like food and write a letter\nIt yeah it's very much the ladder um you know bio systems ecosystems change and and and you know a plants animals and and sometimes the microorganisms that support them for example trees exist because there's fungi on their ... and bacteria and the ... the transport nutrients into them\nAnd in some cases climate change it makes makes those bacteria and fungi network as well in this or the trees can't transport the nutrients that they need and you end up with a fragile trees that are vulnerable to things like rust and as the Beatles and and the fungus isn't things\nUm so so that's the process the the the the two really important points that we try to make in this first movie our number one\nThere are tipping points and when you hit those tipping points into a mass extinction\nUm you'd typically don't know that you past the tipping point until you're already passed it\nAnd number two that\nThe that the major tipping point is the release of of methane gas that is frozen in ice flurries around the coasts of the continents and in the Arctic region and in the Arctic permafrost and and and number three really\nIf you think of the first five extinctions four of them were caused by massive volcanic activity one was caused by a media ride\nPunch a hole that was functionally the same thing as massive volcanic activity in each case the core the the the the crust of the earth was breached what we have been doing for a hundred and fifty years now\nIs the same thing we have been breaching the crust of the earth we've been drilling holes into the earth only instead of doing it like with a big thick hammer that just goes lap you know we like the media right for example hitting Cancun or the Siberian Traps going out for a thousand years\nInstead of doing that in that blunt force way where you know you're hitting some areas that are carbon rich in some areas that are carbon poorer and you get all kinds of other stuff going on you know volcanic rock and stuff\nInstead of doing that well we've been doing his searching the planet for the carbon rich areas and then drilling specifically into them or mining specifically into them extracting the carbon containing compounds\nNatural gas coal and oil and then burning those and and and throwing the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere so we have altered the planet's atmosphere\nBy punching holes in the crust and pulling out these these ancient stories of carbon\nThe same way functionally I mean the mechanism has been different but the the end result\nCould be the same as in the ... as in these previous five mass extinctions and there's\nA yeah we have burned three hundred and fifty billion tons of carbon we burn it and thrown into the atmosphere since the beginning the industrial revolution roughly Eighteen fifty\nThree hundred and fifty billion times and that is produced a one degree temperature increase which means that there's another degree that pretty much a unstoppable there's always whatever you've done there's that much in the pipeline before it exhaust itself\nSo that three hundred fifty billion times is is producing a two degrees Celsius temperature increase or alternately will\n[noise] in the just in the Arctic\nJust in the Arctic there's somewhere between one and two trillion tons of carbon in the form of methane largely\nIn the Arctic permafrost and in these methane hydrate these methane snow cone slush is uh just under the ice in on the on the surface of the the shallow relatively shallow surface of the Arctic Ocean and\nThat basically functioning like a like a loaded gun\nUh and and and we got to take a break but when we come back let's talk about the ... the the rate of methane gas release and a greenhouse gases\nIn the um the last five great extinctions and where we are relative to that in in in this [noise] this uh it's it's it's a little clinical to call it a process but would that were involved in we got to take a break we'll be right back with Tom Hartmann when we return and [noise]\n\nThan has happened in any of the previous mass extinctions with the possible exception of the Katie with the media right but it's faster than the other four so we don't know when we're going to hit that tipping point but what we do know\nIs if we pass that tipping point we've probably won't know it for a generation or two but within a hundred or two hundred years we will no longer be here so I encourage people to get over the last ... hours dot org and check it out\nThanks so much time we appreciate your time today Thanks for highly Sam I really appreciate Tom Hartmann is the host of the Tom Hartmann program and the big picture you can watch his new film the last ... hours of humanity online at last hours dot org [noise]\nComing up on ring of fire Daniel Ellsberg will be joining us to talk about America's surveillance data on Robert F Kennedy junior and you're listening to bring a fire [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] than cedar here you're listening to the best to bring a fire radio\n\nWelcome back to rent a fire and Robert Kennedy junior President Obama recently gave a speech where he addressed the issue of domestic surveillance and revelations that came forward last summer from whistle blower Edward Snowden\nThe president dodged the issue of whether or not these activities would continue indefinitely and Americans are left to wonder just how deep the surveillance on American citizens oh and how much a threat\nIs is to our loved constitutional guarantees and the bill of rights joining me now to talk about this is Daniel Ellsberg a former U.S military analyst let me ask you about\nWhat's happening today is in your opinion is Edward Snowden I mean you're a hero to our generation you change you know you ended the Vietnam War without you it would not have ended when it did you ...\nYou know they're all of this history of of governmental lies you change the way people felt about their government they you know we know we grew up in a world where we couldn't believe that the United states government would lie to us all of a sudden you know you showed that this is terrible Web history of\nOf lies at an end just that\nThe background for people who don't know about this McNamara commissioned a report magma or who is always anti world though he will escalated McNamara commissioned the Pentagon and I think the RAND Corporation to\nDo a history of the war of how we had gotten into it to make sure it could never happen again and you were part of the team\nYou at work for Henry Kissinger you were this brilliant Harvard kid who had and Vietnam or in the Marines was a warrior on came back from Vietnam and was war hock at one point to an out\nYou were looking at it and saying this is not what it was supposed to be but you were part of that group at went through tens of thousands of documents and trace how we had an end to it one of those copies\nWas in the RAND Corporation save you got pissed off one night because\nThe next administration had dropped a lawsuit against a group of special forces and CIA\nTeam who murdered a South Vietnamese informants and dumped has bought in the south China Sea and use it as it from a I'm going to give this to the New York times and you\nUse Iraq's ... I don't know twenty eight volumes are what ... was and gave it to the New York times and that was the end and so you were you really Changed History and you're a hero\nDo you consider Edward Snowden or let's even broadening Julian Assange to be doing the same thing you are doing or is there a difference\nGreat similarities and the court shows there are differences the differences don't change my opinion at all\nThat Edward Snowden and before him Chelsea Manning and in a different rule Julian Sean she was a publisher sort of the New York times\nRelative to the Pentagon papers she was not the shores but he was medium prudish at a concert was to show they are personal heroes your mind\nI think there were a trophy amounting and Edward Snowden a great Americans ... to ... not American which means you're not eligible to be a traitor but he was eligible to be called a traitor by everyone\nJust as interestingly noted is called a traitor by the Australian prime minister actually a that's a ... a whole makes Australia\nAnd for some reason a veil pronouncing and the foreign minister I pronounce your dad would show them as a traitor which is ridiculous I have no more at trader than I Am and I'm not\nA definitely an Emmy account you gave of this which could which is right in in general outlines but incorrect in certain things for example I worked for Henry Kissinger after the Pentagon papers after I worked in the Pentagon papers in the in the new critical restrictions\nAnd job I was certainly not a war hero I was a a a civilian in Vietnam and I did use my marine training from ... years earlier as a\nRifle platoon leader and a rifle Corey commander or you've had experience to walk with troops without injuring them in combat and to see a fair amount of combat Troy sort of the war close up if you had not had a big influence on me and I did work on the Pentagon papers\nAnother little correction you hear a the Pentagon papers you should we're in a safer ground they were in my ... a very few people had top secret shaved in their office\nI add rammed they had to go to the top secret control office for that they had only secret files a I had was one of the few with a top secret shave and that was in part\nBecause I had been authorized to study the Pentagon papers I was one of the actually the only researcher along with the president of the company who had access to the papers at that time now that's a very close analogy to\nShow them because ah what he gave wish of material that he had access to\nAnd in effect authorized ... because she hadn't for contractors at Booz Allen working for the NFC\nOne fewer yeah and then you had the clearances which she had a an be authorized access to the systems\nThere were no rules so it was very little oversight from then on at that point he was so free and he said anyone in his position could've simply walked out the door for any reason\nUh uh with all that information and could have sold it for a very great price to a very foreign powers which again any more than ... feet manning uh he did not do he gave it to the American people are without any recompense and at\nRisk of his life from then on\nAnd I'm trying to be really why I just heard him say in a in an interview with trimming television I was watching it last night which I recommend to people one of the way to look up Snowden and in Germany from television on Google News and you'll find it and he said I Will never be fully out of danger\nHe says unless these systems totally change which is frankly very far off and I think that's true for the same reason that President Nixon actually brought a dozen Cuban CIA assets from the bay of pigs\nTo incapacitate me on the steps of the capital on may third Nineteen Seventy two a year into my trial and a year away from the immigrant my trial for them to that he brought people up big incapacitate me and that had really nothing to do with what I had already revealed\nWe would be so I I Would credit is due critical Baba with responding to public pressure that but what is he was funding to during a congressional recess constituency amazed they representative according to all the news stories\nBy Bunning holding them in ... in the old at restaurants that wherever they found them and saying no war in Syria we don't want war with Syria\nNow what I read that I felt\nLike the Congress people would come from what it is they didn't object to live you would cut into my don't fully the answer to that I think ... played it ruled by the way in this kind of we've had enough this is yet you know no more of this or as\nAs Gorbachev said to his wife race it when he was deciding whether to take the job of general secretary\nWe can't go on like this\nAnd I'm waiting for for ... leaders to say that we can't go on like this\nI have one last question for you which is the corrosive impact of excesses corporate power on American democracy and American values and the end you know you saw as far back as a Vietnam are that\nAre in many ways our military and intelligence apparatus became\n... a ... a ... a servant or the mercantile and ... as a U.S corporations has that trend amplified overtime at and how much of a problem do you think it is to our democracy\nWell you know at the time when I was in the government\nAnd I was a you say no chance but I was a an official a special ... secretary of defense and then um [noise] foreign service officers your one highest cramping in the embassy in Saigon\nAnd I have to figure that with him earlier at the RAND Corporation as a consultant\nI wasn't really conscious at that time of corporate influence of the kind that Eisenhower had referred to the military industrial complex I didn't see that people when they thought a policy was mistaken as in Vietnam I didn't see it as a result of corporate influence in into the state that's a that's a complex question\nOn Vietnam was worthy influences on that\nBut on Iraq [laughter] that's not so hard to see the the oil industry there was crucial to this day we have not learned\nThe make up a membership of\nVice president Cheney's taskforce on energy which was looking after the invasion of Iraq and partially out the oil fields there to various corporations he refused to make public who had consulted with\nAnd I would presume that Obama could could tell us that could surely could find that out and put it out but he's offering that secrets somehow\nSo we have the corporate influence there that is a relatively open and that's true in Iran to really among the various influences but the oil from Iran has always been a target but under surveillance matter\nUh it's really ... and I think we've done a lot to avoid as\nTo what amounts to a corporate government collaboration makes him almost the same the same unit which looks leaving cold corporate\nOr fascism uh where are the there's really very little distinction between certain corporations like who is Allen Hamilton for which Snowden worked as a contractor and the NSA or the telephone companies\nDaniel Ellsberg is former U.S military analysts best known for releasing the Pentagon papers which detailed the decision making process that led America into Vietnam War thank you for joining us today Dan thank you for having a great opportunity [noise]\nJust ahead on ring of fire well here in energy from the great ... Johnson where he'll tell us why America's obsession with empire building is going to be a disaster for this country on my cabin tonia we'll be right back [noise]\n\nA\nNo one wants to be in an accident but the fact is accidents\nHappen so if you've ever find yourself in a motor vehicle accident remember these three to get some more see medical attention if necessary and called ... been blocked by by four twenty Seventy nine Richard Cravens is ready to\nFight for you he's worked in the insurance industry he understands insurance adjuster and he knows how to make them uncomfortable don't hesitate following an accident Colby injury expert that Cravens law by by born twenty Seventy nine [noise]\n[noise] my little [noise]\n\nDo you want me was a man was\n[noise]\nSo [noise]\nBy lied to cry [noise]\n\nWith all the time [noise]\nSome of them [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nNo no no\nThat's her report cabinet and confirmation vote the majority of the Senate has voted to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as protesters repeatedly disrupted the proceedings Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said the GOP ran the nomination through Republican\nYeah saviors it's very interesting 'cause we consider ourselves a democratic country and we think of totalitarian countries and dictatorships as places where there's some big father figure you know\nWhether it's Stalin or or you know some buddy I'm In this totalitarian country that you\nAre you defer to ... and here we are a democratic country\nAnd and yet we have grown up in a culture in which we are taught to revere or the founding fathers\nAnd we're taught to review the military heroes and our history has told through the president's you know the age of Jackson the age of Lincoln the age of Roosevelt you know\nOf the and it's ironic in a democracy you're not supposed to revere and have too much respect for the people who are running the country are you are supposed to be active and engaged critical citizens\nShow so in in people's history and and again in in the\nPeople's history of American I'm part well there are heroes but there's a ... they're not the usual heroes that is that you don't find theater Roosevelt the warmonger as a hero you don't find it a Roosevelt managed thinks you know war is the highest quality that he\nCould have what we learn in high school right [laughter] yeah\nWe we we have Mark Twain that Europe is Mark Twain spoke out against Theodore Roosevelt and denounced him for his Roosevelt had praised a military ... in the Philippines so yeah we have we have we\nHave heroes but they're very different and [noise] and they represent the [noise]\nYou know what people need and and they don't represent the establishment\nTo take a quick break but we'll get back to our discussion with linked Howard Zinn when we return\nIf you want even more ring of fire the need to visit us online a ring of fire radio dot com or follow us on Twitter a ring of fire radio I might have Antonio we'll be right back [noise]\n\n\n... envoys list\nPrice dealer price to be happier if your car shop and you've probably heard these terms I\nWatch what they mean it's so confusing well and was confusing not anymore I'm telling you about your price from two car it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you watch including season accessories and basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because true car shows you what other people are paying for\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you a loan that is right for\nCall today and get started\nBears were playing a huge role in the two thousand eight elections and there's still a lot of similarities between the election four years ago and the one that will just sat in about a month\nThe U.S is still involved in more fiasco was in the middle east terrorist attacks are occurring overseas and foreign policy issues need to be on the minds of all Americans so let's listen to what ... Johnson warned us about before his death\nShowers it out of being the author Seventeen books it's hard to choose any one that ah without that I Would say is just really my favorite but nemesis if it's good stuff well it\nProbably would be mine to really really that\nWhen I've been working on artist\nWell it's just excellent so let me get right to the heart of it OK okay first of all if you were to describe why we maybe are that empire it's on its way towards ruin you have a list of things that I think is yes it is just extremely interest I Want to go down the list and\nWhy don't you feel them in as we go okay All right you're talking about the idea that we have a government did driving the nation to tyranny and ruin I mean that's that's the premise\nYeah and then you say these are the reasons why let's go down the list ... very compelling argument that you have here first of all a nation with no outside threats\nThat are mentally at war fill that in a little bit\nWell it is to say our commitment probably never formal rather earth wild but our commitment to him ... and militarism a puts us in to the ...\nAll empires sense of that of a of the Roman republic uh we uh we face one of the greatest dilemmas Eddie\n... history namely a domestic democracy at a foreign empire history tells us you can have one you can have the other but you can't have both\nI'll get the most secretive intrusive and repressive government in our history and a president who he describes a serial liar that all of our all of our listeners would agree with that in a little bit ... well I think\nThere's just no question that it it it's still hard to understand says we presume that George Bush is a is it American and was educated Americans schools and\nThat he went to Yale University into Harvard law school at a few others such things he doesn't seem to have ever heard the ah the least obvious elements in the constitution the separation of powers the fact that they are our most important defense against tyranny and dictatorship\nOr that the this is a a a work of genius above all by a by ideas Madison but by many others and that he has systematically subverted ... with ideas that are there isn't a constitutional scholar\nIn the country who would agree with with the possible exception of it apparently insane lawyer sitting at the University of California Berkeley Law school daily Jay Z oh\nRight right right and and ... but this is a president that would suggest that he's smarter than the frame or so so we know where that goes okay\nThis is the unprecedented wealth disparity that takes place where you have a corporate power\nThat has really in a sense created that disparity and you you in your book he just again every\nEvery one of these once you do such a great job renting them out of it but you're talking about brand does and he says this we we all know Supreme Court justice Brennan said that we can either have democracy in this country we can have a great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we can't have both\nHow does it feel that in as far as your theory that we are driving ourselves towards ruin\nWell it's a matter of just open the newspaper\nI mean the crises are on us every day we're the one of the few advanced democracies on earth that doesn't provide health care for all the population are any number of people including personal friends of mine a live without health insurance they simply decided that it doesn't fit into their uh\nTheir budget anymore uh the uh we have a a a fuel crisis that's a\nDriving our economy into a potential bankruptcy\nA standing behind all of this is not to say we don't have the money\nWe do have the money but we're wasting it in the most profit hospital way on foreign wars on military equipment that we don't need that in fact we don't even think works we don't care whether it works or not most of this is being spent as a jobs program that the military industrial complex has become\nA ... a intrinsic part of our economy these\nDay well I Want to get to that and I want to talk about that but but I Want to stop this when you you talked about it in order ... as we drive ourselves towards this abysmal end you did you really do equate to a Ukraine equate to other civilizations Rome's Greeks are\nYes the Soviet Union Japan I mean I could go on with that but it is really really examine yeah but so so but one thing that you say as you say that\n... if you look at all of those failures that one thing that you had was the fact a one party state with two wings\nAnd I'm president claiming almost exclusive executive power were they ignored the rule of law you saw that playing itself out in other in other empires that had held\nNo question a now granted it's there's nothing determinist think about this or that or you can wake up and do the right thing the example I use in my book nemesis is the British Empire at the end of World War two\nIt didn't do it well it can we stop the matter there were many ... throwback later but the British understood that you couldn't continue to use Nazi methods holding together the British Empire\nThey they said they used to some extent showers they save themselves and they\nThey did exactly I mean I agree there on an island in or a\nComment and the origins of the ... and then this is one of the great achievements of Britain and even of Europe that they recognized they had to choose you either we're going to keep India and keep it ... under military power is the recognition that imperialism is it pure form of charity\nOkay so our rules by by consent\nSo also in this list as we take ourselves to this thing that should be a wakeup call to any but by the way for somebody to think that they really understand where we are in in in the world today and not have read your book nemesis I I think it's a huge mistake well I don't know it really is such a great\nA great road map but one of those things in your road map you say that when we look at empires and if that has taken themselves to this abysmal end there's always been the absence of checks and balances and separation of powers or you've had this reckless no restraint kind of boy him for a messianic message that flows from leadership\nIs really hard to believe that George Bush didn't want advice on what he was doing\nThat he didn't care to pay attention to the city didn't I don't mean that even listen to his enemies didn't listen to his friends I mean\nRent Scowcroft was telling it some time ago as and a and a former secretary of state Baker that you're heading over the cliff\nMhm mhm well one thing you at in there and your list and there's so many things are just I mean there's just almost completely on point it's almost like Brits analysis of fascism laser that point by point since here's what's happening\nBut one thing that you add here is you say the dominant corporate controlled media is something that will take you to that abysmal and where you have the glorifying ... just propaganda the glorifying of imperial one let's\nMake ourselves absolutely clear on this the first amendment to the constitution which guarantees freedom of press was not written to protect people magazine\nIt was one of the people who wrote\nThat what they had they didn't give a damn about anything like people magazine or any other ... popular literature and the idea was to empower the press to penetrate\nThe ah the greatest defense of a state bureaucracy which is secrecy the purpose of the free press is to try and get behind the facade of government the ... the lying that has become now almost second nature to any high ranking military officer\nAsked idiom but what he does he simply live or to get behind it and publish publicize it instead overtime or as a result of propaganda money\nOf ah the nature of recruitment it to the press\nOf elite universities in America the press has become the handmade into power and it the cost of that is that it no longer performs the function of penetrating say see it's the same way in my opinion the greatest crime of the military industrial complex which they're totally corrupt Congress",
