going to drop the price of the stock\n\nThe stock market is not a window at a casino when you're done for the day and you bring your chipped shop and they cashed wow\nOkay especially especially when

quoted there's a bit and there's and ask\nAnd when you hit that\nIs worse what somebody's willing to pay for it and if you're a guy like ... or a guy like Tim Cook or something or mark soccer bird and you've got billions of dollars worth of shares what you think you could just go out there and sell 'em all without question the stock of course not\nSo all of those stupid articles out there about

the you know I didn't want\nTo meet him from the very beginning that already knew that he he was going to form and I knew that\nHe was trying to attract me and but he was very aggressive in trying to pursue me and and and the sit down with me to call me and it's the friend then to hear this news you know is it really is\nAnd you talk about where you're speaking to us from and how his actions lead to you or in person meant\nYeah sure I'm I'm I'm from Pittsburgh\nI'm I'm going to half way how I'm I'm right now I'm just focused on trying to uh you know my transition back into society to reunite

the fact that this guy was in the journal produce and we'd go to another guy ah I just I knew immediately\nWell really high I don't\nYou to get in trouble and you're in a halfway house and I know you have to get off the air and half past the hour so I Want to thank you very much for joining us ... Kelly joining us talking about how he was in ... head Hussein who is the man\nWho owns the prestige limousine service the limousine that was a legally on the road a number of his cars um had a failed inspection and yet this limousine carried\nA twenty people the driver and Seventeen friends between the ages I think twenty four and thirty four who are all going to a thirtieth birthday party\nTwo of the couples in the car had just gotten married\nI'm the driver of course killed and two bystanders we're joined now by two other cats who can talk about the man who owns the service not exactly clear where he is right now his son has been arrested on manslaughter charges as a result of the accident\nHere in New York San braver meant joined us and attorney who represents one of the new bore Newberg for who are convicted after shot Shane led the group an organized this game he'll tell us about that\nAnd in Los Angeles lyric ... co director of the film terror\nThat's tea in parentheses and the word era camera a documentary that follows undercover FBI informant say ... ... ah who I'm a college I was just talking about another FBI informant um\nWe met you at the Sundance Film festival this astounding film a few years ago if he can finish um\nHow leaf a story for us how he figured out who shot had was significant I mean he not only was involved in the jailing of men in Pittsburgh but also as we'll talk about with sand braver men the men in New York\nWho were then and trapped and are serving decades in prison at this point ...\nYes so shy had Hussein I'm In Pittsburgh and he was going by the name Muhammad\nUm and he had been assigned there presumably to investigate ... um but because of the new bird for case because that was such a publicly critique the example of entrapment\nUm during that trial shy had Hussein was photographed and was exposed to this photograph was placed ... actually it was the front cover up in New York Times\nAnd so because of all the publicly available information um important data than braver men and other defense attorneys on the new bird for team um there was basically this publicly available information about ... Hussein\nIncluding recordings that he made of and Newburgh for that were entered I'm as government evidence during their trial in two thousand nine to all of this was sort of public\nAnd so when Khalifa had his suspicions about Hussein um side is saying and Pittsburgh under the name Mohammed gave Khalifa business card\nI'm with a number and Khalifa due to suspicion he Googled that phone number and it reference number in one of the new bird for a trial transcripts that was publicly available so ... through the school will search was able to actually confirm on paper that I had Hussein was an informant\nI mean that is simply amazing this guy gifts in his number he's very nervous about him\nAnd he checked it out on Google and he sees as the number of the FBI informant and the new book for case which brings us to send brave from in the morning Hi it's great to have you with us on TALK about this case and Newburgh\nAnd yes it was front page news but I think for many people in this country it's long been forgotten about as they ride away in jail\nOh absolutely true so the trial is essentially ... who I was his nickname in our case of course I don't think anybody could honestly say they know what his real name was because he ... he did so much immigration fraud on his original us on occasion totally get anybody believes that he could be for it I mean nobody knows his real name\nBut beyond that he comes to Newberg these terrorists to go into new word he goes into mosques and specifically test\nNew vertigo very depressed\n... very depressed so he was in ... before originally when you went into a mosque and people should get out of her get out of here you went to the ... out of here why why would they telling him to leave and they were telling them to leave because he was in there to say let's have a hard let's have a holy war and the people in the mosque was saying something to do with us\nWe're here to pray we're here for a peaceful mission and so he kept getting thrown out of places and he found a disaffected person in a parking lot\nAnd that's how the Newark a man and his name was James comedy so James comedy was allowed my by his own absolute admission he shot off his mouth endlessly and then like ... he one day you said you know I don't have any interest in this matter more and hid for a month and a half\nHid the FBI knew exactly was 'cause they were trailing memory loss but every time the moxie would knock on his door he was hiding behind the door where he call of Egypt oh I'm Out of town I'm In Philly wherever I Am but the FBI was paying ... to do something he had a job like a salesman so as a salesman you only get paid if he makes the sale\nAnd he has to tell the person who wants to sell me tell you anything you want to hear so in our trial ... Hussein said things like I'll give you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a barber shop free cars free travel my clients are looking at paying was totally impoverished and my client was bought for food\nSo every meeting my client is eating that's how you got my client the joined us saying there's a you know if you've read somebody rice they're starving though believe anything you ask them to believe because they're starting to them as was my client huh so that that was the premise that got everybody into this once they were there\nShow saying just kept doing things his everyday task was to make the story better\nAnd the FBI was continually try to real him in at the same time so there is a no no don't offer those things you can offer five thousand dollars so he went off the reservation said no to fifty is good and then he did these things and then do lied to his handlers about it and they didn't know about it until they actually heard the tapes where he said two fifty I asked I often do you two fifty you didn't want it out of the car\n[laughter] so it was endless and he said you I'm gonna fly on a plane my clients that I Can't go anywhere don't have a passport\nYou're talking about the the the most on educated the most on salvageable young men\nIsn't this is harder to this is ... very significant 'cause um I had no is enough that\nHe cannot just be offering financial and ... as he talks about the cause they have to be there for the cause right jihad not for the money because I don't get the FBI in trouble\nSo I Want to go to the HBO documentary the New Bern staying which features secret recordings the FBI native conversations between\nThe undercover FBI and former head Christine and James crime any one of the men who became part in the New Bern before you have to listen very closely because well obviously this a surveillance audio it's hard to understand that clip begins which I had the same\nIs your understanding that you make a lot of money has turned me on the side if I'm wrong [noise]\nThat'll be good but I have to know what I'm going to do to make the money\nI have a lot of ideas okay for you\n\nIn revenues by then you're going to get some brothers together so more the more you're going to me this these job I'm hoping we can get hurt\nSo that is actually saying saying you're going to get some brothers together can change comedy and this is another clip from the secret FBI recordings nest one begins with James comedy\nAnd under the rug has gotten jobs are only three of us would are no jobs but actually Chinese and we should have humid and do all this money in our pockets or how do you do is look I mean I think the single\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo\n\nA child perform ... democracy now I mean he could and then within our means shape we\nEntered a show with a remarkable new book titled how fascism walk the politics of us and them which focuses in particular on current trends under the Trump Administration arguing that the president is not as much of an anomaly in American history as we often think\nThe book's author Yale professor Jason Stanley whose parents were both Holocaust survivors who came to the U.S as refugees\nShows instead that quote in its own history the United states can find a legacy of the back of liberal democracy as well as the roots of fashion long indeed Hitler was inspired by the confederacy and Jim Crow laws Jason family right\nHe also wants of the dangers of normalizing fascists politics saying quote what normalization does its transform the morally extraordinary into the ordinary it makes us able to tolerate ... was one intolerable by making it seem as if this is the way things have always been\nWe're joined right now by Jason Stanley philosophy professor at Yale University his new book is just out it's titled how fascism works the politics of us and them as previous books how propaganda works welcome to democracy now professor\nAt trade to have you with us why now why are you releasing this book how fascism works now\nWhat we have a global ultra nationalist far right movements crossing many countries both in our Owen Brazil we've just seen and they feed off each other\nSo I think right now it's a very important to make people aware of the features a ... store go features empty\nAlert people to the fact that the United states has always been vulnerable to this kind of politics\nWill explain what fascism defined what it means he is\nSo fascism is an ideology based on power liberal democracy is based on liberty and equality liberty and equality require troops because any truth to speak truth to power\nAnd a free of if if you've ever lied to you're not free no one thinks the people of North Korea are free they've been lied to\nSo if you're going to attack liberal democracy and replace it with power you need to smash truth so fascism is an ideology based on power and loyalty\nIt ah it it creates it's based on hyper nationalism so one group loyalty to one group and one person the leader represents that group it's hyper masculine and hyper patriarchal\nYou talk about the ten pillars of fascism what are they\nDepend colors or fascism our number one a mythic past a great mythic past to which the leader harkens back number two propaganda to others certain kinds of a fashion a fascist propaganda aware everything has inverted the news as the fake news uh\nAnti corruption is corruption ah so ah so three ah anti intellectualism of Steve Bannon said\nIt's a emotion rage gets people to the polls we got elected I lock her up and build a wall a Hitler in my income size you want your propaganda to appeal to the most to the least educated people\nNumber four unreality you have to smash truth so a reasoned gets replaced by conspiracy theories I first started writing got out of my academic shell and twenty eleven when I wrote a piece about birth or with them because I saw a conspiracy theories comic not so deeply concerning talked a sigh\nUnreality so you you you smash every smash truth so all that remains as loyalty a higher ... uh in fascist politics the dominant group ah\nIs ah is is better than everyone else they were they were like the loyal to the great people in the past who deserve respect just for being that the victim mode and fascism the dominant group or the greatest victims the men are the greatest victims of encroaching feminism\nOr whites are the greatest victims of blocks Germans or the greatest victims of Jews law and order one of the victims up their victims of the out group who are criminals what uh what kind of criminals are there the rapists sexual anxiety a pillar nine uh\nIs uh Saddam and Gomorrah the real value is come from the heartland of the people in the city or decadent and pillar tennis all by multiply\nI'll work shall make you free the out group as lazy they're not just criminals they're lazy and ... and social Darwinism it's all about winning so\nWell I Want to turn to one of the features of fascism and he liked Denis ... that are on reality at Trump or speaking earlier this year and he took aim at the media and duty has multiple times using a phrase that prompted comparison with George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen eighty four\nRemember what you're seeing and what you are reading is\nWhat's happening we have to make our country truly great again remember\nMake America great again\nAnd then and a half years call\nAmerica great so that's kind of thinking or near the here and just to say that George Orwell's line read\nThe pine she tells you to check the evidence of your eyes and and it was that final most essential command so can you talk about this particular feature of a fashion and if you see it in the U.S not to ...\nYeah you have Trump is very clear that\nUh that loyalty to him\nIs the only guy reality is of course the greatest threat to fascism because fascism is based on power and reality is a way of responding to power he said just false so you have to make everyone to destabilize knocked connected to the truth and you have to represent yourself\nAs reality and you have to show them you're stronger than reality 'cause fascism as much as ... and power\nYou are and the son of Holocaust survivors how does that way in to you or scholarly work and what you're seeing now and whether you believe you can talk about the United states and this way right now\nWell uh I remember when my when I talk to my father about being the son of a Holocaust survivor and he read me James Baldwin's Nineteen sixty eight peace uh\nUh the negro negroes or anti Semitic because they're anti white\nAnd he said and one of the lines in it he uh he was a was you think you're more connected to us because of our shared history of oppression were more angry at you because of our shared history of repression because we know you're a glass not to be us so because of my background is my mother worked in Manhattan criminal court for thirty three years\nI knew that the United states was replicating features of Nazi Germany and Eastern Europe with respect to its black population\nSo I was raised with an understanding of math math racialized mass incarceration I Lived through it I've met were still living through at nine percent of the world's prison population as black Americans so I've been continuous percent of the world's prison population comes from that tiny group of thirty eight million people\nOr if the nation of black America I if if the nature of black America whether its own country it should be the third largest nation on earth and that's an emergency so we came in we belong had this fake news directed against our black population\nAnd it's completely an surprising that someone came and said hey you're used to fake news being directed against this population let's just generalize and directed against everyone\nSo what are the antecedent to Trump in America and you say there are the ... we have about Seventy second seasons\nTo Trump our uh our while the KKK obviously the Nineteen thirties America be America\n[noise] post hurricane cleanup pass to release I'm In residence at the Florida Panhandle or cleaning up from hurricane Michael\nUh the way of the ... bird or if you are worried never Trump or and you are still and never Trump or in many respects\nYou may not a no longer be a Republican that seems to be the way you're pitching your books these days um but\nGive me your sense I mean was that the moment that ah when Susan Collins basically decided to re brand herself was that the moment that the party the Republican Party and Donald Trump\nSort of lost any daylight between them\n[noise] well that's what I thought I mean I had you know we'd watch this whole thing unfold of course everybody was riveted to the story of you know the cabinet hearing than than the FBI investigation which as you pointed out which you know sending a sham and\nAnd and I've got something else to say on that later that have had to do with the further ramifications of that particular um you know an arrangement that was made between the White House Republican Senate and the FBI\nAs far as Collins is concerned I think you know we we're all waiting there had been this sort of dance that was going on with Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski mansion and they were all speaking in corners and people were saying they were trading votes and making deals and what have you\nAnd this idea of the you know the quote never Trump or or maybe just call it you know the the independent moderates in the Republican Party\nThat they're still existed this sort of that last vestige of some kind of conscience and in the past and Lindsey Graham would have been one of those guys or you know John McCain or whatever Lindsey Graham turned into it you know a vicious poisonous reptile\nDuring this uh situation I mean he was out front and he was fully embrace thing\nTrump ism which is just a vicious he was attacking you know rape survivors in the hallway saying it should have called a cop you know I mean he was horrible absolutely awful and so but\nYou know that isn't coming for a while I don't think it was really surprising but seven cons particularly in the situation with it being an issue about rape survivors and\nYou know me too and women's rights which she was supposedly one of the last you know defenders and the Republican Party I think people were you know still sort of expecting something from her [noise]\nUm and that speech that she gave highly anticipated we all knew it was going to be the deciding vote was basically a sort of a moderate version of a Trump speech and she fully went\nWith Trump which is that she that's why I put it that she Gasland the nation because she portrayed Brett Kavanaugh\nCompletely the opposite of what he actually showed himself debate of the nation in that hearing that you and I talked about last time we were together here\nShe said he was a mild mannered thoughtful\nConscientious juror ah jurist and in fact you know we saw what he was he was a threatening ... schoolyard bully and she portrayed him as being the opposite of what we all had seen in other words she said you can believe me or you can believe your lying eyes\nAnd that is Trump that is the ultimate expression of Trump is on and for Susan Collins they put her out there she willingly in fact it seemed eagerly went out there said that the the protesters that had been protesting at the Senate went along with the entire Republican\nLine on that that they were all violent and it was an angry mob and you know and basically they were all women\nI shouldn't say oh and then there were plenty and then there too but it was led by women many of them rape survivors themselves who flew in to protest this and she's there Susan Collins a moderate protector women's rights calling them an angry mob\nSo she had ... I think that signal I think the final last gasp of the Republican establishment\nThat might have at some point stood up and said no to Donald Trump I think it's over it's done Susan Collins is now just the other side of the coin of Trump is I'm she's a woman she's slightly less um crude in her delivery but the message was exactly the same\n[noise] All right well you know I I I I I agree and I think and and I want to ask you is we're going to take a break your uh in in a moment but you know it occurs to me that\nI think this calculation was was I mean Susan Collins made a conscious decision as to how she was going to brand herself in this era and if there was any chance a within the Republican Party for there to be anyone other than someone who is like a a a sentence away\nFrom talking about pizza gate it strikes me and I I Want to\nPose this question to you will will have answered a when we return\nAnd also I Want to talk to you about that what you think the implications of the non vetting of Brett Kavanaugh will be in future or nominations but\nIt seems to me that with the death of John McCain a Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins made the decision that there is no longer a caucus within the Republican caucus where they can a brand themselves as reasonable moderates and reach across\nThe aisle types of both and they made their decision to basically joined the herd don't want to get your take on that in more when we return I'm Sam cedar this ring of fire radio will be right back with another part\n\nOf the money\n\nAnd we there's a sharp season for mayor Hulu original

Collins swan song as the suppose a modern now she's still out there trying to you know she was trying to for a couple of days are split the difference I sort of believe in blood before but I don't\nThink that she you know she has the right person which I have to say and I don't know why we didn't hear more about this at least to push back and people who are to interview her\nIt was before it was wrong about Brett Kavanaugh was report also has to be wrong about mark judge and also wrong about PJ and also wrong about her good friend and she must have been incredibly\nThe New York Yankees

the ... junior President Obama recently gave a speech where he addressed the issue of domestic surveillance and revelations that came forward last summer from whistle blower Edward Snowden\nThe president dodged the issue of whether or not these activities would continue indefinitely and Americans are left to wonder just how deep the surveillance on American citizens go and how much a threat\nIs is to our loved constitutional guarantees the bill of rights joining me now to talk about this is Daniel Ellsberg a former U.S military analyst let me ask you about what's\nHappening today is in your opinion is Edward Snowden I mean you're a hero to our generation huge change you know you ended the Vietnam War without you would\nNot have ended when it did which was you know they're all of this history of of government lies you change the way people felt about their government\nThey you know we know we grew up in a world where we couldn't believe that the United states government would lie to us all of a sudden you know you showed that this is terrible Web history of\nOf lies and and just in\nThe background for people don't know about this McNamara commissioned a report magma or who was always anti world though he escalated at McNamara commissioned the Pentagon and I think the RAND Corporation to\nDo a history of the war of how we had gotten into it to make sure it could never happen again and you were part of the team\nYou ever worked for Henry Kissinger you were this brilliant Harvard kid who had been to Vietnam or in the Marines was a warrior and came back from Vietnam and was a war hawk at one point it and now\nYou were looking at it and saying this is not what it was supposed to be but you were part of the group went through tens of thousands of documents and traced how we got into it one of those copies\nWas in the RAND Corporation save you got\nIt's off one night because the next minute minister Asian had dropped a lawsuit against a group of special forces and CIA\nTeam who murdered a South Vietnamese informant and dumped his body in the south China Sea and use that as I said from a I'm going to give this to the New York times and you\nUse Iraq's ... on a twenty eight volumes are what ... was and gave it to the New York times and that was the end and so you were you really Changed History and you're a hero\nDo you consider Edward Snowden or let's even broadening Julian Assange to be doing the same thing you are doing or is there a difference\nThere for a great similarities and the ... there are differences the difference is don't change my opinion at all\nThat Edward Snowden and before him Chelsea Manning and in a different role Julian Assange she lives for the public for sort of the role of the New York times\nRelative to the Pentagon papers you but it's not the source but he was medium for this at a skill at considerable risk ... so they are personal heroes of mind\nI think they're a Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden a great Americans only to science is not American which means he's not eligible to be a traitor but he was eligible to be called a traitor by everyone just as interesting late Snowden is being called a traitor by\nThe Australian prime minister actually ah that's a a son she has a whole makes Australia and for some reason they pronouncing and the foreign minister I pronounced dead wood Snowden as a traitor which is ridiculous I have no more than a traitor than I Am at I'm not\nA definitely and in the account you gave of this which could which is right in in general outlines but ah incorrect to certain things for example I worked for Henry Kissinger after the Pentagon papers after I worked in the Pentagon papers in the in the Nixon administration\nAnd job I was certainly not a war hero I was a a a civilian in Vietnam and I did use my marine training from some years earlier as a\nRifle platoon leader and rifle company commander or you've had experience to walk with troops without any danger in them\nIn combat and did see a fair amount of combat Troy sort of the war close up and if you had not had a big influence on me\nAnd I did work on the Pentagon papers another little correction you hear a beep Pentagon Papers you said we're any safer ground they were in my safe that very few people had top secret saved in their office\nI add rammed they had to go to the top secret control office for that they had only secret files\nI had was one of the few with a top secret shave and that was in part because I had been authorized to study the Pentagon papers I was one of actually the only researcher along with the president of the company who had access to the papers at that time now that's a very close analogy to\nShow them because uh what he gave was sub material he had access to\nAnd in effect authorized access because she said for contractors at Booz Allen working for the NSA\nOnce you are yeah and then you had the clearances which he had a an be authorized access to the systems\nThere were no rules so it was very little oversight from then on at that point he was a free and he said anyone in his position could've simply walked out the door for any reason\nUh uh with all that information and could have sold it for a very great price to a very foreign powers which again or any more than ... manning uh he did not do he gave it to the American people are without any recompense and at\nRisk of his life from then on\nAnd I'll tell you really why I just heard him say in a in an interview with German TV I was watching it last night which I recommend to people whether we're stuck up Snowden and in Germany from television on Google News and you'll find it [noise] and he said I Will never be fully out of danger\nHe says unless the systems totally change which is frankly very far off and I think that's true for the same reason that President Nixon actually brought a dozen Cuban CIA assets from the bay of pigs\nTo incapacitate me on the steps of the capital on may third Nineteen Seventy two a year into my trial and a year away from the ending of my trial for them to that he brought people up to incapacitate me and that had really nothing to do with what I had already revealed\nThe Howard do you think that was that was what\nHe has a trivial or afraid with him and there as they were afraid of me because I was afraid to me because of what they knew I knew that had not yet been revealed I mean these are just shut that up\nIt wasn't enough to put him on me on trial it will never be enough for them to put ... on trial and let him out on bail if he came back to this country I Do not believe it or you will be given a moment's\nFreedom he would be in ... in isolation like Chelsea Manning uh for the moment he arrived her nobody was captured or they kidnapped him\nAnd he never get out\nAnd could very well simply be killed they either kept in isolation or killed cause\nFirst of all there's a lot that hasn't come out yet that he has given to the newspapers but beyond that\nHe's made it clear that he chose what he gave to the newspapers is what he thought the public needed to know what should be public\nAny health held back and did not give to the newspapers or copy or bring tremendous amount of material that he felt would not sure we'll public interest to be put out to him to get used to sort of secret but uh they would never trust is\nA him on that or not to decide to put some of that on average from circumstances or put out stuff that should be out\nBut they didn't want out in the past and yet come out he'll never be safe from that Russia's probably is a safer place as you can find because it's one of the few countries uh with all the shortcomings skill that is willing to stand up to us on that and not simply hand him over and\nOther countries could agree with him politically were not willing to give him asylum he applied to practically every country in Europe\nI have one last question for you which is the corrosive impact of excesses corporate power on American democracy and American values and the end you know you saw as far back as a Vietnam are that\nAre in many ways our military and intelligence apparatus became\n... a ... a ... a servant up the mercantile and ... as a U.S corporations has that trend amplified overtime and how much of a problem do you think it is to our democracy\nYou know at the time when I was in the government\nAnd I was a U shaped no traffic but I was a an official a special ... secretary to friends and then a forward service officers your one highest cramping in the embassy in Saigon\nAnd I have to figure out what an earlier at the RAND Corporation as a consultant\nI wasn't really conscious at that time of corporate influence of the kind that Eisenhower had referred to the military industrial complex I didn't see that people when they thought a policy was mistaken as in Vietnam I didn't see it as a result of corporate influence in into the state that's a that's a complex question\nOn Vietnam what were the focus on that\nBut on a rack [laughter] that's not so hard to see the oil industry there was crucial to this day we have not learned\nThe make up a membership of\nVice president Cheney's taskforce on energy which was looking after the invasion of Iraq and partially out the oil fields fair to various corporations he refused to make public who had consulted with\nAnd I would presume that Obama could could tell us that could surely could find that out and put it out but he's offering that secrets somehow so we have a corporate influence there that is uh\nRelatively open and that is true in Iran to really you can go to ... ... it's always been a target but on the shore beach matter uh it's really just building I think we've done a lot to ...\nTo ... to ... ... collaboration makes them almost shame shame ... which was should we be colder corporate\n... a where um the there's really very little distinction between certain corporations like Charlotte accountable for which no work as a contractor and be and that's it with the telephone company\nDaniel Ellsberg is former U.S military analysts that's known

administration wants for how to penalize the Gulf kingdom without jeopardizing a big arms deal\nWhere's the cycles of us expansion is among all the way from wounded needle Iraq right and it stops along the way with World War one central America in Vietnam\nBut but you know the the themes that I think it captures are the things that that were initially captured in Nineteen eighty with people's history of the United states and and you start off really by by painting the picture of how dangerous it is for the American public or really any any nationality\nTo rely too much on this hero worship in on saviors that we were always looking for that said you're talking about that a little bit let's begin the discussion there\nYeah saviors it's very interesting 'cause we consider ourselves a democratic country and we think of totalitarian countries and dictatorships as places where there's some big father figure you know\nWhether it's Stalin or or you know some buddy I'm In this totalitarian country that you\nAre you defer to ... and here we are a democratic country and and yet we have grown up in a culture in which we are taught to revere or the founding fathers\nAnd we're taught to review the military heroes in our history has told through the president's you know the age of Jackson the age of Lincoln the age of Roosevelt and all\nOf the and uh it's it's ironic in a democracy you're not supposed to revere and have too much respect for the people who are running the country you're supposed to be active and engaged critical citizens\nSo so in in people's history and and again in in the\nPeople's history of American empire well there are heroes but they're not the usual heroes that is that you don't find theater Roosevelt warmonger as a hero you'll find theater Roosevelt man thinks you know war is the highest quality that human being\nCould have what we learn in high school right [laughter] yeah\nWe we have Mark Twain is Europe is Mark Twain spoke out against Theodore Roosevelt and denounced him for his Roosevelt had praised a military a massacre in the Philippines so yeah we have we we\nHave heroes but they're very different\nAnd they

we're listening to a conversation that we had with the late Howard Zinn from the early days of ring of fire\nIn his words there's important today if not more important than they were when he spoke those words several years ago\nHow would you weave the story very very well about how this the hero in the savior\nIs just kind of one of those controlling mechanisms that controls the population when a against rebellion I mean you know if if you think about it a rebellion has has has been pretty well suppressed by the American elite for a long time\nOr how how is how do you think\nOne percent of the nation owning about a third of the wealth in the country how has that they've been able to just say well you know that's a good deal for everybody and it works for everybody have they been able to hold back rebellion in in in a situation like that\nYeah that question I asked many times you know what is special about the United states that we've only had one revolution [laughter] way back\nI and I guess one there are several answers to that one\nIs that um because we have a semblance of democracy\nAs because we we have a semblance of representative government you know we have all the right institution as people vote and\nAnd and uh on paper you have checks and balances and you know on paper or the the president can be thwarted by Congress or or ruled out of order by the Supreme Court so\nWe have all the paper was just sort of democracy even though we don't have real democracy because these institutions don't really work for the people\nBut the paper democracy is good enough so that\nUh that is his wish of enough so that people growing up and ... and going to school and saying all looking on a blackboard and say look look we have checks and balances\nSo people are fooled into believing we have a democracy and therefore whatever happens happens if a democratic way I mean that's one reason why we have not had rebellion because we have political institutions\nThat that entice people into thinking they don't need that you I think the other answer is that this country is wealthy in a show that it can dispense enough good he used to be part of the population\nSo that you don't have you know eighty percent angry poor people you have thirty percent poor people and then you have another ... percent who are not really poor and who I just well off\nEnough to think that they are doing well in this system none of which we have a kind of\nA fairly contented middle class which doesn't see revolution as necessary and therefore which except the idea of the reality a of a small elites are taking most of the well for the country\nUh and and uh and the rest of the people sort of paying obey instead of small elite\n... talking with Howard Zinn A People's history of

Johnson warned us about before his death\nYou know showers it out of being the author Seventeen books it's hard to choose any one that ah without that I Would say is just really my favorite but nemesis if it's money good stuff\nWell it probably would be mine to really really that\nThe one I've been working on hardest\nWell it's just excellent so let me get right to the heart of it OK okay first of all if you were to describe why we maybe are that empire it's on its way towards ruin you have a list of things that I think is yes it is just extremely interest I Want to go down the list and\nWhy don't you feel them in as we go okay All right you're talking about the idea that we have a government that's driving the nation to tyranny and ruin I mean that's that's the premise\nAnd then you say these are the reasons why let's go down the list ... very compelling argument that you have here so first of all a nation with no outside threats\n... her mentally at war fill that in a little bit\nWell it is to say our commitment probably never formal rather earth wild but our commitment to imperialism and militarism\nA puts us in to the fix of all empires sense of that of a of the Roman republic\nUh we uh we face what are the greatest dilemmas Eddie ... history namely a domestic democracy at a foreign empire history tells us you can have one you can have the other but you can't have\nI'll get the most secretive intrusive and repressive government in our history and a president who he describes a serial liar that all of our all of our listeners would agree with that in a little bit ... well I think\nThere's just no question that it it it's still hard to understand says we presume that George Bush is a is it American and was educated Americans schools and that he went to Yale University into Harvard law school at a few others such things he doesn't seem to have ever heard\nThe ah the least obvious elements in the constitution the separation of powers the fact that they are our most important defense against tyranny and dictatorship\nOr that the this is a a a work of genius above all by a by ideas Madison\nBut by many others and that he has systematically subverted ... with ideas that are there isn't a constitutional scholar in the country who would agree with the possible exception of it apparently insane lawyer sitting\nAt the University of California Berkeley Law school daily Jay Z oh\nRight right right and as ... but this is a president that would suggest that he's smarter than the frame or so so we know where that goes okay\nThis is the unprecedented wealth disparity that takes place where you have a corporate power\nThat has really in a sense created that disparity and you you in your book he just again every\nEvery one of these once you do such a great job running a matter of fact but you're talking about brand dies and he says this we we all know Supreme Court justice Brennan said that we can either have democracy in this country we can have a great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we can't have both\nHow does it feel that in as far as your theory that we are driving ourselves towards ruin\nWell it's a matter of just open the newspaper I mean the crises are on us every day we're the one of the few advanced democracies on earth that doesn't provide health care for all the population\nAre any number of people including personal friends of mine a live without health insurance they simply decided that it doesn't fit into their uh their budget anymore uh the uh we have a a a fuel crisis that's a\nDriving our economy into a potential bankruptcy\nA standing behind all of this is not to say we don't have the money we do have the money but we're wasting it in the most profit possible way on foreign wars on military equipment\nThat we don't need that in fact we don't even think work we don't care whether it works or not most of this is being spent as a jobs program that the military industrial complex has become\nA ... a intrinsic part of our economy these\nDay well I Want to get to that and I want to talk about that but but I Want to stop this when you talked about it in order as we drive ourselves towards this abysmal end you did you really do equate to a Ukraine equate to other civilizations roamed the Greeks are\nThe Soviet Union Japan I mean I could go on with that but it is really really examine yeah but so so but one thing that you say as you say that\n... if you look at all of those failures that one thing that you had was the fact a one party state\nWith two wings and I'm president claiming almost exclusive executive power were they ignored the rule of law you saw that playing itself out in other in other empires that had held\nNo question a now granted it's there's nothing determinist think about this or that or you can wake up and do the right thing the example I use in my book nemesis is the British Empire at the end of World War two\nIt didn't do it well it did it did we stop the matter there were many ... throwback later but the British understood that you couldn't continue to use Nazi methods holding together the British Empire\nThey they said they used to some extent showers they save themselves and they\nThey did exactly I mean I agree there on an island in or a comment and the origins of the ... and then this is one of the great achievements of Britain and even of Europe that they recognized\nThey had to choose you either we're going to keep India and keep it ... under military power is the recognition that imperialism is it\nPure form of charity okay so our rules by by consent\nSo also in this list as we take ourselves to this thing that should be a wakeup call to any but by the way for somebody to think that they really understand where we are in in in the world today and not have read your book nemesis I I think it's a huge mistake well I mean it really is such a great\nA great road map but one of those things in your road map you say that when we look at empires that have that have taken themselves to this abysmal end there's always been the absence of checks and balances and separation of powers or you've had this reckless no restraint kind of boy him for a messianic message that flows from leadership\nIs really hard to believe that George Bush didn't want advice on what he was doing\nThat he didn't care to pay attention to the city didn't I don't mean that even listen to his enemies didn't listen to his friends I mean\nRent Scowcroft was telling it some time ago as and a and a former secretary of state Baker that you're heading over the cliff\nMhm mhm well one thing you at in there and your list and there's so many things are just I mean there's just almost completely on point it's almost like Brits analysis of fascism delays in that point by point since here's what's happening\nBut one thing that you add here is you say the dominant corporate controlled media is something that will take you to that abysmal and where you have the glorifying ... just propaganda the glorifying of imperial one let's\nMake ourselves absolutely clear on this the first amendment to the constitution which guarantees freedom of press was not written to protect people magazine\nIt was one of the people who wrote\nThat what they had they didn't give a damn about anything like people magazine or any other ... popular literature ... the idea was to empower the press to penetrate\nThe ah the greatest defense of a state bureaucracy which is secrecy the purpose of the free press is to try and get behind the facade of government the ... the lying that has become now almost second nature to any high ranking military officer\nAsked idiot but what he does he simply live or to get behind it and publish publicize it instead overtime or as a result of propaganda money", "show_name": "The Best of Stephanie Miller", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "13"}
