number of prominent Democrats all critics of President Trump\nThe targets identified include a President Obama and Michelle Obama\nA former secretary of State Hillary Clinton and George Soros the billionaire liberal philanthropists former attorney general Eric Holder Congress member Maxine Waters and former CIA director John Brennan\nThe suspected bomb packages I'm\nLifted democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz says the return address in some cases police are also investigating a suspicious package sent to former vice president Joe Biden and a suspicious package found today at actor Robert Deniro Z restaurant in New York\nOn Wednesday CNN was forced to evacuate it's New York offices after receive what police described as a live explosive device along with a container of white powder\nIt came in a package and dress to John Brennan all of the targets have been vilified by President Trump in the past authorities said it remains unclear if the bomb devices were offer bombs or designed to look like bombs no one's been hurt by the devices this all comes less than two weeks before the midterm elections\nOn Wednesday afternoon President Trump described the attempted bombing as close despicable acts but later at a campaign rally in Wisconsin called on the media to stop what he called its and less hostility\nFar larger virtual offered to rejoice divides and bring people together\nThe media also has a responsibility to stop the endless sue the constants negative and oftentimes false attacks insurers have to do\nThe Wisconsin rally President Trump did not name any of the Democrats\nTo incite violence that had various a dance group publicly documented their attacks as a recruitment tool\nEarlier this month for other members of the rise above movement were indicted on riot charges so\nAt the same time we're seeing one after another suspected pipe bomb on being sent off to a leading Trump critics um we are hearing about this arrest here in California um talk about who Robert ...\nWell run does not from California originally from uh New York actually um grew up in in the city and uh\nHis uh you know history does involve a history of violence he spent several years in prison out in New York for a stabbing incident that he'll edges was a form of self defense was\nTargeting a ledge members of the Thirteen gang but it did involve a him and or at least one other person attacking this in an individual and that are run to actually stabbing the person's several times\nUm he made his way after getting out of prison out out to the west coast and ultimately settled down in San Clemente a in South Orange County and um\nHe and several other folks from from this area for them to rise above a couple of years ago at him in part as a result of their presence at rallies where they kind of formed this identity of being kind of the street fighter type folks that were going to defend\nPeople's rights to free speech uh they they're a group that really a has focused on the idea of of training physical training they do a lot of them a training they they were actually just completed a European Tour where they\nMet with far right extremists across Europe including Russia with a leading and them a neo Nazi group called a white rex\nUm they do a lot of cross training so they really promote this idea of healthy lifestyle and that they're kind of a opposed to this kind of contemporary decadent culture and lifestyle that's being promoted by\nKind of multiculturalism so they're very Xena phobic an anti immigration or they have links to a much older white supremacist groups like the hammer skin nation which has been one of the largest neo Nazi skinhead groups across the globe since the late eighties\nSo uh they're definitely part of this you know longer traditions of white supremacist group that has a long history here in orange county\nA speaking at the White House on Wednesday at President Trump um ah oh I Want to turn to a video I'm a that comes from frontline\nI'm at a video that describes\nWhat really what we're talking about\nThe new generation of white supremacist are pushing their politics into the mainstream Rob\nRuined do seem to be part of that trend\nGroups first public appearance wasn't at a torch march\nWithin Huntington Beach pro Trump rally behind the banner that read\nOne member of also attacked\nA journalist with orange county's alternative weekly paper at the time did\nYou know that this was a group or who did this or or what was going on no I definitely saw their organized they stuck as a group you know the also the banner one and I we got back to the office and I started talking to Gustavo about everything you start having to go out and look for everybody there who who was attacking people\nThat are going to hashtags like hashtags mega march of last few yeah right there so sort of like this was this him hitting you is that or is that later this is right after he had just hit me when I clicked on his name it took me to his profile and you look at his pictures their ... and you say oh that's the due to attack me there you go\nThat's an excerpt in the race and PBS Frontline documentary title documenting hate Charlottesville the clip began with A.C Thompson of ProPublica who helped expel a rise above move than ten we were just listening tests\n... and a reporter with the ah Orange County alternative weekly paper talk more about that\nYeah um so you know this is a you know the the the ... the investigative wars the ProPublica has done a exposing a rise above than in others as well it's been extremely important in terms of trying to shut a light that otherwise seems to have been\nKind of ignored to to a large extent which is you know a big part of the problem that my German was discussing earlier I'm just a few moments ago\nAnd I also want to mention something if you look at rise above and they're a propaganda they they have been a pretty adept at creating a glossy videos that show them training and doing graffiti and and and then also having clips of some of their physical violence at some of these rallies\nThey are very clear about identifying themselves as a nationalist\nAnd so it's an interesting point that President Trump or just a couple of days ago at the at a rally in Texas made a point to the dental find yourself as a national lessons so I think just as important to underscore the lot of these groups like rise above they don't call themselves neo Nazis or white supremacist they called themselves nationalist oftentimes\nThey call themselves nationally that very interesting that you should say that considering just this week I'm at a at the Houston rally at President Trump is holding these campaign rallies across the country he called himself a national yeah\nYeah I mean it's it's for folks like rise above that's music to their ears because that word means a lot to them\nAnd they really see that as an important in a way of defining themselves or they can be potentially more palatable to a larger percentage of of the population especially a white Americans who won't\nBe as likely to be turned off by press it's a term like neo Nazi where you have folks it might be a little bit intimidated by that term so groups like rise above are very very adept at using a turn like national because it is very meaningful within their culture\nMy German would you care to expand on that also in New York\nUh we've been showing this video of the Proud Boys\nOn a the Proud Boys are a number of them were arrested by New York police after they basically rioted and assaulted people\nOutside the metropolitan Republican club where their leader was inside speaking five of the nine members of this far right groups Proud Boys arrested on rioting and assault charges and\nThe rest followed the October twelfth street attack and like she doesn't have members of the group were caught on camera\nPhysically assaulted anti fascist protesters after attending a talk by their leader gathering the Guinness I mean it's quite amazing Gavin again is speaking at the metropolitan ... public and club [noise] can you comment on that\nIt is troubling and you know one of the things to understand is how is the word ... governments gain power and one of the things that they have done in history is sanction street dogs to go out and commit political violence and when people get upset at that\nUh what you see is then legislation designed to prevent protests and of course we've already seen that number of state legislatures and regulations being promulgated\nA in Washington DC they would uh shut down some of the protest in front of the White House and elsewhere are and the national parks so you know this is a very troubling trend and the fact that you have the president's states identifying with these groups much like we saw right after Charlottesville\nWhere a comment about very find people on both sides\nOf this conflict or it again gives these groups sanctions and I give credit to the FBI for finally arresting these people but it was a year after ...\nPublished an article that basically laid out who these people were I tend to be for a free speech purist and this isn't about free speech and these are people who had long criminal records who who forecast that they were going to these protests to commit violence\nCommitted violence often filmed the violence and use that to recruit people for the next protests were there and they work out they were going to go commit violence and the fact that they were traveling interstate should have been something that it was tracked by the FBI in real time\nNot here a year plus later after frontline\nOr basically put the whole thing on on national television\nI mean amazing thing progress writes McGinnis says lecture metropolitan Republican club\nWas about a tie a yellow Gucci who in self with a number of an extremist right wing growth in Japan and Nineteen sixty I'm a Gucci stab Japan's socialist party leader ... afternoon to death\nAnd he's been celebrated as a hero extreme nationalist groups after leaving the event the Guinness ... waving a ton of blade like the one used to kill a new law might turn\nRight exactly and again when you have people that are Doherty promoting this kind of a\nPolitical or\nA ... a ... I think that is more than just a week to these groups that is an actual sanctioning that allows them to take okay the the government is on my side and when you don't see a a rap in real time police response\nThat then confirms that for them and the trouble is this has been going on for for roughly two years now so these groups are are are have\nTo talk about the growing Vietnamese American community I mean it's the largest net in a nice community outside of Vietnam is that\nRight yeah little Saigon around Westminster garden grove son Donna up but it and it's interesting how these politics these a demographic Baltics play on an Orange County because the Vietnamese community is still resolutely Republican there are a couple of Democrats out when we talk about Republican we're talking about Donald Trump supporting flaming right\nWing whack job Republicans and so the running for city council there's a lot of attention being put the oh twenty eight of them are running this year and Thirteen of them have the same last name when he ha ha ha come on like the ... most of these drugs Vietnamese are running their worthless\nPoliticians ... I'm so let's turn to San Diego um can you talk about Republican Duncan Hunter\nA running against him are kept button a jar the Mexican Palestinian America of a very significant race um I mean Duncan Hunter on is the person who I think he was the second Congress member to endorse President Trump\nOn he and his wife were indicted in August ... two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in campaign funds on trips to Hawaii Italy and like ...\nTotal or other strapped again personal expenses including spending six hundred dollars to fly as family pet rabbit across the country hunters responded by blaming his wife I'm\nDuncan Hunter was the second Congress member to endorse Trump the first New York Congressman Chris Collins has also been indicted on I Want to go to a campaign ad produced by Duncan Hunter attacking his Democratic opponent mark happened after\n... hours working to treat these three different names to I mean we started the jury room masterminded the musical my father served as on\nMars you lose your support\nFor the\n\nWe can't ignore Duncan Hunter and I approve this message\nAnd this is a mark camp and a jar responding to this ad on MSNBC\nHonestly what are we doing as a nation we have policies we have things we could talk about this is a deeply on America that and I feel like John McCain if you were with us today would be So Paul do remember he stood up against a woman who tried to disparage President Obama all same line of argument\nAnd I think the party of McCain's party of Reagan even as long gone and it's heartbreaking because I have friends who are Republican with an American it's not true I'm a security threat that was given a clear as we are but security's ... Duncan Hunter who\nWas a criminal indicted for spending a quarter million dollars and the corruption smoking gun when you talked about with only paid\nSixty thousand dollars he is guilty it's only a matter of time into people hold him accountable\nThat's a ... I'm ...\nI Love it it's a very American out are you kidding me demonizing it's being scared about Palestinians and Mexicans this is like the Republican nightmare\nCome to live I Love it unfortunately ... district San Diego it's basically like orange county's Nineteen seventies\nFilled with a bunch of Robin right wing lunatics kind of so I think Duncan Hunter is going to win who cares if he's indicted ... Republicans don't care if their candidates are indicted the Republicans and then the ... the Democrat just for being Democrats\nThey're evil and if you're Mexican on top of that you're even more evil than Palestinian like they can they can pin that he's moslem anymore because he's Christian he converted to Christianity so it's a nightmare a cat it I think he's a future of the Democrats and I think that'd be a wonderful thing if you the future\nAnd find a comment and you'd like to make for people who are watching this around the country the possibility that the house could turn based\nOn the racist here the fact that we're having this conversation itself it's historic no one ever thought that Orange County would even be close to purple I Would say at the the ... the weekly the paper that I used to it and we were the profits we've been calling this for a long time\nBecause it's still an imperfect revolution so my hope with the Democrats learn what's good and instead of a supporting corporate is Democrats slip through the good Democrats\n... well I Want to thank the story I Know for being with us calling us for the LA Times he's the former editor of O'Shea weekly he resigned from

says\nOpposition ten simply were stores control over the ability to solve the housing crisis to local communities it would allow local communities to pass stronger rent control laws that will cover more unit\nSo what\nAre the ... say the ... say that we're down however those are poles of likely voters\nAnd we are also making great progress in the last two weeks we went from thirty eight percent support to forty one percent support\nWhat's happening is this barrage of negative and false advertising targeting homeowners telling them that they are going to lose a the value of their home when the proposition does not affect\nSingle family homeowners\nA there is not a single jurisdiction that has ever imposed control on single family homes\nAre and they're also targeting seniors saying that the proposition will make the housing crisis worse because it will deter development\nThere has been rent control in Santa Monica Beverley hills San Francisco cities that have had if I can tell since the seventies have had ... development developers will develop and every single local law\nI'm exams new construction\nI I think what voters need to know what they need to be told us to follow the

what their multi billion dollar profits are if they are able to have uncontrolled went\nSo I'm no campaign is funded by the very people that brought us the housing affordability crisis in LA city an average five percent rent to increase but two thousand people on the street to we need to get this problem under control prop ... is the first step to do that\nFollow the money and vote yes on ten

office ah there was a reports of one and ... and so on and\nYou know to the extent that we know about these things that's almost secondary to the way that the reaction to it and\nTwo how unpredictable something like this was\nWell yeah I mean you know this that the list of targets of this could have been just lifted from any Donald Trump rally right I mean these these names that were that you know it was Hillary Clinton I think Maxine Waters\nWas born in waters yes um you know and Andrew Cuomo\nWas was one of them I mean these were all these are all people that Donald Trump obviously targets you know and gives them nicknames and everything else\nUm and and so you know clearly someone had a method here and the rights ... ... ... you know immediate reaction to this and it was just instant said they are they're so steeped in conspiracy theory I think was it this is a false flag\nUm that it was you know done by I don't know some nefarious group or person to try and affect the midterms which is telling isn't it because you know the idea that they would affect the midterms tells you that they were concerned about that right that\nThat these people being targeted for political violence and of course it comes on the heels of two things one is this ongoing [noise] you know a\nThird a mean that they have a about left wing mobs that are just you know running rampant through the streets or in the country\nAnd then also that the Democrats had paid for this caravan and Mexico and were somehow behind that Trump says that over and over again in his rallies so you know this idea that somehow or another the Democrats are doing all this stuff to try and win an election\nUh I think we can pretty well see where that's going because if the Democrats do when it will be because they ginned up all this stuff to win an election I mean this sort of reaction coming from them and I can guarantee that no matter what happens with the with the investigation into the bombings um\nIt it it you know the the right is going to say that it was a deep state conspiracy if it turns out to be a right wing\nAssailant because that's how you know they they now have a a method as sort of covering themselves no matter what happens right or left wing or or it's a deep state FBI conspiracy to uh you know to a\nA unfairly tag on the right wing so you know they have this thing all coming and going but I was astonished at how quickly and how\nYou know viciously they kind of came out I mean I even in the worst sort of\nYou know um terrorist bombings or terrorist attacks that you find with you know where they're all immediately rushing to the assumption that it was Muslims this even seemed worse than that I mean this seemed like it was just I mean it was I guess maybe it was defensiveness that made them do it but uh it was bizarre and of course the president\nWho didn't bother you know he usually he tweets about you know practically everything he had nothing to say oh he had to say on Twitter was you know I wholeheartedly agree to what's something that Mike Pence said you know some thoughts and prayers message\nAnd then he had at an event in the White House where they sent out you know it was about the opioid crisis millennia came out said a couple of words and then talked about the opioid crisis than Trump came out and basically practically fell asleep while he was trying to say that you know we need unity\nAnd this is a bipartisan thing and then just dropped it and went on to his ah prepared speech I mean he really didn't care and I mean I can only imagine what was going through his head when he saw this I mean he's probably glad actually to see the bomb threats I I'm assuming he's you know actually for it\nI I mean I think I think he probably though um has some awareness that this cuts against and I think this is why there was such a strong defense in his I think you you hit the\nNail on the head there was this is um\nInterfering with the narrative that they were trying to build right I mean let's look at this week they have been trying to build this narrative that are like you said the bears this caravan we're going to talk about that later in the program\nThis a caravan of people that could not be less threatening to the United states I mean I'm than you know a\nA small rainstorm or the you know off the coast of ah of I don't know it would be way\nOut in the Pacific in terms of in terms of a a threat to the country but just I mean to your point about their attempts\nTo to\nAh you know elongate because it's been going on now for a couple of weeks this notion of the Democratic mob right and the the protesters and everyone is anti ...\nOr antifa and um\nBecause and and and they were quite successful is still making like this notion that there is this for off the a left wing mob so much so that had not to even the Proud Boys off of the the radar and we talked about the Proud Boys on this program last week but\nWhen we come back I Want to just a recount\nWhat we saw on Fox News which to me captured that moment I'm perfectly it was really really stunning\nBut it I think it explains why the right responded with all these conspiracy theories that somehow this was a false flag a they clearly know\nIt makes their rhetoric and they're posturing and um it it brings it to life in a way that you know the crystallize is\nWhat has been going on in this country for some time um but I think their reaction was even double the worst because of where they were trying to go with their narrative we've got to take a quick break we'll be right back Sam's street a ring of fire radio talk to the great Heather pardon or ... [noise]\nKnow [noise]\n\nThis is better convey thirst and host of fit I hurt radio podcast with twenty ... listening in and I chat with brothers Darren ... of the band computer game and New York times

perspective I'm like oh cousins [noise]\nBack during a fire radio I'm Sam cedar here with Heather dignity Barton from salon so Heather when we broke we were talking about\nThe of course you know the the attempted and this is what they were I mean someone someone referred to this I think it was Jeff Flake actually as a threat these were not threats these were attempted\nBombings tempted maiming or murder I mean by sending these pipe bombs essentially or some other type of a you know explosive device or through the mail in some instances in some instances I think they may have been dropped off a clear um\nBut I Would I alluded to a moment on Fox News\nThat really summed up why the right was so angry about this happening that word angry because they were upset that their country\nHas a descended you know a into this type of violence they weren't upset because the ah these weapons were all targeting\nAll this week in Nineteen Seventy six Led Zeppelin who voted TV appearances because it sounds problems appear on American television for the first time when they played Don ... rock concert they performed black dog and dazed and confused and this week in the year two thousand George

AJ Jay Gould about how we're all family like it or not the\nWay that I had to find a family\nYou know we are surrounded by people in our lives that we consider cousins and close close loved ones that are closer to us\nWelcome back during the fire radio I'm Sam cedar last week a new report came out that talked about a right wing training academy directed at conservative legal folks has a way of pushing the judiciary to the right here to discuss investigative journalist David day and\nSo David this is\nYour story about this corporate funded judicial boot camp and its impact on the federal judiciary is particularly important in light of the fact that when we look back\nOn that at least the first two years of the Trump Administration and Republican controlled the Senate and the house\nThere's very few accomplishments that have any durability I mean we do see a massive tax cuts for corporations and if Democrats handled that properly they will be able to roll that back and use that money for programs that many of us like\nBut the single most durable\nImpact of the Trump Administration and this total Republican rule\nHas been the installation of a record number of federal judges not just on the Supreme Court we've seen two already seeded\nBut federal judges that the circuit and an appellate levels we see a domination of of right wing judges and now we know like I guess the machine that pumps them out\nYeah so I mean the peace in the paper that I wrote about his historical\nNature this is about a program that started way back in Nineteen Seventy six and continued to Nineteen Ninety nine\nBut recent reporting has shown that there's an attempt to influence law clerks at the Heritage Foundation puts together a training academy\nThere are other uh less report it on a retreat some ... and things of that nature that you know it is clear intent of indoctrinated federal ... there's a whole apparatus you know the federal federal ... society which uh Sikhs outlaw students\nYou know it's a very very early stages of their career and and puts them in the high profile jobs and works to get them onto the federal bench\nA there's a whole apparatus on the right and and what I wrote about in this piece is really one of the more embryonic versions of that is something that happened in the seventies and eighties that really had this amazingly\nPowerful and robust effect\nOn changing attitudes within the federal judiciary\n[noise] All right well let's let's let's go through this it starts in Nineteen Seventy six what is the impetus I mean where what is it about this era I guess that created some awareness on the right any ways that the debt that we should be playing some type of long game here\nSo I mean this is the era of of what is known as the Powell memo where uh Lewis Powell who was who eventually became a Supreme Court justice but at the time was a lawyer\nOr wrote that businesses need to sort of get into the game of politics in a more a focused way that they were losing out to the likes of of Ralph Nader\nIn terms of influencing politics\nOr and this can be seen as part of that there was a movement a called the law and economics movement which attempted to apply economic principles to the law to to the uh the various\nWays in which a judge's go about understanding or various uh parts of the law including criminal law a family law a regulation all sorts of things\nAnd the lawn economic center which was very much a funded by corporations a hundred and five ... according to a contemporary accounts\nI could on this two to three weeks seminar\nFor federal judges they did it down in plantation island Florida it was a resort area\nThey drink a lot of wind they it was it was seen as as something that was you know a a a pleasurable trip in some senses but also a very intensive almost like a semester\nLong seminar and economics plugged into it to the ... period\nAnd it was for federal judges\nSo judges who are you know wanted to understand more about economics and how they may be apply that within their cases there of course their case work their career\nCould could get it there and and and at that time or the theory that the law and economics movements are put forward is that\nUh there is no structure underlying the decision making that ah that\nIs made in the judiciary\nThat there there are no sort of formal ways to kiss tickle analysis to look at whether there is discrimination whether there is a proof of law whatever it is\nAnd uh they set about to to change that and the the the seminar was billed as very much a non partisan sort of objective look at at here's some tools you can use you judges or to to to make sense of the law\nHowever was put together by a guy named Henry nanny who is a conservative\nOr there were liberal economist that that gave lectures as part of the series but they were confined to certain segments of of of the discussion and conservatives were were very much in the forefront when a certain large subjects came up\nManny controlled the curriculum he he knew exactly what he was doing and he while he sort of presented it and objective manner it\nBe clear intent of this was to indoctrinate federal judges in in conservative views business friendly views of the law and by Nineteen Ninety over forty percent of all federal judges took this seminar\nSo this is very very widespread a uh a lot of the people who were deciding these cases with taking these classes are and ah what this paper then then wanted to look at is what effective is how\nOur and before we get into that like I I also want to just a touch on this this notion that these seminars\nJust simply by defining the arena by co mingling the notion of economics in economics itself as as a as a discipline in a profession has its own ideology that is baked into it right of course\nAh but the idea of applying cost benefit analysis and economic efficiency um\nEat almost I mean I guess I'm back when I was in school the one of the things that um you you have you did anything in the social science is the first thing as you advanced um ah through the years was the professors would tell you you need to find the underlying assumptions\nOf any endeavor and once you do everything after that follows fairly predictably and if and if you sit there and trained people that the law is an assessment of cost benefit analysis in economic efficiency\nUm and those are the prominent um ah I guess a elements that you must follow then then what follows after that becomes fairly hum a standardized right I mean I think that's\nRight and and you know when you are talking about uh\nTo a rule uh to like set the terms of prison sentences they were kind of a under mandatory sentencing guidelines before then and after two thousand five you see the judges who took the seminar it shoot up in terms of because law and economics at this concept of deterrence that uh you know sort of\nArgued towards harsher criminals\nAre and then the really amazing\nFinding was that because circuit court judges are typically I'm Ree judge panels right uh there there's there's sort of a random panel of appellate judges that your cases which means that judges who took the seminar would come into contact\nWith judges who didn't they'd be on the same panel and they look at what would happen after those the the judge that was not that never took the seminar was on a panel with someone who was\nAnd they they actually looked at all linguistic analysis and looked at the language that they started to use after being on that panel\nAnd they found that the judges who didn't take a seminar started using more lawn economics related language in their rulings after being on a panel so it it didn't matter if they took a course they're not just coming into contact\nWith someone who took a course would make them more inclined to this law and economics framework of the judiciary it's really incredible\nWell you know the question my follow up question to that is one that I'm curious if that if that effect also took place with lawyers that come in front of them and if that affect didn't spread to a institutions legal institutions that would study these cases\n[noise] well I mean I think here's what we know\nWhat we know is that around the time the law and economics movement\nComes into place that we get more conservative frameworks more generally around the biggest uh seems an ideas in in traditional cases particularly around anti trust what you mentioned before the break\nSo uh the law and economics movement is the primary kind of driver\nOf this idea that in anti trust what's what's worrisome is not whether a company gets really really big\nBut whether they are uh have insufficient consumer welfare that that's the only thing that matters of consider prices are low a company can get big and that's economically efficient for everybody involved and law and economics really drove that right\nTo the extent that that is sort of ... facto\nStandard that we have in cases and that affected lawyers that affected uh the the the academia or around a anti trust it affected the agencies the a Justice Department in terms of how they they litigate each case\nSo uh that's a good example for seeing how this one movement that\nReally focus very hard on changing the ideas around the law ... was able to do it\nEvery day in a fascinating piece a fascinating topic thanks so much for sharing sharing it with us\nAll right thanks a lot David ... is a contributor to the intercept also

people dead as a hate crime\nYou know I don't know it's ... it's very tough because you know this is just rank racism let's just face what's happening here that's a bunch of brown people\nAnd even if you look at the at the at the pictures you're ... you're not seeing a group of hard and you know criminals or or an army you're seeing a bunch of women and children older people you know single men kind of you know walking with a with a pack over their back I mean it's it's not one kid on their shoulders a kid\nOn their shoulders right and and you know carrying a wheelbarrow or something I mean these are people\nWho work quite clearly and threatening any way as a group are as individuals I mean this is a bunch of Central American\nYou know folks who are you know you don't take on a thousand miles walk unless you're pretty desperate I mean these people are not doing this for no reason but it's that sight of that and that this is what got Trump so excited over this was when they saw the caravan take place\nThey realize that they were going to have pictures of brown people in a group\nAnd and Trump even went out of his way to say look look what did you see the pictures down at the border and kind of assuming that if people were too stupid to know that it was actually the Mexico Guatemalan border right and and not the American you know the U.S Mexico border\nAnd and there was all this you know there are people in a crowd and there was military there the Mexican military was there and he was so excited because I really think he thought the Mexican military was going to shoot in the crowd\nBecause that would be the only way to stop this right I mean is that these people were coming over in various ways and across the border and the Mexicans weren't going to do that but and he ended up being very disappointed but this is the idea of this you know there's a mass of brown people coming and this woman that you mentioned in the New York times article I mean she's in what was that Michigan\nI mean it's hard to fear from you know French Canadians coming than than any of these people from Central America I mean they're walking but they're not going to walk as far\nUm so you know this this this ... this was just playing right into their hands and and you know it just\nI don't think I Need to um you know go too far into this but I'm sure you'll you'll agree with me that the media played into that I mean the New York times had front pages three days in a row with pictures of this big caravan a you know Trump had to love that\nNot and it's not a front page story it really is not first of all as you point out their thousand miles away second of all even if they do reach the border and many of them will fall off by the way these caravans have happened before in people's ... ended up staying in Mexico others ended up\nGoing back I mean there's ... there's never this group that state sticks together the whole time but when this group comes to the border here's what they do they turn themselves in because they're applying for refugee status right turn themselves and there's no battle\nThere's no fight there is no nothing and then you know they are cleared or not for for ah\nFor for some kind of a silent and you know they they take an asylum claim I mean there's nothing violent or invasive without any of it there and they aren't doing anything illegal by the way I mean if you come and turn yourself in at the U.S border and say I want to apply for refugee status that's the line now Trump knows that and he's\nSaying we have changed a lot\nWe have to say that as US law and international law right and wrong so these people are not in the ah ... ah that is used illegal they're not even undocumented immigrants they are refugees sneakers and then they get disposed\nOr disposed of their cases get disposed of in one fashion or another some are are very few\nFrankly a will mean if if um if past performance is indicative will receive a status\nUm you know extended status others will be basically told you got to leave now and so that this was all completely manufactured and when we when we come back to I Want to like get a sense of\nLike how how the media should address is I mean clearly the New York times has no reason\nTo put pictures of the caravan on for three days in a row\nBut let's talk affirmatively like how should they deal with these type of life we have the same thing will talk about this do return this idea of a second round of tax cuts there's not even remotely close to that any more so than you know I'm going to announce that the next incidentally next\nLottery I'm winning a billion dollars [laughter] like the ... those two statements have almost the identical um uh validity or we could break

Chris of the ...\n\n[noise]\nWelcome back during the fire radio I'm Sam cedar this week the law firm of eleven pap Antonio was awarded a Nineteen million dollar verdict in a case against UPS for defrauding clients in Puerto Rico or making billions of fees\nHere to discuss the case in how you BS was selling bad bonds that journey Michael ... from Lebanon pap Antonio so Mike\nBefore we um we talk about how this was litigated give us a sense\nOf ... just the context\nIn which I'm this a claim moved forward\n[noise] yes uh salmon the thanks for having me on but uh this all related to the Puerto Rico a bond market which in twenty Thirteen suffered a began to suffer a collapse and a related specifically to a couple of types of products that were\nSold by a firms down in Puerto Rico and even some firms on the mainland but specifically in this case\nA it was UPS or who had under wrote bonds under wrote literally billions and billions and billions of dollars\nOf these bonds and encourage\nPublic entities public corporations down in Puerto Rico to continue issuing these bonds at a danger afraid and more specifically beyond the bonds a lot of proprietary products in these came in the form of closed and funds which really served as a rapper\nUnder which UPS could wrap up the bonds that are under wrote into a product that then sold to regular retirees regular mom and pop investors and it sold them by the boatloads by the truckloads of back them up and sold them to\nAnyone and everyone their retirees people with very small network of people with large networks it was a a profit center for them and they sold these bonds and these funds are for years and made a lot of money doing so but then in twenty Thirteen and\nIn twenty Fifteen sixteen as Puerto Rico's situation deteriorated\nUh these funds and the bond suffered significant losses and folks who had ah the retirement assets invested in these types of risky products or suffered huge I mean just terrible losses\nOkay I I Need you to go or we're going to back up just a little bit here so I mean clearly what we're talking about some measure of a you know a fraudulent representation of the quality of these bonds it appears in and you'll tell me if I'm right but but\nBut just walk us through what it was so they're underwriting bonds on behalf of municipalities in what is what is involved with the underwriting just I'm essentially helping them I'm a take them to market\nThat that's exactly right Sam I mean we you ... you can there's other things that are involved with it but at the end of the day underwriting the bond is really you're just giving them an avenue to actually take the bonds the market and more importantly and perhaps this is most important in this case\nActually sell the bonds because you can underwrite a bond but if you can't sell it to somebody if you don't have\nA a customer to sell it to then it doesn't do any good and that's what one of the big things that UPS brought to the table in this business was they had especially in Puerto Rico they had fifty percent of the retail customer base on the entire island so they had access to the clients and an underwriting these bonds\nThey did help bring them to market and then actually distribute these bonds\nAnd you and you mentioned they wrap them up and something ... walk us through what that means in lay person terms\nSure that was just it gave him a little bucket to put these things into and and it says specifically was a is a closed in finding closed and funds operate a little bit differently ... people were probably generally familiar with say a mutual fund\nAnd and these are like a mutual fund but there are a little bit different these don't trade on the New York stock exchange um these aren't regulated in the same way these can use the leverage and leverage is just a form of thinking that is borrowing so when you\nBought one dollar of one of these funds\nWhat they were able to do by creating it as a closed and fun they borrowed against that and purchased another dollar so every dollar you put a new one of these products they were able to get rid of essentially two dollars worth of the securities that they needed to get rid of or a dump if you will\nThis sounds like one of those situations where\nThey have the clients and they create a product in a market or because they have this sort of this captive audience\nWithout really being too concerned about what the quality of that product is but just a relying on their ability to sell them because they have a direct line to them yeah I I think\nThat's actually a pretty fair assessment of what it is because especially when you looked at it and you start getting into some of the quality of these bonds and certainly there's there's argument about some of the sand that can be had I mean we could have a discussion about some of the the claw back features or their priority features on some of these bonds but some of these bonds were\nHonestly a joke I mean there were some there were literally moral obligation bonds that were being sold the folks and and those those are worse than they even found it's it's like an audio you it has no guarantee no backing no security interests\nAnd the way these are able to get passed on to clients is by having people there who stand to gain significant money from underwriting fees from commissions from management fees really kind of collecting at every level in the sales process\nSo what exactly I mean uh so they're selling their they're basically a underwriting these loans and they're taking them to market as a as the financial securities what were these under I mean you say I'm somewhere just moral obligations in other words there was\nNo legal way of compelling repayment and\nFor these securities I mean just walk us through what people normally expect when you buy a bond and it's theoretically right it's a safe investment because well theoretically many times depending on on the quality of the bond but what if what if people normally expect when they go and buy a bond like how does that work\nYou you you took the word out of my mouth that's what people think people think I'm not investing in options\nI'm not investing in an ideal of a company or even a a stock you're buying a bond and the word that I think a lot of people the ... normal regular people think well the bond is is safe that's the thing is maybe not gonna give you a ten percent return obviously but\nIt's it's going to give you some security and that's why it was so easy for them to sell these products because\nYou're selling a bond you're selling a bond and they they sold it as a bond that either backed by something arts and guaranteed by something\nAnd it was easy to sell it is as secure so someone who is in their seventies or eighties is thinking that they're they're buying this for their retirement and that the principles going to be safe and that's what I think the average person who's going in investing thinks that\nUh if if you're going and buying bonds that that it is something that is going to be safe and secure and that you'll make some income on it for your retirement but not taken a big risk not not reaching for the stars are not trying to hit a grand slam and knock it out of the park I mean you're you're talking bonds here which is what again made it so easy for them\nAnd so there's this expectation that they are lending I guess I'm In is a policy uh money I mean are these all of municipal bonds or they were kind of bonds are they\nYet so primarily municipal bonds there's a sales tax financing bonds there's a pension obligation bonds\nOr there's a lot of different types of bond summer general obligation bonds of of the government of Puerto Rico so it it's there's quite a few issue ... down there the the sense of the central bank the government development bank in Puerto Rico also offer bond so there's there's a lot of different ones involved and of course there was just\nPrimarily concentrated in just a few of these particular issues issues which is one of the other problems uh which led to or even more severe losses the more you concentrate a portfolio the more risk you're exposing it to\nOkay so I'm a UPS under writes these bonds from a different municipalities people assume that they are safe and that by purchasing those bonds they are basically\nLocking in a fairly reliable source", "show_name": "The Best of Stephanie Miller", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "27"}
