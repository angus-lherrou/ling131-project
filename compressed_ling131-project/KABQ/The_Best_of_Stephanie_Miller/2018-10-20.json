and they're selling them\nOr sell them to other market makers like citadel and to sigma security now why would they do that when\nThey sell them they get the money and send it out and to sigma securities they in turn who are high frequency traders can't find ways of making money on each and every trait front running your traits that's right you're not getting the best execution\nYou're

... is what they do and when you see\nLots and lots and lots of pennies well those pennies and\nThere was a a mutual fund company that was doing that years ago and I I'm\nI describe a story that I heard about the treasury fountain in Rome where for years you know the whole thing three points that are found you go to Rome and you throw the coins over your fountain and it's supposed to ensure

I Want to follow through with a piece by Phil Graham and John early in the wall Street Journal talking about the war on poverty talking about government and rescuing the poor\n\nThis is the war on poverty is not a struggle simply to support people it's an effort to since Lyndon Johnson it's an effort to allow them to develop and use their capacity\nDuring the Twenty years people Twenty years before the war on poverty\nA portion of the nation living in poverty dropped or fourteen point seven percent from thirty to point one got this is without any government intervention\nOut with no poverty no nothing we are poverty go for thirty two percent of the country now to fourteen point seven\nNow today\nWell point seven percent isn't up\nWe've spent over twenty five trillion dollars and we've got to twelve point three percent basically\nA poverty has been on changed over the past ... years\nThat's right and let's let's put this into perspective transfers money transfers\nTarget it's a low income families have increased from three thousand Seventy per person in Nineteen sixty fought this is inflation adjusted to understand the thirty four thousand Ninety three\nYeah\nAverage that is the average it's gone from three thousand who's thirty four thousand dollars a year that was more money than\nThe kids were bachelor's degrees were making when I was graduating from college many many many moons ago that's how much you're getting a year on average and transfer payments if you're poor and we're talking section eight housing we're talking food stamps we're talking all of this stuff\nAnd it doesn't even include their payments like Medicare like Social Security\n\nYou understand that again you want to think about it this way people who didn't pay much into Social Security or

for more we go to Washington DC where we are joined by any Lenski deputy bureau chief for the Boston Globe she examined hundreds of documents to determine that cold ethnicity is not a factor and Elizabeth Warren's rise in law\nOr any Lenski welcome to democracy now you did an extensive investigation\nOn can you talk about what led up to the\nSenator Warren's release of the video and the DNA test on Monday but first talked about what you found out all the people that you interviewed a what the allegations are and what people said to you\nHow they're sure happy to um so you know at the Boston Globe um we had been asking for um\nFor years for six years really for Elizabeth Warren to release her personnel records really from Harvard University of Pennsylvania where she'd been a law professor and the reason that we are so eager to look at these files is there's been this long running allegation against her\nThat she um check the box and used her Native American\nHistory as a as a reason to um to get ahead and so that's always in the allegation and the reason for it is a back I think it was in Ninety or eighty seven when she was at the University of Texas and the ... the professor she started calling herself\nI'm a minority lifting herself as a minority in the larger trade\nWhen the very next year she gets this really big job at a at a law professor at an Ivy League institution\nAnd so the idea was oh my goodness the moment she identifies herself as a minority professionally that's when this big promotion caught in this and then a few few years later she goes on to an even bigger institution to harbor\nSo we went back and we looked at as many documents as we could find and ... to ... to find out I mean what was there some correlation there because on the face of it it looks like there could be\nUm but when you look at you know starting with the University of Pennsylvania um we were able to find a document that never before been reported it was a ten page\nAn equal opportunity memo that the University of Pennsylvania I had to fill out when they hired Warren\nAnd they had to fill it out because they were ... they saw themselves as hiring a white woman and so they they had to you know in the course of ten pages go through this giant pool of applicants that they had looked at for this position break them down by Sachs by minority and you know the number of black\nApplicants a number of Asian applicants a number of\nNative American applicants and then say look after looking at all of these people we ended up hiring a white woman Elizabeth Warren and um because we could not find an equal or better minority for the job and that that's quoted in the report\nAnd so to me that pretty much solved the issue for University of Pennsylvania clearly she was not a minority higher if\nThey the um uh if the the higher income any they're always having to argue to hire her as a white woman\nFell on that then takes you to Harvard after a few years at Penn and she goes she teaches at Harvard and Ninety three as a visiting professor at which is a sort of weird thing that law schools do they have you come in when they're looking at hiring you and you have like a year long job interview\n'em so she taught at Harvard and they loved her and they did an unusual thing which is offer her job you know while she was still there and it's still teaching and Ninety three\nAnd ... she initially turned that job doubt she wasn't really gunning for it um there are a number of reasons but she turned it down but at Harvard you really wanted to see is there a similar form you know is there are similar ... forum that she had to that in Harvard had to fill out\nYou know then then our own measurements want us to be doing and so sort of internally they're saying oh we're doing fine externally Harvard was still saying we need to we need to do better for the most part [laughter] so yeah I mean that is I think that as an area that that's going to be a really complicated\nFinally any Lenski you've been speaking to a Senator Warren a ah\nAfter she released the a DNA test and the video and you've spoken to her husband Bruce men about the effects of what this has meant a and you've covered the response to the release of the DNA test yeah\n\nYeah yeah and I I have and it's that it's been a fascinating um the day is really um I you know it was I'm a big surprise I think to many people that Elizabeth Warren was willing to kind of undergo this DNA test and and do it and put the results out there\nUm I think it's a little early to know what the impact of it's going to be on her political future but I also think I mean she has been her Rand unquestioned on this for more than a year and her approach to this is\nQuite different than say Hillary Clinton made her idea is like well I'm I I got a tip is test well it does actually show that this is the first proof\nThat she has been able to produce that they're her family stories were true and that there was\nNative American ancestry and her family um so you know this is the first time in in six years there's been something beyond you know a family lore to rely on and put this claim although that credit because they're saying my goodness it's so far far far far back doesn't really count\n'em and do people have to make that\nThat decision for themselves um I just I Know that this is one of those questions every time I write about Elizabeth Warren\nI get I Would get so many emails about why does she just take a DNA test I mean ... you know they ... they would be um come across the board it didn't feel like the sort of normal um you know offer them generate a type of emails they would just be from\nA regular people I got so many from one story I actually had to create like a forum email to respond to them all so my guess is that she was getting in a similar amount of questions for my constituents and I guess this is the way that she decided to deal with it which is very different from\nHow a lot of candidates woods and we'll see how whether it was wise or not\nBut it seems very quickly that she has a maybe for other reasons expressed regret about her decision on releasing be taking the DNA testing releasing it saying I Wish I had been more mindful of the distinction between heritage and tribal citizenship\nIs it your sense that she has been a regretful for this reason\nNo I mean I I don't think she regrets during the ... I have no indication that that that's the case at all I mean I think what she regrets is\n... my sons would be that she regrets calling herself Native American at Harvard at a pet I mean I think that's where her um she has learned a lot more about ethnicity and about how ... tribal membership works and how a family story is not the same as\nYou know having the experience of being a member of a tribe but I you know ... the idea that she robots doing a DNA test I I have not heard that from anyone\nAny length scale and I thank you for being with us Washington D. C. deputy bureau chief for the Boston Globe a link to your piece ethnicity is not a factor in Elizabeth Warren's rice and law after break we host roundtable discussion with the ... lawyer ...

Senator Elizabeth Warren came to Native American ancestry she's come under fire since releasing the DNA tests showing Native American lineage and her family tree in a video released Monday she told her family's story\nMy mother was born in the eastern Oklahoma\nIndian Territory until just a few years earlier when did you become\nDaddy always says he fell over heels among among\n\nMy daddy's parents herrings bitterly they're married my mother read was part Native American\nJust short of discrimination was common to talk\nTo when my mom was Nineteen and my daddy was when they want and together they build a family\nElizabeth Warren has said her mother told her family had ties to the Cherokee and Delaware tribes\nBut Native Americans across the country are criticizing warns decision to use a DNA test to assert her heritage ... junior sexy of state for the Cherokee Nation said quote sovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lineage\nSuch as paternity to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliation using the DNA tests to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nFor more we hosted roundtable discussion joining us from Fargo North Dakota is Tara house to national campaign director for honor the earth she's no ... lawyer and\nWe go to Anchorage, Alaska where we're joined by mark ...\nWho is editor of Indian country today a member of the ... tribes in Seattle, Washington we're joined by Jesse Rosh author speaker lawyer and storyteller member of the black feet nation host of the pot cash break dances with wolves welcome you all to democracy now\nI'm let's go to North Dakota I'm too tired how SCA\nIf you can respond first to I'm a Senator Warren releasing her DNA test indicating a Native American lineage and her video and your thoughts on this\nWhat I see are some non native folks arguing over what native identity is I'm a native people just being in almost entirely left out of the conversation I'm so we saw that Lindsey Graham now is running around saying you know that I have more Indian blood than she does I should open a casino\nIt kind of shows just how problematic\nI'm senator warrants decision to use this DNA test as her smoking gun now see I'm native I said I was um when in fact you know common genetic markers and geographic location does not tell you anything about you know which tribe you might be a part of or that you might have this tendency from she couldn't actually locate an ancestor\nI'm having done a genealogy study who is a native person\nUm it's kind of this one drop rule that she is reinforcing all these you know understandings of race being something by blood and they're being the difference between um different ethnicities\nSenator Warren and her own words in that video that she released on Monday talking about her Native American heritage\nNot enrolled in a tribal only trying to determine tribal citizen I understand and respect and\nMy family history is my family history and\nSo that's a Elizabeth Warren ... can you respond to that and also explain how is it at that Native American tribes determine a membership\nYeah ... you know I think she's kind of walking back her words because she got this really harsh statement by turkey nation who is saying you know that this is really disrespectful and has nothing to do with um you know their sovereign right to determine membership\nUm you know I I don't think that she's very regretful about this I think that she's just kind of bold her way forward on this on this issue and you know yeah it's a sovereign right of tribal nations to determine who is a member it is in a relationship so can ship of community of\nYou know a lived experience it's all kinds of different factors that sometimes can include blood quantum but Bill Clinton is something that was created by the colonial government not by tribal nations um and it's this kind of myth that's been perpetuated by the United states and buy a many many Americans who claimed to be quote unquote part Cherokee\nUm you know and continue these problematic ideas of who native people are and we're ...\nLet's turn to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham on Fox and friends Tuesday saying he plans to take a DNA test in response to Senator Warren\n\nKnow I'm going to\nJail soccer used them around the\n\n\nI don't have a\nChance to Jimmy ... by the group that says democracy now I'm any good and then within their means shape\nWe entered a show looking at the record number of Native American women running for office in the mid term elections there has never been a Native American woman Congress member this yeah there are at least for indigenous women running for Congress three are running for governor and thirty one I'm running for seats in the state legislature\nStill with us mark ... editor of Indian country today member of the ... tribes also with us in Fargo North Dakota ...\nHouse and national campaign director for honor the earth Ojibwe from the coaching first nation in Seattle, Washington we're joined by Jesse ... author speaker lawyer story teller member black seat nation has to the pot catch break dances with wolves\nMarc let's go to you in Alaska you've been writing a lot about us in Indian country today about the record number of native women who are running for office in the United states\n[noise] yes and just this week uh history was made when a Valerie Davidson became the lieutenant governor of Alaska the first date of American Woman to hold that office in any state in the country\nUh she's ... she's one of a four other a native women running for lieutenant governor across the country in fact in Minnesota no matter what happens it'll be a Ojibwe woman who will be the next lieutenant governor of Minnesota red legged mission for the Republicans and daughter Bergstrom\nAnd a ... for the DFL in Minnesota so she's ... so this idea of just this year everything is just lit up candidate\nA decided this was a time to run up hall is a great example um even though it's because of she said in her announcement because it was that Iraq and because of Donald Trump\nThere's also this long arc of she's been working at this for Twenty years and she has built a resume this ready for this job and that's part of the case in this story if you look around the country are so many women who are prepared and this is the moment they chose to run it\nTook her to talk about the context you said a ... being in office has something to do with it but how is it that that Native American women organized a to run in this election\nWell definitely the administration has policies was a motivating force particularly the policies that gives women\nUh this one of the great stories is how the Native American women candidates have created this network of early on um I started reading about this I use the outside she representatives\nAnd a very soon after that uh the fashion designer Bethany yellow tail decided to make sure she calls she represents and list all of the Native American women running for office they formed an informal network they reach out to each other they support each other that help fund raise a Sharif said was a\nEnded up all the temptation to gather boats and Kansas\nA pile of Jordan was at um [noise] a ... campaign the night of the primary win and making calls for knocking on doors the network they've created maybe the most lasting institution out of this whole electric\nPower house got can you talk about what's happening in Minnesota\nAnd in Minnesota um you have a situation where no matter who wins on will be a Native American woman\nI'm we're talking about um the state representative penny Flanagan versus Republican uh Donna Bergstrom uh both running for lieutenant governor\n[noise] yeah\nYou know that's been frustrating part I Would say about this whole Warren debacle and like the the concept of native identity being played out by two white folks um is that there is this historic you know I'm representation of native women running across the country there's also you know the\nUm the Indian child welfare act coming under coming under fire and the very core of federal Indian lobbying put into question by that um there's the ... bridge pipeline and Minnesota where\nWe're looking at you know to potential native women are going to hold the lieutenant governor said you know at the same time we're looking at a a you know massive resistance of indigenous people um that is building against the line three project emerges Landry tar sands project that's actually where I'm coming from today um so you know we're\nSticking lane that wild land para\nIndigenous representation I'm at the same time the that we're trying to hold back the worst of what's happening\nExplained that you're deeply involved with pipeline politics whether we're talking about the Dakota access pipeline or whether we're talking about the current battle that you just mentioned\n[noise] yeah you know I think that native people as people who are still very connected to the land to the water are taking these leadership roles and fights all over the country and all around the world\nUm to protect the existing resources that to protect the existing water resources for us all um you know as I say to climate change raging around us um we're trying to protect the last of what's ... what's still remaining to us and protect our communities and protect those um around us for the next generation\nSo as that's happening it's also in tandem with this with this rising up of women\nUm and particularly women of color and see representation but hopefully you know we can get a a good balance between the two so we're able to all survive as climate change is the greatest problem facing this world\nAnd Kara um how important is that women were also leading the battle against the Dakota access pipeline and inspiring winning a new or in a North Dakota right now I Want to talk about the Supreme Court I'm In North Dakota\nAnd also indigenous activists fighting a daily battle and the swamp plan to Louisiana against the bayou bridge pipeline one sixty three mile pipeline being built by energy transfer partners the same company behind the apple\nAnd water protectors have repeatedly been arrested for protesting and face felony charges under harsh new anti protest law signed by Louisiana's governor\nEarlier this year pipeline construction scheduled to end before the new year\nI think that women as we've seen with me too movement really building and we've seen the women's march and we've seen\nWomen being the backbone of so many different movements basis including um you know indigenous\nA resistance against these extractive industry projects um it's women taking on the role of leadership that's sorely sorely needed\nIt's women record recognizing that missing murdered indigenous women as a epidemic across the country across the across Canada\nUm that these can be directly that these ... cases of ah women can be directly tied to extracted extractive industry\nUm and also sitting here in North Dakota where I Know there's many women organizers rushing to try to get people I'm home address is that they can actually participate in the election\nAnd the very notion of indigenous people not being able to participate in the election of a country that started after\nUm our nation's existed you know it's women taking on so many different roles and I think it's something that is really really needed in this time it's very critical time of potentially are very survival I'm being called into question with the latest reports of what's happening and we're we're out with climate change\nAnd Jesse must could you also comment on that issue the issue of a voter ID laws that could potentially a strict ah the the ... the patient of Native Americans in the upcoming elections\n\nI think that you know ... ... excuse me um you know spoke about the two main part about it which is that people are trying to be proactive\nTribes are an individual native organizers are trying to do the best that they can do with a bad situation where the Supreme Court\nOh excuse my mouth is right of the United states already passed and said that they're not going to weigh in substantively on this issue um obviously this this is an issue that goes back to two thousand and Thirteen when this initial voter id law was passed and it's interesting just as a historic matter that\nUm the previous governor of the state of North Dakota said that there's never been any sort of voter fraud issue this was something that was one hundred percent um the result of partisan politics I hate to make this about partisan politics but this was\nThe result of a Republican controlled legislator with the intent of um doesn't\n\n[noise] journalists killing migrant caravan pancake Saudi Arabia says it does not know what happened to the body of the Washington Post columnist killed at its consulate in Istanbul correspondent then we demand\nComing from a source in the Saudi royal palace that they found some\n... ... ... this is an example of sort of Trump ism spreading across the globe like ... the the lack of the u._s. being any type of ballast starts to open up a huge can of worms\nOh absolutely and I think I mean I even read an article this past week\nI'm dating from some buddy quoted from within the inner circle or some association with the inner circle in Saudi Arabia\nThat one of the reasons why NBS ... Mohammed bin Salman that young print to is in charge of Saudi Arabia at the moment and who is a you know very likely to have been the person who ordered this a gruesome killing in Turkey\nThat he was a highly influenced by two things one that that same you're putting has been getting away with the fascinating dissidents and and you know people he considers to have betrayed hand in foreign countries and you know it just everyone seems to be shrugging over that ... know ramifications\nFor anyone and second that um you know Donald Trump has been has been harshly criticizing the media as despicable Scott I'm you know the worst people in the world nothing but dishonest\nAnd you know it led him to believe that this would not be something that would cause him any any serious blow back and that what it would do is sort of exert his own authority and power not just within his own kingdom\nBut also you know this is a pretty aggressive move against\nTurkey and its own way and you know what we're seeing here is a lot of jockeying for power in the middle east Iran Turkey Saudi Arabia or Israel and these various ... you know\nFor shifting alliances and it's all complicated but particularly complicated by the fact that you know Russia is now involved in the middle east and the way it hasn't been in many years and you've got Trump ... you know is on the one hand ah advised by a naive print playing a Jared Kushner\nAnd who has very little understanding of the complexities of these relationships or the consequences of\nYou know making the sort of move and on the other hand he's got some hardcore right wing ideologues who are essentially working on behalf of Israel to\nConfront it Ron and so you know this is a very very very volatile situation and this has thrown a bomb in the middle of\nSome plans that wherever the New York times reported last week that that the Trump Administration had been planning to stage a major confrontation with Iran in November\nOver and and and basically I Try to isolate them by uh sabotaging their oil sales yup which of course\nWhat and and this would with the with the backing of Saudi Arabia of course it would recreate a reduced prices are up there\nUm you know there are oil production or whatever that this was it you know a big grand plan that this has somehow disrupted because now Trump is sort of having to you know I mean he's not doing very well because he's basically saying hey you know stuff happens what can I say [noise]\nUm but you know this is a very very volatile situation and and and just before I stop here the the the one thing I heard that was very interesting to me about how this might affect the midterms is it this has been the most sustained coverage of a foreign policy event since\nDonald Trump came into office and I don't know whether that means anything important but it sure seems like it might that maybe this is going to have some effect on on the terms\nI mean it's possible I mean in in in a book before we get there I mean I think you raise a couple of their their ... two aspects right but I think are becoming clearer and this is something that you and I have have touched upon or every couple of months over the last couple of years which is what what are going to be the implications\nIn the context of a foreign policy\nWith an administration that is I'm a on some level fundamentally incompetent and so far is that um they they're understaffed\nThe day are inexperienced they are a running our foreign policy in the same way that you would if you were a small under a undeveloped a nation without a democracy right or they are running our foreign policy as if we were not a nation\nAnd and regardless of of of one's perspective on how much of a source of of good we are in the world right I mean because I think uh people\nHave a range of perspectives on that\nWhat we were indisputably was a consistent watershed that would change our policies perhaps at the margins but fundamentally there were certain things that didn't even need to be articulated on a regular basis that in some ways a impacted\nAnd regulated the behavior of other countries and when we come back we'll take a break when we come back I'm going to talk about that element of it because there's really two elements to this there's there is the sort of the the mechanics of foreign policy and then they're sort of the more broad um\nMessages that we send to the rest of the world that are not necessarily um a tactical or strategic in any way uh but they have big implications for the way the rest of the world\nFunctions we going to take what break I'm Sam cedar I'm Talking to the great dignity we'll be right back on ring of fire radio\nIn many countries around the world\nMedical care is

with Heather ... reporting from salon so Heather when we broke we were we\nWere talking or at least ostensibly about the uh the killing of ... a U.S resident of Washington Post columnist a Saudi national killed in the Saudi embassy in his stand bowl I'm\nThere have been multiple stories Donald Trump has tried to cover for the Saudi a prince NBS a lotta people um in in our neck of the woods have been have been a saying that I'm a mom had been Solomon is or not the sort of reform or that he's been made out to be\nThis weekend Nineteen Seventy three after Fifteen Years of construction Sydney opera houses dedicated by Queen Elizabeth the second the eighty million dollar structure designed by Danish architects you want to listen\nAnd funded by the process of the opera house lotteries

a time when most video stores were small scale operations featuring a limited selection of titles blockbuster open with some eight\nThousand tapes displayed on shelves around the store and a computerized check out process the first one was a huge success in blockbuster expanded rapidly apparently there is only one blockbuster video store left today and it's in Bend Oregon\nThat's your look back at this week in history\n[noise]\n\nDuring a fire radio I'm Sam cedar last weekend the far right group the Proud Boys made headlines when they violently attacked protesters in Manhattan here to tell us about this group of self described western chauvinists Angelou curse soon the president of media matters\nSo Angela let's just start with who are the Proud Boys\nThey are a\nProbably the most well organized part of the men's rights movement and so basically the Proud Boys um are are there would describe themselves as western chauvinists\nAnd that's just to put it simply they have chapters they they do meetings um you know they're not just sort of like participants an online forums like I think a lot of the men's rights movements are they actually do stuff in public or as as we are now saying\nOkay we I mean we we got to go a little broader than that because uh I I just think that the um everything you just said probably strikes normal people as being yeah absolutely we have a group of adult males who are young\nThere are twenties thirties their leader I think is a late forties uh Gavin began this we'll ... we'll get to him in a moment and they all wear Fred Perry color shirts and they're in a basically he\nMan or women heater a non\nWestern civilization hater group is I mean it's like it's like a like a like a youth group but for theoretically grown men\nThat's right and they they consider themselves to be sort of like fraternal order um they have levels\nAre of participation so like the first level is actually you actually have to identify yourself officially as a proud boy um and you have to make that a publicly known statement it's not something that you shy away from you have to actually explicitly say that\nIdentify that in some of your either public communications or on your social media profiles that you have to make it known 'em the second level is when things start to get\nA little stranger hum you have to commit to giving up masturbation\nUm it's a really important part of moving through the ranks um and it's something that they insist people commit to as they sort of go through it and then the applies a part of that initiation what happens is is that you get beat up by other Prague board members of higher rank while you list or five favorite cereals\nAnd then the third part of it\nIs when you actually get a tattoo among and then you're saying these things like they're not absolutely bizarre you've got to get it can be done while you're saying you're five favorite breakfast cereals\nYeah yeah like and it's a real thing these are places that have these are they are a pretty well organized group but they've been growing pretty steadily the last couple of years because they're tapping into\nThis sort of energy that is uh that that is sort of ... within the larger anti PC men's rights movement and so it's just like a funnel you sort of start with big picture kind of stuff and then you slowly you know recruit people and work them down\nThe fourth level is where it gets scary though and and sort of what goes from being we're just sort of scary is that\nActually the highest level of being a proud boy\nIs when you commit violence for the cause that's what they describe it and uh it is it is the most honored thing you can do um and you are recognized as such when you get to that level and the what we saw on friday a ... in New York City\nIt wasn't just that it was an outlier or random example of the Proud Boys are sort of getting into a scuffle\nWhat they had was a moment where some of them\nCould commit violence for the cause and sort of earn that badge of honor and that distinction and it's intentional um and when Gavin McGinnis founded it he described it very proudly I'm as a gang or he really believes that there needs to be sort of a pro violence movement\nThat the tip of the spear for the larger you know men's rights and anti PC movement and he's\nPretty unabashed about the fact that violence as a as a necessary and effective tool and you know it's and that's kind of where the the sort of the culture part of it comes in right that when you're sort of moving people through those levels up part of that is actually to indoctrinate and to get people comfortable I'm just like any game\nWith increasing levels of\nActivity so it goes from being sort of strange in weird to can you know starting to create those moments of hazing and more intense camaraderie to outwardly conditioning people and incentivizing acts of violence\nIf you know what is this all about where they don't masturbate and how do they um I mean we'll get onto the more serious aspects of it but it's you know people should know this is a very bizarre a group\nAnd I happened to uh have known Gavin McGinnis as socially I'm ... years ago we will we will talk about that in a moment but what is the theory behind telling the members of this gang that you're not allowed to masturbate in how do they regulate that\nThey I think it's I think it's an honor system and uh and and I think that's really a part of it at the the theory behind that I I I think it's partly connected to a few things one is that there's this\nIt's it's gated cut yourself I'm a little bit it's a little ... or beta or this is according to sort of their tenants that there's this this hyper masculinity associated with being a proud boy I'm which seems strange given the name but\nAnd that even doing that act alone is somehow a part of it um the deeper peace though is less about they're hyper masculine approach and actually more about creating a a shared sacrifice and to incentivize\nMore group activities the ideas that you know when somebody moves to that level of commitment it's actually coincides with a with a hazing experience and a piece of that is actually that\nUm you know you're you're sort of bonding a little bit more with with the group and it's it's like a gang right the idea is to really tether you more to\nTo a community in a weird way than to yourself um and so as a part of that presumably and and as a typically is the case you actually spend more time I'm at ... meetings um and with other Proud Boys um and you sort of move deeper into this this disorganization\nNow you refer to this gang as a being centered around the men's rights movement and I'm a and in western chauvinists him what why do you not use the term white supremacist\nI think that that's too easy into simple and I actually think that it's not because I don't think that they inherit they have a part of their\n... it's not because I don't think that race is a a a big piece of their organizing principle I I I\nBut there I just it's just too simple and I think these days the sort of knee jerk reaction oftentimes as as they when these things break into the public is because we think about this kind of activity activity in the past typically associated with white nationalist and white supremacists and because that's often are frame of reference\nThat's immediately where we go to when we see groups like this because it feels very similar\nAnd there's no doubt that bigotry and racism and\nAnd very much anti out to be the discrimination are part of their brand but it's bigger than that um and it isn't purely limited they the organizing principle is not around race um in fact\nA as evidence of that actually I Am proud boy meetings um is where actual white nationalist organizations will try to find recruits because there tends to be very intense alignment um but it it isn't this or this or the organizing principle and so I think it's a ... I I think it's just a little misleading and\nThey have the people of color that are part of the ... community um and so when when you say that they're white nationalist group and then there's like it it actually makes it harder to to get to what they're really organizing around and\nI that's the part that scares me because they are much more appealing than than say the white nationalist are um when you look at Charlottesville what you saw on display at Charlottesville not the night of the tiki torches but on that Saturday when there are all those people they're one of the ways that so many came together was that\nWas that ... chapters had actually activated themselves as well as other men's rights organizations to say go out and protest political correctness um and so there is something a\nThe one of the things they do is they actually have a training program for higher level members um around how to instigate fights to actually have the set up straight I mean that is a part of it to actually create these conditions where you can actually look\nThough you're operating in self defense and that's I'm not saying that was happening here but actually you know there's a lot of events where they are involved in um that part of it is this actually set up jobs that they are and acting essentially a script in order to pretend to do they are operating in self defense when they're not\nAngel which is about Ninety seconds left how does how does get me to make money off this and how many of these Proud Boys exist in this country\nIt's hard to say about the number that exist definitely thousands so I Would say the growth rate is really steady um you know I've been watching Marty in them now for two years and a two years ago they were marginal and it could attach more than I Would say that now there are definitely in the thousands of of like steady active participants and that's\nBecause it's reflective of a deeper environment\nAnd got an makes his money are largely because mark within his new boss\nUh met he's in bed with a really big media company cumulus rate cumulus media which is the second largest radio company out there um has a subdivision called Westwood One that actually distributed program\nA to companies that pay for it to a man that's mostly how he makes his his his repetition\nYou get older that on air over terrestrial radio is that just threw a C. R. T. V.\nThey had tried very aggressively through today ... and it wasn't clear to me that they were able to successfully get any contracts the our TV and then some of some smaller digital distribution deals\nInteresting and know who that is it just strictly a corporate thing and I said people basically said hey why are you um why is this major corporation a supporting literally brown shirts bugs\nIt's weird because the R. T. V. basically paid Westwood One for gabbing McGinnis this program\nThat's how it's so Marco Vince companies see our TV pays Westwood One which is that really big radio company for that for those distribution right for the distribution rights I mean there are probably the largest footprint that he has\nA right now what what has not been successful but they have other programs that they've been adding that are very similar to get him to get it they're just not that much further both programs they had they had had success of getting to trust your radio so in a way the whole idea behind gathered and it's kind of like the overtime window right is that if you're the tip of this\nYear and you're really far out there maybe you're not palatable but you create it taste in the audience his mouth for something that is\nThat is close to that but maybe just not that far over the line and that's the thing that I feel the net effect of all this is not just the violence but how they constantly\n... things further and further ... thank you so much for your time today really breaking Patricia\n... is the president of media matters\nWhen we come back Heather did be pardoned will join us to analyze more news from the past week that's just ahead um same cedar\nYou're listening to ring of fire radio don't forget R O F\nDot com to hear what you've been missing and to support the show [noise]\n\n\nAnd my bank account on on\n\nOn how [noise]\nPart of the problems are no problem at green light auto sales\nA job at a down payment you'll get you the green light for a green

auto sales were you can enjoy a relaxed comfortable car buying experience green light auto sales on mobile is east of Louisiana up to the green light auto and em job\nRelied auto sales where every sale gets the green light [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nSon again sleep on\n\n\nWay\n\nIn la\nLa\nMan\nJournalist killing migrant caravan I'm and Kate's Germany and France are among the nation's criticizing Saudi Arabia which has knowledge to death of the Washington Post columnist and its consulate in Turkey thing is accidentally killed during a fistfight correspondent nic Robertson\nFor such a dramatic shows his buddy is still underway and therein lies one of the holes in the narrative arriving on Iran so far they say they are deeply saddened have regrets about what happened um for his family though of course knowing what happened to his buddy and all of this would be one of the most important and biggest thing\nNot forget what we're talking about our rape survivors who came to Washington and they cornered senators in the hallway and in elevators to tell them their stories and begged them not to vote for Brett Kavanaugh I mean apparently they these men found that very threatening um and the truly\nTheir lives they get their ... they ...\nThey didn't and they knew they knew that this was not you know in any way physically intimidating the protests were nothing compared to the protests and the town halls and twenty ten over Obamacare and in fact I put up some video\nOn one of my piece in salon last week that showed you remember they spit on on Republican or democratic congressman Emanuel Cleaver and screamed and John Lewis is faces they were trying to walk across the grounds I mean it was intense and really had a very violent feeling about it\nUm so you know no ... they were not physically intimidated and my personal feeling is that they ... this was actually an elaborate troll on the part of the Republican senators first of all to try and get past their\nUm you know they're they're kind of shame a over the cabin up business but\nAlso to try and intimidate democratic lawmakers into distancing themselves from their pat I support it\nI mean this idea that you know and and the media jumped right on it too oh look you know the violent mob there there's mob action and oh they're going up to people in in restaurants and that's just terrible and look how out of control and civil they all are\nCalling for civility civility uh that's just a method to try and get Democrats to disown condemn their own supporters and so far I haven't seen much evidence that Democrats are doing that which is\nSomewhat surprised I mean normally they would I mean that's usually a pretty effective a ploy on the part of the Republicans um and yeah it does fire up their base um but that has been\nYou know this has been not ... this idea of of this angry mob actually goes back to the moment when Donald Trump was inaugurated and the n._r._a. and mediate Lee came out of the box\nAh with this um campaign called the the fist of the righteous fist of truth I think it's called\nThat clenched fist of truth sorry and it was run by Dana Lowe's and and what it was was this idea that antifa and the resistance where all the same thing and they were more rotting in the streets and getting ready to burn down your your town\nAnd they put out a whole series of those ads and they've been pumping not from the very beginning I mean that's been going on for two years\nSo this idea that there is this angry mob is sort of turning underneath and that leads us to these groups like the Proud Boys\nThey're positioning themselves as the as the defense against the left wing angry mob right I mean that is how that's being how that's being sold in right wing circles that these guys are protecting themselves\nAnd the scariest part of that Proud Boys um incident\nIs the fact that the cops seemed to be on the Proud Boys side right because there were antifa outside the event and they were holding signs and screaming at them and what have you they didn't start the violence\nBut that was sort of how the cops perceived it that they were provoking the Proud Boys and they kind of that I mean if you saw the videos you could say that they were not exactly aggressive and stopping\nThe beating rather than we are taking place\nSo I think that that's sort of where that part of it is leading and and and part of pimping this idea of the violent left wing mob mostly bunch of women wearing pink cats\nUm is to sort of give them the excuse in case this does\nSort of escalate and I see it escalating with or without Trump's you know without winning the midterms are without you know anything this is something that's happening sort of organic way on the right and it's really really dangerous I mean you see those red hats on cops and you see those red hats on those Proud Boys and you're kinda going you know this is not\nThat there's there are some historical parallels that are disturbing to say Italy\nAnd we should say it was a U.S congressman staffer who set this event up at the Republican metropolitan club right right I mean so this is not an arms like I mean the idea of of the Democratic Congress person\nSetting up a you know\nI'm a black block\nOr a group of people use black bloc tactics to speak at a democratic club is\nUnlikely to say the least and uh the outrage would be enormous um you know the um\nI think there's a misconception uh amongst people as to\nWho a so called anti uh people are right this is a people who are simply fighting against fascist or to be distinguished from you know black bloc ah people use black bloc tactics a ... but I think that you know in the\nIn the popular a construction a these are the same things but neither group and anti war can be just a teacher who is a you know trying to I'm\nA identify you know one of these guys who are involved and beating somebody in Charlottesville or through the Internet or none of these people would ever be invited to a democratic\nFunction in their official capacity is just absurd right ah but yeah we see this where the Republicans are are hosting this guy Gavin McGinnis 'em to do a um a\nA reproduction of the assassination I'll be Japanese socialist figure from the Nineteen fifties I mean this is you know clearly the Republicans are trying to be um uh well\nProvoke some type of violent conflict yet but we'll look we've got to take a break let's talk more about this on the other side I'm Sam cedar this ring of fire radio I'm Talking to the great Heather pardon were to be\nCall a civilian storey\nIs berets someday Thurston and if you haven't already you have to check out our radio as new as podcasts with twenty ... this is the show where we sit with musicians and experts to talk about how DNA is changing our lives and the world around us this week we got real with Melissa Etheridge has we discuss\nWhat does it mean to be family family's family you can make family family's law that the bond with\nHis baritone day Thursday and and I am so excited to tell you about spit and heart radio podcast where I sit with musicians and experts to talk about how DNA is changing our lives and the world around I don't\nFeel like I look like anybody else or feel like anybody else we're becoming closer together more empathetic that's what they instilled in me in the very beginning that you are part of a revolution you can make family family's love [noise]\nWelcome back during the fire radio I'm Sam cedar Sears has been a household name for almost a hundred and twenty five years but now the retail giant is facing bankruptcy\nHere to tell us how hedge fund king stands to make a lot of money over the failure of the company he was running Eileen Appelbaum co director of the center for economic and policy research\nSo I lean this week a Sears after a I'm a along well I guess maybe not that long but it's certainly a precipitous decline over the past ah less than a decade filed for bankruptcy\nAnd uh the easy I think for seal a explanation is that they just couldn't compete in this day and age of the Internet but that's not nearly the most accurate story is\nNo uh what's true is that the a retail market place has changed a lot uh in in recent years a but this is an industry that is constantly facing disruption of one kind or another and that uh\nHas learned to deal with disruption so for example every time we have a recession\nOr this is a problem for anybody who was involved in retail because you don't need a new dress you don't need a new so suit you you buy as little as possible things and and just make do a if you're worried about your job and certainly if you've lost your job and become unemployed you you don't have the ability to spend so\nPeriodically retailers face that kind of disruption\nThey face disruption from changing styles there is of course a lot of change in the marketplace the question is why a company like seers as big as successful as a\nEngraved in the in the memories of uh of everybody who grow up in the U.S why it was an April to respond and for that I think you have to look to the fact that they were owns and managed and run by a hedge fund that had little interest in fear succeeding\nMore interest in lining their own pockets\nNow I mean okay now and and we should say also and we were talking about the Sears it's not like fears is not familiar with the idea of people not coming into the stores to buy things they they invented the notion practically of if not invented the notion of of ordering remotely and having it shipped to you\nBut let's put that aside for a moment conceptually speaking and I think this is difficult for people to understand because we have seen this story though now are increasingly we've certainly seen it in the past to start with Toys R us we start with Ankara hockey we saw with I think sports authority um\n... what we what we have conceptually and I want you to walk us through it and tell us who the players are but it it tell me if this characterization conceptually makes sense\nThere is a quality to when when the c._e._o. and when the hedge fund essentially Mary's with Sears by Sears and gets into a union with them it's as if they know they're going to get divorced\nSeven eight years down the road right when the kids go to college we're going to get divorced and what they do is they start basically bleeding the the the household income of money in burying it in the back yard and by the end of this thing the the marriage as an entity has a lot of debt\nThey head and the money or in the back yard and they walk away essentially that's that's what we're looking at here right\n[noise] but I think that's a very a very good analogy that are in fact whenever\nA these companies are bought by private equity they're they're intended to be sold in just a few years this story is has it has its own little twist to it because the earth remained a publicly traded company and a Edward Lambert an ESL his hedge funds\nBut hedge funds do is they take over they take over the control of publicly traded companies and so\nUh if the share price goes up they're happy to continue holding it or if the share price closed down and they have other ways of making money which in this case they clearly did a than they are happy to do it that way I Will say that Edward lamport an ESL his hedge fund adopted a lot a lot of the practices\nThat you see was private equity taking resources out of the company owning more than half of it so that they could actually dictate I and and this was in some ways even more extreme because Edwards Lambert not only is the founder of the hedge fund that\nBought up all of their bought up so much of their stock but he became the the L A Sears he became the chairman of the board of directors of Sears he is the head of the trust fund that uh that own fears\nOr he let them tons of money which he he let his ... his hedge fund lend money to Sears on which he and his hedge fund or collecting interest payments uh I'm situated themselves\nShould there be a bankruptcy ... and the cat bird seed in terms of figuring out\nWho gets paid into bankruptcy and who takes the losses so he has covered every base there is\nAnd ... and just so people understand we have a situation I mean I think the first inclination of most people's to assume oh someone is a a a CEO of a company and they own if not the majority of the stock in a pluralistic ally of the largest amount of the stock\nThey of course want that company to succeed but he extracted so much wealth out of this and and just to be clear on this bankruptcy thing as as the son of a bankruptcy attorney\nWhen a company goes into bankruptcy there is a hierarchy of creditors are people who are owed money who get paid first he made sure because he was on both ends of the deal that\nIn the event of a bankruptcy and I'm not convinced from the story that he didn't know that a bankruptcy was a notable in fact drove the company towards this that he would get paid first in way down on the list\nAre of course obviously the workers who would lose their jobs but those people who had deferred their compensation in the form of a pension\nWho are going to get a screwed on this as well All right so let's talk first about the first thing that ... did with ESL in terms of the real estate 'cause this is one way that they basically stripped a huge asset that in a bankruptcy would be one of the first things that\nGenerate the revenue to pay off creditors how did they basically like pull that real estate value out of the company\nSo you are absolutely right at this point this is funny Fifteen and he already knows that Sears is not going to survive everybody knew when twenty eleven that it was on the ropes by twenty Fifteen he already knew this and what he did is he took a\nBunch of Sears stores including some of their most valuable properties and uh so the real estate\nTo a a real estate investment trust which his hedge fund had set up\nSo this is like ridiculous he sets up a publicly traded real estate investment trust\nSells the real estate on many many of the Sears stores hundreds of the Sears stores including some of their most valuable real estate to this real estate investment trust\nHe signs a contractor has serious financial needs to see us so we signed a contract with the real estate investment trust for the rest they are going to pay which are high rents with a built in accelerator every year they're going to go up by a certain percent for the stores that he keeps open\nThey are paying the real estate investment trust money\nBrent but there are other stores in prime locations that he closes and then the real estate investment trust because they're no longer getting rent from Sears a now and and they owned the real estate", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Best of Stephanie Miller", "city":
