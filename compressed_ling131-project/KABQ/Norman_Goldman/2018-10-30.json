and make the best of it and by the way you know what's happening here in America right we see what's going on with these on American unpatriotic forces well we've been chronicling it throughout Europe now it's in Brazil Brazil\nVery polarizing figure but at the same time a lot of resilience frustrated with the political corruption and there were rising crime I really put their confidence in someone\nWho for many years was known as this kind of incendiary figure if you're in Congress where he would make his remarks are defending a military dictatorship hacking and women and gays and blacks but to him over the recent\nMonths he's come out of this kind of ... senior and vowing to combat the political corruption that has emerged in the last ... scandal and to really be tough on crime and it obviously works T uh he his message was listening to voters and and they voted on\nThat issue Shasta darling didn't have CNN the Jews\nName is ... high air bowl so narrow and John Oliver I Hope you know John Oliver is he's a riot on ... and now he's on HBO he came up of course with John Stewart\nBoth NATO has talked many young people in Brazil particularly from the middle and upper ... does some incredible videos online toning up to ...\nOnly to be loved via crowd missing him onto their shoulders and ... it is some intense support on his worrying the young people are so excited for him because he's an extreme ... conservative\nHe wants to withdraw Brazil in the past agreeing on climate change and we can environmental regulations he's cool refugees arriving in Brazil the storm of the world and that's the crime he wants to make it easier for Brazilians ... presumably so they can fight to themselves but he also he was so psyched Coptic Lee strong law enforcement signed\nA policeman who doesn't kill isn't a policeman which incredibly still isn't even in the top ten most alarming statements that he's made on someone that you could actually go much further pulse and all of a sudden the pasta all I'm In favor of a dictatorship\nWhich is particularly worry as he's a former military captain in a country that until Nineteen Ninety five was rules by a brutal military dictatorship that regime engage in torture an extrajudicial killings Baltimore who said that mistake was simply didn't go far enough that's\nJohn Oliver we think HBO for that and and so we have a guy who kind of makes Benedict Donald look tame\nI'm In favor of torture you know that and the people are too I thought that the ... through the vote you won't change anything in this country not nothing absolutely nothing it's only going to change unfortunately when we get to a civil war doing the job but the military regime didn't do killing thirty thousand\nWell that most of our own and he's the new president elect in Brazil and you've thought we had problems However I've got an ad I've got an add this\nThere was a reference to it by Shasta drawing from CNN and I'm no expert on Brazilian politics but if you know Brazil recent Brazilian history it recent Brazilian political history there's a name Lula\nAnd that's the name we need to know ... and he is a guy he's the guy and right now he's in prison um he was the guy he was the president he was the guy very very popular and by the way I've been I've been going after these radicals in any way\nYou want definition\nBrazil has rocketed from left to right Lula Lula was the left and here's the way they're defining it in their usage he was for the poor and against the rich\nBig government in favor of the poor against threats that tell they're defining it and that's my observation\nLeft versus right in Brazil is Lula was fighting for the poor against the rich and was going to use the government to do it now if you want to apply that to America that's fine but at least let's have that as a common definition the problem with Lou was he was very very\nCorrupt very very corrupt and in fact it appears that there's a lot of corruption in the whole country and so they're sick of it the people just can't his stomach it any more\nCrimes gone crazy and there's a lot of problems in Brazil we got problems they got problems\nAnd so they rocketed from left right out of frustration that's my view of the matter by the way\nWill America ever rise up and frustration about guns\nShortly after seven AM this warning seven ten am [noise]\nOur school resource officer called in that there was shot fired in school\nAnd then he had a victim of the student was shot [noise]\nOfficers were there were several officers

issue of left and right and deserved it versus liberal here the definitions as best as I can do and I don't really found\nIn America seems if you're in favor of more and more government of people's lives\nThen you're a liberal if you want less and less government of people's lives you're a conservative I'm cool with that definition if you want to sign on to that one that's great but don't call

about home protects and you know made\nWell regulated militia to hunt deer and a dog though not about suppressing the ... direction and they are bad apple there is J's rebellion and the whisky rebellion which occurred during the time of our founding fathers\nAbsolutely didn't Washington themselves will lead the troops in just in in suppressing one of the forget which one it is but George Washington and oh yeah he led the incentives so\nThat would be like Ronald Reagan parachuting from the door of uh the one thirty entered written eight\nOh what an image there well I don't know are there any hide anyway they're going to hang on\nTo as an example of that is not about rappelling a born in ... in\nOur founding fathers knew the war of Eighteen twelve was coming and they were able to prepare for it\nAnd what they did was not called for individually owned arms to be but they formed a public private partnership with the spring grail a and Massachusetts and a Harpers Ferry and Virginia\nArmory in order to provide the boulders where uniform weapons that were at interchangeable bart\nOkay is the second amendment that if it's not about rappelling up for it and they done and it's not about the press thing of domestic ah insurrection\nPutting down flavor billions\nAt like back away right it about red grieving cattle property and returning it to its rightful owners write it up the or the fugitive slave act\nThe idea originally was that the there were a lot of slave rebellions a lot of slaves really didn't like being slaves and there were slave rebellions and the south was very very concerned that the north was going to free the slaves and so they demanded as part of the price of admission to the union they said we've got to have\nThe right to guns so we could put down a slave rebellions and if you northerners try anything will have guns to repel you as well who is very very and I was reading you know back when we were debating these issues and a couple of years ago or something\nI went back and looked at the these are the secession statements by the state legislatures because when the south in the southern states started seceding\nThey didn't just like stopped talking and say you know by the way we left they passed resolutions in their state legislatures and one of them and it was like in the first part goes either Georgia\nSouth Carolina Mississippi was one of those on American states where in the first paragraph it was slavery is the foundation of our economy\nSo it was obvious in Eighteen sixty one that they were quite aware that slavery and stealing free labor from fellow humans as chattel property as you quite correctly put it was the foundation of their economy men as the most in more often than I ever\nHeard and they then they declare that they have to leave the union to preserve that are you kidding me still holding cells Christians are yeah do you mind\nWhy did we not repealed and that can embed but when we were passing the thirteenth fourteenth amendment and the post civil war years the answer is we were elbow deep and genocide with the aboriginal people of North America\nAnd best thing handles everything on

A. R. R. and we've never heard of him because the special counsel never makes it as a speech there's there's no point to having a spokesman I mean it's kind\nOf a way to government money truth\nBe told me why would damage spokesman if you never make a statement and he's like never made a statement except now he's made a statement now we know\nYes there is a ... there's a jet the guy had been waiting around all the time they go what man gave me a statement to make my job let me do something productive anyway Peter card now has issued a statement\nAnd the statement I'm summarizing it it it says\nAbout a week ago we got these reports that there were people who were making or be solicitor to make allegations of so we were for the whole mess over to the FBI\nSo the special counsel as soon as they heard about it they refer to thing to be a ... [noise] and they asked the FBI to launch an investigation now that is a hoax gone wonderfully a rye and I do have the best words I mean come on you gotta you gotta confess\nI had the best word is a hoax\nGoing wonderfully are right and I'm going to post I'm going to posted the first break in just a little while I'm going to post\nOn our social media sites though linked to the Natasha Bert ... story in the Atlantic so you can get it right straight from the source and\nYou know she should get the credit but I mean I'm not going to plagiarize or work she's a reporter who really really kind of lead the breaking of this story although there were whispers and there were other reporters in any event\nOr this to me is the big story of the day and here's why and and and that's really saying some given Benedict dollar's gone to Pittsburgh even though people told them not to here's the reason I'm saying this is the big story of the day\nBecause this exposes the desperation that is in the Trump camp they must be so afraid of what Mueller has\nAnd they are sitting there knowing that we are how many days away now\n[noise] All right so they know that Mohler is got all these cooperating witnesses he's got on evidence they know there's a decent to good chance Democrat's gonna have some power in one or both of these houses come January because we're going to find out in\n[noise] and so they're freaking out\nBut I I Would suspect Benedict Donald who by the way the reports are now he's down to work in three hours a day [noise]\nAnd I think that's great I like in the work actually two hours a day on our day would be even better I'd rather have an incompetent Adolf Hitler want to be any competent Adolf Hitler wannabe\nAnd so ... by the way we have seen your legal analysts type today we have senior legal and all this time today\nAnd it's exactly that thought it is Benedict Donald becoming Adolf Hitler junior it turns out the more on his actually starting to learn on the job I mean taking them almost two years to start to fit I'm not gonna give him credit for speed and efficiency and all that\nBut the dummy is actually starting to learn on the job and this is what I'm afraid I'll be starting to learn to be Adolf Hitler you know you gotta like do things like what are you talking about a year and he's going there Paul Walker and sell them no and I know why Paul Ryan is telling them no anyway we'll get the senior legal enlisted in the beginning of the next hour\nBut it's also politics Benedict Donald as a trust you've heard Benedict Arnold is talking about issuing executive order\nThat would effectively overturn a key portion of the fourteenth amendment right and as they trust you know is a good American no executive order from any president legitimate fake or otherwise no executive order can overturn the constitutional provision I mean you just can't do that that's not the way this thing works\nSo anyway Benedict Arnold I don't think he has any intention of doing remember when he started talking about amending the constitution\nAnd by executive order what was the relationship to the election [noise] all\nRight so remember this is politics is about ... up the Nazi base and he's gone the phone not see now I mean the guy's problem itself a nationalist right I mean he's he's gone to Pittsburgh\nWhen they're telling them don't do it he is he's going all in on the full on on American you know radical Nazi agenda\nOn gambling that he can ginned up his base and get them out these cameras there are some big numbers my question to you is I mean aside from who's going to jail because that's always my quick question is who's\nGoing to do is eat joining up our base and by the way out you're watching on the norm can we stream video as well as audio through norm angle mendota time I got my voted sticker on because France's line\nMy wife and I we live right here in California and we are permanent absentee voters which makes it very easy the states and the

your status and you bring a friend\nBring two friends this is literally the most important election of my lifetime and then there's not even a presidential like ... ballots lot up there it's all about Congress\nAll about Congress these are the congressional elections we need to take over one or both houses of Congress the focus is Congress every two years and then\nPlease remember that's the foundation of our system we have the entire house in one third of the Senate every two years like clockwork since Seventeen eighty eight and we haven't stopped since and every other time\nThey had the president in their how's that for a change of prospect [noise] every couple of congressional elections they say oh yeah like now it's over the president to the original focus that we would have put ourselves in John Adams the Jews and look at is there a we're one of those in George Washington's wouldn't teach for yourself and measures are going\nThrough their eyes that's the way they wanted us to look at the system they wanted us to say every two years house representatives and I I Know who my congressman is I'm a I'm a I'm back in those is among his rear end and all that kind of stuff right so if the if you want to hear from George Washington Thomas Jefferson and the old boys you know the original guys\nThey wanted us to think of it as Congress first president second that's why Congress has article one of the U.S constitution please take a look article one is Congress it's the longest it's got the most words and we know what those words are as a vest worse article one is Congress the house of representative\nIs A People's house Nancy Pelosi goes around saying it all the time she's right it's the people's house that was originally intended to be our house and so every two years we can take it and keep it and hold it\nAnd so that's why it's a congressional elections and so California please remember the state's run the elections so I live in a normal state with\nNormal people very few Republicans in other third the Republican Party is the third party in California by me independents Democrats independents then Republicans even in San Diego county my goodness that was always a Republican struggle than other third party even in San Diego\nSo a normal state like California run by normal people who actually believe in democracy with a small D say of course let's make it easy for people to vote and so my wife and I took advantage of that because we live in a normal state we were able to do our voting very very simply if you live in an abnormal\nState then you have an extra heavy burden you've got to make your state normal you've got to you know make make your state normal again and it's up to you to engage in if they're making it hard if you're in North Carolina\nRight to Georgia I mean there's a lot of these these Republican states and doing everything they can to stop people from voting\nSo if you're in one of those abnormal states you the burdens on you to work extra hard to make your state normally think about Wisconsin right you remember what Scott Walker came in there and he was busted in the unions and they did the recall and any one of the recall and then he won reelection I mean this is hard\nWork you don't always when\nWe're up against some very very nasty forces however\nTo me the big story of the day is a desperate attempt and I'd really like to know how deep into this old Benedict Donald is because\nThere's this there's a\nThing called surefire intelligence surefire intelligent you'll find it in an

Norman gold man show on Facebook the norm angle manager on Facebook at\nNorman gold man on Twitter and\nSo you'll be able to read that article for yourself it's very interesting I'd like to know how how far this goes close to Benedict Donald because there is a desperate\nPlot to discredit the special counsel because they know with Robert Mueller about to be hopefully protected released from my perspective by the Democrats holding one or both houses of Congress they can protect Robert ... they can have\nHim you know subpoenaed come over bring your reports they can leak things right the Democrats' controlling one or both houses of Congress is beyond the central at this point the survival of the nation almost kinda rides on here\nThey are also laying white roses said the name of each victim had a memorial in front of the Senate God as\nBill recover CBS News and trying hard not to vomit\nWe can hear I tell you a there are protesters who are chanting quite loudly\nSurely the first lady and first family can hear the protesters I Can't hear exactly what they're saying\nWhat they are loud enough to be set aside shore and\nThat is David ... of CBS News and we again thanks CBS News for that this is what they have brought to us and we need to figure out a way to fix this justice has to be served next with justice or\nIndeed knows finding the right higher takes time away from your business hiring unqualified data engineer felt like a second job more job seekers using deep in any other site so there's no better place to find someone with the skills you're looking for I needed someone with a masters in computer science and database experience\nPlus indeed screener questions hope you find your shortlist fast now I'm back to having just one job the way more than three million companies worldwide using deet to hire poster job in ... dot com slash higher indeed the world's number one job site source ...\nVisiting angels as Americans to lengthen senior home care we believe your loved one should never have to give up living at home visiting angels provide personal home care up to twenty four hours per day including meals and light housework asked about our demented care at\nHome you let your professional caregivers look up to the angels dot com or called eight seven seven three seven four limbs that eight seven seven three seven four Lance\nYeah man I\nHave a few of them and rules casinos courts have oh they have a holiday of of what's\nGoing on well I think I Want to leave the kitchen where I've been cooking green chili cheese burgers embryos into a lot of income on the eye because once in awhile I let\nYou do that but then they take out your paycheck hope\nYou anyway and you will love ...

feeling\nOf American family mean to hell and little\nTractor on fourth street two blocks north of Kendall area or makes a tractor dot com\n\nAnd\nTo me the big story of the day is Robert Mueller basically busting a whole speak perpetrated against Robert Mueller he learned the special counsel learned that there was this effort to bribe women to make false sexual harassment and misconduct allegations against him\nAnd so he reported to the FBI a bunch of reporters have been getting these you know kind of shopping around the old we got some dirt on rubber motivating so now it's all exploding and everybody's bases all the bad guy is an egg on their face and I have just posted so you can read it for yourself and the ... the Atlantic she gets the credit\nCheck it out none Norman Goldman show on Facebook the link is right there at Norman Goldman on Twitter or you just go to the Atlantic ride the Atlantic dot com you can read it for yourself right there\nHowever we need to understand that\nAnd it did Donald only cares about the people that vote for him and give him money and support him that's all he cares about so when he goes to Pittsburgh despite all the civic leaders saying don't come here and you'll notice none of the Republican congressional leaders went with him he was going by himself inserting himself\nPushing his way into a situation where he was he wanted because he wants that optic for his base he only cares about his base so when people protesting\nKind of three years Mr from your worst and your policies bones in a growing white nationalist movement me loves us stuff\nThen why\n\nThose protesters\nSinging and as you heard from David bend your CBS they were within earshot of you know who\nJewish leaders voicing their preference about a presidential visit the White House responded by deciding to stick a thumb in their eye and immediately schedule a presidential visit for Pittsburgh well here's the real problem with that the funerals\nPittsburgh is going to start burying there than the first of the funerals for those who were killed in this attack will start and not have practical consequences and that led the mayor of the city of Pittsburgh to make this public service will play\nHe told reporters today quote we did not have enough public safety officials to provide enough protection at the funerals and to be able at the same time to draw attention to a potential presidential this\nIf the president is looking to come to Pittsburgh I Would ask that he not do sell while you're burying the dead\nAs Rachel Maddow we think MSNBC for the clip that his last night's Rachel Maddow show and the funeral started today the burial started today and Benedict Donald when bullied this way in and\nOf course he's happy to say on the road when it's somebody that he perceives being rude to him but he doesn't see that as the any of these standards applied to him as well don't the road so he can be as rude is he wants and that's fine well I'm Glad the protesters were there and I'm Glad\nThat he heard them mark thank you were getting started today are real talk nine ten in the San Francisco bay area mark\nAnd or how you doing well it's crazy times but you know what say you know what's happening right there you go\nThat's right and you know in seven days we can reject eight and let's let's talk about the Republican outlined with warm for\nTheir this election it's based on hate fear\nAnd and division they have nothing for the American people their tax scam is it's been brought out to light and everybody knows it's a scam they ... they are basically are lying about pre existing conditions saying there for it\nWhen they were against it for years and they know that people want health care their whole their whole a basic a format\nUh for the American people it is\nAbsolutely nothing and so what are they running on fear and hate and that's what this whole country's full of right now because of this Republican Party and their leader Donald Trump\nThey shrunk and purified marked and they've been reduced now to essentially the white nationalist movement\nI mean when Brett Kavanaugh was being was up there with his beer comments and ... do you like we're saying what when all that stuff was happening there were supporters of is making that white power assigned behind him you know where they move their fingers in a way makes it look we give them the okay science but in their crazy white nationalist world they're\nBehind the man who they were jamming on to the Supreme Court they was signaling to their supporters that this is a white power guy\nThat their signal and there you can see it all over the Internet you just look at it and and you see it everywhere and there were people by break cabinet giving that signal this is this is who is in control of the government now more and they are now that we are so close to this election how close are we\n[noise] that they are now freaking out and they are truly just shedding all of the pretense mark all of the all the all the claims to respectability you're just out he's calling himself a nationalist\nHe's going against the global list and that's code word for the Jewish international\nConspiracy he's speaking the language of the store owners of the Nazis and and I'm hoping these enormous early voting numbers we're seeing are people saying do all of you were ... you've shown us who you are and you are so Addy and\nGet him out I'm really hoping that we can just something so soundly that the Republican Party kind of shrivel up and goes away for a while they have to reform mark this is a there aren't acceptable there on America now this this is this an insurgency in our nation and they've taken older the government and now they're showing this truly who they are\nAnd really norm all there are about is stealing from the American people as much money as they can to give to the rich donors and and they they have no nothing\nTo ah you know really put this country forward\nOr they're just basically a avid agenda for the for their donors they're owned by the Koch brothers and and some of the other foundations that they formed and and just like um if you look at what nor a Norquist said he said he didn't care who the president was as long as he had five digits well\nThis is a really a good indication of what happens when you have an idiot like a Norquist and the Republican Party that are willing to just put anybody up there are just so they can get their ugly agenda through it's a sad day norm\nMarta ... well for the last fifty years you and I've been watching this build and\nThe thing that really scared me was when Ronald Reagan in Nineteen Seventy nine before he was even elected\nMe to deal with

from us flooding and and and hurricane relief [noise]\nAnd and they transferred of course to the down to the the mortar where it costs are paying something I'm not just aren't fifty dollars a day to keep your children again if you if you if you don't have any incentive in the panhandle to vote against Trump after they've taken millions of dollars away from your potential relate to get your back on your feet you know\nHow I don't think I can handle is doing so well I'm not sure that FEMA and all those folks are doing such a hot job I mean the people that were a little upset\nYeah that's my point they they've they've they've they've taken away millions of a total orange chicken I made the hours from various agencies and at least ten million from a you know from FEMA and the point is you know if these people aren't there aren't many now that they can't get their ticket might need to get back on their feet and and they still go vote Republican then you know it is or what they get\nWell if I were them I say what do you think I Am Puerto Rico Joe I got to leave it there thank you very much that the arrogance to these people that is their arrogance hey you can do that the Puerto Rico they real Americans but on wind here in the panhandle of Florida My ... got to be here for me and I\nI haven't had a chance to look in lately\nBut from what I last saw I don't think the folks in the panhandle who are running the red rock rib Republicans I\nDon't think they're all that impressed with the Benedict Donald response Joe thank you so much for the call as always it's one eight eight eight three two one six zero zero one let us do senior legal analysts\nTime and allow me to preface senior legal analyst time by saying it's all politics please remember where we are on the calendar what's happening in\nThis is all about what's happening in seven days some legal scholars claiming with US citizenship without changing the\nWay that could have water is that\nOr have you thought about that is\nTotally off it was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member of and you don't want no one you don't need that nobody can can you do well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in as a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us it's ridiculous and it has to and have you talked about how so young\nWhere in the protests in the process it'll happen\nWhat are the executive order that's what you're talking about but I had to say I didn't think anybody that knew that but me I thought it was the only one\nThat is ... reporter Jonathan Swan with Benedict Donald and Benedict Donald is out there saying he's got legal ... I don't believe a word of it by the way and then when he says he's in process it does all this stuff is just BS however leaves you remember where we are [laughter]\nThis is all about ... up his base their full non Nazis now\nThe president's looking at executive action I don't know the Congress has looked at legislative action to reconsider that [laughter] but are brought objective here is what we need we need to fix a broken immigration system\nI there's your illegally legitimate vice president\nAnd we need to have a system where people know how to come into the United states huh legally system is working for the American people first and that is working in an orderly way like if it from my grandfather when it came through Ellis Island when he was twenty three years of age from Ireland\nAre now that's illegal illegitimate vice president and the reason I played that clip was because of the trolls that we got yesterday one of the troll calls yesterday was parroting that\nLine if they just show up with papers legally everything will be fine here's the problem when the doorway is the size of a key hole that's point number one point number two\nThat's legal immigration there's a whole separate thing called asylum where you need emergency relief from persecution far away that kind of thing\nAnd asylum is not show up at the door with your papers in order it's like apples and watermelons they're two very different fruits these are just yeah they both ended up getting into the United states I suppose uh but\nThey're very very different ways of getting in like running the ball into the end zone and throwing the ball in the end zone\nBut what pants is doing this is their talking point now they're talking point is\nWe're totally with all kinds of\nPeople of color just do it the way we want\nWhich is ... three people in every seven years through this tiny little portal and and have all your papers and everything and by the way when he's talking about his grandfather and and and that will silent\nPeople showing up at Ellis Island in all kinds of different shapes forms and conditions if they didn't have diseases and stuff and you also need to know when because prior to Nineteen twenty to the United states had a much more relaxed\nImmigration policy things started to get very tight there were times prior to Nineteen twenty two there were some tightened the tightening up here and there but for the most part part of the Nineteen twenty two things are pretty wide open and we wanted a lot of people in this whole business of we don't want anyone anymore as a recent phenomenon okay so\nUnderstand everything that you and I are about to talk about is all about the politics of illegal immigration it's all about the politics of the caravan it's all about the politics of getting the white\nEaten it must not go dragging knuckleheads at our Benedict Donald's of borders to to just drink again\n... boys dog needs dinnertime\nOwn if you get to me were fine do as a dog\nBecause other people because they're animal as though he's referring to in the Carolinas people these are animals once\nYou go there we can all go there and you have forfeited your right to complain because you went there first yeah that's how it works you got to live by the same rules as the rest of us are\nFourteenth amendment I'm not going to read it to you but essentially says if you're born on this and this or you're a citizen of the reason they did that was because there was a Supreme Court decision before the civil war that said slaves our citizens and never could be citizens and it's called Dred Scott\nAnd so in after the civil war then we got to fix this if you were a slave and they made slaves citizens right there in the thirties amendments\nThey abolish slavery that was the movie Lincoln with Daniel Day Lewis was all about abolishing slavery the thirteenth amendment well then the fourteenth amendment right we had more amendments after that and the fourteenth is very powerful and the fourteenth at a whole lot of things\nWell one of the things that the fourteenth amendment did was make it very very clear\nThat if you're born on this or you're a citizen if you're subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and obviously if you're born here you're subject to the jurisdiction United States\nBenedict Arnold got a political problem because rich elites in in China and rich elites in Russia and\nElsewhere in other countries that\nThey're they have they're pregnant wife fly in and and give birth and there are there are special resorts and hotels big pricey resorts and it's called birthright vacations and birth rate bake a birthright tourism and\nIt's a real big thing and there have been busts here in Southern California against Chinese rings because they want to have children that are American citizens so they can get all that in that chain migration do when they're boys\nSo if Benedict Donald really serious about this you know of course have to talk to his buddies in as owners in Moscow and and in Beijing and get their permission and this\nSo here's the problem\nThis guy and we know who this guy is right this guy he is the forty fifth guy right now hasn't been a woman yet so he's a forty says the guy\nIf\nOne of his forty four predecessors could issue an executive order to overturn a portion of the constitution don't you think they would have tried\nReady to take on your\nLast week so why are\nLeast the tractor on Wall street two blocks north of capital area or miss a tractor dot com [noise]\nNo problem at a green light auto sales job at a down payment they'll get you the green light for green cards not only that but your new set of wheels also comes with a twelve month\nTwelve thousand miles power for a more allowing you to drive away with ... and there's no high pressure ... where you can enjoy rely more carve I it's very green light auto sales on ... east of Louisiana the green light auto ...\nSales were every sale gets the green light [noise]\n[noise]\nI Try and live by principals and one of my guiding principles is it in a democracy we should have as many people as possible participating\nAnd that's why I'm a big fan of this automatic\nVoting registration and Oregon the great state of Oregon got going and then my sneak out where he says a brilliant idea right in the states know who we are they issued our driver's\nLicenses they generally have our birth certificates they have the the states in which we live how will I think about it in whatever state you live in your state has a lot of information about your property records there's all manner\nOf stuff the states know who lives there and who's eligible to vote and who's not a ... vote so the state's who'd register\nTheir own people without just asking you and in fact in Oregon and California we opt out now yeah and then these other states that are doing it it's kind of sweeping the nation now you the staple register you automatically give you a short period of time like three weeks whatever say no thank you\nIt seems to me that's a better way of doing it because we're maximizing\nThe possibility of getting people involved in Judy's home state of Colorado Judy's on old and she's about to rejoin us in Judaism state of Colorado and Judy correct me if I'm wrong the stages like males your ballot whether you want it or not duty is that what happens is they just mail you a ballot\nI Believe I signed up to get my mail mail in ballot\nOkay well so I Love the idea of caucuses because everything you said is very merit tourists in my humble opinion in my opinion doesn't count for anything anyway but I Love the idea of citizens getting together and everybody joined the fat\nAnd everybody getting their opinion and it's all civil and you get to know your neighbors but Judy that's not a possibility for a lot of people and to make political power dependent upon them\nMaking that kind of a time commitment when they can't I think it's very discriminatory it's exclusionary to purchase painting a democracy now I'll stop in one second cause I just want to give you a really ... for example\nIn twenty sixteen just in the last presidential election in the great state of Washington they had a caucus system that ... that\nActually gave the the the delegates away and Bernie won convincingly then\nA couple of months later they did what back when I was in the ... and the kid in the sixties called beauty contests right there were primaries it or not binding and so ... now and then me too movement oh we don't pump beauty contest anymore by the way in the sixties they were all men there were all men\nAnd they were called beauty contests so in any event or what would they they are the reason that caused as a non binding primary\nWashington state shortly out two months after the ... did a non binding primary and Hillary robbed because the turnout was so much more broad you had a much broader view of the electorate and Hillary won the non binding primary and Bernie won the ... was his part or since it was his partisans that had\nThe time and the energy and the commitment to show up at the at the Congress is and I don't care look if we've slipped in Hillary romp in the cubs is Bernie won the primaries it'd be exactly the same point that's why I started by saying\nI have principles I don't care who the individual winners and losers are if the principles are true if the principles of right then the results will be whenever they ought to me doesn't that make sense\nIt makes sense you I hear your point my only concern is and I can't tell you the source that I heard this but that uh with primaries which you vote and they can be more subjective to hanky panky voter suppression kinds of um tactic so\nThat well but the remedies do this to fix the voting systems ... voter verifiable paper trail I\nMean that's that's the ... that's got all the elections in the primaries Judy I you know to me your presentation\nReally kinda reveals wealth and income inequality because there's a lot of people who just don't have the luxury to be able to devote to the time in the interest in the energy the Baltics as you do I wish we all could that's not the world we live in unfortunately Judy\nIf we're going to make a deal if you and I were like politicians in a room and we were trying to make a deal I Would say look you want to\nHave called is his last August is and will reserve what ten percent of the delegates for the people in the caucuses but it's got to be the bulk of the delegates the vast\nMajority of that to be for the most broad as possible\nGroup of Democrats talk in the primaries now no Republicans are independents only Democrats primary the party picking its nominee so I Would say look I Want as many and if my candidate loses I'm cool with that it doesn't matter\nThe ideas that healthy democracy not this candidate or that candidate in this primary stop living so much in the moment our nation's going down the toilet here Paul I know you know our nation's going down the toilet here we can have these kinds individual fights anymore\nWell I went to one ... of fact I ended up leaving that was the one you're talking about I ever want to see another one I mean you're talking about voter suppression died for caucuses are\nSo [laughter] and your right arm and I was going to talk for burning and then the primary ended up voting for Hillary because in the interim\nPeriod I decided that Bernie has become entirely too divisive and that's what happened there\nI'm just like to have the maximum voter participation you always hear me decrying Ninety million people who are eligible to vote never bother that's an old side of apathy that's that's a sign of a very sick democracy and that's that's that's a democracy with the temperature of a hundred and two point do right and and you know the doctors over there saying\nOh maybe we should get you the hospital there's probably talk about how we got brain damage\nYeah we got some serious issues here and so I I'm I'm very very concerned and so to me one way to restore faith in our institutions does he get people participating in our institutions\nRice and I want to feel so cynical\nAnd that's where I'm at now you're going to say that if they call your way to
