loving and open and embracing and they really really embrace the Jewish community and there's all kinds of interfaith activities that had\nBeen going on that nobody ever talks about and I'm really really glad to see that out of this horrific catastrophe that Benedict Donald has caused that we are seeing people rise above it and come together we did that in the first hour as well as the second hour to check it all out at Norman Goldman dot com but I I\nI Need to share a news story with you\nAnd that is it ... it may sound depressing but it's just reality and we just work with the facts and live with the truth\nDon McGahn Don McGahn was the White House counsel from the beginning of the time that Benedict Arnold got into the White House so Don McGahn is the guy who has been the White House counsel from the beginning and he just left\nThe president or a like a lot of what his White House counsel Don McGahn did but it was clearly bitter about the fact that the Mueller investigation the Russia probe continues there you go that's\nWill Blitzer and we think CNN for that Don McGahn is a bad guy in my humble opinion Don McGahn is responsible for Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh those where he's guys and he got them through so I'm no fan of Don McGahn\nBut Don McGahn on the other hand work with the facts live with the truth when Benedict Donald ordered Don McGahn to get mole or fired a month after Mahler was first appointed Don McGahn said no and if you tell me to do it again I'm going to quit and you fire him yourself\nAnd Benedict I'm of course 'cause he's a coward back down so Benedict Donald now has gotten rid of Don McGahn he's gotten rid of Don McGahn\nAnd right after the election next week I suspect Jeffrey symbol regard sessions and don't be surprise surprise if Rod Rosenstein goes with him next week there's going to be right after the election I'm back in the production business Benedict Donald is itching\nAnd sharing that final set of environmental atoll island cat and Donald child that Donald Trump of crossing a lot about the ... and ... kind of put on some ... was put into place falling again with White House counsel and have time for St ... at the\nCast a cloud over the presidents have this ongoing investigation they really for sex than it on our sources tell us and what was otherwise very positive outgoing and the gas tax that play I got a cat and operate in the Supreme Court\nAh Seventeen I was saying the taste of it for a law office that they really kind of you know had the final five but it seemed like a real fickle five for the president was so the ...\nAnd ... from CNN we think CNN for that and yeah Don McGahn on a final meeting with Benedict down there are reports that it really didn't go well because ... the Donald is bitter that that Don McGahn did not get rid of Muller and he blamed sessions he blamed him again blames everybody but of course he'll never blame him self blame you\nIn any event I Need to raise a flag of caution here just for a moment\nThat you and I cannot let the ideas seep into our heads\nThat election day is kind of the end of history that election day is the end of it and if we have a good night on election night than we can relax and go home and forget this\nI'm really sorry to have to tell you this it's gonna get really bad right after the election Benedict Donald is going to move now that McGahn is gone he's got a new guy in their\nNew White House counsel passive alone will have his hands full stepping into his job as the White House braces for potential legal storms following November's midterm the Washington DC based lawyer is also a former Justice Department official during President George H W Bush's administration\nWhen he was first being considered in August President Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow put out a statement praising ... ability passable Loni is a brilliant attorney I have had the privilege to work with than I can attest to his skill integrity our knowledge and the law civil\nOn these hiring shows the White House is gearing up than the Democrats take the house which could lead to a number of new investigations that the Trump Administration and perhaps even an impeachment battle\nThat is Jessica dean and we think CNN again for that\nAnd that's why I'm back in the prediction business and that's why I'm saying is right after the election because if the Democrats have a good night we've already covered the the polling and things are looking very promising for the Democrats next Tuesday remember we thought that was happening two years ago but if the Democrats have a very good night next week\nAll of a sudden Benedict Arnold has a very short timeline because if the Democrats take back the house next week\nCome early January the Democrats will be in control the house and the subpoenas are going to start flying right but before January the third or fourth whenever the new house committees right and the first few days game right after the new year so the Democrats if they take the house and or the Senate\nCome early January it's going to be a Democratic House endorsed Senate or one or the other or boat\nAnd so Benedict Donald is sitting there saying okay the elections November the six them looking at the counter November seven as the Wednesday\nI mean gee whiz I've got a most of November and all of December I've got a fire sessions I got a fire Rosenstein I got a fire more I got to shut this whole thing down because only a little less than two months of the Republicans still control in Congress in the lame duck session\nSo\nIf Benedict Arnold does what I predict who's going to do which is right after he doesn't want to do it now because he figures it backfired the voters get mad and they'll go vote for Democrats right you got to wait until after the election you and I need to have\nThe energy ready to go and oppose him because we're going to need to force the current lame duck members of Congress to try and do something to stop him\nThe Democrats of course you're going to be coming in and gonna be going crazy but I just need to warn you I'm when I say going crazy going to be jumping up and down yelling and screaming but they won't have any power to do anything about it\nSo what I'm suggesting to you is is that we've got a stretch our time horizons here we can't live and die in the moment and say okay it's all going to be wonderful if we have a good night\nThat's only the beginning we need to win a lot of elections in a whole lot of series we need to win elections oh you know we need to do we do in elections and all these raises a Bernie thoughts about\nNow we need many of them to start running for school board city councils county commissions state legislatures and governors ships\nHas it right we need to win these races and we need to win them over and over and over again if I Hope you heard the show earlier I mean it's taken literally\nFifty

I'd really the question going I really want to grab\nA hold of what you just said because you just ... the giant nugget of gold and I really want amplified here which is we have got to stop thinking in the old\nPatterns I'm very very serious now we've got to stop thinking in the old ways I'll give you an example Doug Jones democratic senator of Alabama\nWe've got to start thinking of every single state as a potential democratic state\nFor example Mississippi next door to Alabama Mississippi they tried to be ...\nWell they have both US Senators up this this week I mean next week this election normally like add one senator but because of that there's been some kill ya ... one center at the time because of health and so\nIn Mississippi both US Senate seats are up and one of them has a as a former African American congressmen he's kind of a moderate Democrat but it's Mississippi Danny Mike Espy ESP why he was in Bill Clinton's cabinet\nMike Espy stands a very good chance of winning African American former congressman to be a U.S senator from Mississippi we got better or work as women striking distance of ... water cruise in Texas and so what we need to start doing Charles is expanding these playing field in our mind we need to make\nArkansas a battleground and Tennessee Phil Bredesen is in their right and he's gotten Taylor Swift endorsement that ought to be helping a guy anyway we need to start thinking differently and not just writing off the states in Georgia is way at the top of my list of states that we need to start reclaiming here\nAngel Gillum was going to win number one in but you have to understand that South Carolina North Carolina are you in North Carolina as they are very close to turning turning over not even have a a black governor within the next ten years in my opinion\nWell ... I mean South Carolina's going to take more work and more time but North Carolina North Carolina voted for Obama by fourteen thousand votes in two thousand and eight and then it went backwards because in twenty tend to Republicans took over in ... states with the gerrymandering and all of a sense is a ... they were able to do\nBut I chose I think you're right but what I'm suggesting that we need to do here is what we need we need to stop thinking that there are regions of the country and states in the nation that are off limits to Democrats we need to really stumped thinking that way\n[laughter] ... when she becomes governor ... one of the things you wouldn't have to think she's going to do with first the I think she's going to try to get your Ga here because the governor had their power number of\nPeople who are in ... expand Obamacare\nRight at your ... Ga Ga deliver to Georgia being like a six month are they like that George ... that'll be important because this is going to probably try to revamp the entire\nElection system you know make it easier to vote and if ... if the Democratic ... Georgia and electrical um columns two thousand twenty they don't need Ohio [laughter]\nThey'll have you know Florida Georgia I mean look at it like North Carolina\nSingled out in the seventies Charles think about the census\nBecause we're going to have a census in twenty twenty and if there's a democratic governor in Georgia then the census won't be a ... there's a decent chance of Democrats won't get railroaded where they rigged and fix use of the census because there'll be a democratic governor than sorry I'm not agreeing to these maps\nRight I mean the Democrats need to have power in the states especially in these descending ill that's what they call them the dissent ... censuses and so having\nStacey Abrams in their elected twenty teens she's going to be there to twenty twenty two which means he's going to be there when the census has done the same thing for Andrew Gillum in Florida we need to start taking the state's back", "show_name": "Norman Goldman", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "01"}
