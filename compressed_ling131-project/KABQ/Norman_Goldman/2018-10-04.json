month in a it was but I remember everything that's important including his identity and his name yeah\nBut you were talking about how women your first instinct is blame yourself to go and not even realize that you've been drunk I like old teen\nI thought I messed up I thought I did something stupid and it was my fault and I was embarrassed and ashamed and I didn't tell anyone yeah so you can't

C. O. M. I. T. Y. meaning fellowship no ... no a courtesy no comedy C. M. C. O. M. I. T. Y. no comedy or tradition left\nIt's just about power politics closed quotes and That's Chris Murphy on Twitter quote for two years McConnell has been carefully purposely breaking the Senate this is the final blow no comedy or tradition left it's just about power politics if you spent any time on the show here with me you've been hearing me say that\nI'm not the only ones seeing it this way\nThat's a sit in the United states senator he's inside the house he sees what's going on Mitch McConnell broke the United States Senate and he broke the U.S constitution when Merrick Garland got nominated and\nThe constitution is Boston because his whole electoral system that many Democrats if we refuse to accept that you've got to win state by state and you got to focus on the state that's the system we've got a win with so we got a giant mess we have an ocean of apathy\nNinety million that's a nine and a zero in Ninety million eligible to vote don't vote at all we have an ocean of apathy\nWe have a giant group of people who don't know their rear end for first base that\nWould be Republican Party we got a giant group of people many of the Democratic party who meanwhile enters sweetened their hearts in the right place but they don't have the patience of the of the knowledge to to settle in and learn and and do the grounding\nBoss didn't take over and so we're stuck in the situation with this notion of apathy taking this giant pool of people are way we've got this this much smaller pool of voters roughly evenly divided that gives power to these marginal little shift and that's\nHow we got here today and these dire consequences weren't obvious\nSo my question to you\nHow do we get out of this mess where do we go from here where do we go from here and and and and I'm I'm giving you that Chris Murphy tweet because I got I I'm ... personally just me I'm just from my own perspective I'm confronting a real\nReal crisis here\nI'm an attorney a licensed attorney in the

tonight with a straight face not lying say this is a legitimate Supreme Court\nI've got Chris Murphy on Twitter he saying the U.S Senate ain't legitimate anymore that's what I'm hearing him say for two years McConnell's carefully bubbly breaking the Senate the final blow no comedy your tradition left power politics\nYou know it's just it's just bare knuckle brute force now okay\nHow does it sound to have a license attorney said the United States Supreme court as illegitimate what are the implications of that don't obey their decisions go on a tax break I'm not advocating any of that at least not yet this is the kind of situation\nWe find ourselves in Mitch McConnell and the Republicans put us in the situation they blame us for Bork in Nineteen eighty seven you can have it however you want everybody's got their perspective bullet you and me please understand one thing led to all of us everybody\nStop leaves trying to talk about this in terms of principles there ain't no

progressive and I don't think conservatives are conservative there there's a bunch of bologna\nBut anyway go here I think those things don't matter label labels on line to go with a ... or Democrats or Republicans who's a political parties there identifiable their platforms that candidates I mean it's lasting worm\nWhat war is the issue what we want to be the party of the majority you said earlier\nWe already are we just don't know where we don't\nYou know but how do we have a majority how do we have the minority ruling that\nI'd been great to be four thousand dollar question yes\nSo there you know your ears what the Democratic Party need we need a checklist along these issues that the material that the polls show that the majority of Americans are are in favor of such as a a higher minimum wage were living wage um\nHealth care for all equality for\nA racial equality just item you know things that are so important\nTo once you have an ailing driven party you want a party that's present those are driven on the polls really is that why not do well there does not accurate no the ...\nAnd they were born in the morning to one of the polls say or what if the bulls were to say oh we want to get rid of rights for gays\nThis democratic more to say okay well the bulls they want to get rid of lights were getting right\nNow that's it you're you're kind of yeah it's it's not a poll driven party it's a value driven party and the way we know that the values are majority held values are very well so we get we do it by our values that we haven't\nHad the Republican Party that there are about the call themselves values voters yeah well not the same value to agree with you more [laughter] totally okay so we're going to put\nOur values up here and we're going to say you know
