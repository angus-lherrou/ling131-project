{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "This is about so if you're the prosecutor wouldn't you I mean if I were the prosecutor I Would say I want a second degree murder I Want to give the jury the option I Want to come back with some kind of a conviction and second degree is plenty fine\nBut the aggravated battery with a firearm is actually more here you\nAre in terms of being struck agreed to grieve ownership will buy our fencing rage or want to eat in the department of corrections but still ... percent and it's also probation double\nWhat George could fly serving ... mitigation give him probation on that effect\nFor ... for all sixteen oh that from the second degree\nRole on the second degree the judge and get probation for second degree murder\nIn Illinois that judge can give probation on the degree murder wow a firearm\nUm is punishable by a a a range of six Thirty years in the department of corrections served at five percent but I mean if the judge in ten years for example it's five percent of the ... and a half years\nYou know ... percent just so people don't get lost in our conversation here on them aboard why appreciate the call really thank you for teaching me stuff teaching us all stuff and in California we have a lot most of the ... now certainly all the violence serious once it's in the law now state law eighty five percent time I mean if you just give you ten years and you've done you know aggravated\nAssault or something that you know none of this you back in the old days they say oh you're not going to serve three days and walk out you know do eighty five percent of your time for a lot of these crimes and and if you're given ten years that's that's a lot of time going\nRight and so the second degree murder actually the punishment is much more lenient or at least it actually being much more lenient than the aggravated battery and the second degree murder ... if you may have heard the phrase perfect self defense\nWell that's what\nA certain degree in Illinois is don't know the word but surely define bad find the elements of first degree murder of additive and dark intentional or know committed an act it caused the death of another\nAnd what defines second degree they had to find one that ban\nBan them on your hold over with me please go do don't send me a bill banana my put you on hold our do is ended I'd love to

is a category ... storm Florida is starting to assess the damage after it made landfall this afternoon at Mexico beach as a strong category for storm storm chaser return or is that handled by city beach\nMore than ... plus\nCorrect um and uh that would be my gas I think what it is just\nMy own kind of reaction and I don't know anything more than what I've seen in the news reports and things like that and um my my\nSense of it is that Van Dyke hurt himself um testifying number one and number two just the the the sixteen shots I mean that that ultimately is what they had them in hard to justify sixteen shots\nRegardless of what I'm saying what did you say oh well I'm Sorry go ahead\nNo I mean I I I guess I mean once once it all came if I were on the jury and say come on sixteen bullets this is ridiculous\nOr if you're a thought that it was really a prosecutorial move that that the prosecutor said let me bring one county each for each bullet for aggravated battery with a firearm ... isn't that creative lawyering isn't that being good prosecutor\nIt is very creative laureen I'd never seen it done you know I've seen mine's really creative then\nYeah I you know I never um I was a prosecutor in Cook County for ten years we never you know if a victim was shot multiple times it was charged as you know one count of aggravated battery or one hour of attempted murder\nUm it was it won't count for each shot but having said that I think a previous caller may have suggested that those sixteen count\nRon consecutively that is why you know what free speech\nRight one after another right\nRight I I I I think I agree with that I think that it is essentially you wanna you know the the the the shots were fired in a matter of\nI I forget what the testimony was maybe ten seconds or Fifteen seconds something like that a very short period of time right I think that is\nActually one act so it would not be\nSomething that would be ... imagine a bar fight you know a guy for five watches the free orange I don't think so\nIt's a bar fight Brandon for participating in a bar fight right exactly\nSo you just go to the judge it sounds to me like the judge would do that the judge would fold all sixteen of these convictions into one\nThat's correct yes let me ask you this and that is his second degree murder a lesser included offense to first degree murder\nIn Illinois state law and it doesn't so it doesn't have to be charged separately that was one of the issues with one of the previous callers I mean I just uh to me\nThat I mean I just don't remember enough about the criminal law in various states that wasn't my air as a civil litigator ah but I there's so many crimes that are lesser included defense is we don't have to charge each of the subsidiary crimes in that\nLine they're just there and and they can be accessed as needed\nI hate to make it sound so transactional\nBut I mean did the prosecutor need to charge a senator from your description might get the at the jury instruction conference or the judge said well the fact the evidence indicates those can be first or second and I think I have to give a second degree that would be the way I Would see an unfolding I mean you know more about it than I Do I Do and what do you think\nI I think you're absolutely right now I'm ... now it's\n... he was charged with first degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm be the second degree murder occurred during the jury instruction tired first when\nYou know I don't know which side I think there were some reports and then I may have requested the second degree but I I don't know\nUm but one side or the other or the charge on his own\nSure it was five days you respond day that's one of our favorites around here a suicide bomb thing is very popular has the best words go ahead\n[laughter] so yeah and second degree murder you know I think what you have to think about second degree murder as it it isn't perfect self defense approve it felt the fear in Illinois you would think that for that the victim or the alleged victim\nUh what was the threat that the threat posed was imminent and deadly as somebody in exposed to that threat could use deadly force\nIf um they could if they believe better the victim or this person who was shot up a a a a threat or a deadly threat if the ... in this case I Would have had to prove that line\nThat a child to read a deadly threat and number two that\nAt McDonalds oh if the threat was reasonable and that's where\nTheir defense on this issue affecting debris fell apart that Van Dyke at the but we but I think the jury found that if we was unreasonable and so that would be a second grade\nAnd um I Can't thank you enough for ... I got to leave it there and I know you have other things to do as well but you have been a valuable an important part of the show and I do thank you so much and\nI you know call me again any time and contribute as much as you like I always get emails to norm at Norman Goldman dot com Norman Norman Goldman dot com whenever we have a lawyer call in and we do the two lawyers talking about the thing

then boredom and fast I mean you get all these these emotions together by the way it's the same thing with insurance\nThe exact same thing with insurance okay I Want to get to a story I promise this story we've gotten lined up for you it won't take more than a minute or two it's really weird and I feel it's definitely worth a moment or two of our time after that\nIt's you and me on the phones the rest of the way I Do have a few open lines they do have people on hold if you're on hold you're guaranteed to be on with me and just a minute or two to stick with me but if you got a couple of minutes one eight eight eight\nThree two one six thousand one one eight eight eight three two one six zero zero one I'm confident they can get John before the show ends however however\nThere is a guy there well it turns out I guess it was that was the guy there was a guy and a and this was the story of what happened to this man it it it it's a straight out of one of these novels\nJournalists from all showed a critic of the Saudi Government who vanished last week after entering the Saudi Arabia's conflict and stumble Turkish officials say he was killed there an allegation Saudi officials are denied\nAn image from a security camera that appears to show to show me walking into the consulate last week we see no evidence that he ever walked out of State Department spokesman today said that ... was Saudi officials and like the U.S does not know what happened to show the vice President Pence tweeted that he's deeply troubled about reports of showing that\nNow that is Chuck Todd and we think NBC News for that clip you can't make this stuff up\nAren't as I trust you know the Saudi Arabian government is a royal monarchy right I mean it's not a democracy women have very very few writes oh and they're making some reforms women are now starting to be allowed to drive with another man president\nOr you get the idea Saudi Arabia they do hanging Z do beheadings\nSaudi Arabia were it not for the oil would be internationally especially is by the United states condemn for its its human rights abuses its lack of democracy oh by the oil is very important in their Saudi Arabia\nAnd all of that factors in because Benedict Donald and his good for nothing son in law Jared Kushner\nAre very very close to the highest ranks of the Saudi Arabian government meaning the royal family and there is reporting and I do believe it's the New York times yes it's the New York times that's reporting this\nThe New York times is reporting that Turkish security officials\nAre alleging that the quote I I did my notes as my own am writing quote the highest levels of the royal court\nClosed quote quote the highest levels of the royal court ... court in Saudi Arabia ordered the murder of this man\nJamal ... who is Saudi but self exiled to the United states and he was a contributor for the Washington Post and he was critical of the Saudi Government and their human rights abuses on and on we go so he was he was obviously\nA guy that the Saudi Government was not impressed with\nWell he's gotten divorced when he wants to get remarried he needed some papers from the government of Saudi Arabia Saudi a citizen so he went into\nI wouldn't have done it I would've I would've done it in the United states although anyway he chose to go to turkey is Campbell right giant city assemble turkey

pending business with Sam with us on AM nine fifty K. TANF in the twin cities Sam I use the break to go and do some Internet research in what my research tells me is that a consulate and an embassy are the same thing that I was right\nHere's the difference that I can tell so far the difference is an embassy is the largest representation and it goes generally in the capital city a consulate is a smaller version not in the capital city\nBut in other of the major cities of the nation such that the United states will have one embassy in Ottawa\nCanada the nation's capital or they will have consulates in kind of in a conflict in satellite cities like Toronto and Montreal Vancouver so I\nAs far as I can tell I haven't completed my research only in a few minutes there is still all that diplomatic territory space stuff I haven't seen anything to the country and everything I'm seeing is that the only difference is one is kind of a junior embassy that serves out in the hinterlands in larger cities not the capital what do you think\nAre quite honestly that's that's just not what I was hearing earlier today\nOr you could very well be right I didn't have a chance to really research at very early either 'cause I was driving\n[laughter] so but I I did want to point out one other thing the fact that a Saudi Arabia as as you said to do I'm a search really doesn't mean very much because as I was also hearing today on the radio later in the day\nOr perhaps while you were already on the air is that uh the\nAs I understand it there's evidence or or they're they're talking about the idea that uh the poor guy has been chopped\nInto little so he's already been ... so it is that's right I mean I totally agree with you can say they do a search to the embassy I mean at this point it's kind of a snarky sick joke because they're like hey we we had a bone so I mean\nI didn't want to get into the details but I mean the New York times is reporting that the Turkish authorities are saying the Fifteen member assassination squads brought a bone saw with them and what they did was that in the meticulous planning to kill them chop them up and get them to\nGather in little bits and pieces which is so sure no consent to a surge righty long a million dollars a week ago [noise]\nSo anyway Sam I'll tell you what when you get a minute and you got your computer you check out the difference between consulates in embassies by way of essentially diplomatic immunity is kind of what we're talking about from what I can tell a consulate is still the same\nIt was never see in terms of its respect you can't just invaded that's my understanding I\nLet's let's say it's preliminary that's my preliminary position at this moment I reserve the right to amend it is for the fact show themselves upon further research one eight eight eight\nThree two one six zero zero one it's one eight eight eight three two one six thousand and one I Do have some open lines and\nI work with the facts and live with the truth right this is where we go this is why we're different here we don't take a position and then say okay let me look for some support and make up some arguments and Brian dress it up with some principals they see now we don't do that\nWe just work with the facts and follow the bread crumbs wherever they go and wherever they go as long as it's true will manage\nBilly thanks for being with us in Chicago Hi Billy\nHow you doing buddy\nI'm well thank you and thank you for calling what's on your mind\nAlways good talking to your oxygen to my brain uh yes I'm calling in regards to be a huge amount hush up the story um I've been following it on our al Jazeera in Arabic all day today I'm very close to this stuff um a couple of things no they did not consent to search or the\n... was misinformed I was misinformed than I Apologize I was mishaps or\nNo no that's okay and um they just met dismembered him oh they the footage shows a Mercedes black a van leaving the embassy and called him back was a luggage is they just purchased and I'll leave it again with the luggage till the counselors counsellors house\nAs sort of right now they're assuming that the body is dismembered sitting in the ... house\nAnd they said no to not you're not allowed to search a are um you know and the the than the cost of the house that its sovereign territory one of the Fifteen members of the assassination team is a specialist a surgical procedure procedures and that's the guy when they searched his luggage they found the bowl ...\nI'm I'm I'm speechless I'm speechless at at the ... royal family of Saudi Arabia\nA bit of a major critic of them for the longest time and I hope I don't end up like this guy but also today the\nWaiting there where you go I mean just be careful where you know because they are I hear your new satellite\nBill you and I have some time here suit so let's just settle in and have a conversation 'cause you're obviously very educated on this issue and I'd like you to teach me a\nCouple of things first of all first of all is eat your thought\nThat the reason or one of the reasons the Saudi regime would be willing to take such a brazen act they miss when really this took some guts may have to do this to send an assassination is why we're the bone\nSo into it any way to do all that here's my question do you think they did it because they felt they'd be protected in the White House that as long as ... as long as Jared Kushner is compromised and and Trump is on their payroll and very close to them that basically they know they don't have to worry about the United states\nOne hundred percent correct they actually issued a warning\nPrior to all of this a couple of months ago they issued a royal warning seen criticizing the royal society family not to say anything negative about us anymore\nFor the government little then obviously it and not the government or ... ... you had it all the oil family\nTo solve the cow so we're kind of a family council oh they told them to not say anything negative about us and the western press\nAt the guy did that yeah listen he didn't know he ended up well the New York\nAnd now I made the New York times is doing some major reporting on this and that's that's what I'm passing along here and the New York times is reporting that the Turkish security officials either my handwritten notes from my research earlier today that the Turkish pretty officials allege the\nQuote highest levels of the royal court close quote ordered\nThis assassination I mean they don't need to name names it's M. B.

Benedict Donald side so they stuck him on there and he's already paying dividends\nWell Brett Kavanaugh has all these judicial complaints against him watch at all about what's gonna\nWhat's gonna be the outcome will do it a senior legal analysts time because the chief justice has referred that batch of complaints to the tenth circuit court of appeals which is based in Denver, Colorado if memory serves me right in addition to that\nRachel Maddow last night did a really nice job on a story that a lot of people need to know about and\nLeaving Rachel's excellent reporting aside\nA in Georgia in Georgia there was a massive conflict of interest because the secretary of state there who's the guy who runs the elections is also the Republican nominee for governor and he is not recusing himself from anything and in fact he's helping himself to the governorship by purging voters\nAnd take a wild guess what the skin color is of the voters that he's purging so they're they're really needs to be a lot of attention there and we will give some of that and with that in mind\nVote dot O.

I think it's in the past tense got to be now Jamal to show he is he he was a Saudi national\nMeaning he was born and raised Saudi Arabia he self exiled to the United states and he was a contributor to the Washington Post the reason he self exiled is he was afraid for his safety because he was critical and not as scathing Lee so his moderate critic of the\nSaudi regime the Saudi regime did not like that he was being critical they didn't like that he was in self exile and so he apparently was murdered he ... he had been divorced and he was getting remarried he needed gives a Saudi nationally\nNeed to get some papers and\nSo he went into the consulate in Istanbul, Turkey right the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey Saudi Arabia is pretty far away from turkey right a lot of miles between the two so Saudi Arabia's over there in the middle eastern turkey is kinda you know south east I buy a lot and so Saudi Arabia has a consulate in Istanbul\nAnd Mr to show he goes in there any vanishes\nAnd we've covered this yesterday in the third hour\nAnd I wasn't sure what was going to happen but it it seemed that I uh was a mistake in in my belief that people just didn't care because it seems everybody cared and the phones went crazy and so that was the third our yesterday\nMy ... especially trained pharmacists but it provided over sixty million police Johnson's two thousand ten mine for your flu shot today with a zero dollar company with most insurance because protecting the world starts with protecting you are ... just it's it's nice you know one\nSubject to availability state Asian health related restrictions may apply\nTo [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nWatch the news of the\nVideo\nWhich really gave me an eagles to discredit\nWins Puerto Rican is when ...

B.\nS. because his name is Mohammed bin Salman he's the crown prince in other words he is their version of Jared Kushner [noise] so basically and and by the way he and Jared Kushner had become really really good buds oh there they are so close they're they're like blood brothers by now\nSo Jared Kushner and NBS Mohammed bin Salman are really really close\nAnd\nI Can't imagine a world where Jared Kushner and Benedict Arnold would not be aware that MBBS was about to assassinate one of his own citizens on foreign so they had to know they had to know\nAnd they had to have given the green light statue\nSaid don't worry about it were cool can you imagine\nIf Iraq Obama were still president an MBA as that hey I'm going to go do this thing I Know he's living in America now\nAnd he's with the group or the Washington Post and all but I'm going to just go kill them in the ... and and use both sort of had them up and and making disappear that's okay well you isn't that Mr Obama you're cool with that President Obama and that's about right President Obama would say you know\nI think we need to have some more meetings with Iran that would help [noise]\nSaudi Arabia of course is the mortal enemy of Iran and vice versa they are the two big heavy weights in the middle east they're combating it out\nAnd so the way to make a Saudi Arabia upset is too cozy up to Iran and the way to make a rod said it's the ... Saudi Arabia and of course everybody plays game but Benedict I'm of course not playing that game what Benedict out there was a bad kill the guy and the reason bent and now of course I by the way I have to confess I\nDon't have facts to back this up but Benedict Arnold has been selling our government\nAnd basically privatizing it and essentially selling you know going to Russia China wherever saying hey what do I get for this and we're you know they get they monetize so the United Arab Emirates to scientists figured out that the way to Benedict Donald hardest through his wallet and through his son in law's wallet and so\nThis is the kind of corruption going on here\nWe now have we now have a sitting United States senator a Republican a well respected foreign policy Republican mom\nKneeling on the problem with them but\n\nAh yeah that's Bob Corker he's retiring Tennessee Republican he's on the foreign ... is chair of the foreign affairs to me he's a foreigner intelligence kinda guy foreign affairs guy and so when he saying I think he's probably been murdered that's a pretty significant statement although you know I\nHope he turns up somewhere that was his last night anyway\nThis is the voice of corruption because Benedict Donald is compromise because he's in the bees in the pocket he's on the payroll of the Saudi royal family he and his no good sons good for another son in law they're not going to do anything about this but they have to save some words\nI think there are other ways if it turns out to be as bad as it might be there are certainly other ways of handling the situation but I Will tell you up front right now and I'll say that for the senators [noise] they're spending a hundred and ten billion dollars purchasing military equipment and other things\nIf we don't sell it to they'll say well thank you very much will buy from Russia or thank you very much will buy it from China that doesn't help us not when it comes to jobs and not what it comes to our house is losing out on our\n... year will keep selling them arms hundred ten billion why let a big chunk of business get in a way of a little murder\nAnyway at least he's open an obvious

mind\nI'm was recording and I haven't read the story the actual facts so you'll see it doesn't matter I don't have facts got it right\nBut the Washington state Supreme Court I think in some kind of a

others made her Washington the state of Washington could do that but\nThat the state of Washington that yes the\nThe guy on constitutional for the purposes of the constitution of the state of

that governs best\nGoverns locally the idea of federalism is to keep government as much government is close to the people as possible that's why the states are really important and then inside the states your local town your village your community your city\nAlso has power over you the\nIdea is the smaller and smaller the group that has power over you the more and more you have a chance in a democracy to have an impact on your the governance of your own life so I get to deal with the Los Angeles city council in my city councilmember over the ... the streets in the city of Los Angeles I don't have to go to Washington for that I don't have that Benedict Donald\nAbout the streets in Los Angeles it's a local issue the reason it's a local issues because of a federalist system of government that splits responsibility for various\nThings amongst the different layers the federal government handles international fares\nBankruptcy she'd have uniform bankruptcy laws across the country to facility business\nSo as natural incidence of federalism each state is its\nOwn kind of like a mini nation in many ways it can't really have an army can't negotiate international treaties that's been give it to the federal government but the state still have tremendous power with in their own state borders and for example in Kansas yeah\nThat state Kansas a few years ago the state Supreme Court got into a big fight with the governor then governor Sam Brownback and the legislature because the Kansas\nCity state Supreme Court said under our Kansas State constitution there are formulas for funding public schools and you cheap skate Republicans are not funding the schools to the minimum required by the state constitution so you got to do it and they had to be in trouble\nKansas State constitutional crisis where the governor was an open defiance of the of the Supreme Court and the legislature saying we'll work it out and everybody's trying to make deals and everybody's posturing\nThat was all in the state of Kansas because the state Supreme Court said under their state constitution they're public education system was screwy and that to fix it\nIn Pennsylvania just a couple of months ago the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court said\nUnder the state constitution that the district lines for Congress were written illegally because they were gerrymandered and therefore they had to be rewritten in because the legislature wouldn't do it to court when did it themselves and all that went to the U.S Supreme Court in the U.S Supreme Court said we don't have any jurisdiction air that's a state\nThat the state issue\nConstitution state Supreme Court state laws inside the states boundaries and so when a Republican\nShow host is getting upset\nBecause exactly the stuff that they say they love doesn't hurt to their resulting advantage they get mad that just exposes the ridiculous is of their views because all they're doing is they're creating ridiculous theories\nThat they think will likely get them to the outcomes that they want and when they get ... on their own pet tarred when their own thing boomerang back on them and exposes them because they lose on an issue then they get mad and yell and scream and tribal everybody into submission and Paul that game got and\nOkay so what are you hoping is\nThat somehow the United States Supreme court and actually do a little too okay so we talked about the United States Supreme court will step in and say\nWashington state Supreme Court you have to abide by what the legislature says anything if they can't get it through the legislature accord has no during this I don't know the court first of all our record of it all worked the body as much as the legislature is and the and the United States Supreme court has no business\nCapital case that has to deal with a state law they kept talking about they have nothing to do with it but what the what they're hoping is that your short while they're in power they will use the Supreme Court to only the Democrats states\nAnd to and that when they're not in the Supreme Court drive it's right states right now they're going to play both sides of the coin\nAnd what is the case that he went into is that\nA I'm a Washington state capital murder case went to the Supreme Court and he said and the court or are the facts of the cave and said no he doesn't deserve the ... the family and I don't even have to know the case for noted notice did not hear the facts of the case 'cause of the record of not fight fracking\nMurder cases now it'll just nothing wrong with the decision some grumbling along with the stars of the wrong it's the fate of it so it was a lie faces presented that Supreme Court did upsets me what if that could not it but what happened right on Supreme\nCourts don't do trials spree all its is right and so forth so I don't do trials they don't find facts\nThey accept the fact that were found in the courts beneath them they way the law they say was the jury instruction a proper statement of the law did this jury instruction mislead the jury and would there be a different result if the law were told to them differently that's the job of state Supreme Court's not to weigh facts and say people deserve it or not\nPaul here's the problem here's the problem you are taking them at\nTheir word that they are principled people they are not principal people they are lying sacks of crap cola and you know it as well as I Do\nThese are the most insincere people we ever come across you know and I know you know even John Boehner no you know and I know what this is the most insincere inauthentic group of lions sexy you know what that we've ever\nSeen its own results oriented and we should just stop with the

eight three two one six thousand and one but let me set the scene let's just set the scene so\nThat we get the basic fact right so that we can do this segment of senior legal analysts time but let me get their\nSupreme Court chief justice John Roberts has selected the judicial council of the U.S court of appeals for the tenth circuit to deal with any current or pending complaints of judicial misconduct against new associate justice for Kevin [noise]\nBroadcasting cable dot com reports that the Circuit Appeals court work of and I used to hold court so that members of the public have begun

O. C. H. I. T. is how they spell it W. O. C. H. I. T. watch it news they're big on YouTube they're big on the Internet and they've been kind to us so thank you and that is again an accurate summary of the facts Brett Kavanaugh\nWas until a few days ago a United States court of appeals judge for the DC circuit which means he was one layer below the Supreme Court but still there in Washington DC\nThat means the judicial conduct rules applied to him once look where senior legal analyst I'm here\nThere are federal rules of judicial conduct they do not apply to the Supreme Court and I'm not kidding [noise] sorry for the drums thing but the Supreme Court is is literally a rule is\nI mean it's ridiculous how our Brett Kavanaugh was a member of the court or the two layers but he's a Supreme Court very much are subject to all the federal rules of judicial conduct and when Brett Kavanaugh\nDid his disgraceful performances in front of the U.S Senate when he said what goes around comes around and you destroyed my life but they do you drink I mean all that horrible stuff\nRight a bunch of people made complaints against him and they are allowed to\nRemember the constitution starts our discussion article three regards the courts in it does not\nSeem much it basically says is a Supreme Court the judicial power the United states is in the Supreme Court and whatever else Congress wants to do pretty much you fellas go about doing it and and so Congress was given a really really wide broad set of uh of discretion to deal with the court system and in Nineteen eighty\nCongress Yousef discretion to create the judicial conduct and disability act of Nineteen eighty\nAnd in the judicial conduct and disability act of Nineteen eighty any citizen any person can make a complaint against the judge\nAnd you're supposed to do it for a judge in your own circuit\nAnd people took that opportunity and there were about a dozen complaints made about Brett Kavanaugh because of his his performance right we know what his opinion what\nDo you think in my opinion of it I think it was [noise]\nIt was a really disgraceful performances and a lot of people that are really really negative opinion on that performance and so they filed complaints\nThere was a lot of buzz on the Internet about whether uh whether the chief justice John Roberts was going to do anything well it was actually the chief judge of that circuit the DC circuit of who said you know look this is I\n\nI'll\nWatch the\nVideo from a massive cactus falling out of fear ... we've covered I talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two\nAre\nUnder it and I finally struck by insurance exchange for products out of state [noise]\n\nUnited States constitution is the Supreme law of the land and under our system the U.S Supreme Court decides what the U.S Constitution says as blood to cases that's just how our system has been for a very long time and if you want to get rid of an article three judge in articles re judge means\nA judge that has been nominated bind the presidency and then confirmed by the Senate once that happens\nThat judge take a look at articles read the constitution is on the court for or is in the federal courts for life you can't reduce their pay and the only way to get rid of them it says in article three while while in good a wallet under good behavior while conducting themselves good behavior\nThat the Supreme Court said it's it's impeachment at the same process and some federal judges local judges have been impeached and removed from time to time\nBut what happens when a complaint is made against one for the judicial conduct certainly that has to be an investigation well there's actually a process for that it does not end with the removal where justice wouldn't be served\nOn Jay

[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] because the U.S Supreme Court\nIs the final word on the U.S constitution and because the U.S constitution is the final word\nOn US law we need to pay attention to\nThe Supreme Court and we need to pay attention to the fact that report is not covered by any rules and this is really important because Brett Kavanaugh is now sitting on the Supreme Court so what do you do\nWhen you've got the Supreme Court of the United states which literally has no rules that apply to me the standard rules of federal employees apply but the there were rules of judicial conduct\nThere were rules that apply the judges like you're not supposed to GO Campaign for a politician right I mean that that that rule applies to a district court judge at the bottom of this relates to the to the ... circuit court judges right they can't go out\nAnd start campaigning for partisan politicians they can go I start raising money for politicians for campaigning for office\nThe Supreme Court can technically yes they can and by the way Antonin Scalia back in the day or as Clarence Thomas these guys I Believe Samuel Alito to have been seen it like Koch brother events technically the rules don't apply to them they can\nDo it so what happens when you have Brett Kavanaugh sitting on the Supreme Court in my opinion it legitimately but I my opinion doesn't carry the day what happens when he's sitting on the Supreme Court you've got all of these ethics challenges a lodged against him and by the way the law allows it\nThe ... there was a judicial council is you're from watching the news\nThe judicial council is comprised of lawyers and judges there's judicial councils everywhere there's one in California for the state courts the federal judicial councils into various circuits and so\nWhen a citizen avail themselves of the judicial conduct and disability act of Nineteen eighty they make it can make a complaint against the judge and then it gets investigated it gets investigated very often it is dismissed on grounds that it is really just\nThe sour grapes of all it again who lost a case\nVery often it when they when they complain as long as you against the judge it is the sour grapes lit again who's who lost a case and that's is expressly in the law that says this is not a thing for when you're upset about losing an appeal Oric case so very often the complaints are dismissed\nHowever let's assume that's the complaint has merit and in this case I think the case does that mirror Brett Kavanaugh why at that time is at the time he conducted himself disgrace literally he was subject to the rules he was a court of appeals judge the middle layer the rules apply federal judicial rules apply so\nWhat can they do remember they can't kick the judge off because the constitution says the only way you can get rid of a nautical three judge and he was an article three judge them he was confirmed by the Senate for his court of appeals judge chip that\nAll of these judges Supreme Court courts of appeal district courts they're all articles three judges their own nominated by the president's ... confirmed by the Senate to Brett Kavanaugh when he was sitting there trying to get on the Supreme Court was already sitting federal judge\nAnd so they can censor him\nThey can't kick him off the can't kick him off I'm ... I'm Sorry to be the bearer of bad news the judicial council cannot kicking a federal judge has already been confirmed by the Senate has to be nominated by president the only way to do with his impeachment announced removal by the Senate short of kicking them off the bench\nWhat they can do is put a form of censure out there in extreme cases if it's like a district court judge that they can just simply stop assigning cases to the judge and there's a procedure in the law to get a new judge that Congress will approve a new judges you can get you basically have a sitting judge or not doing a whole lot\nYou know that's a rare case and that's a very rare case but basically most instances they just dismiss the complaint and even when they find the complain has merit there's no way they can kick the judge off so you know basically if it's a bankruptcy judge you can kick the bankruptcy judge justice bankruptcy judge's not article three judges\nBut they can or judge to retire they can wave the rules and kind of help a judge to retire there are ways to deal with this without\nKicking the judge off the bench and so the remedy for all of these complaints against Brett Kavanaugh\nA letter center at most I Would think and I'm not sure even that because now he's visiting Supreme Court judge\nAnd I got one more and this is kind of said punch line which is when the chief justice of the United states the so called illegitimate chief justice of evil general United States I got to get used to say that now thanks Brent and Neal anyway or when he decided to send this for investigation\nHe said that to the tenth circuit which is in Denver and the judge of the center to as a George W.
