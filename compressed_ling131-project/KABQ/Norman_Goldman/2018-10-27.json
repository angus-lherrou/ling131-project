I found out through DNA I'm her like six has it actually made me switch my perspective I'm like oh cousins\n[noise]\n\nWe\nWe have been re camping weeks on days like this with our friend now like cites wall says the virtual beginning of the show and we recap some crazy crazy week on this special day\nBut today of course because of what's been happening is a special day in its own right so we get to recant this week with our friend Alex sites walled you can find him at NBC News dot com is a reporter at NBC News dot com MSNBC dot com and he's on TV MSNBC TV Twitter\nAt age sites wall and I'm following Alex ... on Twitter at a sites waltz and\nAlix I've stopped trying to figure out which we ranked higher than the others 'cause they're all just insane thanks coming back on the door and Goldman Joe\nAn arm or give you back on a particularly crazy week\nThere's no point in trying to rank them anymore and Alex we gotta talk about the bombings I mean I\nDon't even know where to start or the Trump did not praised as as far as I Know yes the FBI he hasn't even says award letters FBI doesn't thank them for doing their job she hasn't called any of the bombing victims to say I'm On your team and you know we'll get to sing cleaned up these major thing all about himself\nAnd he and he keeps attacking the media\nAnd so you know another way of looking at this is kind of a perfect set of episodes of The Apprentice because here we are in the fire the show we have resolution those and this is not again but it's not a game and so you know but it's stretched out over a few days but we have resolution out because the bombers been caught he's exactly the kind of guy we thought he'd be\nI mean what are we to make up the whole constellation of things around how how can we make sense of all the craziness about the bombings were the attempted bombing the FBI would call them I eat these improvised explosive devices which is I guess what they were how can we grab this bag of snakes and put 'em all street for once\nWell I think first of all we should say it's a very wonderful lucky perhaps that no one was hurt that none of these bombs going off you know that's a little bit of the post nine eleven security\nApparatus abs coming into play that male get screened at even at at NBC we've got emails this week about all the extra precautions they were taking and I'm very grateful for it but I mean what an October surprise politically\nIt came at this moment where the the riot and Trump or trying to build this narrative that Democrats are uncivil their their heckling\nRepublicans in restaurants they're saying things they they're supporting violence and then all of a sudden to have the worst assassination attempt a in recent American history I think it's fair to say come and and you're right when they found them in today who the suspect to allege that they did this\nI I think if he was brought in to a director as the guy who they want to cast to be the bomber the director with say a little too on the nose I don't know I don't think anyone will buy it I mean she is you know a white van\nPlastered with Trump means with literal targets over the heads of politicians that he doesn't like\nBack a written all over all these uh chewing on conspiracy theories stuff from four Chan and that kind of darker places the Internet I hear a reporter they'd been kicked out of his parents' home he is exactly and the demographic that you would stereotype you know a white\nMale in his late fifties or and then there's just some of jumped just bizarre things in his passion for allegedly a male stripper\nBully went so this was clearly a troubled guy and you know I don't think anyone is claiming that he was acting on behalf of some kind of organized of a larger politics but I remember Bill Clinton made this great speech after the Oklahoma City bombing when he\nWas in that case he was talking about Rush Limbaugh and and those guys and he said I'm not blaming you clearly for this but you need to know that your words have consequences and when you speak out to the masses Ninety nine percent of your people know you might be joking no you don't actually want them to hurt people but\nSomebody out there might and they might think that they're acting on the ... of the president of the United states who they clearly idolize and love and think they're doing the right thing I think they're going to be a hero for the history books and you know we don't know exactly but it it seems like that's what this guy a ... that's when his case was this\nGuy well it's about creating an atmosphere\nCreating an environment and I do remember the speech or referencing and it was excellent\nBecome glad you brought up because been washed away in the sand is three well yeah when the Oklahoma City bombing happened it wasn't in a vacuum it was in this heated rhetoric does this very anti federal government rhetoric that common forest was a black helicopters and stuff\nAnd so you know what when when people go out to fish they don't catch every fish in the ocean\nBut they only have to catch one or two and that's exactly\nThe situation here is when you broadcast when you've got the platform that you know who has\nAnd you're broadcasting so such a big audience you don't need to many to take it to where this guy took it\nAnd uh this guy Alex\nIs this going to be the end of it\nWell here's my a nightmare scenario enormous show ... let me down the rabbit hole\nI mean they the right has been trying to spin this away or you know all we can not claim credit for this guy before we knew who he was they said it was a false fly by the media that said maybe it was a liberal person trying to you know discredit the the right or that it was all fake\nThey're gonna have a lot harder time doing that and uh it's it's certainly going to blow back on track he's going to be a lot of questions about it he has not been conducting himself\nOr you know he liked that presidential but it's not about ... about being the leader of this country being the president of of of everyone including the law enforcement and the former president a procedure\nBut my nightmare scenario is that you're going to realize back is against the wall and he's going to do what he did with Roy Moore and Brett Kavanaugh or and or any other kind of unsavory figure who he has been associated with and he's going to double down and he's going to say something\nVaguely positive about this guy something to the effect of well you know he's a man\nThe action and uh he he most people complain and he and he did something now quickly condemned what he did but we you know you ... just like you did with great Jan forte the other day\nIn Montana when he said he likes the guy who can body slam that is my nightmare scenario is that the president of the United states it gets up there and basically condones even if he immediately walk that back\nA uh a domestic terrorists there's no other way to to put it and then that sends a very loud signal and then I I worry about what happens after that\nCopycats and that's that's the issue and now it's I think you're really kinda scary down the rabbit hole but exactly on it because that's exactly what the this guy's guy will do is send a wink and a nod kind a you know hey this is my time a guy who's ...\nI think Alex sides wall has it and you can check
