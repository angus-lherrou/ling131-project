free I maybe I'll ask [noise]\nHurricane Michael deadly limo crash I'm In case hurricane warnings have been posted from the Alabama Burgess wanting river Florida as Michael bears down governor Rick Scott is urging residents in the area to take the hurricane seriously\nWhat Republicans do and that is the dirty little secret American politics it's up to the Democrats to get their rear ends engaged in the process and I'm not kidding around here Bernie Sanders if you really if you want someone just Bernie he'll tell you he runs around the nation saying this all the time\nWhen people turn out in large numbers that means Democrats are turning on that means elections or one by Democrats\nSo is Mitch McConnell right just going to blow over those is worth he's\nAssuming the Democrats are going to forget about all of this stuff hey what do you think Susan Collins is future looks like\nI think that that's more than ... he'll wake ending for this country I don't think a lot of stuff that had any idea how PR faces the problem of sexual assault is\nA so that Susan Collins let's put a sexual assault there on the Supreme Court\nAnyway she called it an awakening well a Mitch McConnell saying people going to engage in the process stemmed the polls are showing Democrats very much want to engage in the process\nAnd so just to show you how are these times are we now have a new entrant onto the battlefield and I welcome are very much because it's Taylor Swift it's Taylor Swift and I think you heard of her\nFor the first time Taylor Swift is making public endorsement backing to Democrats and the Tennessee mid term in an Instagram post\n... says she's appalled and terrified by Trump back senator Marsha Blackburn votes against three authorizing the violence against women act and her stance against marriage equality status singer says she'll vote for Phil Bredesen he endorsed Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nSweat says she's also supporting incumbent Jim Cooper for Congress\nThat is Deborah Rodriguez of CBS News we do think CBS News for that\nAnd I I Confess I've never heard of a swift song I've never heard her speak I I Know who she is a means you a big star and the kids seem to love her and all I'm way outside the target demo I'm aware of who she is don't know very many details\nBut from my observations of just ... moving around I don't recall her ever being involved in politics and so last\nNight when I was you know on and on Instagram and on Twitter and Facebook and all I saw people starting to talk about Taylor served as I what's going on and then I went on Instagram and she posted this really\nLong really articulate very very smart presentation\nIs kind of like a political coming out and then I started ... around saying if I miss something has she been I mean it's just like a Dixie Chicks thing do you remember the Dixie Chicks you remember the trouble they got to do and they got into politics\nAnyway so it turns out that Taylor Swift really never had been involved in politics and so\nThese are the times that are doing these kinds\nOf things to people so even someone who has been a political just staying out of it all these years now she's on the battlefield and look he's got millions of followers millions and millions of fans and she's a leader she's an influence or\nPeople listen to or they respect her she respects others if you read that Instagram post I mean she's really concerned about she's terrified that there were terrified and so it's obvious she's one of us She's a normal person she's respectful of her fellow humans she's\nObviously very intelligent and cares about all of our well being so let's welcome to the battlefield I Do fear a Dixie Chicks backlash but\nI have a sneaky suspicion that she's big enough a star where she can handle it and so uh just this is what happens when you get on the political battlefield people start punishing you they did a boycott concerts and stuff but I suspect she knows all about the Dixie Chicks story however\nWe have\nI don't know what else it would have taken to get someone that apolitical I mean Taylor Swift was never about political at all but look what it took to get her out to the battlefield and so engagement right and if she can get her legions of young supporters to engage in this process\nIf she can get them to care about our politics my goodness gracious she can do a fantastic\nPublic service and so I think it's fantastic I'm really I'm terrified that it took this to get her onto the battlefield but she's here\nI don't know how long she tends to stay up she sticks around the brings all of her followers and and fans with her and get them engaged in the process and that they all help shape America for the future so that we can all have a normal nation I Want my country back\nAnd I I I\nI didn't know quite how to handle this one this next story is want to give you a quick preview a I I don't want to be disrespectful I really don't want to be disrespectful because something really really horrible happened this weekend I mean aside from the ... ... ... and I keep on Neil Gorsuch thing\nAside from Brett Kavanaugh getting out to the Supreme Court something else ... did you hear about this horrible tragedy\n... Eighteen people including the driver we're in this SUV limousine when it came down state ... thirty and failed to stop at the intersection with the fruits thirty I traveled in the parking lot and hit a parked car that car hitting kill people standing nearby\nThat is Tori wells have W. R. G. E. B. T. V. and it gets worse\nWe are learning more about these things inside that limousine plea are told that their relative four sisters Abigail Jackson and her husband Adam Mary ... and her husband Rob ... park and her husband axle in a fourth fifth or Allison cartels they were all celebrating youngest ... thirtieth birthday\nAnd as Lindsey Lucia um W. R. G. P. T. V. we're talking upstate New York outside of Albany the state capital and here's the reason why I wanted to make my point without\nSounding disrespectful I'm not trying to use these deaths these or what do you live and they should never have happened\nDriver of beer [noise] quote unquote limousine not have\nThe appropriate driver's license the operating a vehicle that's the governor of New York Andrew Cuomo the driver needed from the CDL commercial driver's license with a passenger endorsement [noise]\nA driver did not have that [noise] proper life and what about the actual limo this vehicle was infected just last month [noise] and they failed inspects\nThere you go that's the governor of New York Andrew Cuomo and it's being reported in the news that one of the people who died and the crash texted a relative or saying the the first limo that we got broke down and they sent the second one and this one's even worse I Hope we make it and so\nThere's one the dead bodies now when one of the families and all the friends and all the tears and everybody's going to be upset\nAnd it said darn government regulation this is the cost of when we don't have\nProper government regulation and I'm Sorry but this is why we have food inspections this is why we have toys safety laws this is why we have\nGovernment to protect us from defective products defective vehicles right the idea is to save lives and so for all the Republicans who are always blow V. aiding about government regulation\nThese are lives at stake and a lot of the regulations that already exist or existing because people have died and we said oh look what happened maybe we should try and prevent that from happening again children have died from choking on things you know all these stories and yet we have this constant assault on government and so\nThere is a place that all said there's got to be a place of personal responsibility that driver shouldn't have been driving he paid for with his life by the way that Dr ... died the driver ... he died two innocent people on the street who happened to be the wrong place wrong time they died what is what do you tell their family and friends boy they just\nWhile you're talking about bad luck they should pay for their lives with that\nBut there's gotta be personal responsibility to drivers shouldn't have been driving it the company whoever was behind that limo shouldn't have had it on the road\nRight to have to be consequences but getting back ... can't get back to ...\nWe have got to re adjust our thinking here and accept that government regulation is appropriate given that it's got to be efficient that's got to be effective it can't be wasteful it can't stifle innovation I mean it's got to do its job but it's gone to do its job properly there's got to be a\nBalance and obviously we have plenty dead body saying that system out of balance\nPeople need to take responsibility and properly and government needs to do its job and obviously we got a failure and we've got twenty people and look at all the young one eight eight eight\nThree two one six zero zero one\nI was wondering this myself and I I I see others now out there in the world saying why did the New York times dropped that Mondo bought food Donald Trump Benedict Arnold attacked the expos they\nIn the middle of the Brett Kavanaugh saying we're just get kind of washed away by the Brett Kavanaugh stench well\nThe New York times that's not really answered that question I was wondering it's like you know they didn't pick the best time here guys I mean you know you need anyway turns out the New York times isn't done\nTurns out this was a work in progress and so the New York times is apparently going to break a bunch more news on this so these are the big stories we have for you I've got time for you today it won eight eight eight three two one six thousand and one Norman Norman Goldman dot com\nIt's like a tennis match and the ball is coming over onto the Democrats' side of the court the Republicans have now\nRigged and fix this thing so they got two Supreme Court judges on there and do a whole bunch of judges and they're just taking over the course the question and this is alive experiment or the Democrats\nGoing to focus on the courts as he discreet that is the third branch of government is only three branches and that's one of them and that's a third of the government is really important role versus Wade all this other stuff OK so will the\nDemocrats during the courts into a political issue do the Democrats had the staying power I don't think so I'd be

Hi [laughter]\n[noise] Oh hi Norma I Love your show a with a crime but ah I have a question about\n[noise] I don't understand how um [noise] the protestors who were protesting the confirmation of Kavanaugh why why why were they arrested this not unconstitutional don't they have a right to protest depends\nOn where they were protesting what they were doing when they're protesting I mean if you if you protest in somebody's neighborhood at three o'clock in the morning don't you think the police have a right to a restaurant\nI thought this is in front of the capital that's what I'm Talking\nAbout and I and I all I can tell you is is that this wouldn't be Eric let's assume you're right let's assume was completely unjustified would this be the first time that the police got rid of protestors because of their political message\nOf course not but it's still if it's unconstitutional or I mean even if it's happened to a hundred times it's if it's unconstitutional still unconstitutional is an\nWhy are they I I totally agree with you I'm looking at it from a completely different perspective air you're looking at it you're focused in on this incident and you're seeing the injustice of one incident I'm looking at it radically differently I'm looking at it as\nWhy are the Democrats in a position where they are protesting why are the Democrats so powerless that they've had to fall back as soon as like Nineteen sixty eight again they might as well chant hey hey LBJ how many kids did you kill today\nThe Democrats should not be in a position of protesting what the Democrats ought to do is calm down\nOrganized and marched to the polls and if they're going to go to the get go or march in protest anyway I'll go to the Supreme Court forget the capital go the Supreme Court and just chant illegitimate and camp out there do a do a a you know a\nOccupy Wall street occupy the Supreme Court and just camp out there and say your real legitimate and the joke and we want to pay you\nBut Eric I looked to me there are so many and justice is being done here I refused to expand any emotional energy on abusive police power arresting protesters in front of the capital if you want to see that as an issue yeah one more example of America turning into a fascist nation maybe we ought to stop is now what do you think\n[noise] of course you know I thought you know you know more about the constitution and I would I just had a question is that or is\nThat not unconstitutional oh you're not you're not supposed to arrest protesters you're not supposed to peaceful protest unless that comes to fighting words\nI and the key word is peaceful which as far as I Know they were\n... along the lines of in the law has been for decades and decades and decades that unless there are\nPeople on both sides or screeching and screaming at each other nose to nose about to come to violence that's when the police can step in until then the police can step in Eric I'm going to assume we have police abuse here's the remedy a lot of litigation people file lawsuits they take 'em to court\nWhich make getting a free ten day sampled one of the wisest things you can

thanks for taking my call for a long time listener thank you I'm not and I do want to thank you for us to follow that United you could have a special beyond\nAnd bedroom down the judge and for the last week I could have been and I actually wrote educating tour listening to your show my job make you\nKnow but uh the reason I'm calling actually have a good thing and I like to discuss one is and I don't have facts to back this up but\nUm don't have facts to back this I had to do it didn't you got hit\nBy a what a rumor I've heard that Mr Trump went to the Saudi Arabia as you know that Saudi Arabia is a a corruption friendly country so the rumor\nIs randomly corruption friendly I think you're being under an understatement isn't it [laughter] they could probably say the same thing about our country though don't you I mean come on let's\nGo ahead or am I had that that um they gave Mr Tom\nA billion dollars under the table and uh I have a very good friend who works as a medical doctor and Europe yeah when he was back in return and um so I asked him I said well you know just little might have heard\nAnd ended up by about that well what for the European in a very large um foreign population who works in Saudi Arabia because the most of your choice of foreign\nFondness for work and go what are the the government is that they did that to ... hundred US dollars from everybody's paycheck but no explanation and grand that Trump was there ... or for that kind of you know you said that the ... that\nYou know that it was a ... the youth that are in the ... come from sort of used for but you know again you know what I've also heard there was ...\nCan I can I ask a quick question cash a quick question why would you need to pay a billion under the table when you can do it on top of the table out in the open like China did tell me why why bother with all the ... because it is\nIf you're doing a billion dollars if you're doing one dollar or any amount in between under the table you're admitting automatically by the doing of it in the fashion and what you're doing it so that you think it's criminal act\nWhat Benedict Donald is really good as doing it on public example he's gotta he's got a project in Indonesia your car to outside\nYour corner is one of these luxury things you slap and his name on a deal well he was about to put China's the tea each company out of business and he had the power to do is use about to do that\nNow I don't know what happened to your phone but he was about ... out of business all of a sudden China invest half a billion dollars mom and your million dollars directly and the Chinese bank another five hundred million that's a cool billion\nPut into that your car to Indonesia a a a a property development and that guaranteed success when you've got a billion dollars committed from China and the funding they already had been the thing so\nAll of a sudden as soon as a billion dollar commitment half from government direct from a Chinese bank and the Chinese bank gave ... billion dollars anyway with the Chinese government saying okay without that billion dollars\nBenedict Arnold would have put vt out of business the moment the amount that billion dollars into the departed project oh I Can't put the ... out of business looking all the Chinese jobs that would be lost he actually tweeted\nAnd then he saved the tea why do you do it under the table he does it above the table alley I'd like to see some facts to back it up main thing to me was the main main them at a low um I may go ahead you're on the air with me go ahead\nYeah well what I wanted to say is we're in a common denominator is you know you thought about a lot of dry did they ah ah ah we're ... we're we have so many uh there's a ... a ... in the Democratic party you all you get that I'm\nA ... a poet but a common denominator issues like health or something that we actors will do to get our Saturday tend to get up you know there was a good I'm going to get a like a draft political or you say you're talking about\nA ... a bit and then she turned out well both but if you get 'em in the ... or common denominator is\nWell common denominator is odd to me are trans political issues how about this one balancing the budget and paying down our debt you're going to get a big consensus on that\nHow do you do it tax the rich you're going to get a lot of people saying the rich aren't paying their fair share and it's time they paid back 'cause they raided the treasury stolen all the money so I mean it's all it's all how you present it you can go trends political with along the same physicians but it's how you present it\nSo if you present it properly for example abortion is big government liberal picking winners and losers imposing

justices or\nWell everywhere you want to listen on our free [noise]\nHurricane Michael deadly ... Iraq I man capes hurricane Michael is bearing down on the north east Gulf Coast meteorologist Jennifer graces the storm is expected to strengthen\nThat they threw their entrepreneurial report or real spirits were able to suss out\nThere there's a hidden there seems there was a close relative of Fred Trump Benedict Arnold\nPops his daddy Fred that says all Fred work the made all this money any way that there seems to have been a a relative like a brother or brother in law that Fred Trump liked a lot and brought into the business who had a lot of the same documents that you're offering business records so the New York times found this guy apparently and they have\nIt in his basement since you have a look at the New York times found themselves a treasure trove this is what good reporters do\nThis is why I subscribe to the New York times and the Washington Post digitally and the Los Angeles times and they deliver the LA Times we get at least part of the deal but they deliver it you know in paper form to the front door because we're old anyway\nA but do do support your local newspaper if I Know Rachel Maddow is always mentioning it it's very very important it's she's right and so\nThe New York times having\nHad access to this amazing treasure trove of Fred Trump's or documents were able to decipher that a whole lot of criminality had occurred with Benedict Donald and his siblings and Fred Trump was in the middle of it he was helping 'cause none of them wanted to pay any taxes\nSo they all concocted these schemes this life and all this money off and up and do tax evasion well I was sitting there scratching my head right it's like with all the the the meal cabin all Britain Gorsuch stuff going on\nHow the New York times you just you you buried your own giant story you're the New York times you know better than that\nWait for a slow time and I know that you're you can stop laughing I Know there's no slow times but there are slow word times right well anyway I but scratching my head while I was in New York Times do that well it turns out the New York times as an answer to that it turns out\nThey're gonna keep going this is the beginning of a longer process I didn't know that so I stand corrected\nWe had two hundred pages of tax returns for Trump's empire including a number of his tax returns look what we were able to piece together about Donald Trump just through his father's returns it's incredible\nNow that Suzanne Craig and that's the New York times and bless their hearts in the New York times because they're still on this story and so\nThis story looks like it has as they say in Hollywood legs right if a movie or it keeps getting big box office week after week they say that his legs right because it's running so it it appears in New York Times is just getting warmed up that was the big one but it looks like they're continuing to do more analysis and they seem to have\nMore to say on the topic so let you and I not\nHave short attention span about anything hash tag no short attention span but let's remember that Benedict Donald's taxes remember you always promised to release his tax returns and all those lives have been exposed so\nIt appears in New York Times has more to do I have my eye on it and if you're busy I keep an eye on it for both of us one triple eight three two one six thousand and one\nGary I'm Glad you called from Illinois Hi Gary\n[noise] uh-huh yeah it actually Jerry but I'll take Gary how about gerrymandering over and Gary Mandarin\n[laughter] there you go closer to write a love your show I mean literally they won a a a good coal run uh your your inspiring I got a lot of people do\nI Want to talk about Dakota I'm I don't I don't know I mean\nIt doesn't bode both of us are but anyway I was thinking like Republicans are able to destroy the country\nGo too far out of the people our short soldiers and you can do the power and Democrats which can you imagine\nA a Democratic president like ... [laughter] you know well the Republicans were probably destroyed the Democratic party I mean nothing I mean they would probably [laughter] it's an odd unbelievable to\nMe how can you you're wondering how Democrats that this why are there to standard that's what I'm hearing in back of this is\nYour your perceiving to standards the Republicans can rape and pillage and burned down villages and very low up people and mass murder and invade countries on the lives in fraud and steal trillions of dollars they can\nDo it all thing called and celebrate Christians they can do whatever they want so I Am a great Christian and I am and they still keep winning elections and staying in power and that amazes you doesn't it amazes me to do I know who I boy I blame the Democrats I blame the Democrats lately that right\nThere or why not even one smart per person or in the Democratic party like ... ... ... where the older older sure what Donald Trump they got a good guy and things\nCan grow out and make\nPeople vote or a power can waters car [laughter] time and with the concrete\nIs one year old boy [laughter] people why what is happening to our country [laughter] hey man you almost you almost spontaneously said the exact political what is happening to our country\n[laughter] um but but [laughter] going what the worst possible thing I mean\n[laughter] like like where Obama Republicans can turn around and and twenty or twenty fourteen ... return against Obama show even Democrats democratic governor ran against their own ...\nAnd how is that possible [laughter] unbelievable\nI can give you a lot of answers\nLet's start with their ownership of the mass media and the fact that they can propagandize people they own five hundred radio stations that are constantly ramming Limbaugh back in ... down their throats staff Fox boobs and ABC NBC CBS all these other guys CNN [noise]\nThey were they they are totally in the tank for corporate power and they will not challenge corporate power and that's the eight hundred pound elephant in the room is these are owned by giant corporations the media is owned by giant corporations and they will not challenge\nCorporate supremacy and you'll notice you can see it in who they book they never book Bernie Sanders consistently Elizabeth Warren no one out there like Ralph Nader who's going to just go right to the heart of it and say corporate person or the Citizens United\nThat is that stuff's scares them in the corporate suites a ... a B C NBC CBS\nThey can't allow that any quote unquote white wing lunatics Rick Santorum any of these nut jobs that will be apologist for Benedict all they can get on there but no quote unquote left wing nut job can there's a biased it's deep seeded and by the way I\nInnocently Jerry I can I I now have I think I now have the ultimate correct definition of left and right would you like to hear it sure\nIt's very short here goes the more and more government involvement in the economy the more and more or less\nThe less and less government involvement in the economy the more and more right the more and more power of private\nProperty the more and more right the less and less power of private property and the more and more powerful government as against by probably the more and more left that's the way everybody seems to think of it that is one hundred percent false it's ridiculous\nI think it's I think it's ridiculous however after\nDecades of suffering over this I think I finally got it\nAnd so any with a generation in mind with that definition in mind\nRight right wing ers white winners one little little itty bitty government massive power in big business in business generally they they've cloaked in freedom and liberty oh freedom right in the second amendment freedom ... network\nBut what they're talking about is that the power of private property as against government they want weak government that's white stronger government\nThat regulating private property that's more or less with that in mind\nWith that as the definition one would think that poor people working class people lower middle class people even middle class people now and again squeeze really hard in other words the vast majority of the American people one would think they would like to be more left because they say hey I Need the government to stand up on my behalf\nAs against the primacy of the power private property how come the government is not going under 'cause they've been corrupted and you guys are voting for the party that sets supporting this isn't that what you're posing over Jerry\n[noise] call yeah oh yeah\nThey've been tricked with religion abortion\nOh yeah I Love Atlanta locked or religious stuff yes help the poor are given to help everybody out that they do an awesome job and they still getting your work at\nA general question controlling the media right so you just drumming this ridiculous messaging never challenging the primacy of big business uh keeping keeping voices that could wake people up out of people's ears why are we on a radio stations eight\n... this rate if this radio show were on foreign ... three hundred two hundred and one of the best specially if we're in the top ten is a spin on his radio show in America we are being stifled by two giant corporations that own the airwaves because the Republicans was complicit corporate Democrats like Bill Clinton\nPoint of view and who uh shares a legislative solution\nA you know for example a federal law that relates to a woman's rights\nWell with respect to abortion or maybe have a a a something that says that you know in order to have a lifetime appointment a that has to be like sixty seven\nSenators half the vote for that\nYou're giving them an already veto power they would you

All right yeah I I I don't know how this works out but you know I read an experience that we've had you know it's a it's a party line vote to to put somebody on the Supreme Court for\nA lifetime that man only one or both I think things are wrong to me about that I think that uh that we would be better served a ... if the majority if the minority what's what's better protected and the only way I can think of doing\nThat hey this is a minority than other in the minority do you want the majorities it'd be that's the problem the minority is running every thing this is why the system is so screwy\nThis is why everyone's so upset because either they're seeing it or they're feeling it if they don't see it you know so clearly there are saying wait a second\nWe're the majority why other minorities running everything and they are the minority\nAnd this is what's driving this is why they're so angry all the time Dave this is why they're so angry even though they've got all the power even though they just stole another Supreme Court seat no matter what happens there always angry because they're always victims in their own minds because their nation is slipping away from them oh my God Taylor Swift is talking about politics\nNow see in this kind of stuff upsets them women in you know strong women engaging in politics and talking about this is the kind of stuff that upset them Dave and here's the problem and this is why I said let's go trans\nPolitical we live in a very weird system it has a ... year features to it like that electoral system there right like the two senators per state think think about it have\nGot Wyoming Idaho South Dakota you got all these lightly populated were heavily Republican states each with two senators they really have a majority in the Senate now at fifty one forty nine the only reason he\nBarely by their fingernails are going to a majority as it goes all the crappy little state like Wyoming in Idaho that have nothing but\nThe it's in ... and two U.S senators each I'm sitting in the middle of a state with thirty nine million people in it man I got two senators to is is a joke\nSo once you understand that our system is\nOld and creaky and has all these weird features to it you can do one of two things\nYou can get really upset and ... and throw temper tantrum which is what the Democrats do and then refused to engage which is what the Democrats do or you could settle in and take it over by understanding it and and working at the Republicans have\nDone that one which is why the minorities running everything and when I Try and tell people [noise] have you still there\nDave that I lose yeah I I I did when I don't want to jump I\nKnow when I when I tell people you know look this is a weird system\nLet me show you how it works I Know the system intricately I've worked in it I study that I mean gee whiz\nIf there's anybody to teach the systems there's\nLots of lawyers who worked in politics they can do it too I'm not unique I'm not like Benedict Donald I Alone can fix it there's a lot of lawyers who worked in politics who studied sociology\nBacon teaches stuff just as easily or probably better than I can but they will do it because there's no money in it because they don't they don't want to lose the money that are moving so Dave point of the matter\nIs is that if the Democrats\nIf the Democrats want\nThe majority to run the country than the Democrats are going to have to work the system that exists and the way to do that is to go trans political which is to come up with a group of issues that will garner a nice big broad centrist consensus for example that tax\nFairness here you want to talk about senators yeah I mean you want to talk about Supreme Court justices\nHow 'bout this let's get the politics out of it by creating a giant committee that nominates judges from uh from lawyers street distinguish lawyers all over the nation a nonpartisan bipartisan broad based three people for people per state put a\nBig group together and say we want family law specialist we want government lawyers we want people who are moderate in tone moderate in temperate moderate in temperament\nWe want people who are very smart and capable lawyers who would be willing to take a break from their careers to serve the public as a judge or justice\nAnd then put a big group of lawyers together you can't tell if they're all Democrats or Republicans they're all just kind of technocratic judges who will just follow the law and that will take a lot of this partisan rancor out of it but to do that you're going to need a constitutional amendments and to do that you're going to need a massive\nPublic a consensus\nAnd to do that you've got to spend a lot of time convincing people hey we got to get this system fixed and that's what trans political is all about targeted taxation\nWe got all this massive debt and deficit the rich are getting away with murder let's have a special surtax on the rich every single thing goes to paying down on national\nDebt none of it goes to the treasury to pay for corruption or any of that other stuff there are ways to be creative and come up with policy suggestions that will get a broad centrist consensus of Americans and we just are winning elections and the bully using power but until we started doing these things were sunk Dave\nThat's right that's ... that's right but I I don't know what's wrong with you you're in you're just completely wild and crazy when\nApplying intelligence to our problems forty you're trying to do\n[laughter] I'm trying to bring some sanity do it hey Dave ... is the thing\n... Carter Jimmy Carter you remember Jimmy Carter he's still alive and I thank goodness or Jimmy Carter once said way back when he was like running for President Jimmy Carter said the only radical in American politics is the radical center\nNow he was right back in Nineteen Seventy five Seventy six when he was running a but but that's changed now because the Republicans have become a radical party but now that America has gotten a nearly two year good close up and personal look at the crowd I think they're rather repelled so\nWhat is the alternative they're going to vote for the Democrats theoretically and hopefully if some if the votes are counted accurately the Democrats will do well but if the Democrats want to start winning elections on along street corner winning streak that is consistent that is up and down the ballot\nThat involve state and local races the Democrats are going to have\nTo have a positive agenda that responds to people's concerns and resist presents them in a way that people understand and are willing to go along with and to do that that got a ton of people in a way of the understand and you got to talk about the issues they care about like health care and education\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments\nQuicken Loans
