theft of government money and now we've got a sex scandal is that what you're suggesting that is going to affect two of them\nAt least\nAre you saying by the way the Democrats need to take four out of how many I mean what's the total number you got to know that number to to know the significance of what for is right so what's the total number on the board\nThat I don't I don't know I don't know how to find this a moment for homework for dimitrius [laughter] oh well\nAnd everybody over there okay so there with me I was like well I'm forty three and I'm I was like one of the youngest people there there was another girl there that was running for something that uh teaches at my son's elementary school special needs and she was running for something and then the\nI don't think they like being cold and girls so I don't think they like being called girls and women barrel thing she's you'll hear they use laser girl I mean I get so that I understand I\nI meant like everybody would either like in the late fifties sixties seventies\nBut it's very common guy that was very common next\nTo me was\nA juvenile diabetic like myself and\nHe was also waiting for a heart transplant for me the other guy we both had medical conditions and then but one lady I should say but I when I said lady she was\nA she worked at the school but aside from that and and and the one person wanted to volunteer me to run for Wake County board and this is the first like thing I've political thing I've ever volunteered for and then I'd get phone\nBegun again you didn't want to do that I gather you didn't do that you didn't accept it and\nI I don't ... I Know what the issues are not and I'm like I'm I'm In form to bud\nLook who we hope right there up right there because dimitrius you just I think he just reached passed\nA really really giant lesson I'm not getting around about American civics politics look how open the system is dimitrius you're seeing in saying I don't know if I'm ready to handle that I Need to know what I Need to understand I'm asking you to just stop for one second and look at it from a different angle\nLook how open and accessible this system is at least on the local level and certainly you that's where you really would want to have\nInfluence in your own neighborhood that governs your local day to day life I'm just I just wanted to note I didn't want to sell breeze NASA look this our system our system is dying because of lack of participation people volunteers show up like you're talking about in the fifties sixties and seventies\nThey run at all guess who's running the White House will look who's running everything\nBecause they show up because they've got time and they're all Republicans because they're old now I ... I shouldn't be categorical about it but I mean that what you're seeing is very common and you're also seeing and I think you reach passed it is is it if you were to choose to dedicate the time and\nEnergy necessary you could make this system your own you to be one of those county commissioner self dealing it's given Fifteen million bucks and going to prison and all that\nMeans that I Would I Would miss ... to that is a future for you but I'm just saying you know that's how do you think they got into those positions that two guys with the Fifteen million or whatever it is and the self dealing how do you think they they looked at me said wow look how open the system is I just walk in and they say hey\nYou want to be something will make you something and because nobody else wants to do it and then they got in there and they said well look at all this money laying around I Would take me a joke and then they go a little crazy about it and so they go to prison\nOr they lose their election and use TV dimitrius I'm just saying to you the system is wide open and begging for you and everybody to participate now I'd be laboring the point please go ahead\nOkay so yeah so the second so I was the one day I was during the day when I was by myself because I didn't have my kids\nI went to my representatives like the general assembly house of representatives for the state of Illinois and he's a Democrat 'cause they told me that he needs help so I figured he's my representative I voted for him in the primary I'm going to help 'em out\nAnd he goes Greenfield he goes to the state capital he's your state representative right he goes to the state capital diet\nRight but not that it the the how like the general assembly\nAnd then um I did some you know I did some calls and then they picked up my kids and I want you\nTo a citizen I tried to go to the lake county for the second part to do phone banking but we had to use our own phones which will they couldn't get my kids a year to the Occupy that and then they were just like I had to leave\nAddict not out of all I understand oh your kids are four and six right yet and that's my six year old and still young is\nActually watched a couple of different occasions and he said who is Donald Trump and the numbers have they just said president I I I like to get my kids fat\nBut I I I like for them to draw conclusions especially when it deals with character issues grapevine hold them he's president of the United states and then he ... this little blue and then\nThe second did that when he asked a separate occasions I\nHope I'm at the same thing at school I did school there there are bad is that that I think like the tigers or something and they have an acronym and it's Cold War and war stands for being respectful take ownership\nBe accepting and be ready so what I call my Sundays instead of telling him that Donald Trump is a bad person or anything like that I I told them Donald Trump is president the United states but I said Donald Trump\nIs not rich but he doesn't take ownership and he's not accepted and I let him drop zone\nConcluded [laughter] you know hey this guy and that is good Hoosier

do that his poll said the country so divided there's so much anger out there so much resentment and has to get toned down if we're going to make any progress ...\nWhat a peacemaker he is yeah you've got to call this for what it is and everybody knows where it's coming from including Republicans could people on both sides to me\nHow about this have on the views Meghan McCain compares bombs targeting Democrats or Republicans getting heckled at restaurants she jak hall okay\nOn one of the co hosts that I've been texting with my former colleagues at CNN and they're scared one former colleagues that this is what happens when the president calls you the enemy of the people I thought my gosh you know the tone is coming from the top co host Abby Huntsman\nOf course was a Republican urge caution and assigning a political motive to the bombs give me a really break it jumped any conclusion not fall there wasn't enough evidence to make any such claims really how many did you just mentioned six seven liberals is this now\n...\nJoy they are said Fox News hasn't gotten a bomb yet I don't want them to get bombed by the way they are so that the Republican Party's pushback harder

states among others doesn't matter what the appetite for\nYou know I've I've really after some a lot I I'm just flooded [noise]\nOkay let me just get to the since I mentioned at the Supreme Court is another ... elections matter and just doesn't make you mad enough to vote what's happening right now yeah\n... the Supreme Court blocked a federal court order demanding that commerce secretary Wilbur Ross base questioning in a lawsuit challenging his decision to add a citizenship question to the twenty twenty cents is this is more voter suppression on a huge scale\nI'm white matters the decision a major blow to the Eighteenth states doing raw sewage argue that the additional questionable discourage both legal and illegal immigrants from participating in the sense is the census has used determine electoral boundaries and the distribution of federal runs they can only win by cheating and they're trying to\n... they are trying to make it so it's a mountain and says this maybe are less free and fair election that's how important this is\nBecause they are trying to make it so the Democrats the Democrats never win again I mean it's the gerrymandering is already insane and the voter suppression 'em by the way Ross changed his explanation breading the question gets his idea what's Steve Bannon [noise]\nDo you think it was racist in any way [noise] he's pure motives oh\nGod oh how

figures corresponding the gal Marquez says law enforcement sources are revealing a few details about the explosive\nThere you go that's David gregory thank you CNN and it's really really weird because I ran citizen I my wife and I we were watching we were watching CNN and and we're just you know on the couch guy going through newspaper CNN's on and you hear all these alarms\nScares the law enforcement officials who've been\nHandling this is that it it appears to be and they are treating it as\nA functional devices the or the governor of New York and the mayor of New York us in just said the one that was sent to the CNN building their time or had a Time Warner building in a in Columbus Circle in New York was a live explosive devices so this device could have heard a lot of people\nOr you go that's Evan Brezhnev CNN yeah they said that the CNN ... I mean whoever did it\nWe're told that the package that was sent the CNN the one that you're looking at a that has caused the evacuation of their midtown Manhattan headquarters was actually address not just someone who works at CNN but\nTo John Brennan the former CIA director of who sometimes appears on CNN or has appeared on CNN [noise] that's what the package was addressed to tune John Brennan\nBut then the address was the CNN headquarters and what we're told is that a Mr Brennan was contacted by the CIA security because of the fact that of course he's a former official and they're concerned about the safety\nAnd the description that they gave him of the device is consistent with what we have been told and what we've been reporting publicly they all appeared to be similar to the ones are sent a Soros and to the Obamas and the Clintons that they were in a cushion envelope and appeared to be a pipe bomb censor the postal service\nContained I'm I'm a pipe and some wires wow\nThat is Pete Williams we think NBC News for that\nClip I've got time for you we're not going to do our our comedy thirty three minutes into the first hour thing today I've got time for you\nWe got a lot of questions for you as well and if you've got questions answers I've got time one eight eight eight three two one six zero zero one one Tripoli three two one six thousand and one but it started on Monday right today's Wednesday it started on Monday afternoon\nIn a very Tony\nArea north of New York city in Westchester County there's a lot of very wealthy communities in Westchester County north of New York city I have personal knowledge or any\nOf I I was there and not in one of the rich give me I was in an orphanage up in West to there's an orphanage in the middle of Westchester County and I was in it in any event or a north of that orphanage in Westchester County is a very very nice area and that's where George Soros has a home and\nUh somebody found out that address I didn't know it until this story happened I didn't know that we're living in any event he's got a house there someone send George Soros bomb\nOn Monday afternoon now he wasn't home it was intercepted all of these I'm going to give I went through the ... on that I can find on the chronology today just as we can try and reconstruct the chronology and it seemed to start with George Soros Monday afternoon at his home in Westchester County outside New York city\nThen Tuesday bill and Hillary\nA and it was a guy that their home also in Westchester County much closer to that orphanage by the way a very nice but it varies some very very nice areas in Westchester County and bill and Hillary have a home in one of those and uh so that there was a\nBomb address to Hillary went there all of these were intercepted none of them went off none of them reach their intended targets that doesn't make it any better or then of course the Obamas a Eric Holder the governor of New York is the governor of New York since he got one\nDevice has been sent to my office\nThat is also being\nSo there is a spate of these bombings in from ... thanks CNN these are live bombs they're apparently were crude but they could do some serious serious damage\nOkay now of course we have to get to the what do we do about it what do we do about it number one but also but also I\nI have a really big concern here and that is that Donald Trump in the Republican Party are dragging us to help and the problem is is that in order to fight them we've got a battle them straight to hell for example I\nI don't know how to put this I mean I'm declaring the Supreme Court illegitimate and\nI and I believe they are because my position is I'm recognizing what they've done and acknowledging it is simply saying okay since you have torched the place\nI must acknowledge him recognize you towards the place and I give it to respect the credibility it deserves as he scorched torched and destroyed institution\nAnd so I'm not disrespecting the Supreme Court I'm at now during the you guys have destroyed it and so where that takes us is a very very bad place\nBecause here we go again Timothy McVeigh blew up the offered more federal building in Oklahoma City Nineteen Ninety five after Newt Gingrich and his Mary Nazis were giving all the same kind of inflammatory me all Bill Clinton and socialism at the end of the world all that tea bagging\nStuff that you and I saw some years back\nThat was presage by what was going on in Nineteen Ninety four with the conference on America let me take you back if you're old enough to remember those days\nThat was a warm up for all this ... stuff we saw when Obama got in but the rhetoric got heated and of course it doesn't take more than one or two few people write a small group of people to hear what's going on to catch the electricity in the wind and say\nYeah I'm going to win made that pizza place in Washington DC that had Hillary sex operation operate now the bank um a pizza bar going and when I got to find out by myself [noise] that actually happened\nYou know this right that actually happened a guy travel hundreds of miles to go into a pizza parlor in Washington DC with a gun fortunately it didn't go off and no one got hurt because he had just see for himself up pizza place where Hillary was operating\nHer child sex operation out of this is the kind of stuff they're peddling and the people out there here it is a bunch of them all act on it and you only need one or two or a few and that's where we are today so\nHow do you when I\nDeal with the situation when we're dealing with the most uncivil of people who at the most on civil of ways and then say oh we'll kill terrible your your not acting sibling I mean what do you do with that\nI don't have an answer other than to say hey you forfeited your right to claim anything about civility look at you you're an animal you're deplorable these aren't people these are people please recognize that these are one of\nThese people because you're animals All right\nSo he claims the right to declare people he doesn't like these are people around them\nAll but when Hillary said they're deplorable wool Mart doing how dare you\nWhat do you do with this stuff I I'm Serious Donald Trump the Republican Party they are dragging us to hell and\nEither they're going there and dragging us whether we like it or not we're going to have to beat 'em there I don't see any other answer other than say sorry a springboard to legitimate you broke at the governments are legitimate you broke and everything's he'll shouldn't make you broke it\nAnd you and and all this all these these bombs a pipe bombs all this stuff it's all your fault and you really need to knock it off oh and by the way and I know you're going to get mad at me you're going to get mad at me\nBut I'm going to do it anyway\nBecause fierce independence is the norm and I'm going to be accused of giving people ideas\nAnd I'm going to say you're out of your mind I'm not giving anyone any ideas that I ever say anything about Santa pipe bombs to the Obamas and Eric Holder and the governor of New York and CNN so who's next right I mean you've got to ask\nWho's next are they gonna start stocking Supreme Court justices right senators congressmen\nMean all of the street they all do they are I don't know do they already have federal marshal protection\nI mean they ought to at this point if I were sitting member of the speaker especially if I wanted the four Democrats or by one of the four Democrats on the Supreme Court I'd be saying a security escorts protection twenty four seven because if they're willing to do this if whoever was doing to do this what about the spring what about\nLeading Democrats in the Senate and house is this is this the kind of nations like I said that Donald Trump and the Republicans are dragging us to help this is what hell looks like\nSo what do we do about it one eight eight

Oklahoma City that's what this is it's not just Muslims who do terrorism terrorism isn't there is a definition by the way the FBI has definition on their website and I\nI don't like it because to me what makes terrorism terrorism is linking of violence and politics were violence and religion right\nViolence and an agenda some political religious social cultural agenda it is the use of violence or the threat of violence in this case it's both violence and the threat of violence for the purpose of the thing that makes it terrorism is what's the motive behind the violence\nRight if somebody it

know the difference between right and wrong they've never known the different ... right and wrong in years\nAnd speaking of rigged and fix system that brings me back to what's going on today the Republican Party claims to be they don't say it explicitly\nBut it's the tone the attitude\nIs quite obvious they claim to be special they believe they are the white master\nRace they simultaneously claim that they are under attack\nBy all the blacks and the gays and therefore their country is being stolen away from them yet they have all the power and they just ruthlessly do all the stuff they

in his mind for the rich on Wall street well I think he's got to have some accountability when things go bad however that's not the big story of the day in Illinois we have Mike Mike Mike Mike thanks for getting started today\nOn I'm good what's up quite quickly\nViolate the oath of office every time he said something negative about the media or to press that the first amendment amendment that he violates\nQuite the opposite I mean if we were suppressing his speech he would be we'd be violating the first amendment he has the right\nFree speech even if it's extremely disagreeable speech where the courts have come down on this and there have been lots and lots and lots of cases might actually hears it it's a it's the\nLaw is clear is the fact that get muddy but let me just give it a long it's very simple the law the law of when we can stop people from speaking is when that speaking\nIs about to incite violence and I mean a like a second from now the classic example in the cases has been a a two different mobs basically going\nAgain screaming at each other and and they're about to go out and that's when the police can step in when it's fighting words when their nose to nose when it's about to erupt in violence the Supreme Court has said very consistently throughout our history\nThat the remedy to a reprehensible speech is more free speech the ideas it's a marketplace of ideas and theoretically in a in an open and free marketplace of ideas the bad\nIdeas get rejected and the good ideas when the problem we have now is is that the best ideas are winning and a lot of people subscribing to them\nBut us the courts to issue orders or what what lawyers were called prior restraint\nOr you've got some problems first of all what do they how do they fashion or do they issue in order to Benedict Donald saying don't do the bad things about CNN and then what if he says screw you I'm going to do it anyway just exactly what you know he would do how are you going to enforce that order\nWhat do you do impose fines on him\nAnd so you you've got some real problems here we like free speech in America and yes he is inciting violence and yes but he's doing it is doing it\nFar enough away from fighting words and you know if if you were one of these rallies right I mean you got a better a case against him a civil case in these rallies when he said you know what hit these guys are paid for your legal fees\nSee that that would be you know to me evidence in a civil suit were you just say he made himself a party to the case by offering aid and comfort base without pay your legal fees go ahead and the salt these people but the courts may if that were there\nAnd say you know even that's not specific to enough it's gotta be specific if he were at one of these rallies and he said hey this guy take him out and beat him up then the police could jump in and they stop right there that's\nYou know you're you're literally about to be the guy beat the snot out of a guy and we know that's about to happen\nThose are fighting words we can step in and prevent that but it's got a gum really close to the line before we can stop people from speaking my day no that's not anything like what you were hoping to hear but that's the law\nYeah one more thing has oath\nOf office as to support the first amendment bottom line and he's not doing that [noise]\nThe remedy is impeachment in the house conviction in the Senate for repeal and replace Republicans in the house and Senate this November the six so that we have a check and balance on the White House and then kick him out in twenty twenty\nBut when you ask the courts to start issuing orders about what people can say in who they can say it to\nYour asking the courts to do something they are extremely reluctant to do the remedy is not always in court and my that's my concern is that so many people looked to me and look to the long look to courts right to when when they don't win elsewhere and\nAnd very very often that's a square peg round whole scenario there were will look into the courts to do things that they just don't do that are supposed to do so there is a remedy is not in court\nOne eight eight

anyway I don't know I\nI understand I mean as an avid listener I followed the rules [laughter] anyway I just like yeah and I know I've been able to you about it and I just what it was curious as to what you think I think there than it is fundamentally unconstitutional fundamentally on representative for those of us who live in a big state like California\nYou know and allow or you are go ahead man you are so right you can't be more right go ahead\nYeah well I have an idea and it would take constitutional minute by I think we can do it and my idea is basically to expand the Senate so that there is one senator or a million people um regardless of where they live so in California we have to forty million people be forty two senators we keep our\nHow do you know that I mean it's a great idea but how do you do that\nWell yet constitutional amendment but that's basically job one senator for every million ...\nWell how do you get the kind of decision amended to say that when the process of requiring amendment is going to never succeed because you have lots of states that are voting today we'd their power radically who would do well I I Will power would Wyoming for talking about Wyoming Idaho South Dakota might be not the now the junkie crappy states\nSee my my my ... my fingers and I think you can sell the states that have over a million or even over two million in population just by saying hey you're getting more representation in that regard was whether they're rich\nThat are blue state they will get then we'll get more representation\nAnd I think you can find a thirty seven states necessary to to pass something like\nThat really I think it'd be a lot how I don't know what I Hope so [laughter] but you know\nI I go ahead you're never going to convince Idaho in Wyoming and Montana and South Dakota Vermont I mean as a democratic state in the mix there they'll never give up that kind of power but go ahead go ahead and make it well\nOK aren't they can work something out Georgia we got about ... million people you know and regardless of whether they're red or blue or you can you weren't getting more representation in the Senate you're on the function of a sudden they still do according to the cost\nYou know because the ... there's at least Thirteen states that are lightly enough populated Kansas Nebraska north and South Dakota I mean we can start going through and they're going to look at that proposal say you're out of your cotton picking mind\nThat tell us a power that's how we get massive power in this country we're not going to vote to give that up and with more than ... states saying forget it you can't amend the constitution you just can't\nBlow the wide be willing to look at whether there are more in Thirteen states or not but ah but you know I\nAnd then as soon as it doesn't get two thirds of both houses by the way best of luck on line and you got to go there to build houses\nExactly that that that's going to be I I agree with you that the major hurdle but I'm thinking that you're going to be able to face directly or hey you can have more representation of federal level if you live in a if you live in a state that is\nYou know even even two million cars on the way I see it and start off with here is I think the centers would lose any senators every state without at least two it was just you just get additional
