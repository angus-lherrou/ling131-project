allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona says it's important that\nThe conclusion to a senior legal endless segment we did last week if you recall we were talking about Tesla Ilan mosque tweets\nInfant in fact one tweet in particular\nAre you on must get weeded out that he was taking Tesla prime and the two magic\nWords which were not the best word dream funding secured which turned out to be false there was a whole bunch of just like made up stuff behind that we it royal ... the markets that are old I L. E. D. there's nothing regal or were you know king like about it it has\nTo do with upsetting R. O. I. L. E. the royal the markets and so the securities and Exchange Commission went after him and now it's a resolution that lightning speed so that would be part of senior legal endless time in one hour forty million dollars is changing hands and some other changes as well it was a settlement and this is what happens\nPeople settled their cases so\nWe'll do a separate senior legal analyst a segment but with regard to Brett Kavanaugh\nThat's how we got to get started today you know there are really\nTwo big issues here\nAnd the first of the two is what is the scope of this investigation what is the scope how many people are going to be interviewed\nAnd as to which allegations now it seems to me there would have to be at least three separate people right there are the course Dr Christine Blasey Ford who got started then of course now\nAnd then there's Deborah Ramirez the second victim and complain it out of Yale University undergrad and then the third one is Michael ... client you we sweat Mick\nI'm leaving the fourth and fifth aside because they seem to just kind of not didn't go anywhere I mean they were this is why people investigate right they they were brought up I reported them but this I'm not here to vouch for them I'm a reporter so\nThat's why we do investigations hello that's what we do investigations there's a report let's investigate so it looks like the first three\nHave really really turned into you know credible and certainly investigate all\nAllegations in any maybe the forces well I don't know I'm not an investigator that's not my job so the question is what the heck is the scope of the FBI's investigation that's a really important question\nI think the way I should interview anybody that they want within reason\nBut after say within reason they\nBut they should also be guided and I'm being guided by what the senators are looking for because they have to make the choice\nAs always every word a lie and hash tag every word ally and that always made up because it's being reported everywhere my everybody that he is personally involved in keeping the FBI on a very limited track\nI Want it to be comprehensive I actually think it's a good thing for judge Kavanaugh I think it's actually a good thing not a bad thing I think it's a good thing now with that being said I'd like it to go quickly and the reason I'd like to go quickly very simple so simple because it's unfair to him at this point ties\nSo that that's about as much of you know who is I can stomach playing however I may have to play a little more a little later but let's just understand that there are there are two jam jobs going here and so\nWe've got the first big thing that we've got to talk about the scope of this investigation and with the scope of the investigation\nThere's two things going on there as well number one is we're being told oh it's a broad as the FBI was wherever the center was the launch of bologna that's not true the thing is is the second part is the inside there's there's there's a cover up\nAnd so that's what appears to be going on and one thing that Benedict Arnold is very much a emphasize yes\nIt's got to be done by friday we got to wrap it up friday they said one week one week I'm looking at my watch year one week woman and a you know all I can say is\nMerrick Garland Merrick Garland how 'bout Merrick Garland anybody Merrick Garland\nReal awesome careful and Mr President you can practically hear the south of the Democrats moving the goalposts\nWell there you go we gotta talk about those goal posts and Mitch McConnell the Senate ... Senate majority leader who is the guy trying to do it jammed job and so\nThe the first thing is what is the scope and so I Can't I cannot tell you what the scope is ah because I Believe I Believe that the scope is very narrow in his being rigged been fixed by Benedict don't believe me however if you are to be leaving believe me other sources which I Do not then it's a more broad investigation\nBut it's got to be done by friday when I got to be done by friday\nAnd so that's that's this is the second thing this is jammed up McConnell is out there now saying we're having a ball there's way worry about as we can if you think I'm making this up check our social media sites Lenore mangled man show on Facebook at\nNor mangled men on Twitter and you will find the link right there that there's a story Mitch McConnell late breaking news Mitch McConnell saying\nOr an all white and all the above the gay and we're going to be voted is worried about the law I'm ready to go\nAnd so they're doing a gym job on two sides Mitch McConnell trying to jam it through the Senate and Benedict Arnold trying to jam it through the FBI by not having them investigate and so it's a double Jim job with two things happening and about those goal posts about those goalposts\nLet me preface this by offering you an observation\nLast Thursday you and I and the rest of the world\nWitnessed in on glued on hinged Brett Kavanaugh he was horrible that was the most in judicious temperament I've seen me he made the judge in eastern Virginia you remember during the trial with Manafort with the crazy judge you kept interrupting and making it by himself\nBrett Kavanaugh made that judge look normal and so and ... and\n... it's not just me it's a lot of legal you know observers saying wow what Brett Kavanaugh did was really crossing the line here he really showed himself to be quite the partisan he accused the Democrats are political hit right to me this is a consensus of all the legal observers and and\nWe're all looking at him saying after that performance you know what was everybody's opinion of Kavanaugh's performance\nYou think you'd find enough but I think it was [noise]\nIt's impossible for him to have any legitimacy if they do gym among the Supreme Court because he's going to be a for ever identify with that ... present patient where he said\nIt's about getting the Clintons back at what are you talking\nAbout it's up by the way you're talking about millions being spent it's all being spent on your side bro so that the fact that he lowered himself not just into the gutter he went into the sewer\nRight see that we saw that I'm going to assume from my purposes here that he was sober at the time [noise] and I'm not shouldn't do the drums I shouldn't do the drumstick because I'm being very serious now\nLet's assume I think it's fair let's be fair right fair about let's be fair about let's just assume that last Thursday that performance that Mr ...\nIf I get my opinion of it\nWas yeah I agree I agree let's assume he did that sober\nNow\nChange one fact put a few beers into him right imagine his behavior after he's had a few and his in hip missions\nHave been lowered\nOuts by liquid [noise]\nCan you imagine that performance can you imagine I put\nMy opinion of it I think what can you imagine that\nPerformance after a six pack or eight or ten or twelve or whatever it is against them blacked out and\nThere's a dude named Chad loving ten L.

Glad you called from Chicago Jason\nHey non thanks for taking the call deal I'm Sorry\nI've got your privacy is that I Need to set up before I ask my question first I'm Robert Mueller if he charges and the science ... things to charge Trump with Trump can pardon himself but then it could be he could also be charged in state court from\nWhich he cannot pardon himself\nThat though from that is true I've got I've got an added an asterisk there is a case out there that challenges that doctrine I'm working on it well you know I don't want to I'm already getting the panic females to Norman Norman Goldman dot com and I yeah\nI don't want to freak people out it's not time to panic at the guy who built the first duty uh we did in the radio show said nor I'll tell you when it's time to panic\nIs not now and he never did say was time to panic and he was probably write in any event it's not time to panic and I know everybody's already hair on fire the runaround oh my God it's all over and it's no it's far from over so yes there is this case out there\nBut it's there's many steps but I remember myself saying look there are many steps for Benedict Donald gets into the White House these many steps things seems to have a way of kind of\nHappening all in a room anyway go ahead\nYeah you're right in my second premise that I've heard that the strikes have in our nomination is so important to Trump's because of this case coming up that he could no fire that that uh that says that if you are first charged in a state and federal court you cannot be charged again in state court so my question is\nIs if it gets on the court and we know that that is how he is going to school and how that the five other than the other Republican judges are going through all that could lower\nAt the end of it investigation just say you know what I'm not getting fresh pressed charges in federal court we're just going to have this right over to the state and let them do it first\nWell ... ... ... ...\nAre you doing a race against the clock kind of analysis\nYou're basically look now at at the end of the before the Supreme Court takes away the dual sovereignty doctrine which is what that thing is called a and prevent prevents the states from ... from prosecuting when there's been a federal pardon for the same crimes are you are you saying we've got a race against the clock\nLot against the clock but yet if you say that if you if you didn't federal first then you can't do state why not use state for\nWhy I think you're misunderstanding the concept that we're discussing what's what's going on\nThere's a thing called dual sovereignty and that is that the federal and state governments have\nConcurrent jurisdiction over many many things if you're walking around with a pound of cocaine right in your car your subject to federal prosecution as well as the prosecution because they have concurrent jurisdiction over many many things\nRight if there's a a poison the water well uh you can have federal EPA can have the state environmental agency involved\nSo there's concurrent jurisdiction over many things in in our lives that concurrent jurisdiction means to us once the federal government in the state both have jurisdiction over us and we're answerable to both of them\nWe pay taxes to the federal government does that whole IRS thing that we all know about but there's a state taxing aids either we also deal with as well Michael Cohen gotten into trouble with the New York state taxing authority as well as the iris ... the reason we have\nThis concurrent jurisdiction\nComes from the very nature of our system\nWhich is a dual sovereignty system the federal government and the states are separate layers of government and they each have their own claims to sovereignty and truth is the states have a much stronger claimed sovereignty because the state just always work and the federal government is an artificial creature created by the state\nOkay now with all that foundation lead the theory therefore is and has been for ever that if you commit a crime like walking around with a pound of cocaine in your car or driving around with a pound a cocaine or\nYou know you don't need to cross state lines to invoke federal jurisdiction right if the fed cat you of the pound a cocaine they can ... federally the state's prosecute you this notion that there's a case out there that's working its way to the Supreme Court that says that\nIs fundamentally at odds with the\nFifth Amendment and double jeopardy right that if you get a presidential pardon for a pound a cocaine and your car that you shouldn't be allowed to be prosecuted by the state for that same pound a cocaine because you've been part in federally and it really is double jeopardy you're being charged twice for the same crime and\nSo what what they're looking for is kind of carve out of the concurrent jurisdiction are dual sovereignty doctrine\nNow that case I haven't finished my research on it yet I'm not sure where in the process that cases but today today they have an eight member court you knew that by the way right Jason hang on the\nCourt begins a new car without a ... currently sat on the high court slip a tool for conservative and liberal now that's a possibility of what has\nNow that's nor O'Donnell's CBS News thanks CBS News name liberals there for Democrats and a former public gains snake conservatives either in any event so Jason\nThere's our situation but already I Know the people who liked to set their hair on fire and freak out and say oh my God it's all over the sky is falling I Know them well after all these years ah they're already reaching out and saying norm I'm betting ready to kill myself again and\nNo one reason President Obama nominated ...

E. O. he will remain that's why they settle cases you give some and he gets up he's giving up his seat on the board and they will be other board members and\nThey do or not so close to Iran must but he remains the c._e._o. of the company\nAnd forty million dollars will change hands twenty million each for me one must\nAnd Tesla so that was the settlement they settle their case the securities and Exchange Commission didn't get what they wanted they wanted him out of the company but they did get forty million dollars I mean that's always a good thing and\nThey got 'em off the board and they got the board to be a little more independent so that's what happens when you settle cases you don't get everything you want one eight eight eight three two one zero zero zero one there was a massive national natural disaster in Indonesia we will get to that\nAnd there's a new NAFTA and I'm going to call the new NAFTA well we'll get to that in the next hour this hours you and me and Paul thanks for being with us in Washington ball\nI Want to talk about evidence or this keeps coming up here about the cabin okay if there was no there is no evidence and I\nI have to say testimony as evidence right norm\nOf course yes\nIt's a matter of fact the greater amount of\nMoney yeah it's one of the most popular types of evidence is there are no kidding [laughter] as one of the most common one of the most common types of evidence is testimony\nRight and as a matter of fact that I get these these people are coming off the worst thing that well there's no physical evidence but I point I Would point out that\nWell oftentimes say one a blue dress is\nOkay let's habit but\nA norm I think you'd have to agree that doesn't physical evidence doesn't really help you without testimony\nTo inform the nature weight and relevance of the physical evidence\nAbsolutely I mean you got to explain what it is here's a blue dress here's one here's what we did with it right his and then we found out what was on a blue dress\nAnd you can have conflicting testimony about the physical evidence absolutely\nBut the other thing I was thinking arm is that the ocean is here that okay we have to talk to them on it and that the opposition opposing testimonies are necessarily a counter canceling and that is not true\nBut they left the implication that is what they wanted to be like oh look I've got I've got fifty percent looked at the keg is half empty here and a half empty their\nVery apt analogy no\nThat was Matt Damon I must now not I'm not going to steal his material without attribution that was Matt Damon on Saturday Night live I'm a I'm a ... half full kind of guy\n[laughter] great well I loaded\nWith either by Ford made her testimony well let's look over her testimony was coherence it was um [noise] she was cooperative and art or issue was coherent she was um a consistent sorry and uh\nAnd she was\nListening I'm listening go ahead\nEither change phones because the only ones with\nRussia and I heard the boot looping go ahead oh was it was like being boom bang boom right along the toilet you go\nLook at what he was inconsistent combative and also so in this case we have heard testimony helps her testimony outs are\nAbsolutely it wasn't if she's\nThought duct defied and he said nothing hers would sit at whatever value it is and then you could come on let's say he has an opportunity to either counter\nTests the counter testify and and I took a detract from her only can pick out to testify and in ... which is what he did so I'm hearing it all is well we don't have any evidence\nAnd my thought was well things about evidence first of all and we're this is the Senate hearing this is not a not a beyond reasonable doubt it's not even provide some of the evidence it's simply fishing dog wouldn't you agree sufficient doubt in this case\nWell with the fifty percent\nWhat standard or you're applying is a great question I mean if that's west right in the criminal\nTrial it's beyond a reasonable down it's got to be unanimous here here and so many people pointing out it's a job interview and so what's the standard you apply to a job interview and I love them now gee it's a job interview great if the person applying for the job appears to be a drunk molester women then\nPerhaps you should invest the gate before you hire this person do you ever thought that was a little lifetime job and you can't fire him\nBut it goes to sufficient doubt in other words I'm sort of let me ask\nThis question when any but what what anybody listening engaging from activity in which you had a twenty five percent chance of dying\nThat's a pretty ... it's a twenty five percent chance is low but if you're talking about getting killed I don't think many people would engage in a let me try this and the one in four chance of dying\nRussian roulette right Russian roulette with four chambers in one bullet\nOr even six chambers one bullet know most people wouldn't do that that's\nThe only one in seven ... [laughter] so so much\nLess than fifty percent so then the other thing is I wanted to ask if I hear this where can anybody cite an example we're physical evidence has been introduced in a Senate hearing of any kind\nOf well it depends on how you how you define evidence I mean how about a chart how about a shark with a grant for charting the graph right which is referencing something that can be evidence\nPoint what well let me do this let me just because you and I have a wonderful senior legal endless teachable moment here which I think can help\nIf if if whoever is listening to a person listening\nIs actually coming if this was good faith and really wants to learn as opposed to being a snotty politician who already knows the decision they they want to get to win and just looking for a way to get there in let's differentiate those two let me give you an easy example here it's a hypothetical I just made up on the spur of the moment during our call our conversation\nArt here you go let's say there's a murder trial right in state court there's a murder trial and there's a real question of who'd done it right the state is prosecuting this guy let's make them a guy there prosecute this die\nFirst degree murder and his defense is you've got the wrong guy right okay so the question in the case is who's dude did he do it did he do it identification on one of the features in my hypothetical is that the murder happens\nTo be short and I mean noticeably short and people who witnessed the murder they didn't see him but they said\nI saw shadows I saw whenever I saw right and who we it was a guy 'cause he looked like a guy and and he and five feet tall me gee whiz five one maybe and all the people's at five months by by short guy that's the thing that everyone agrees on short guy so they put a guy\nOn on trial and and and they put in these five foot two or whatever right and so\nNow you start to parade witnesses in right different witnesses and they're all talking about the height of the person they saw now many of those witnesses are not going to be able to say in fact in Miami but set a goal not one of them can say that the guy\nAll they can do is say he was a short guy kinda fits that time the judge can let that in\nNo question that can be evidence and the fact that it's not I witness saying that's the guy I saw him do it that's not the standard we apply to evidence the standard is first of all is it relevant right and if the question and the cases that we get the guy and he's a tall divers are short guy and everybody's going to say your guy\nBut that's just a really good chance to just going to let that kind of stuff in\nEvidence takes all kinds of different forms as my evidence professor in law school was fond of saying an elephant\nCan be evidence in a case you can physically if we can fit it into the courtroom you could walk an elephant into the ... image relevant I mean it'd be litigating a circus or something and the question is won't be element I mean you can come up with\nThis week in Nineteen eighty six popular news anchor Dan Rather is attacked by a man who hit them from behind them repeats the phrase tennis what is the frequency prompting our am to write this song [noise]\nWhat's the frequency Kenneth this weekend Nineteen eighty seven in a wild twists Smokey Robinson hold the number tense thought on the hot one hundred with one heartbeat song about him when smoky things by ABC\nIs it number eight this week in Nineteen Ninety to ...

your judgment call Nolan [noise] [noise] oh you've obviously watched a doctor for a\nInterview let me just walk through the little part I'm Talking about and then I Want your judgment okay she was pushed into a room where music was already playing the doors close they turn the music a cabinet jumped on her\nShe started to scream he put his hand on her mouth she feared for her life the they start laughing both of them are kind of ... in concert and the\nAnd he didn't say that when you're little out of sequence that last one's more towards the end\nStuff has been in between before the laughter\nAs I ever as I recall a story ... stuff happened there was the time passed a cabinet was trying to rip her clothes off and\nShe said he was so drunk he was having a hard time of course she was struggling mark judge was in the room and he was as\nUltimately egging him on and tell him to stop then mark judge jumped on the bed at least once and sent them all tumbling and that shows she got away she got out from under Brett Kavanaugh to she got thrown onto the floor when when mark judge jumped on all the she said it was then she was here and all the laughter\nWhen they were running down the stairs bouncing off the walls going downstairs laughing their butts up\nThat's my recollection of the facts I could be wrong go ahead and\nOkay I accept that now here's what occurred to me after I was watching it over and over this thing was so kind of free rehearsed with the music on in the in the room and I think they've done this before it's it's just working in concert too much for me in my head\nI think that would be the first\nWell if you listen to Michael I've been out of his client you we sweat Nick she said that there were ... efforts made that were intentionally targeted in advance to pick out a a young woman and two targeted her with alcohol and you know give her the bill Cosby treatment and and\nGet her to a point where she couldn't scene when she was vulnerable and his defense was position and then take advantage of by gang rapes that's what Julie sweat Nick was saying was that these guys they called the jungle juice better name for it and so basically it's like setting a trap\nThey would set a trap for a young woman and\nIn snare one and then gang rape her and Jewish what makes it it happened to me and her story is it happened\nTo me but what I from what I can recall Brett Kavanaugh and mark judge neither one or two of the guys who gang rape me they were not on the train in ... that's what they called it but they were in the room when it was happening and so and they they were that's\nTypical that wasn't the only time they did that by by reputation so gee that's Julie sweat next argument\nRight and the other person that was in the rule no reason I think she doesn't want to be interviewed directly under oath is because he's dirty he's done this before they're going to dig up something in his past and that's what he doesn't\nWant mark judge or the other guy does in the room I don't know it was like\nWell ... which there was only one guy in the room was mark judge Brett Kavanaugh mark judge and and and Dr Jordan\nCourt judge yeah\nWell here's the thing though is CJ here's the part that I Can't I Can't shake this one thought\nWhich is that Dr Ford\nWho mark judge in that room she didn't have to she created a witness she made mark judge a key eye witness and she knew that mark judge was very close friend or Brett Kavanaugh at least back in the day\nShe gave mark judge a\nClean wide open opportunity and I'm telling you this is a lawyer right as a lawyer who was done with lots of litigation that if I were a lawyer talking to mark judge I'd say look I don't know what you know but I'm telling you this you have\nAn opportunity to say I know exactly what she's talking about and she's totally wrong\nAnd and however you know whatever it is but mark judge did not say that\nMark judge didn't say he didn't say she was right\nBut he didn't say she was wrong he said I don't know anything I'm running away I don't feel well I'm a recovering alcoholic does that sound like a guy who wants to tell the truth to you or does that sound like a guy who knows what happened\nAnd doesn't want to say because it's going to blow up his buddies Supreme Court nomination so he's running for the hills at a hundred miles an hour CJ that's what I Can't shake\nMark judge when he was asked about it he could have just said yes it happened or no it didn't happen but he gave this really weird squirrels we answer\nThat said basically leave me alone that tells me that that yeah that's what happened and then when when Dr Ford said she ran into mark judge in a safe way ... you know some took point their employees working at a Safeway and he was very very uncomfortable I mean\nWho can make this kind of stuff and by the way I'd like to get some verification from Safeway they've got an employee records he has a Social Security number they were deducting taxes for me whether he was a stock boy or a check or whatever\nThe heck that guy was doing Safeway has records and so Dr Ford is giving giving\nIndications where things can just blow up her story or prove it and she's giving these details voluntarily that\nTells me she's being a hundred per cent honest a straightforward nobody would do this stuff it's too easy Safeway could come back and say we have no record of mark judge ever\nWorking for us in any place in the San Francisco bay area and that goes out to forge credibility do you see mark forwards or pardon me mark judge do you see anybody going to say they say they will come on give us your records give us your records show us the market has never worked there I don't see I don't see mark judge saying no no no no no I never worked at Safeway\nMarches knows full well he worked at Safeway he knows real world that he walked in that Christine Blasey Ford or Christie ... walked in there he knows it's all true and he doesn't want to get involved because you just want to blow up his buddy Supreme Court seat that's what's\nGoing on [laughter] it's not only his buddy that I think his his own skin because she said when she was pushed in the room she didn't know who pushed her so she had to include that person because she didn't know\nWell she was telling the truth I mean this is what happened to someone pushed urine from behind the food that you know she didn't know was right and there are two guys in the room CJ thank you so very much for that and and here's here's the guide use your commonsense\nHow you keep
