oh right under the toilet\nAnd situation we have now is um he's turning his back on a our regular our allies like uh France and Denmark and um\nYou know Sweden and and ah Britain uh Germany and he's pandering to um Russia he's the I'm trying to I'm a diminished China\nAnd and China basically\nUh with the numbers of people China has economically they won uh there there's more Chinese that our our children and our our people in the United states\nUh they went by the attrition anyway you know it is it we can't battle these people but we need to show the world we need to get back to the court to directory of all\nWhere we are the guiding like we are the ... the place for bringing in your poor and you're a wretched and the people coming in from Guatemala and Honduras Nicaragua or\nUm [noise] we need to be there and show the world that these people it's a long ways to walk all the way through Mexico to get to the United states they would probably be a great Americans\nVery harrowing journal and they're very harrowing journey to go from Honduras so here\nThey would become great Americans if they're willing to walk that far for the promise of America there there probably will turn out to be the exception a suction\nAll Americans and and there are a small number two the size of this country they were to simulate and and you won't even notice that they're basically you know uh except probably that they're they're good workers are good business people they're smart people\nWhy are what are our long though Trump once of er mar a Lago we import them I mean he treats these people like they're just ... in the machine he does\nWell I I agree I agree with that's another of bad black eye on a on the face of this country\nI let him once like that how can we talk migrants present because that's your topic first of all is\nUnless you are a Native American then you weren't a migrant to this country you and me and everybody else we're all migrants number one that raises the question of is there an expiration date or the for the statue of liberty bring me your tired your poor your huddled masses\nYearning to breathe free you're rich you refuse to your teammates yours is there an expiration date I mean did it stop like on December thirty first Nineteen fifty one and no one told us about it apparently apparently the Republicans\nAre saying oh was when we came here but now that we're we're going to slam the door I knew there was an expiration date on this number two number three\nThe real question is I see this how many people we absorb how many people we absorb\nAnd I know I mean I'm I'm though when I'm no town miss but I Know a lot of a credible found them as are out there saying hey we need immigrants for economic growth because they do a lot of the jobs that we need done so the real question how many can we absorb and\nAnd I know this finite land they know this finite water I noticed finite everything we can't let everyone enemy now obviously every a lot of people want to be here we've got to be smart about a month this nation is showing the racist side by saying I\nDon't want anyone from his home country I mean for crying out loud if we know how many people we can assemble it if we know how many people we can absorb for economic growth and how many people the resources are and we're letting those numbers and we got to show the world we're letting people have been all from all different places like Somalia\nWhere they're not no region I mean the so what what Benedict Donald's doing Jim is what you're saying he's given us a black

area both on real talk nine ten Hi Sean\nHey well hey nor am I think first and foremost a we have to over perform in this upcoming ... congressional election absolutely and uh\nYes because we need to take back our Congress see maybe that needs to be the message 'cause I'm so sick of how the media calls at MIT terms and stuff\nBut I ... back how's that for good when I'm On my Congress back\nWell absolutely absolutely\nSo normally real quick on this show you thing because it's disgusting Fifteen of the Eighteen hijackers on nine eleven were Saudis and there were really no consequences because the oil flowed and then we ended up going in invading a a you know Iraq\nIran lies bring all that wrong country yes\nI just want to say that first and foremost and also let me put this Republicans have radicalized too many Americans absolutely\nYou can do a parallel people this is a little bit scary but this is how important these elections are the Republicans have radicalized too many Americans and it and they proved it by supporting chump absolutely if you have to watch out\nThese people wouldn't be mercenaries there so not smart [laughter] I don't know what words they use\nPeople these are amateurs showing their animals are either mayor animals\nThey even fasted our country because we are taking the bull by the horns and the sad fact is now in this election which I agree with you I don't really trust\nHow this whole mechanisms gonna work we're going to have to over perform and I mean white people are gonna have to over perform I mean black folks understand\nAbout this their whole lives they've had to over perform and getting jobs and just getting a little step in life\nAnd now normal patriotic Americans who happen to be white\nUm our understanding right now that you better over performing ... groups of people to vote and overwhelm the system because we're up against it voter suppression Russian collusion I don't like that word but I think it's conspiracy to the fraud with the Trump Administration\nWe really got to get this together people and understand it really is just win baby when it comes to politics\nThere is a certain time when you need to just say just wind and for the Democratic party this time around\nJohn I couldn't agree with you more and the Republicans are so freaked out about a blue wave will boost to nominee that they are now just openly doing anything and everything they can't stopping a bus full of African\nAmerican or senior citizens from going to the polls right sitting on thousands and thousands of absentee ballots which is what's happening in Georgia\nThey're doing everything they can to doing it openly embrace only that desperation they know that people are very very upset and that they're voting in large numbers and so this is that we're seeing the Republicans for all their ugliness\nAnd please remember and never forget that do those cells creates you see on the keys and that's why\nHe that's why violate the constitution that's why I hate every body 'cause I'm a Christian\nYou see this is what we asked to do these people and if you're not going to get through to them 'cause they're a bunch of knuckle dragging ignoramus as you get to the people who can be wage you use them as a diving board\nThey use a Christian that Reagan all the elections and we'd go raises ways not Christian that showed you marry brand\nNow look I Do it in an offensive way to make a point\nBut there are people who are reachable and to that point\nAnd John thank you for the call there is pulling out showing the Republican Party is shrinking and purifying\nThey are shedding women even know why women what the Republican Party is boiling down to what they are basically just shrivel up into\nIs a party of white older men with no education to speak on we're talking a high school high school educated in last white men\nAnd some women that's in\nEverybody else's like thanks I'm outta here is that enough or unless you is

Bush they had a five to four majority on the Supreme Court and that had that power five four majority stop the voting in Florida handed the White House that George W. Bush they'd been accumulating power ever since\nAnd look where we are today so in this vein\nAlong this line of they grab power they accumulate more power they use that to get more power than a cumulative more and they use that to get more and more\nAll right the census is coming up the census\nEvery ten years it's in the constitution we have to have a count and by the way the first count the very first census Seventeen Ninety\nRight we've done it every ten years to Seventy Ninety just under four million four million one two three four four million that was the initial population the United states and the first census Seventeen Ninety four million\nAnd that's the population of the city of Los Angeles\nJust to show you take the populist the valley spread it pretty much all over the eastern seaboard right that's where you know the states were right beside the board and that's that was the original United States population well we've grown just a wee bit since then\nAnd every ten years meaning twenty twenty there's the census Wilbur Ross is a corrupt creating of a guy and he is the commerce secretary and the Commerce Department runs the census who knew and he added a question\nVery interesting question are you a citizen\nThat's designed to deter people from being counted and deterring people\nPeople who are citizens say like like white Republicans they say oh of course I'm a citizen they're trying to deter Latino right Mexicans from being counted and if you're not counted that's one less member of the house representatives in the state if you get an undercount enough people right this is\nHow you fundamentally rig and fix a system you play with the fabric of it every ten years if you can undercount your opponent right you've got\nTo have power to control the machinery of government this is why it's important that Hillary had one it was important it it'll be in the White House does he executive runs the census I kept saying this ten billion consequences\nThat come from one vote and here's one from the census NAFTA Republicans get away with reading and fixing the twenty twenty cents is then the Democrats will have\nA structural disadvantage under counted for\nTen years all through the twenties hey guess who's helping them\nLast night the Supreme Court gave commerce secretary Wilbur Ross a path allowing them to avoid testifying at least for now in a lawsuit over a twenty twenty cents as question an overwhelming evidence that Ross middle less misled Congress\nNow opponents say the question about citizenship was designed to the press responses from immigrant populations and therefore undercount residents to get partisan advantage\nRoss said it was all the Justice Department's idea but he mailed brought to light a lawsuit from the New York attorney general show that that's just isn't true\nRoss disgust assesses question with Steve Bannon and kinds of sectors that Kris Kobach that would be Trump's one time vote frauds are now running for governor\nFaced with an inconvenient truth the Trump Administration asked the Supreme Court to step in and block a lower court order the Ross explain themselves under oath the court came through for Trump big time chilling Ross from testifying and the order was written by Trump's first Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch\nAnd that is John ... from CNN and we think CNN for that Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch wrote saying hey we stop these entire proceedings\nWhat are these proceedings you and I are a senior legal analysts time I'll be on the phone within just a moment of one eight eight eight three two one six thousand one however\nWho has standing to file a lawsuit against the United states government over a rigged and fix censors who has standing us I don't know about the state of New Jersey\nHow 'bout any state that says you're going to under count our\nCitizens and that's going to deprive this state of representation in Congress that qualifies that's standing\nAnd that's why there's litigation because New Jersey definitely and other states as well are suing and then they're saying hey look you are intentionally going under count our residents and that will deprive us the representation in Congress and the damages\nThe citizens of this state and the people in this state and therefore we want to find out we got to go to trial with a lawsuit going to trial we want to prove that this was a a\nArbitrary and capricious that this was done for ill motive so that the court can throw the question are we going to have a proper centers the trial is set for a couple of weeks from now\nAnd they ... the the plane to say the New Jersey public interest groups wanted to take the deposition of Wilbur Ross the commerce secretary he's been all over the place on this he's given a variety of explanations as to why that sentence question is there but\nSupreme Court said no you don't you don't get that they will bosses deposition and by the way you needed five judges to stop it it was on science so we don't know how many but it was at least five how many Republican judges are up there and also I don't know I take a wild\nGuess other case will go for it slated to begin November fifth but without Wilbur Ross this case is about far more than one Trump cabinet members honest in front of cause it's about attempts to get Republicans an artificial edging redistricting by under counting undocumented immigration assessments despite a constitutional requirement that all residents not just citizens pick out\nThat again John I've long we do think CNN for that and that is an important point the Supreme Court even John Roberts the so called chief justice said this just a year or so ago he said no\nIt's not just counting citizens it's counting all warm bodies all warm bodies whether there are citizen or not and so that question was answered even recently and therefore this is the latest Republican attempt to rig and fix senior
