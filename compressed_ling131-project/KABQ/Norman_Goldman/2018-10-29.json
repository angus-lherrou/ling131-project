this week starting things off is the latest from Riverdale the cw theories takes place [noise] see them three of this disaster is underway and into the episode Atlanta number four\nGood grief is the newest Halloween episode of ABC's Modern Family they take a third place this week NASA number two it's the everyday angel episode of Grey's Anatomy\nAnd finally Halloween season it wouldn't be complete without some TV scares American horror story apocalypse remains as your number one TV stream\nTop TV stream and I are radio\nIs for massacre pipe bomb hearing I'm In case the suspect accused of gunning down eleven people at a Pittsburgh synagogue has made his first court appearance correspond a Jerry ...\nWas wheeled into the courtroom where the judge lifted the charges against him you sign some papers and agreed to be represented by a public defender he'll be back in court on Thursday for a preliminary hearing when the prosecution will present evidence to back up the charges against him\nI always thought that it that the idea of America was the cream rises to the talk the whole point was if you've got talent if you've got a good idea if you're willing to work hard this is the land of opportunity\n[noise] the idea of America is you rise and fall on your individual merits the opposite of that is group judgment group punishment\nThere have been instances like in school\nRight there's a group of kids and one of the kids does something bad steal something does something and the teacher says okay everybody stays an hour after school unless they tell me or whoever tells me who it is that did the thing right so thirty kids or whatever the number of kids that are getting punished does have one\nThat's group punishment and we don't like group punishment and there's instances of punishment everywhere and it's not good anywhere however here\nIn America and that's where I'm an American so who's an American you and I have to confront who is an American because these people who are doing these things\nBy the way I've got senior legal endless time in the next hour right we've got to we've got to give it to the law case against the magna mama hash tag ... bomber don't forget the mega bomber we've got the new things here and of course it take you know personal responsibly over at the White House will get into that but\nIf if the idea of America is the cream rises to the top\nAnd each of us rises falls based on our individual merits and we are a nation that is as broad and diverse literally is the world itself\nIt's at the base of the statue of liberty bring me you're tired or give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free right the rent you refuse of your teeming shores I'll take them now\nI thought that was still the boy double apparently there's an expectation data on it and I haven't found out what the data is but it's already passed I mean they told the but they don't get to tell me that's the key who is in America we're confronted\nWith a bunch of people who are committing these horrific acts in the name of America the hash tag ...\nAmr right he thinks he's a real American he thinks Benedict Donald is a real American this guy who ran into this the synagogue as and killed eleven people\nHe thought he was doing something on behalf of America the very definition of who we are is up for debate right now\nThere's been a letter written by some Jewish leaders in Pittsburgh to President Trump asking him not to come\nTo the city in the wake of the shooting and one of the things they say is that for the past three years here wars in policies have involved and the growing white nationalist movement yourself called a murderer evil but yesterday's violence as a direct combination\nOf here and for that is\nJohn Berman we think CNN for that and the letter was a ... it's from uh there's there's there's actually a lot going on but there's a letter from bend the ark and I put that up on our social media sites bend the arc so they've written a letter saying go away and then of course there's the former president of the tree of life\nWe hate all the time our leaders are responsible our leaders have a responsibility to us to unite us to bring us together and not to divide us\nThat is Lynette Letterman and she is the former president of the tree of life and so why was this happening\nIt seems that the motive is very clear that he had sought out this one synagogue because of activities that uh they had done working with refugees and immigrants and the ah his message of have a was against our Jewish community that\nIs the mayor of Pittsburgh his name is bill ... due to end this is a growing thing who is an American\nSome experiments have been emboldened by this president hate crimes rose more than twelve percent in America's largest cities last year ... violent crimes overall encouraged likewise video up on a two hundred and fifty percent increase in white supremacist activity on college campuses in twenty Seventy\nAnd what's especially on all of this is a white nationalist movement like militias typically increase in reaction to democratic presidents but with this Republican in the White House is groups are sitting there on the rise\nThere's John abalone or we think CNN for that so why are these groups now more on the open an acting take awhile yes\nThe very first action that the president did was can them ah these heinous acts that very first thing that the media dead was condemned the president and go after and try to place blame not just on the president but everybody that works in this administration\nEvery Republican I've ever heard always demands of people take personal responsibility they mean to black people to get off welfare to racial code word and and dog whistling you and I know that who was an American who is an American\nThese people never take personal responsibility palms dire who was the recipient the one of these you know bombs from the hash tag ... Tom's Diner I Benedict I went after him just hours after that\nVery first thing that the president didn't was condemned the attack slow things his spurts and and the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blame the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous accent is outrageous that that would be the very first reaction\nMy God how could anybody link anything that Benedict Donald ... these people\nThe only person responsible for carrying out either of these heinous acts were the individuals who carry them out it's not the president\nI'm shocked shocked to discover this kind of activities going on\nRight the line from Casablanca Claude Rains I Hope you've seen the movie he's got gambling going on there right under his nose he's profiting from it and then when you know the of he needs to he says oh look at this I'm shocked is gambling we've got to shut it down this is this is what they've done\nAnd so asking them to accept that they have any role to play Benedict Donald and his cast of characters you know there's no point in that\nThe question is in them the question is to you and to me and to our neighbors our fellow Americans who are we and where do we go from one eight eight eight three two one zero zero zero one but\nWhile today it is anti Semitism right now is anti Semitism\nThe number of anti Semitic incidents up dramatically in the United states fifty seven percent in twenty Seventeen according to the Defamation League maybe I'll says the increase comes from increasingly divisive politics embolden extremists and the rise in social media\nAnd the social media accounts the man behind the synagogue massacre were littered with anti Semitic statements unhinged conspiracy theory\nAgain John Avalon and we think CNN for that so who is an American\nI see America as a nation that was built as a melting pot and I always remember those words we we're we're a melting pot\nRight and that's why on on St Patrick's Day\nEverybody's Irish right whether you're Irish or not everybody celebrates St Patrick's Day this is a nation that's a melting pot the whole world fear I\nAlways thought that we enjoy the fact that we can go to an Ethiopian restaurant and have Chinese meal or go somewhere else and that French food I mean the whole world is here we are the those everybody all of our ancestry and we get to celebrate that\nFor some to claim the mantle of the American flag for some to claim the mantle of what it means to be an American\nAnd pronounce group punishments now it's all Jews must die right see goes into synagogue well\nA man went into a white ... Nazi went into a Kroger in Tennessee executed to African Americans\nAnd the African American community has a lot to talk about when it comes to being unfairly targeted so you know the problem is punishment route judgments and who is an American\nBecause I was always taught\nThat there are good and bad of all kinds and that's a simple slogan and you know I like the slogan airing you and I've done a lot of slogans ear right work with the facts live with the truth and on and on but there's good and bad of all kinds and that's a slogan I memorized as a kid I got it from my uncle Joe is a great guy and he was smart and he was right\nThere's good and bad of all kinds and if you if you just reflect on your own life your experiences that becomes manifestly obvious and the space of about twenty two seconds\nYou give me twenty two seconds I'll give you a great ... minutes from the old radio shows anyway but she is we need to redefine America and I'm not joking around and it's not just America\nIn Brazil they just elected their own version of Donald Trump\nIs named Moulder suffer oh anyway he will get to him we'll get to him but there's a sweeping the world now this is sweeping the world now I think there is a I'm no expert on Brazilian politics but I there's some things going on in Brazil\nIn the in the recent political history that may have a reason at least in in significant part why this Donald Trump you\nKnow kind of not the guy got elected president of a of Brazil they just want they they very recently they had someone who is kind of like Bernie Sanders they've gone from Bernie Sanders Donald Trump very reasonable and and so anyway this there's some things going on and Brazil that might not be applicable here however\nIt used to be on the wall in my office but now it's real again it's not history anymore\nIn Germany they first came from the communists and I didn't speak up because I wasn't the communist then they came for the Jews and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew then they came from the trade union is and I didn't speak up because I wasn't the trade union is then they came from the Catholic\nAnd I didn't speak up because I was a ... and then they came from me and by that time no one was left to speak\nUp this is that moment again that man was pastor Martin the mole or an I.

V. for that yeah he was in court today it's an arraignment right I mean this is that they got him this you were starting court proceedings now\nThe FBI has what they claim to be very strong physical evidence DNA and fingerprint and so if\nIf the bombers the hash tag ... bomber if he wants to have his lawyer march out and say I didn't do it\nGreat this is why we have evidence is why we have trials this is why we have rules of evidence and if you miss that first hour not only is it free and commercial free at Norman Goldman dot com but the legal system and an independent judiciary that's one of the separation of powers\nChecks and balances the make America\nAmerica the fact that we don't concentrate power in the dictators hands and he doesn't have a bunch of violent goons who go out there when he tells them to go out there to do physical violence and target for physical violence his perceived enemies\nThat's not America but what is America's up for debate right now\nOne triple eight three two one six thousand when I told you were doing senior legal endless time and I told you are going to keep it short so there it is senior legal analysts time is in federal court in in Miami federal court in ... southern Florida there are now the beginnings of legal proceedings against the hash tag maggot\nBomber and that's what he is ... I'm not saying that ... name is Amanda bomber and\nAnd the evidence about that is indisputable\nAll you know is van had all the stickers on that his social media sites or ... you know the evidence is overwhelming so\nLegal proceedings that'd be gum the case will likely be transferred to New York because that's\nWhere the whole thing got started when the bomb started showing up was in New York George Soros right and then the Clintons so that's in New York and that's where it all got started so even though the proceedings are beginning in Florida are basically it I suspect the case will at some point be transferred\nTo New York it can be transferred down to Florida if they choose to do it there's a lot of places that could assert jurisdiction\nOver the mango bomber right I'm In Los Angeles could say that the bomb here that means we have jurisdiction but you're not going to see this for you and I are not going to see this fight\nOr the you know basically the the uh when it first started they were like oh this is bombs in New York so it was all said it in New York and it just kind of built from there so that's probably where to go but they they could do it in several\nPlaces there's lots of places where those bombs went through and those bombs were sent and as a basis to assert jurisdiction\nOne eight eight eight three two one six zero zero one\nIn a van in the van that the ... bombers van\n... it's it's in the popular press I mean you can fact checked me if you like but in the ... president like the FBI wants the already try their case normally normally they're not supposed to do this but they're saying the van they found\nThe ingredients for making bombs they found lots of physical evidence to indicate that that was he was actually making the bombs in his Vance they found that the stamps and all this kind of stuff so basically he had the he he was living in his van and which was covered with these I Love Trump stuff stickers and\nAnd and turned it into a mobile a bottom up\nAnd that what that is what has been on a leash donor nations and now the legal system is dealing with it of course after these things happen one eight eight eight three two one six thousand and one Teresa in Wisconsin Hi Teresa\nI'm a Washington I to read one way okay\nUm I just wanted to say the news just got me thinking of a prayer and it goes like\nGrant may have the ability to forgive people who trespass against me and me and neither will not trespass against others now the first part of that is now and I've never been able to climb\nI Can't get people back to the I forget I it's kind of or I can control myself a little most of the time\nBut I don't do violent or if if if if if if you will be live if you believe that you can't forgive the people who've transgressions you then don't forgive them\nI'm not requiring that you do it there's no law demanding you do it if you feel compelled\nBy some moral force or you feel compelled by some religious force where you feel compelled by some social force whatever the force is a major force be with you are you from well reasoned I lay if if reason if whatever in your mind is telling you that there's value in forgiving\nBut there's a you'd wait three so let me see if I had threats are you having a battle in your mind is they're part of your brain saying forgive is good for you and there's another part saying no and you know war inside your brain is that what's going on here\nExactly what's going on\nAll right well\nWhich side's winning them with more I Know\nThat well I Am well I'm not you were wait wait ... if you were fighting this evil with that that's kind of a sloppy thought so let's see if we can clean that went up\nIf you were fighting quote quote unquote fighting this evil with evil you'd be getting a gun and going out and shooting people and I don't recommend that and I don't think you're going to do it you don't ... that's that's fighting evil with evil is is resorting to fight violence I I I I tell you don't do it right and you know I have\nThat clip I tell you don't do it or don't do it it's against the law it's horrible it's immoral it's it's every reason wrong to do what they did with violence\nSo assuming that you're around it you know assuming that you and I can rule out the violence right now we have to work through some issues in our mind don't we\nYeah okay so in your mind what we have to work through is there's a part of you that says it's important to me to forgive these people okay Theresa on that\nPoint of the problem I Want to fix the problem I give it to
