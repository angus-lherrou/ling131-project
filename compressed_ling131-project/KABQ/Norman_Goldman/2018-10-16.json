{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "Just more typical for folks to stick together and weakens our side so it is a frustrating I picked that we we worked with so a couple of other our of our opponents are\nThat organization called the lore and John Arnold foundation and John ... is a former Enron trader and a ... to run hedge funds do and and Kate folks don't remember you know pension fund walk\nUp we're like a few billion or I think like a quarter of their\nBody during the financial crisis but when Enron went down I think there was\nLike quite like I Want to say a word of a few billion dollars lost in public aspect because of the Enron situation and so then this guy\nComing from Enron have the gall to try and fix the quote unquote public pension system through his foundation and\nDuring the foundation is very similar to what the Koch brothers do\nThese funds other organizations to do the dirty work right so\nThe reason foundation and the retirement security initiated are cut from the same clock at the state policy network\nUm they focused solely on pushing defined contribution or cash balanced plan that undermined retirements carry a but the big one that the Arnold foundation has poured a lot of money into is ... charitable trust\nAnd so you know or the organization may have a very respected reputation and where that reputation they've created a Center for Retirement Research and what that stature it does is\nYou know push out there that very data to undermined\nA retirement security through creating the whole I\nSpent sort of not the first domino down and they call it ... ... ... and so they do in this day skew with their stress tests date and say hey let's make sure that your\nPension fund can but they are and you know certain stressors and they do their actuarial assumption\nYadda yadda yadda which then say oh no New Jersey if you don't pick some in your funds are going to go belly up and twelve years and that's that's the worst possible scenario\nWhere everything right side fowl this is what was going to happen fine stress tests\nAre ready or work with people distrust that is that you know a practice that shows that are funds are being ...

putting it in the back of your head that something needs to be done\nBy and so that's that's just one because it is really frustrating to have such a strong brand right they they they they take in overthrew the sponsorship of um you're the Arnold foundation\nWhat what's so shocking to me ... and and you're you're absolutely right is that when you look at these right wing attacks whether it be against pensions or collective bargaining or the right to work by these anti generally anti union attacks there are really just a small handful of individuals who fund\nThe vast majority of these campaigns and so whether it'd be the Koch brothers or you Arnold's or the ... foundation or the Bradley Foundation that's where the money comes from and then it sort of it's just ... up to all of these different a\nLegitimate sounding organizations like a through through the donors trust or the state policy now and then from there it goes into these legitimate sounding reports that if you're just a regular\nYou informed citizen you may not know or exactly what it is you're reading or where it's coming from or who's funding it so it's just it's incredibly frustrating to to see that in here that no so I got one just one last question here for you um if you're a regular\nRegular person maybe you're in a union maybe you're not maybe your luggage and local issues but you're not necessarily the world's foremost pension expert what can you do\nTo make sure that you're at least on the right side when it comes to these issues to make sure people are aware of what's going on [noise]\nYou know it's about education and advocacy educate yourself on the issue it may seem cut and dry but we at the end he could be plenty of resources that help out why they're very very uh\nParts of the

what\nElizabeth Warren being out on the stump is more effective than a Ninety percent of the other people out there people like Elizabeth Warren and a Bernie Sanders\nAnd um other like high profile progressive democratic leaders\nThere what they said means more so Elizabeth Warren can have all the attention she watch because she'll help get people I saw your good with it yeah yeah yeah I like I said it's complete lunacy that Donald Trump even made this into an issue and I think it had to do with her checking a box on um her college I'm\nA application I hear her financial aid and stuff like that\nAnd what she did today just validates the thing that she's set on line so maybe we can in red and don't forget about this\nDonald Trump continues\nTo go after I'm Elizabeth Warren and her heritage so it's not like this issue ever went away or not it's got to\nYou know who knows when she took the test what what prompted to do it maybe she just had enough of listening to this crazy person talk to her I mean you look at you look at the end of Trump there's something wrong with this guy\nYou know he had the um the the minister who was released from a turkey right it's great to this guy the passenger yeah they have great but did you see that thing where he's praying with Trump and I'm seeing this right should be a good sign moment this guy who is a prisoner American citizen as a prisoner\nWas released from turkey comes back to the United states meets with our president and I'm looking at this picture and all I can think is my God he's orange and I can see where his painting goggles and where he covered his mouth and the ... see the thing that I Can't figure out maybe one of you guys could tell me this\nIs using a tanning bed or is that spray tan and if it's sprayed tin can he touch up those areas with some type of makeup or ... year the tanning expert of the group\nHere as well ... that's for sure um I've got I've got you know pure Irish skins Oregon's got to be real careful with the sun but\nUm I think that's a really good question because it certainly doesn't look natural anyway it looks like something that's been sprayed on but you raise the question about the goggles ... I mean you could touch up around the goggles you'd think I mean but he's the president said he's got resources the man's got means I'm so I'm I'm not sure but I think one of those things that I don't\nBuy the way I don't think our taxpayer money should be going to filling in his raccoon eyes what I think should happen is she he should dip into some of their money is personal money which by the way he should have been using to pay for security at Trump Tower and he should be having someone\nDoes that money that he got from his father or or like his money when you talk about his money it's basically his father's money those are one of the same no right after the New York times reporter last how do you\nYou know you want to go into all this we can even get into our governor here in Illinois too and the fact that he considers himself independent self made man before\nWe get into that us a very good question Bob about painting God no no no no before that a legitimate question what's wrong with Donald Trump\nSo ah last night he did a sixty minutes interview and uh one of the topics was uh the sort of the joking around that he did at a doctor Blasey Ford's expense and you know\nYou said um you know I think she was treated very fairly Kevin O's not treated fairly and uh the interviewer kind of a ... said that when she was testifying she said that the most humiliating difficult part of it for her was the fact that she was laughed at by these two men during what happened to her um and that he had gone on stage during his stump speech\nAnd made jokes about her not remembering and the whole crowd laughed and he tried to kind of explain himself for a moment and then he just finally said\nI mean there is no explanation so he ultimately had to say it doesn't matter we won it doesn't matter whether it's making fun of her whether it's making fun of or you don't lose with Warren's heritage the ends are always seemed to justify the means\nWe have ... let me let me tell you a secret with this guy must not many people notice he has he does not believe that when he goes to those rallies and then shows up somewhere else that anybody was paying attention to the rally she thinks that everything is in its own individual bubble that it's in his own space\nSo so many things you can get at a rally in Wisconsin nobody's paying attention in Virginia and when he was at a rally in Florida it's\nJust it's very similar to our governor here in Illinois who goes and says crazy things down down state then says opposite crazy thing is up here in Chicago\nIt's like we're all dumb and don't want to paying attention I heard he was a genius by the way have you heard this a Trump he's also said that he was smarter than Obama\nRight in and I've since looked at all these like um you know and and they're and they're not all scientific because they're trying to measure people's um IQs throughout history from what I remember his IQ is not higher than President Obama's\nWell you don't you don't get out of Vietnam with a bone spurs being dumb you know you got to be pretty smart\nKid out of one of the let's make sure we're being cleared get out of going to Vietnam and not get out of Vietnam like he left Vietnam was never in Vietnam right\nHe's a fortunate son now do you think you've watched this president for a couple of years not like we all have nice nice ... a credence Clearwater revival reference he ... he's the tanning and see see our experts here\nDo you think that Trump is getting more nutty and detached from reality as time goes on or do you think the gravity of the position has\nHad some impact and kind of raining him in\nI think he's getting not here and I think every time someone thinks he's about to do the right thing he backs away from it because he gets aggravated that people think that he needs to do the right thing that he can't just do whatever they ...\nAt once once people start to ... you know political a commentator start to be able to sort of guess what he's going to do or say well if he's on a pattern and we think that he's headed to do this I think you're right that he does feel the need to kind of throw everybody off Israel I'm not predictable this is the very next yeah\nThis is a very troubled guy who's gone through a lot of trauma in his life you know I'm Donald Trump you know he's you know he's he's been afflicted with wealth and\nPower and um you know he's you know this is this is not the life anybody would walk\nRight and he's you know I ... the guy the guy his everything and yet it's not

I was ... we should have had that on the script one I did the show\nWhen the giants like land like radios that I I don't know what to tell you I mean then as anyhow getting back to get let's get back to the question here Bob so part of the bit folks is that you know I just I just try to hijack the show every time one of these guys answer question he tries\nTo but it doesn't work we we were going to stop 'em [laughter] um but one of the things that we were teasing a little bit earlier on was um some of the nuggets of gold that a President Trump left in the sixty minutes interview from last night uh no one little one of the topics um that I've I've seen and heard people talking most about this morning\nI'm what his comments on climate change and ah I'm not mistaken I think we've got a clip a vet courtesy of CBS News from a less about sixty minutes interview\nDo you still think that climate change is a hoax look I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give Koreans and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage\nSo Bob let me ask you um what's up with that and\nHe's not a smart guy I mean he literally not a smart guy did ... years is he's a stable genius that someone solve it yeah no I I get the I get the irony and him calling himself a stable genius that is crazy right I mean we're here in the mid west um the we ...\nI'm going to be forty five years old my mom\nI have not seen such erratic weather I mean we February two years ago it was Seventy degrees outside I have two very good friends of mine from the Sierra Club here in Illinois jak there in key to mix pad\nTheir heads would explode I mean I'm sure there has exploded when they heard heard this guy talking about climate change\nHe is only saying that because\nHe has relationships with people in industries\nThat are ... the environment now in the labor movement you know we we had the struggle with environmental issues because we have a lot of people who work in the fossil fuel industry right and we talk about things like trying to get people to\nMy home local operating engineers local one fifty one of the biggest uh construction locals in the Midwest\nWe started before I left the ... come over to the federation we're working on a win turbans and things like that the ivy W works out a lot on um a solar power you know the the um the other unions you know are trying to figure out what their spaces in green technology\nWe don't deny even as we're working on these hard\nIssues around climate science and how it impacts jobs we try to figure out ways to work towards that transition disguises straight up denying science it's just completely ridiculous\nWell known can't do that as you said um that it will go back so as you know gene that ah that you don't think I think it was after the people die after all the humans are dead at some point after that happens it will go back so\nI I like I said I'm forty five years old I was in college I don't know how many years ago now twenty or Twenty years ago and we're looking at this thing about climate change is Twenty years ago\nAnd about how the earth works in these cycles between heating and cooling periods right and we're in one of those heating periods now and the way we're going it's like\nCreating we're we're we're supposed to be go slowly going into a cooling period\nAnd instead we're we're keeping it warm but the problem is we're not just keeping it warmer sound like we're prolonging that warm recycling keeping it static now we're starting to just pick it up a little bit and were melting things that aren't supposed to melt\nAnd that is going to create a problem\nI don't like norm norms nor Goldman's from California\nWe keep going at it like this the whole the whole Lex Luther thing from Superman from the Superman Movie work California drops into the ocean that's actually you might be a thing that might be able to even I think it was the first Superman Movie so bad we had we had ... was um was playing Lex\nLuther [laughter] oh that's right yeah we had British really from the national public pension coalition on I used to work for you do if she was our political director rich it was ... was talking to us a little bit about how ah some of these dark money groups come in and fund these attacks on public pensions\nAnd a lot of the money is from a just a couple of very very wealthy people\nI see the exact same thing going on with the climate science here because you have a very small number of very wealthy far right libertarian Republicans and all they're trying to do is create that are are you talking about the Koch brothers talking about the Koch brothers I'm Talking about the ...\nFoundation I'm Talking about the Bradley Foundation these organizations have found very deceptive ways like you're saying Twenty years ago nobody\nKnows who they are which is a problem right we talk about um I don't even know who all these groups are and I'm In I'm involved in this day in and day out\nYou got to listen to the norm and Goldman ... right now I Know I but here's the thing the public needs to know that they need to know who these people are the Republicans just the Nineteen seventies building it built this network\nAnd when I say Republicans I mean ... ... exactly right but ... but we talk we we throw this term libertarian around liberty

Republicans they hide behind this libertarian\nA nonsense their laissez faire Republicans they wanted just they wanna destroy the world so they can make more money ... crazy\nNo no no well hold on as I get it beyond the political labels beyond the libertarian versus Republican versus conservative at the end of the day it's greed these there are small handful of people in this country who are

interrogation that went wrong something went wrong now I ask you\nWhat were they interrogating a journalist about and the Saudi cancel it on Turkish soil this is not an embassy this is a consulate\nWhat were they interrogating a journalist about why would they send Fifteen men including a a a gentleman with the bones so why shouldn't say a gentleman including a Saudi with the bones so and an autopsy expert\nWhat the Turks are saying that he was murdered dismembered and his body shipped out or carted away by the dirtiest Saudi assassins\nNow apparently what they're saying is\nThat the Saudis are preparing a report that admits that ... was indeed killed but they're going to say that it was an interrogation gone wrong something happened during the interrogation\nWell first of all when one of your citizens goes through your consulate just apply for permission to marry and use in Fifteen people there what could go wrong or magic in that\nWhat could possibly go wrong\nThis is just so bizarre to me and we have a president does not willing to take any kind of action now I'm I shouldn't say it not willing to take any kind of action we don't know if he's going to take any kind of action but Congress is furious\nTrump insists that he's not going to do anything to him pero\nA one hundred and ten billion dollar purchase\nBy the Saudis of arms from the United states well first of all that purchase has not been completed there really is no hundred and ten billion dollar purchase\nThis was a ... an arms sale that started under Barack Obama and so far the only thing that has been completed\nIs the Saudis agreement to purchase I think Fifteen billion dollars from ... in in an arms I think it's a missile defense system\nStarted under Obama there is no hunter didn't ... billion dollar deal that's been confirmed it's been agreed to Trump he ... he says oh you know the the Russia wanted this deal in China wanted this being in France wanted this deal\nYeah there's some competition there\nBut most of the Saudi military functions on us arms\nAnd they need us part to us supplies\nMakes no sense to start dealing with Russia when does not the same equipment it's not the same aircraft is not the same missile system the Saudi army the Saudi air force all of it depends on us arms and us manufactured goods\nSo we have a situation where\nWhat's what's on the block here according to Trump is our credibility in human rights our credibility and human rights\nWe can't condemn ... and we can't condemn China we can condemn aside if we can't\nCondemn the Saudis were murdering one of their own a journalist who lives in wash in Virginia and writes for the Washington Post what does that say about our own record for human rights we just cannot let this happen\nBut so far apparently\nThe inclination to as by the Trump Administration to let it pass and the name of the bottom line\nThat seems characteristic of the Trump Administration everything happens the consequences seems to be there is no consequence if it's going\nTo affect our bottom line that the Trump monitor our bottom line is talking about oh we don't want to put people out of work at a rate Dionne and\nLucky Lockheed Martin and Boeing and there is no deal there may be a deal a handshake but we're not selling them\nA hundred and ten billion dollars worth of military equipment right now\nThat's not going forward at the moment but that's the price see that's the Trump price for human life oh I don't want to put all these people out of work well let me know when they get the orders well yeah that's what I Want to know what are they going to get the orders\nFor all of this military equipment I just it's just it's appalling to me we're talking about human life of course you know on the other hand this is a journalist maybe he didn't value journalists life so much\nAm I wrong in that thinking he doesn't seem to care for journalists anyhow he accuses most of them are being bakers liars\nCheats so now we have now we have a human life someone needs to account for and and he's and he's talking\nAbout roe gilly rogue killing babies rode gathers he's becoming the laughing stock when it comes to international relations\nAt ... there's a lot more to this story we're going to be talking about I mean this this regime the Saudi regime\nBut it's just not a human rights regime this is a regime ... the the ... who is the governing figure in Saudi\nAgreed to let women drive yet he jail the protestors who were protesting but the right for women to drive that's the kind

Massie just west of I twenty five\nOr seven o'clock or David have saving ... ... ... the mother of three Twenty one horse that he bought for ... [laughter] probably half of any other\nThing about Elizabeth Warren Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts\nUm she has been I don't\nKnow for what reason I mean I Am I'm I assume that family lawyers told her and her family down through the years\nThat they had some Native American heritage and you know that's not uncommon by the way I mean I even had that in my family I Know for a fact that that uh that one of my room far distant uncle\nOh married eight and a Native American woman ... back many many years ago and I had always been led to believe that\nYeah I I probably have some indigenous heritage in my family and I guess what I did the same thing or did I took a DNA test it ate their beneath there it's not it's I mean you know I'm I I'm I'm straight out of the aisles I mean Scott ...\nIreland in particular but back to the real story now a warrant said that you know Trump continued to teaser and he constantly at rallies obviously he he knows that she's likely to be an opponent\nOr she is an opponent in the Senate but he's like might be an opponent in the presidential race he keeps saying he liked the challenge he liked that take Iran you know so he keeps calling her Pocahontas\nPocahontas Pocahontas Pocahontas Well Elizabeth Warren took a DNA test and the results are now now I skipped step\nTrump said that if she took a DNA test improved gee was India and he said he would donate a million dollars to the charity of her choice wherever we heard that before wasn't that five million dollars for Iraq Obama's birth certificate\n... another unkempt promise\nSo he said he'd donate a million dollars to Elizabeth Warren's favorite charity if she demonstrated that she had a indigenous or or a Native American heritage she took a test an expert said yes indeed\nShe does have some ed of indigenous Americans are I'm I'm just going to call them Native Americans or Indians either want I'm Sorry I I ... but indeed she does have some Native Americans in her ancestry\nThat's the result of the DNA test now I admit\nIt's Michael cosmic but she does have it and so\nShe released a videotape she let it be known that she has it and Trump denied it first even though this guy does this all the time he denied it first that he'd ever made that officer he said you better go back and read it again was well you don't have to read it\nJust get out the tape and play it and we did\nAnd he did make the pledge for one million dollars now now that now that she has taken the DNA test I don't know if she took it just to shut up this issue just to stop this nonsense from Trump got tired of it but she did it\nAnd now that she's done it he said no I didn't do that now he's not going to do it he said well he only donate to charity if he can administer Elizabeth Warren's DNA test I have no if he could do it himself\nAre you kidding me only if I can do it myself [noise] that's crude that's crass isn't it\nBut that's what he says he's known for that kind of conduct no he's not going to do it no he's not going to do it I admit and and and and the DNA sample it shows that is microcosm make\nI mean ... it's ten generations back\nTen generations back that's what the DNA test said well guess what it's still there but he's not going to do it now know he's got to admit or the test you know\nMan with scientific knowledge right what does he got a degree in chemistry or or biology or whatever you want to call it obviously he doesn't I mean this is this this this this this is a brag that this is a ragged\nAnd and and and\nSo that that so but one no one has said that she's going to have an announcement after the midterm elections I Am more convinced than they ever\nAs are many pundits on the national saying that Senator Warren will be a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the presidency\nAnd I say great I think she's highly qualified I think she's highly compensated I think she's an intelligent woman I think she would be far better than this open the White House\nAnd I'm convinced now she's got she's already got a slogan out there remember they were trying to shutter up from reading or was it was it a Dr Martin Luther king's speech or reddish got king's words the message\nAnd the Senate told her it was inappropriate and she did it anyhow and the the word came out that said uh nevertheless sheep resisted well that seems to be here slogan\nThey they have one word bumper stickers out now that say persist persist and of course they got T shirts that say ... she persisted and I think that she's geared up for real run for the president say she has not been to Iowa\nBut she has and she has\nEncouraged candidacies she has helped finance some races out there and finance rations in other places and so I think that that that she is certainly a candidate for the president's going to be a candidate Cory Booker from New Jersey the senator has already been to Iowa\nBut look we got time right let's get through the midterms I think that Senator Warren probably will become more active after the midterms that's when she's going to make the announcement so I look forward to it\nAre you talking about Kudlow is that who you're talking about ... inches name yeah yeah\nWell I mean I at first of all I don't think ... should go to that\nUm that the Saudi of economic conference over there are certainly don't think that that should be the case but uh I mean and and you're right about creating a deficit and you're right I mean we didn't you expect that didn't you expect them\nTo to do I start to ... make cuts in Medicare and and uh Obamacare and Social Security\nOr I did but I think what the Democrats need to do is go on the bench\nAnd and tell them that these these two individuals should resign because they basically created this mess and and and it shouldn't it it's a big mistake\nAnd they shouldn't be held accountable not the American people with with our programs and and and hold that against us it should be they should take the responsibility and resigned because this was an unnecessary tax cut that the economy was doing well and this was just a welfare plan for the rich and we the people shouldn't have to pay for it\nWell ... let me let me give you an example of what what what uh what mark is talking about the U.S deficit in twenty eight teen\nClimb to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars now that's a hundred and Thirteen million more than the previous year that's according to the treasury okay\nAnd that and and they they expected even though they gave this massive tax cuts to the corporations they expected that the economy would boom because of the tax cuts that didn't happen what has happened is that the deficit has continued to grow\nAnd and then and now they're worried about you know\nCutting programs such as Medicare and and Social Security this is the Republican plan this is something they've been out there for a long time now they themselves as mark points out they are responsible\nThey are responsible for this massive increase in the death of a hundred and Thirteen million dollars more than last year\nAnd he's right but these but this is typical of the Trump Administration this is typical of the officials in Washington\nYou know an ... yeah\nOr the other thing is uh you know Trump is going around saying that the Democrats want to cut Social Security and Medicare is laid out of it he's lying and he needs to be held accountable for it and the other thing is Steven Mnuchin said that the the devastated because they've been taught him at programs when he knows darn well yeah because of his policy\nHis seat ... because of these in it so that the quote in title ... programs these these are programs people have contributed do these are people\nPeople have put money into now they're calling these are these are suddenly become entitlement programs what are you talking about they're talking about Social Security and met\nYeah that's what they're talking about that's exactly what they're talking about and they're blaming the deficit on that and so that's why they want to attack it that's why they want to cut it in in spite of the fact that the that the deficit just could to news to jump under this administration\nFolks thank you very much Marco thank you very much for that let's go to Angie from Illinois Angie\n... I I looked in high I listen to every Saturday on double ... Chicago and now you write your commentary okay I'm checked\nMe I don't want to hear from him about what has happened to Rudy Giuliani we we haven't heard it on tape in quite some time and maybe I missed\nSomething what do you now [noise]\nI I I think he's gone underground [laughter] maybe ... you know he was proven so wrong so many times maybe they decided to shut him down I don't know what happened\nTo me now to carry it to me I thought about it like two days ago I was like wait a minute he's not a player anymore yeah [laughter]\nYeah he's not and and and when I'm I'm not surprised by that I mean I ... every time you went out there of course you know the people have sort of changed the tone\nThe subject you know you don't hear too much about the motor investigation anymore that seemed to be Rudy sport day but you know I I expect to hear from Rudy again pretty soon I especially on Fox because you know there was a judge who just throughout\nThe defamation lawsuit from Stormy Daniels against now right and now and now he has reverted to form\nWhat he's saying is now he can go after quote horse\nRace of our ... at the fasting that's yeah I go after the horse race ... you know a real ... but that's that's just one\nOne little bit of the cases are between stormy and Donald Trump the real issue now is the is the a\nNon disclosure agreement and the suit that's bending over that and by the way I so Michael ... said he's going to appeal the judge's ruling in and throwing up this or this defamation lawsuit\nWhile he shot yeah yeah I think you will but but you know more true no I can go after horse race\nA horse race I'm an Audi said that Trump is going to own Stormy Daniels about a million dollars when Mrs over well that's ... you know I think this guy's a sharp lawyer I don't think you put much past him\nI Know and and yeah okay well thanks for taking my call\nAngie thank you for calling uh we got a minute or two left before we have to take another break for the News Let's go to Roosevelt you're on Roosevelt\nThe cake and you hear me yes sure go ahead good at that investigate the three subjects\nPrecisely that I wanted to talk about one let's not forget that this guy when he wants to Helsinki accused\nOur intelligence yeah ... ... ... and Russia so whenever there's a problem as far as what he wants\nHe reports back to pointing the finger at us write a nation United Nations uh he wanted to do with the United nations because that's what I Want and all he wanted to include Russia [noise]\nSo if it doesn't go according to plan he points the finger back at us where the Republican that they're always think country first even Trump said country first words this country first thing\nThat they are where are their head they're they're hiding in the corner they're worried about and here's an her sister humans to Mr Kay\n[noise] they're worried about the mid ...

to what Roosevelt said we're the Republicans I don't know how well the Republicans are going to do because it looks like in some of these races that I see a ... that the Republicans are in real trouble and some of the districts around here they're in real trouble now here's what we need\nWe need to flip to Senate seats to get control of the U.S Senate\nI think that's a long shot everything I read says it's a long shot\nBut we need to flip or get twenty three\nHouse seats that's doable in fact it is likely that that will happen and when you get those twenty three house seats when they're in the Democratic hands and the control of the house is in democratic hands a lot can happen namely now people to just start talking about impeachment know that ain't\nGoing to happen or the Republicans are you know that that's that's the ... that's one of the things that they're always talking about you know oh with the Democrats are going to start worrying about about\nImpeachment [laughter] excuse me\nNo they're not they're not going to talk about impeachment they're there they're going to talk about the levers of power the levers of power that will make a big deal\nGive them control of the various committees the various chairmanship of the committees give them an opportunity to uh to uh start investigations and they can if if they have for example jury now with a representative from New York will be the senior Democrat\nOn the um on the um\nWhat am I thinking oh sorry the house Judiciary Committee he will be chairman of the house Judiciary Committee and they're already going to start some investigations they really are and then because they will have the power to do it they will own the chairman chips and that's why it's so very very very important\nRight really crucial we got to\nDo it we got it we we got to make this this election count All right now\nHere's the number I'm a\nI'm looking for it eight eight eight three two one six oh
