after murdering the guy they took\nHis clothes off the dead man's body and put it on a body double\nAnd then it was so meticulously thought through the then sent the body double out onto the street with someone else to try and make it look like the he loves the embassy you\nLove the ... console let's see let's look Barry is [noise]\nWell now there have been busted even more because the guy who acted as the body double has been identified he's been named and it's been obvious now what's going on I don't understand why Benedict Donald goes along with this other than he's on the payroll of the Saudis\nThe emerging explanation which the White House appears content to accept is that this happened\nBecause there was a fish fry there was some is understanding\nDelivered to the Saudi security personnel and there's always a tragic accidents there are many skeptics in Congress some Republicans many Democrats some us allies in Europe who are very deeply skeptical of the Saudi explanation\nAs

has facts to back it up however it's being reported now including at or tea and you'll say as\n... outfit Russia Today anyway it's being reported in a variety of places outside in the from the middle eastern outside of the middle east\nBut as far and I I've spent more time today than I really should have frankly honesty\nIs the important thing honesty is the best policy I spend more time than I should after they trying to chase this one down like could not and if some enterprising reporter somewhere really is able to nail this one down\nOoh you got a\nBig scoop here goes NBS is Mohammed bin Salman he is the crown prince the so called crown prince he's the big do now right he's the guy\nWho tortured and imprisoned all all the other members of the royal family and store to billions of

appears to own them but they put a lot of Saudis put a lot of money into Benedict Donald and and it's good for nothing son of a sudden ... well\nFrom the very first moment where Mr could show you went missing right I mean his his fiance was in the car outside and she said you know he never came out and so\nFrom that first moment Saudi Saudi government's the ... the regime Timothy ... illegitimate

American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem Donald Trump promised that\nAnd he followed through with it and so to me when you give your word and you follow through with it as an elected official that as a model that we're supposed to do he was right to move the embassy to Jerusalem or I was there a for a historic event\nOr no answer didn't support that it doesn't think that's right but to me that was true leadership of America used by the question\nThe question was whether or not or whether or not he thinks President Trump is a good role model for the children to Florida I sort of thought originally I got confused so [laughter]\nNo he's not Donald Trump is Donald Trump is weak\nAnd he performs as all week people do they become bully\nNow that is Jake Tapper moderated debate with Andrew

time\nPresident Trump announced his intent to leave the INS all intermediate range nuclear forces trading on Saturday in that decision already been criticized by Russian officials\nFrom senior Republicans found this treaty dates back to Nineteen eighty seven it prohibits Russia and the U.S from having producing or testing ground launched nuclear missiles with a range of three hundred and thirty four hundred miles now it was signed by former president Ronald Reagan in Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev\nAnd that is Errol Barnett of CBS News if you're on the norm can watching yeah\nThat's me coughing up a lung because it was by the way we stream audio and video at Norman Goldman dot com and ... you know I'd like you to listen to radio station but if you're not in a radio station Norman Goldman dot com but as I'm listening to this when I'm coughing up along because yeah\nBenedict Donald is pulling the United states out of a nuclear weapons treaty if anything good gonna come from that\nPresident Trump says Russia has already been in violation of this deal he's also accusing China which is not bound by the training of making the same kinds of muscles and says he won't agree to a new deal unless both Russia and China are included\nA now that is Errol Barnett we do think CBS News for that and I'm setting us up here for senior legal analysts time I trust you see the legal issues emerging right can Benedict Donald just say we're out of a treaty that there's a lot to that stand by\nUs position has been that Russia has been in violation of this treaty which prohibits the U.S and Russia from having producing all testing\nGround loans nuclear missiles with a range of three hundred and thirty four hundred miles of the Obama administration also found that Russia was in violation of this treaty dating back to twenty four team\nThat is Errol Barnett we do think CBS News for these clips\nAnd\nI have a theory and I don't have facts to back it up but we know that I\nDon't have to say here goes I think who wants out of this treaty\nI'm not I'm not joking around I don't have facts to back it up I mean who wants out of this treaty but who would be the bad\nGuy if he aggregated the treaty right if boot and said I'm Out of this treaty then the world would be heaping heaping showed a program on who I Do have the best words a program that's a good one that's the best words O. P. P. R. anyway appropriate anyway so I don't think hoot and wanted to take the hit\nOn this one he didn't want to get the the publicity blind guy so what he did was he ordered Benedict Arnold to go and do it so that way 'cause 'cause he said Benedict Arnold you're going to do this you're going to pull out of this treaty and or otherwise the ... show up on the Internet and that's it for you\nAnd so that's my theory is Benedict Arnold is is the hatchet man and and putting gets to play the good guy\nGoing to get a lot of pushback on the Russian lockout has already been saying that a lot of the art of the United states that uh they don't know if that should lead this treaty and that they're stuck in an explanation from John Bolton about what state in Maine\nAnd that is alec ... and he is an independent journalist in Moscow we thank him so far\nWhat we've been hearing loss there's something very negative without Gorbachev the former Soviet leader ah criticize move you said that under no circumstances should sign agreements on up and he said that that was a move by someone very stupid\nOr that again is alec Loni is an independent journalist in Moscow and we thank him for that report and\nMy theory is is that who wants out and so we had Benedict I'll be the bad guy and now you see what's happening right Mikhail Gorbachev who still has republic a very popular public image released around the world he gets to say oh this is terrible right and everybody gets serene their hands and Benedict Donald looks like the bad\nGuy and so I think that's what really ... once and the reason prudent wants it is to create more instability especially in Europe because these intermediate missiles were talking about have\nFrance and Germany written all over them and so I I think it's boot and just trying to create more instability and so\nThat's my theory I admit I admit I admit I\nDon't have facts to back this up however\nHowever\nThe Republicans in Congress can never ever ever be counted on to stand up to this guy\nRepublican Senate Foreign relations Kevin Bob Corker calling this move a huge mistake he is warning that leaving this treaty could unwind other disarmament agreements but you also have a Republican Senator Lindsey Graham saying this is absolutely the right move on\nThe u._k. a federal ...
