A. B. Q. am is available everywhere you want to listen on our free media went down bomb\nSuspect nab a lack of civility I barbecue that Florida Man fifty six year olds either say Iraq has been arrested in connection with the Thirteen package bomb mailings into high profile Democrats and critics of President Trump the corresponding the casting bomb report the FBI cautions there could still be more packages out\nUsing false information to obtain a driver's license\nAnd that in two thousand Thirteen Coral Springs police grand theft and battery\nNow that is one more from local Florida W. P. T. V. West Palm beach now and we thank them boy did we thank them listen to the rap sheet on this guy\nThis guy I mean they said that Wal Mart absolutely I make America great again buddy\nThis is the kind of person that is exactly\nThe Benedict Donald supporter they don't deserve respect because they're deplorable people they're just horrible people but they demand that they be acknowledged and and and treated like they're the American master race and when you look at the stickers basically\nEvery square inch of the huge windows on his van were covered with these stickers knows all the maggots stuff\nAnd and that's who he is and that to these people are and my question is do the act alone are there are more\nThis is about twelve packages that apparently had been sent to ten\nDifferent targets the latest targets included a former national intelligence director of national intelligence James Clapper and also New Jersey senator Cory Booker that follows packages that were sent earlier this week\nTo former President Obama a former secretary of State Clinton former vice president Biden former CIA director John Brennan which was that package was set the CNN former attorney general Eric Holder\nAnd then we saying Jeff lower and CBS News again for this clip as well and so\nWhat we have is Benedict Donald has created this atmosphere right he's been doing it for a long time now recalls the press the enemy of the people and and and and this guy right this guy this guy had a sticker on CNN sucks on his window one of those many stickers and so when\nOne with a with a a platform in a podium and access to everybody the way Benedict Donald does now when he uses that to put this message out there\nMay be the vast majority of people will say I'm not going to go and act on it and get violent but there is a guy who goes into a pizza place in Washington DC from North Carolina the Washington DC I Hope you remember this with a gun and he says\nI'm here to investigate myself I got to see myself this Hillary Clinton child sex operation out of the back of his\nPizza parlor I was obviously is preposterous stuff but there was a portion and it does not need to be a large portion a small sliver of a large group is still enough people to cause a lot of mayhem and the U.S we have this guy\nOn the day of the arrest of several more suspicious packages turns out\nOf all continuing explosive devices one was found right here on fifty second street in New York\nIt was addressed the former department of national security had James Clapper another was found in Florida it has a New Jersey senator Cory Booker is name on that's in California a package was discovered address the billionaire Tom Steyer a vocal critic of President Trump\nThere is the fundamental we think CBS News for that so of course now we have to start asking questions or will there be copycats\nIs he alone does he have Confederate and so here we are\nAnd and a story that has dominated the news this week comes to a fitting conclusion just in time for the credits and the commercials on a friday afternoon it it feels to me like an Alex Jones kind of false flag Benedict Donald staged a print this operation unfortunately\nThat kind of weird stuff has become reality for you and me here we are and where do we go from here\nOne eight eight eight three two one six zero zero one is our number and I do have time for you of course at one triple eight three two one six thousand and one one eight three two one six thousand on incidentally if you want to know how they got him how\nThey get them well you know the FBI and some very very good tools to work with and\nOn top of that the bomber the mega bomber right that is being called a hash tag ... the mad bomber is now he because none of the bombs went off right\nDNA fingerprints they uncovered relating fingerprint from one of the envelope containing an ID that had been sent to Congress will and Maxine Waters we have confirmed this fingerprint is that the seas are saying that there you\nGo that's the FBI Director Chris Wray he's the guy who was put in after Comey got fired just to bring back some memories year he's that FBI Director he is the second guy under you know\nSo the FBI did its job they did exactly what they were supposed to do what they did it fast they had a lot to work with right to have some very good it's a skill sets in and equipment and so when you have the kind of evidence that they had right at all these ... and the bombs it didn't take them long to go and trace it back now\nWhere do we go from one eight eighty three two one six zero zero one that is not the only news of the day of course that is the enormous news story\nAnd so that's why we're starting with it there are two separate but I think related economic news stories and we will get to those later in the show economic growth is good but it was better under Obama it was a lot better under Obama not only is economic growth good but not great\nThere are some very worrying signs about is slowing down global economy which would include us and that\nSeems to be at least in part getting Wall Street very nervous 'cause you know they're real swashbuckling you know real strong backbone\nTypes of by Wall Street right not nothing rentals the people on Wall street reports so of course they're getting rattled immediately enter all freaking out oh my God everything's crazy so the freaking out on Wall street is going on and will so that those are you to a economic news stories we will get to those and of course\nI'm not forgetting the fact that the congressional elections or a week and a half away hello\nElections a week and a half away early voting numbers are off the charts they trust you've seen that Republican voter suppression efforts are also off the charts and the enthusiasm of the voters is just insane ... we will get to that as well but\nWith the Dow down nearly three hundred of course that's something we've got to pay attention to one eight eight eight three two one six zero zero one is our number one Tripoli three two one\nSix thousand and one Norman Norman Goldman dot com is always the destination for your emails Norman Norman Goldman dot com and I have not forgotten that this is friday I Hope you know that around here on friday we pay attention all ways to to issues\nNinety people a day die from gun violence in our country\nBecause our government has been bought and purchased by the n._r._a. Republican Party is owned\nBy the un Iran because the Republican Party is owned by the n._r._a. and the n._r._a. will not allow our government to do the public health and public safety function that it is required to do under the constitution one would think I was running guns it has to fall to private hands gun violence archive dot org gun violence\nArchive dot O. R.

it's very quickly back over to you know where it starts with an F.\nBut it doesn't anyway it's o X ray Fox one eight eight eight\nThree two one six thousand and one one Tripoli three two one six zero zero one that's on pop culture news for the day is such as we do around here a ... obviously the big news is the bomber right and who he is and we knew who he was and it's obvious that this is who they are\nBut the economic news\nEarly voting in the elections are not totally off our radar Leroy thanks again this started in Wisconsin today highly Roy\nHow are you doing I appreciate you taking my call and I've been a longtime listener but first time caller and I think it was a great really no thank you uh it was a great relief to find that they had caught this guy and as I told your screener I mean this [laughter]\nMy main reason for a call and it prompted me to call today was you know\nThe question was should they handle I think you know you said it will they be copy cat calls I think what the question you put out fair\nCopy you know bombers\nRight and they may very well be what I think you know if this gentleman was handled the way he should be handled and [noise] maybe that would eliminate some of the copy cat out that it would maybe\nBecause well hang on we were to that point ... hold on the list that's both of us in this\nYear's been charged today with five federal crimes including interstate transportation I'm an explosive\nIllegal mailing of explosives threats against former presidents and certain other person's threatening interstate communications and solving current and former federal officer\nAt the attorney general ... regard sessions\nAnd so you know what they do is they follow what's called an information I mean they didn't have time for a grand jury so they got 'em and they just danced off a criminal complaint\nThat will be amended they'll probably be superseding grand jury indictment but they have to get them in you know they got him because he got charged with some so that's that that they're trying to you I suspect he's going away for the rest of his life I mean that'd be my guess as to his sense does that the tour of the future um copycats or a license cynically kept her\nThat's a good well that's a good question I don't I don't know that I Would hope that it would you think God that he didn't\nKill anyone you know but I you know they'll warehouse him and put them off you know for the for the rest of his life that might the tear them but\nI Would hope that it would my main purpose a norm was to call you and let you know just how much I really appreciate you and your relentless effort to try to inform those of us that have managed to maintain an open my vowels\nThat's my main because I you know I said sometimes to listen to your show and it really you know I've ... my son also so he was just you as\nWell and we just hang up I Would soon will\nThe main point for the call normal just to let you know that there's

especially give me hope for the future and thank you for the kind words I mean they're they're they're very appreciate appreciate it they're not necessary but they are greatly appreciated and what use my hope for the future\nIs people like Leroy and his son the kids out of Parkland, Florida Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school\nThat the the masses of people who have been demonstrating protesting and marching the women's march right the to women's marches mean what we're seeing what I Hope I there's a line and Sean Connery movie with Nicholas cage where uh the the rock\nThere's the movie the rock where where Sean Connery says you nurture the hope that there is hope\nRight and he was portraying guy who was on Alcatraz so anyway you nurture the hope that their results and it's a guy must be screenwriters they always turn these great phrases though and I pick their pocket and at least I give them credit for from the movie the rock with Nicholas cage in a highly recommend it it's a very good movie and\nAnyway I nurture the hope that there is hope I nurture the hope that people can some want at least somewhat shed the past\nAnd look to the future pivot pivot to the future and say I understand the past has been what it's been and I got many grievances from it and I've got legitimacy grievances about it but I'd like to spend the future trying to fix the future rather\nThan seeking retribution and trying to punish for the past\nAnd I'm hoping I nurture the hope that there was hope whoever that screenwriter is thank you for that I nurture the hope that there is hope\nAnd and for the last fifty years\nI've been watching this nation go down the toilet and it's sad\nI mean I was a politically engaged young fell in the Nineteen sixties but then when Phyllis Schlafly came along

boys got ... ... oh my goodness ...\nWonderful it's great living near the ocean here yeah it's awesome um outlet driving right now but I what I heard at the beginning of your show people worried about copycat bombers and I just wanted to tell you you know I've called before but you may not know this but I I Lived in England or like in the late eighties early nineties and the IRA with an ... or ... or doing a bombing campaign\nThat got right and the thing is that just because\nPart of the background of the British really just a very stark about maybe to the blitz and stuff like that but\nIt's just background noise you know the thing is it's it's gonna happen some crazy person is going to do what some crazy person got it and it may or may not happen and we're we're just better and stronger and more stores not that's just the way we have to act\nWell isn't that what the the way the British are though they just you know keep a stiff upper lip and carry on and they just kind of shrugged off in ... in their character\nExactly that's opening their character but the fact that they went through World War two and ... and got that it's about the crap bombed out of it you know what I can attest that I had put things in perspective sure\nWell let let me ask you this amount I'd like to test your theory because here we have a white maggot righty Trump supporting miscreants right a deplorable an animal and and and I have I have no\nProblem saying that because these are people are animals and he goes there I go there they forfeited their right to complain about it is my argument so\nHere's here's the problem though\nWhat happens if it's a Muslim guy who does this\nThis is the problem that I Am I'm seeing here is when it's a white maggot when it's a Trump supporter and nobody gets harmed right we're all just drug loose plus in it All right in a drug enough\nWhat happens if it's a Muslim guy right you know Trump is going to grab a hold of this thing and he's just going to whip up the hysteria and that's what scares me what do you think\nYeah no I agree with that that is the difference here I mean that that that compared to say what the what had happened in the in the u._k. with the IRA you're right you're going to blame the Muslim I blame the other you know the typical kind of a a you know right wing stuff that people do\nWell he's already got is not stirred up I mean about some caravan of a bunch of poor people who were fleeing their own version of terrorism in their home country I mean he's got his he's got his idiot knuckle dragging it all worked up over that\n... imagine imagine if some guy named Mohammed is behind some bombing campaign you know it just this is my concern we can all shrug it off because everybody's all these white guys so you know okay but I'm just I'm very very Jeff I'm very very concerned that if you got any president Americans aren't\nWilling to do the rest of your very concerned I'm just thinking that there are probably more angry white guys like this guy that may have the capability to do stuff like this\nAnd it's like why are we just have to say that they're idiots do stuff like this and just know that they're there but you're totally right about about a a an ethnic person will say say was responsible for this and then and then a Republican from going all or\nYou know Hitler on us you know blaming the other\nAnd to you that that's just about the consequences of the leadership that we have right now I\nMean look out the justices apathetic we are to my knowledge Benedict Donald has not yet thank the FBI for catching the bomber\nMe even acknowledge that they did what they're supposed to do many he's the boss he'd been waging war on them I suspect a whole bunch of them are giving them the middle finger saying there you go down would still do it on the job done on you right\nYeah exactly what that just shows you want to comment what a ... a you know what a what a what a partially Trump is and how he's holding to his face and getting support because he can't even congratulate the FBI or you know for finding for finding this guy it's just pathetic\nAnd and if you is this guy if he was going after Muslims a first organization he'd be demanding go round them up would be the FBI Jeff thanks for being with us thanks to show me with teaching me were Luke ... is\n... and that that area

are now\nBack twenty five point lead among women for Democrats is still a twenty five point lead but that three point lead among men has now jumped to fourteen points so in eleven point increase there in the Republican's lead among male voters and then you add these up\nTwenty five points to the Democrats among women fourteen points the Republicans among many that have thirty nine point gender gap they basically are forty point gender gap there staring at right there\nAt a Steve corn that can we think MSNBC for that this nation is divided in so many ways and men verses women it really is one of those dividing line\nTake a look here at past mid term not just either Mitt terms where you had\nWave elections of the recent past and twenty fourteen being here for Republicans remember this to a month's out in our poll or NBC News Wall Street journal poll this was the enthusiasm gap\nRepublicans fifty nine percent very interested back then Democrats forty seven percent very interested back then\nThat was an enthusiasm gap of ... points and the Republicans flavor and remember\nThis ended up being a wave election for the Republicans in twenty ten this was a gigantic wave election for the Republicans a month out it was a twenty point enthusiasm gap in the Republican state where this is the election remember where they won sixteen three house seats that taint party uprising John Banner becomes speaker\nAnd the Democrats had their own wave election back in two thousand six George W. Bush Iraq was getting out of control congressional scandals and look a month out there was an enthusiasm gap of Thirteen points the Democrats much more enthused and the Republicans and Democrats ended up flipping the house in two thousand six so you have here\nThese past three mid term waves\nThirteen twenty and twelve point enthusiasm gaps in our poll amongst out\nAnd there is the ... border we

questions about uh the Russian investigation liked the self assemble it today\nOkay and I differ on a different topic I here in Illinois we have the Pritzker of defending the possible legalization of marijuana which I Know is a topic that you are very fond\nOne of my best one of my big issues you bet ya\nRight now I Want to replace by say I do not like marijuana is not for me but I Do not want to take the ride from anybody giant that outlook out ...\nAlcohol is not for me I mean I don't drink and and but I don't want to take alcohol away from other people ... will do what they want to do as long as they're not hurting anyone else\nAbsolutely but I Do have some reservations at all likely to educate\nOh like ... maybe ... form an educated decision but before I start to just want to stay a while ago hold much half an hour along with the conversations we have a lot of people here I Want to just drove two cents on two different topics there\nYes it was a Muslim guy Trump would have been all over all over you know it in all\nDoing good doing round up she would have had the police agencies under control just round up Muslims it would've been the most and it's still going to happen or it it will be the most disgraceful episode ... since ... when I'm not even going to the wind but it'll be a disgraceful episode go ahead\nRight and the other one about the death penalty or a life sentence as being the different from our copycats those people don't think like you and I know arm and now I if I don't want to have to begin with it all\nI Hope you're right I Hope you're right I I really hope you're right\nIn ... he has shown over and over again to curb crime or violent crimes are all people like that they think in a different away it's not like you know and I maybe I'm not got your body because if I got the death penalty but\nAll those people do not think so I Do not believe that the death penalty or it is really as a threat but that being said let's get back to them\nOr your wallet just now but just can't bring them in putting him in prison for the rest of their lives right right I mean we got his editor I didn't have that be a deterrent\nOften I don't know about the dirt from another person who has a punishment for the person and I'm okay with that\nWell you know hopefully I suspect that the guy who got today it they got fingerprints DNA it looks like they have the evidence they need but assume let's assume for the purposes of our discussion that that he is the guy the guy that when they got the evidence and they do put him on trial and they convict him my suspicion is the judge will give him life in prison probably without possibility of parole\nBecause the only thing is I mean and of course nobody's going to argue nobody's going to say hey judge you being too harsh on the guy\nMay have to judge puts him away forever with nobody really broke nobody's going to criticize the judge me do ours\nBut will that will that service as a deterrent for anybody who wants to be a cop get or are they are you right I mean I'm just asking are are you right to the point where there are so nuts so other than like I'm willing to sacrifice the rest of the guy the murder of Dr George Tiller was willing to make that that that sacrifice he's sitting in prison for the rest of his life\nSome of those guys don't even think they're going to get caught or did

Bush you like that ... that I mean I'm Glad you did some of that good old fashioned man them after that I was there was all well\nAnd and obviously there's got to number job openings that have different salaries and think what they did it take a easier\nNow let's map that a man\nThat I you know they were making about thirty thousand dollars a year that sure Margaret and I said I mean that's sort of fifty dollar\nSerious money at it ...\nIt really is it you know take take quarter that back in ... I'm certainly wouldn't solve the one trillion dollar deficit at ... ... ... dollars that would be going into the uh ... you know help ball that not to mention all incremental that\nWell this is one of the reasons go going back going back to my conversation or a moment ago about cannabis it it's like you need the revenue as well I mean this is one of the reasons to legalize the thing\nAnd in fact you're from Illinois one of your famous former senator Everett Dirksen\nRight one of his most famous stories about him is he got on the floor of the Senate one day and he said you know I've been listening to this region here from OU senators will be a different programs a billion ear will solve this in a billionaire will solve that well you know after a while billion here at a billionaire we're talking about some real money [noise]\nRain there was one of the most famous Everett Dirksen he was a Republican as I recall anyway\nBut you know but that's the thing is you know ... what was that number again ... thirty thousand times seven million was how many billions that\nI heard it on WC ... you know a little shout out a seven\nRight and so while I was a number that the the result I was I wondered and fifty six billion\nTwo hundred and fifty to\nTwo hundred fifty billion art that's\nMorality or your sort of an indoor economy ... billion then go back to the federal government right\nI'm not to mention of course you know things like the housing market down again you can structure and I mean all these things you know what I mean there's a multiplier effect and of course we can't just an absolutely seven million white ... ... ... jobs they have to ...\n... ... alone with us he'd say yeah we can get seven million white people [laughter]\nYep I'm rushing out ah [laughter]\nDo you manage outweighed ... Scandinavian in Russia is all the same damn I\nYeah I did it I ... and call it well I I don't care it out and people are coming in the Arab man I'm you know ... ... in our country from national alert the\nGovernment work [laughter] problem you know what\nAlso know job you're right so much of a you know I'm a gross that we have in this nation comes from immigrants the gums or people coming in doing jobs that Americans just don't want to do\nRight by the way you know when when Obama was first and Rick Perry then the governor of Texas to stand now the energy secretary was talking about secession\nAnd and I have played that scenario out in my mind a bunch of times I own I'm almost to the point where I Would dare the south to secede and tell the north to let him go because in about this in less than a year they'd be nobody there\nAnd the place they'd be begging to get back into the union and while they were out we can amend the constitution to get rid of all the people that would be against guns do we get 'em in the country to get rid of Citizens United do all the stuff we want to do and then when they come crawling back to get back into the union who you say okay you can come in but he used a new constitution ... you want to come on it\nGetting abortions in the new constitution marriage equality is in the new constitution very strict gun reform is in a new constitution I mean it's so anyway I just I toss out when\nI I I I had a thought for the scenario I felt like what really what we do it all while the rest of the country trying you go wait fossil fuel oh\nWell that China why we need Texas right now and and how much how many government and you know how many government programs out\nThere that if we split up the government on it if you get money you\nKnow they got right right you know the government how much money that we all the\nSocial Security and Medicare alone just thinking those Social Security and Medicare to the states they want to be out right Mississippi to exist in all these states than we did with the around there is no more Social Security and Medicare payments going to them and all those military bases they're gonna have\nTo take over those military base and pay for those do not paying for some of the country's military bases that not that this other country we do it for everybody else absolutely but not this so I don't think they thought through the the the the whole secession thing and I'm I'm to the point where I'm like you know what\nWill just kick you out we don't need you to want to leave we don't want you here and we know what's going to happen\nThere'll be no economy there's going to be what's known as a brain drain everybody's gonna leave because they're going to come to the north for all the jobs you guys gonna have nobody to do any of the menial labor I mean it's over for you it'll take less than a year before you be begging to be back inside the union\nHarry's as a way to handle that as a
