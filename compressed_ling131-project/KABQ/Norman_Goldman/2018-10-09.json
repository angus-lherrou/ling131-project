right when you look at these mega churches in the thousands of people there and they're all swaying and doing that stuff they know their role in the army that is the Republican Party and I'm not a military kinda guy is a trust you know lowest but I think the analogy really works and and\nSo it's not an endorsement the military but I think the model in the paradigm that the structure of the

people are really we need to just take a really deep breath and look deep in the mirror and look I mean I hate to keep coming back to it but Taylor Swift did it\nAnd I respect her for it she was a political I'm sure it was fantastic for career milligram through the Dixie Chicks right they got political look what happened to them so you know by she made a decision to enter the the ... in the mud and the reason I'm I I keep thinking about this is because she she can do so much good\nTaylor Swift has a connection with her audience that she can motivate them in ways I that they never even heard of me they don't know who the heck I\nAm right but they know right she is and she can lead them and she can do so much good and and lowest I don't want to drop any names I refuse to drop names but I

the other reason we have\nGot to turn out in massive massive numbers don't forget today is the last day to register and a whole bunch of states check if you are a registered if you're not in those states please registered today huh Taylor Swift that's all yeah listen to tailor just doing trust or yeah or even have trouble\nTrouble trouble we won't be able to shake it off no shaken up a\nNew

eastern Gulf Coast meteorologist Alison ...\nSo if you don't know when the deadline to register in your state is Tennessee is today and I'll give me the other states in a second but those states have\nA a deadline of today fourteen states in Tennessee is one of them so my sense is Taylor Swift basically wanted to help spike registration in her state because she explicitly endorsed her sitting house member and a U.S senator and so or pardon me US Senate\nCandidate she of course\nHas more fans than just in Tennessee and so there's been this bike everywhere but I'd like to see your just my own view is she can do a lot of good she can do a whole lot of good she's got a lot of followers and she can engage them in politics it would be nice ride I can order around\nNobody's got power where she's more free American Woman write I'm a born free American Woman everybody gets to make their own decisions however\nShe can do a lot of good so I'm hoping she gets in and stays in the Republicans already hate our guts right I mean you know the damage has been done so in any event\nThe polling is fascinating it's just really really amazing brand\nNew numbers from CNN conducted by SRS out right now forty one percent approve of the president's handling of job fifty two percent a majority of Americans disapprove always handling a job but like I said he's up take a look\nAt where he wasn't September he was thirty six so the president's up five points now that's good news you want to be heading this way for weeks off from an election but here's the problem take a look at how that forty one percent\nStacks up in history gym it's at the bottom\nDonald Trump is matching were Bill Clinton was in Nineteen Ninety four at forty one percent he's at a historic low and we all remember in Nineteen Ninety four when Bill Clinton was that this forty one percent his party got wiped out in the mid term elections this is a concern that Donald Trump is this low for weeks out from the ...\nThat is David ... CNN and we think CNN for that and that's kind of the top line set of numbers but when you start to look a little bit of a little bit deeper into the gender divide\nAlso asked about how the Democrats and Republicans\nHandled themselves during the Kavanaugh hearings this did not where well for either party or the majority of Americans disapproved of fifty five percent disapproved for Republicans fifty six disapproved of how the Democrats handled themselves this process did not where well on anyone not justice Kavanaugh not the ...\nOr craft and Republicans on the hill maybe say for President Trump who I said as approval rating is on the way up\nThere you guys David ... CNN what about women\nBiggest movement I think the most significant movement\nPotentially we're seeing on the Senate front or the one that jumps out his Tennessee Tennessee was sort of a surprise target that emerged for Democrats over the summer Phil Bredesen very personally popular former governor\nNot too attached to his national parties image within the states unexpectedly got in the Senate race he has a lead in polls in the spring and summer led in our own NBC News ... pool but in the last week we've seen two separate polls come out in Tennessee now\nOne that shows him falling behind by five points\nOne that shows him falling behind by eight points there's another one that sort of in the field right now I'm very interested to see what the final result there is if we've got three showing up pretty steady gap there for breakfast and then I think we started to say something significant maybe has changed in that race and again this is one of those when you're a Democrat trying a stitch together a path\nTo a Senate majority Tennessee was really emerging as something close to an essential state for you especially because some of the other big movement we seem to be seen is in North Dakota North Dakota is probably the single most vulnerable democratic seat on the map that Heidi Heitkamp\nRunning in a state that Trump carried by thirty six points in twenty sixteen\nI Can't falling behind by eleven points in one poll last week and that eleven point gap came before\nShe announced her opposition to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court so again if you if you lose a cabin or senior Democrats fry it at that point you got to pick up an Arizona that's doable you got to pick up in a vat of that's doable\nBut then you're going to need like a Tennessee or a Texas also the polling news not encouraging for Democrats the latest polling is that a Texas either\nThat is Steve corn ... we think MSNBC for that\nSo and not watch him a scar skull survey a decisive factor in the Democrats support out there so they went on here for for a democratic candidates by fourteen coin [noise] fifty four to forty percent long men favor the Republicans by five points\nMika Brzezinski we think MSNBC for them this\nWay more traveling for Republicans have bike and the number of women\nTo support the Democrats are for the Republicans in their choice for Congress chart based on NBC Wall Street Journal poll says the transcends twenty can when Republicans took over a going from a six point gap that air to a twenty five point one this here\nThat is ... ... again we think MSNBC for that and so it looks like a very very clear situation if women motivate themselves to the polls and vote the way we anticipate and hope they will\nDemocrats stand a pretty good chance of making substantial gains and in that Tennessee race the polling had been bad\nLately for the Democrats Phil Bredesen he was the mayor I Believe was Nashville and then he was the governor and he's very personally popular but he seems to be slipping Marsha Blackburn\nShe's really not very nice he's\nA very nice person and she's a congresswoman she's a T beggar and she's the Republican nominee to replace retiring Senator Bob Corker so does my sense of it was the timing of all that that got Taylor Swift involved if you want the people in Tennessee to come in and vote so that she could get her senator or Senate candidate in and so\nWe've seen a spike in registration and as we know it's become kind\nOf an axiom of ... American politics or young people don't vote and older people do vote and so we are seeing a giant spike in Eighteen to twenty nine year olds are registering to vote in the Seventy two hours because of Taylor Swift okay so the timing\nIs really really important in politics and timing is really important in life so\nWhy did Nikki Haley announced\nToday before the election that she's leaving\nAfter the election I don't believe we're Benedict Arnold says\nShe told me probably six months ago she said you know [noise] maybe at the end of the year the end of a two year period but at the end of the year [noise] I Want to take a little time off or what but\nAll right so the U.S ambassador to the United nations Nikki Haley is out\nThe end of the neck me will be leaving\nNow that's weird in terms of the timing and timing is showing up in a couple of places today\nNormally announcements like this are done after the congressional election and if she's leaving at the end of the year November cancer eleventh or whenever a few days after the election would have been normal there's nothing normal about this administrator and\nShe's done an incredible job [noise] she is a fantastic person [noise] very importantly but she also is somebody that gets she has been [noise] at the United nations from the beginning with us from there we got a\nWell something doesn't smell right about this it just doesn't smell right\nI'm a believer in her mind that farmers have to be to me now here's enough to know her father in law someone else to do the\nAdult thanks so this doesn't smell right not at all announcing it before the election when would normally normally be after the election uh and saying after not even two years that she believes in term limits no ... and now of course I have to bring in Herman Cain here because I\nDon't have facts to back\nThis up some things telling me it's about North Korea sums telling me\nThat Benedict Donald with his announcement the he's in love with Kim Jong on\nAny keep sending might pump a oh these so called secretary of state to North Korea I have a sneaky suspicion that Nikki Haley knows that Benedict Donald is being played by North Korea's Kim Jong on and she just can't take it anymore the reason I'm saying that is because I don't think it's about Iran\nI mean they are they all hate Iran they all want to bomb Iran John Bolton the whole\nBloody a lot of 'em they're all bunch of war crazed lunatics and they all want to go after Iran so Nikki Haley it strikes me she wouldn't resign over their policy towards Iran they're unified on one the bomb it back to you know twelve ten or whenever a so\nIt's it has to be North Korea because Benedict Donald has made this the centerpiece of his foreign policy is going to succeed\nWhere all the others failed I Will denuclearize North Korea I Will bring Kim Jong un to heal and I want my Nobel Peace prize\nThis is what Bennett what goes on you know in what passes for brain inside Benedict Arnold said and so\nHe's got ... pale over in North Korea seemingly endlessly he's putting a lot of pressure you could see him you know picture screaming at pump a all all the time and so it seems to me that Nikki Haley basically said you know I got to do something and so she quit\nIf this were all hunky dory if this were all normal and we're all friends\nAnd all of that then uh you know they would have announced it a couple of days after the election and\nThat would have been it but there's something fishy about this and I I've ... I've been on Twitter at Norman Goldman at Norman Goldman on Twitter and I have seen the questions and of course email Norman Norman Goldman dot com Norman Norman Goldman dot com\nOur\nTelephone number is one eight eight eight three two one six thousand and one and I will be on the phones with you in just a second and I would like to spend the really big chunk of the show on the phone with you with

having a longer attention span right I've been doing my hash tag no short attention span\nI've been focused on this and playing the John Boehner clips three yards in the cloud of dust man I'm sick of hearing this stuff and I suspect you are as well well\nMitch McConnell the Senate majority leader or he thinks we have a short attention span in fact he's banking on it he's counting on it and I and we're gonna have to thwart a mix with justice almost rare missing a horrid\nTheory or to adhere to fall in line\nWe've covered it talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing

women\nAnd young people and so we'll see what happens Democrats generally don't turn out in these non presidential elections let's see what happens but Mitch McConnell has been banking very smuggling as well very smug guy\nAnyway he's been banking on Democrats having a short attention spans and he's been very public about it because these are not and he's out there saying all those all all all over and over again or just blow over the cabinet thing is going to blow over\nConfirmation process was contentious an emotional that processes over my focus now is to be the best justice I can be a take this office with gratitude no bitterness\nAll right so I don't believe a word of that Mitch McConnell thinks we're going to just let it blow over and\nThe news cycle is already moved on we've got us the new news cycle Nikki Haley now I just want you to understand for my part for my part I'm not going to let us forget Brett Kavanaugh certainly not until the election but Mitch McConnell he knows politics better than I Do and he's sitting\nThere going on all the ... the news I get outraged about the next day may worried about it\nLet's see what happens it's up to women and young people it's up to Democrats to get out and vote\nBernie Sanders himself has said very many times that when Democrats vote they win elections because as many more Democrats and Republicans and that's simply a fact jak laugh that hey speaking of Bernie Sanders I have\nTo confess that I have been trolling you and nobody has taken the bait so I'm just going to go and do it anyway because I've been I've been begging I've been kinda begging for somebody to call I trust you've been listening in recent days you've heard me say something like this\nI Would like somebody to call me and asked me about Bernie Sanders talking about the Brooklyn Dodgers a couple of spring training to go when he was at the Los Angeles Dodgers a spring training headquarters because it was the most wonderful example of socialism versus capitalism like it ever\nEver come up with and I wish somebody would call me at one Tripoli three two one six thousand and one and asked me about it and and to your credit you didn't go for the ... no one has ever done it well I run out of patience and I've been looking at\nYou know look I have patients but I've been looking for a spot and and here's here's I think the moment is presenting itself here goes on to do this fast like that but I really really really would like to take to give it a quick listen here a\nCouple of seasons ago a\nBernie Sanders that Bernie Sanders says Vermont's went to Arizona\nWhere the Los Angeles Dodgers have their spring\nTraining and he went there not as a politician he went there not a you know ask for money right he went there because he was the Dodgers fan as a kid I looked at a Bernie was born on September the eighth Nineteen forty one Bernie and put the let's just say Nineteen forty one the\nBrooklyn Dodgers left their last\nGame in Brooklyn was in September Nineteen fifty seven I don't know if you knew that but I mean there you go the first season of the Los Angeles Dodgers was April Nineteen fifty eight so it's simply a matter\nOf laughs at Bernie Sanders born Nineteen forty one\nBrooklyn Dodgers leave Brooklyn in Nineteen fifty seven so therefore Bernie Sanders was laughs at sixteen right you were Fifteen if you want to you know excuses board September the if you lost that baseball season art so if let's say Bernie was Fifteen when the Dodgers you know basically gave up\nAnd and split art\nThat means that Bernie Sanders grow up on the Brooklyn Dodgers and you don't need me to you know you don't need a tuition or math death or anything I mean Bernie Senate he showed up at the ... I grew up in Brooklyn Dodgers fan\nI Love the Brooklyn Dodgers I Do the right and of course all of Brooklyn I mean look they left they left before I was born in fifty nine the Dodgers were in LA the second season ... when I was born so to me they've always been in Los Angeles Dodgers and incidentally just to show you how fast time is flying I I did I did this last that\nI did I I I did the calculations in twenty twenty five which is not\nThat far off right twenty twenty five not that far off in twenty twenty five the Los Angeles Dodgers will be in Los Angeles as long as the Brooklyn Dodgers were in Brooklyn and how's that\nFor a mind bender if you're you know kind of that age anyway Bernie Sanders went to LA Dodgers spring training he was talking to them about the Dodgers leaving Brooklyn and he said he was shocked and he said so many of his friends were shocked\nHow could you take a a an institution that was so central to the identity of Brooklyn that that had the heart and soul of so many Brooklyn Heights wrapped up in this franchise how could it be private property this was\nBernie Sanders at the LA Dodgers a spring training couple of years ago is that how could it be private property but you could just pack up and take it along [laughter] deal is and Bernie was saying that and I read\nI read this in the LA Times I give them the credits Bernie was ... times right there covering the Dodgers a spring training and so they covered this and I was like wow that's it there it is their socialism versus capitalism\nIn a capitalist system the means of production please remember those three words oh I beg your remember three words means of production this simple words NBA an S. O. F. production means of production pop quiz\nWhat is the means of producing a baseball game bus I don't know\nAbout baseball it's I I'm not a franchise I don't know the means of production of baseball is baseball right the means of production of food is a farm the means of production of shoes as a factory right the means of production of a flower shop is flowers okay\nYou get the idea\nThere are requirements to make things right so if the means of production production a farm or a baseball team whatever it is law question and when I say the I mean capital T. H. E. ... question is who owns it\nIs it private property or is it public property\nNow this is why I loved that Bernie Sanders' story with the LA Dodgers Bernie as a Fifteen sixteen year old teenager was as heart was broke and he was crushed falling right because his\n... is manageable some don't keep a lid on it [noise] good why Denis ...

and they obey\nRhyming wild check that out that those happening a lot of countries like right they get caught the guards around stocked with with political apparatus chicks right and the porches set the bar generally smell was so so if you're asking me what am I first you have to define what democracy is then you have to define what we're talking about at the federal\nLevel the state level the local level I mean I'm sure there are many small towns\nAnd villages and even maybe smaller cities that\nHave ... that are run very democratically with the people are engaging they they they care about their local community and they both the local elections they know who the fire chief isn't a police keep right and they knew the city council members are and they go into a bug the mayor when there's a pot on the street I mean there are cities in little little smaller towns where people the democracy in action\nInvolved you know they say hey I made a stop sign on this treaty or because it's dangerous it's done much traffic\nRight so that's that's democracy on the local level so I Can't I have a local or going on\nUp picking through and I guess in to everything that's happened not just with this question is Ronald Reagan when he started just dismantling the country\nAgainst the popular I guess or your or people to see if you're if you're going all the ... people or their what

lot of people in our country is that greeted with Donald ... regardless\nOf course the polling rooms it where we played the polling in the first hour the big majority don't want cabin on there is I mean it's been proven in the moment ...\n... ... it didn't bother your vote which is basically a democracy over by the people were all older people it doesn't mean anything anymore are both in our\nShow the ... and you know George can can I bring celestial and I can I bring some perspective to this because I think you're looking in a very narrow window of time and I think I think I can offer some perspective\nAllow me okay in the beginning of this nation or black people were mostly slaves which meant that they were personal property of a white\nPerson and they were forced to work for no compensation right and we know all that they didn't have any rights to vote and in fact the African American experience in this nation trying to get the right to vote right we know that story and it's still continuing story so\nWe have that just take that hold that thought women\nWomen in this country in the beginning of this country they had no rights at all they couldn't divorce they could no property then the rights of the kids I mean they had no right there were essentially the fact\nOf slaves so between women who are about half the population and African slaves who were a big chunk of people enough of the constitution said there are three fifths of a person for counting population purposes\nThat tells you that this nation began very on democratically and today we have Ninety million people nine zero that's almost a hundred million Americans who have voluntarily accepted them from themselves from the from the system I'm not talking about people have been thrown off the ballot or\nOff the rolls as felons I'm Talking about people who say I can vote and I'm eligible I don't want it\nThat's Ninety million people if it Ninety million people is more than the population of all nations on this planet and in the nation this calls itself a democracy that has that ocean of apathy of Ninety million people who consciously say I participate in it is that a healthy measure of democracy the\nFace off but you know he got elected other marketing\nThen you add to that in the constitution that says two U.S senators per state\nAnd so Wyoming guess two U.S senators Idaho gets to us that\nIs yes Vermont gets to us those but so to South Dakota right and so there's a lot more of these rural Republican states in a very lightly populated they get two U.S senators and even with that built in advantages they barely are clinging to a bare majority in the U.S Senate\nSo it's a ... system\nHowever what I'm suggesting blows\nMy when I was like Rojas dish or by the way well\nGeorge what I'm suggesting he knew as it was a whole lot more rig them fix back in the day when we had slavery and women had no rights were doing a lot better now we need to keep doing a lot better now my theory of America is is that what we are trying to do is to make with George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and John Adams\nAnd all those boys they wrote all those highfalutin words all those really really fancy words about\nFreedom and all this great stuff they didn't they were in practice any of that stuff it was a joke man they were there was only white male property owners and he writes everybody was out a lot and so\nThe bears all there was a there were allowed to vote on whatever yeah\nSo the idea of the the whole the whole to me to me the whole story of America\nHas been taken the aspirations of the dreams the written hopes than and declarations of the boys and applying them to everybody and we're getting closer but we still have a lot of good call interrupt or I\nDon't deny that it was about ... we can increase I mean they representation by for a U.S the numbers are in any state\nGeorge there's adequate here's the deal is a lot of possibilities to do a lot of things is independent rang voting there's a million things in this show airway these show airways are populated with fantastic ideas all the time and I just keep having to come back to the city a stops fable of battling the cat\nRight that you know the you know the fabled by now and if you don't hear it is there's a cat and it's getting all the mice right and the mice aren't happy\nAbout it because they can't keeps getting nice and so the mice have a meeting and they say what to do about this cat that keep picking us off and killing us this is bad\nAnd so one of them says let's put a bell around the cat's neck that'll be great and then whenever the cat comes near by the bell ringing will know to run away and the cat will never kill any more of us nice and then an old mouse in the back taps his cane and says\nAsk a question who was going to put the bell on the cat and of course that's the that's a ... look at thousands of years ago I didn't have anything to do it anyway\nWho's going to build a cat who is going to put the bell around the cat's neck how you gonna get a bunch of mice to put a bell around the cat's neck good luck with that so it's just that's why bring you a self fables and battling the cats\nBecause the idea is you need the political will George at a great idea we can do this reform in this state on this voting we and I

where you know if you're going to fight a war you're going to have battles and some battles you're going to win some battles you're going to lose\nThe once you lose you know learning your lessons licked your wounds and go on\nAnd one thing is when we left in my mind from friday which unfortunately got lost with all the other noise is that according to the New York times twenty four hundred\nLaw professors signed off on a letter saying that Kevin ... should not be I'm\nOn the court that is right that was more than ten that's well more than ten percent of law professors in the United states because the color to our show and I forget the gentleman's name but he looked it up on the Internet he just did a search how many law professor in the United states it was about Seventeen thousand\nSo ten percent of Seventeen thousand of course is laughs at Seventeen hundred and so if you've got twenty four hundred and ten percent me or your into your into double digit percentages of the law professor United States that's unprecedented I mean to to oppose ... coordinates in brain it's insane off the charts\nThat's just that's incredible so what I've been thinking is how do you Marshall that\nAnd the question is can you start filing lawsuits I think about what the what the Republicans were to obstruct obstruct obstruct\nWater and with all of this legal fire power were to start filing lawsuits and I don't mean frivolous suits but suits that actually has merit such that you absolutely ... absolutely the lower\nCourt they're already starting out there already pretty called what what what what merit tore us lawsuits do you have in mind\nI ... I Can't I don't know the law well enough to to answer that but it but my thinking is if you can cause the lower courts to the extent that few if any case\nWhen get them to the Supreme Court\nNot listed than having Cavanaugh a when a good now\nI understand what you're trying to trying to stuff the toilet basic rights oh well that was\nAll right [laughter] I'm [laughter] saying yeah\nI it's a lot you know I'm a working class guy I mean these are my roots you know I'm a Brooklyn guy like money than I look I get the idea here's the problem here is ... ...\nWhen bronco bomber was President Obama\nAnd the Republicans were hating his guts which was always they found the LA it was the Los Angeles times I have to give them credit 'cause we don't plagiarize\nThe LA Times counted forty four towards the I think it was right at the end of Obama's time they counted forty four federal law suits against the Obama administration for many of them were filed a course in Texas and and many of them were against the EPA\nBut that's forty for law suits and they were down there fall by Scott Pruitt the attorney general of Oklahoma stand right and all these you know the attorney general's of Republican states\nAnd sometimes they would get injunction sometimes they wouldn't it sometimes you get to the Supreme Court and sometimes they wouldn't but\nKnowing how much the Republicans be tested for rock Obama understanding how much they hated his guts and would have done anything and everything to harm him\nThe best they could do was forty four federal lawsuit\n... so I ... and the courts the federal courts had no problem digesting forty four federal law suits so Andrew here's the problem what you want to do is you want to use the courts and kind of a bad faith way I understand you are not acting in bad faith but but the\nThe whole idea of filing a lawsuit is to get justice in that lawsuit is not to use the lawsuit for another reason which is the stuff the toilet right so in the courts if this were the courts would look at this and say dude that's not if it's by definition it's bad faith\nThat that would be the argument by the courts and\nIt's certainly the argument by me is I wouldn't recommend it don't file lawsuits just to clog up the courts and it's not going to work the judges will throw them out and and look the Republicans can only scratch up forty four federal law suits in eight years\nI mean if they could've scratched up a hundred and forty four or three hundred and forty four don't you think they would have\nDon't you think they would have wanted to you know\nAny way you get the idea\nLet me give you a different idea have you ever looked at your credit card statement and saying oh my goodness gracious that's a really high interest rate not carrying a big balance you have good credit\nWe've got a new sponsor and I'm really proud of this is a great sponsor light stream if you're on the Internet\nYou should check out light streamed dot com slash nor man because this\nIs a really easy way on line to do debt consolidation if you've got credit card debt you're carrying and you've got good credit I've got a fantastic solution for you I'm really proud to associate myself with this company because light stream is\n... is a division of sun trust is a giant bank in the southeast this is a big company in a big market space there's a lot of companies out there but light streaming I checked the man you should check them out to his life's dream dot com they have really low interest rates and\nThe people that they're talking about are people with good credit light streamed believe people with good credit deserve are great interest rate a new fees and that's one of the interesting things about light stream\nNo fees no fees and I mean no fees and if you've got good credit if you've got some debt that you're paying high interest rates on I've got the perfect solution for you because light stream is very flexible five thousand to a hundred thousand dollars and\n\n[noise]\nDo", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Norman Goldman", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "09"}
