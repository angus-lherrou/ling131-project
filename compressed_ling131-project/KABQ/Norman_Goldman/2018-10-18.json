the Internet now anyway Archie Bunker and all that he represented is in the White House now and it's a serious thing\nSo the good news and all this is you and I and all of our fellow normal Americans we don't need fifty years we really don't because we are the majority now and we've been the majority was obvious in two thousand when George W. Bush and\nKatherine Harris and his brother Jeb Bush right stole Florida by five hundred and thirty seven most as ... obviously we've been a majority for a long time we can grab power and make this government whatever we want\nWe can fix Social Security we can have single payer Medicare for all we can have whatever we want the constitution gives us all of that the thing the standing in our ways organization and focus so\nNow that people are really really really upset now that people are mad\nWe've been following what really is a national\nStory now the share about the right to vote and that she has congressional elections that right to vote coming under tremendous and very pressure all over the country\nAs Republican officials on down the line Republican officials in state government and county government not the city level the municipal level all around the country we're seeing evidence of them\nBasically trying to help the playing field wherever they can however they can to make voting as hard as possible or as complicated as possible for democratic leaning voters who might be inclined to vote in this upcoming congressional election\nAnd then of course is Rachel Maddow and she's on this story she's a leader on this story she deserves tremendous credit you shining a big national\nSpotlight on it and it's happening in lots of states of course the Republican states my state California makes it very easy to vote there's no impediments Oregon and the normal states voting is a good thing we like it when people vote and so that by the way Bernie Sanders would tell you this anytime you ask him\nWhich is when large numbers of people vote Democrats win that's been the rule of American politics since I've been a child\nIt's true because there's more Democrats there are more Democrats than Republicans that's why they have to suppress the vote because what because there's always been more Democrats and Republicans and on those occasions when Democrats get upset and they say okay now I'm really going to vote by Democrats win and the more Democrats voted the more Democrats when it's really very simple\nWe don't need fifty years they needed fifty years in the unlimited resources and all the rigging and fixing call themselves Christians and making alliances with whoever they need to make life live because they're on American they're not patriots bad people you know they're out in the open now we see it all now\nWill the anti immigration stuff right ... ... et cetera et cetera so\nGood news roses we'd only fifty years maybe eight maybe eight\nBut we've got to win like virtually every election from now for the next eight years we've got to get a Democratic president it's twenty twenty and then re elected we need a heavily Democratic House and Senate we've just got to take power and consistently use election after election and these things do build on each other\nWith Democrats or bold and they take power and they start showing people a little government can actually do have some good news doesn't have to be corrupt in terrible people's I'll give you another chance keep going let's see how you do but\nYou gotta earn let's see we aren't\nMy real concern my real concern because it looks like the Democrats this year for this congressional elections this November next month the week couple of weeks right the Democrats appear very angry and very arousing very ready to vote my ultimate biggest concern\nIs not turn\nIts wheels the votes actually be counted we have election fraud that's what the Republicans do\nThe voter suppressive efforts are getting a little emotional a little heat it case in point I Will I Will confess that was a little bit of laughing out loud when I first saw that but I'm trying to be apathetic I'm trying to get

for a few years now there are two party conservative basically anti voting rights activist group\nUm they're the ones who send conservative poll watchers into minority precincts to loom over people

thing in the Treasury Department called Finn sin it's basically not basically it's financial crimes I mean that's what it is fenced in is the financial crimes enforcement network or close to that and so they are the\nPeople in the Treasury Department who get what are known as SARS and you heard in the u._s._a. today report suspicious activity reports right a bank\nHas a customer that they see

O. L. if we if we coal mingle all of our senators from Wyoming in Idaho in South Dakota right and all these lightly populated states wow\nLook at the power we can have if we act as a bloc\nWhat they have figured out how to use the system that is built in a lot of protection for minority rights and they said I\nWe can take that in turn it into actual massive\nMajority power at a ... power to oppress the majority\nAs the minority and that's the genius the evil genius of these guys now is they've taken a system and they have used it in such a way it was already designed to give them minorities want to you know we weigh in power protection and they've managed to take that in turbo charged it and turn it into an oppressive system\nWhere there is a clear minority and the clear majority is being ruled and I\nAs ... and I think he's at vox V. O. X. Ezra Klein was on Twitter and I ended up on Instagram 'cause he nailed that he said how long is this kind of think sustainable when people figure this stuff out and they get really angry what's that going to look like and I think it's super great set of provocative questions from Ezra Klein so we're not the only one thinking about this\nGym they put you to sleep I think Jim went to sleep [noise] gym\nYou know what I mean they don't know they know what he did he put me on hold and they went to get a sandwich I got an\nOld Jim it was a long answer but what what is your what is what are you I'm going to avoid what are your thoughts on that and that kind of\n[noise] well I I I Know that uh what you're saying is true I'm not sure how it links to the idea of a constitutional amendment I somewhat of amendment yet to abolish electronic oh\nWell ... well there's there is a way around it but yes got to take a constitutional amendment and so you're going to need two thirds of the house and the Republicans are not going to vote for it in the house and the to the union need two thirds of the Senate to approve the same constitutional amendments\nAnd so you're not going to get two thirds of the Senate to do it because there's a lot of Republicans there and they're like why would I vote to disadvantage my state's take away a lot of our power so that's impossible that passed away in my humble opinion is simply sealed off it's closed off I have an alternative for you it's called the interstate compact\n[noise]\n\n\n\nIt's\nA time of the season to come back to the telephones one eight eight eight three two one six thousand and one that's one Tripoli three two one six zero zero one and we have the pleasure of Tomas holding over with us until my I'm Glad you did\nThanks so much [noise] what am I [noise] I went back and we're back\nIn ... in Bonnie made them or we're going to go in the whole game local call me ... ... in ... on his show and ... ... ... ... nothing away from\nAll the immigrants who come over and and one and of course not while on the on the phone all all all of our own Congress\nAnd mosques here can have\nYour phone is going on me I I'm Sorry it's just the either the phone quality was great and the first part and then all of a sudden it went Timmy and muddy Tomas I have to be able to deliver a audible\nAudio how's that for phrase anyway and the U.S please call me back I got your line is open to one other open line at one eighty three two one six zero zero one\nI hear you I heard you I'm not so sure that everybody else can't in any event ...

African\nAmerican voter suppression playbook stuff that our parents and grandparents generation thought they had like said oh let's not do this\nAll this stuff has come back these people trying to take us back to like Eighteen Seventeen or aid that turn to roll back the clock couple of hundred years to repeal the entire twentieth century Medicare and Social Security that they you know they think Medicare those carry it out and get it out of here they're trying to roll is back and so\nWhat I think you're asking is is is there some independent unit inside the U.S government that is not beholden to the political powers that be and just say this is wrong and we're just going to bring the power of the federal government down on us to stop this was that the essence of your question\nIt is the answer is no sorry\nThat's the answer the answer is no\nI mean this is just not how it works the way our system works is Benedict Donald's in charge of the executive branch\nBeing in Jersey executive branch puts him in charge of the department of justice the department of justice has unit of government that you and I are talking about the civil rights division voting rights as all that kind of stuff under President Obama that really you know big staffing they were aggressive they weren't messing around the problem now\nIs we've got you know who in charge and so you know there's no independent unit that can disobeying the elected officials say this is why we have elections put people in charge of the government and to make policy choices\nAngel\nElections have consequences even when they're ... been fixed I'm Sorry to depress you\n\nI Am feeling a little different I wasn't expecting it to work out well but I thought there might be some things you\nKnow this is this is what all of us keep playing too and the answer is no there's no something\nWe have left the devil take over and the devils got us by the throat now\nAnd it feels very uncomfortable and everybody keep searching as can we repeal Jim we'd just like retroactively change all of this no a ... you know what the answer is we made a super massive\nSeries of stupid dumb mistakes we should blame ourselves\nWe should learn all lessons and and try and minimize the damage\nNow understand that for the vast majority of the damage we cannot stop it and we cannot get emotionally upset watches their delighting white and ripping babysitting a mom's arms watching everybody is normal and cares melt down\nTheir delighting in this stuff their gas lighting us trying to drive people crazy and they seem to be doing a pretty good job and the normal people are saying oh my God and the goal for the ... like people like you and say oh my God we can all the damage insurgent around", "show_name": "Norman Goldman", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "18"}
