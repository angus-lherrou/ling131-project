thing so Tom with each house making its own rules they get to decide who goes on committees and who goes off whenever they want to that's how it goes I don't\nYeah I Know of course for you you know and then we're in our history where congressman or senator ... never maybe\nWell I don't know the answer is I don't know I mean I don't know I suspect the answer is probably no\nUh many of them are on one or two committees and some of those communities or not you know the top ranked communities around me you know do you want to be on you know the house to administration committee where you're dealing with my in the paper towels or the men's room kind of thing I\nYou know there do you want to be in the ways and Means Committee that's a tax writing committee that is we get all the big

political back scratching deal making system that is largely based on seniority but they do make adjustments there were allowed to do whatever they want the courts will not intervene and Tom would that I got to leave it there because that's the end our number\nTwo I'll pose a blue parts ... formation adult true where justice is served\nAnd now I look back at this week in history\nThis week an aging sixty three expressing gratitude for a federal union army victory at\nGettysburg President Abraham Lincoln announces that the nation will celebrate and official Thanksgiving holiday for November

... one of a hundred and thirty five candidates on the ballot which included career politicians other actors and one adult film star that's your look back at this week in history\nBut right now they're buying spree and we need a place that could make it home\nDiabetes a ventilation safety around or [noise]\nUh the foundation\nOf why does the cat in fact as active I\nCan't do it without us\nWas where there's a wide enough\nOr why are better [noise]\nDidn't grant and probably ... the votes have lined up to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court with the key votes of Republican Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Democrat Joe Manchin all deciding to approve the judge\nWe're out of power he obstruct and of course he make preposterous to mom and exchanged for four months because they struck can you you are you going to get their own and we want to see what kind of health care if you're not giving her think about half an hour to got to know about it sorry\nAnd then we're going to get into power we do things like increasing number of states they could for Washington DC Puerto Rico in California not twenty two additional electrified they found a Supreme Court and lifetime appointment and the Supreme Court guarantee each president on the court regularly\nSo that if things don't happen\nA lot of that needs to be done through the constitution the law that can't be done through some of it some of it can be done by law some of it can\nCause I think about your stuff will have to have to take office to cook\nBut I have come up with things you eliminate when a take on election didn't get rid of a two party system if you have ranked choice vote yes here's another one like the number of them and to make the number of the house of representatives Naga government according to the parents because he says\nThat right now every representative represented an average of seven hundred thousand people through it's ridiculous and it shouldn't be that way and of course we need to make\nA constitutional voting rights act to make voting\nVery into the constitution you seem very educated so alone\nThey ask you if you ever heard of a shops fables\n[laughter] I Love them okay do you remember battling the cat oh yeah okay\nSo the what I'm hearing from you is that there's a man named spelled F. A. R. I. S. S. virus object\nRunner and they are and if they are as\nOkay David Ferris has a book of good ideas I have a three hour Daily Show good ideas from callers so how do we bell the cat how do we take power how do we organize the Democrats to march to the polls every election\nThe boy we are doing it the ... this is this is a problem with that no no no\nEverybody's assuming it everybody assumed Hillary would when everybody assumed were going to take the house and maybe the Senate and and not what I see is\nDemocrats don't understand power I'm very I'm being as as honest and streaming weren't as I can\nDemocrats don't understand power they don't understand how our system works and they don't have the the the intestinal temperament to learn from my perspective and I've been looking a long time I've been doing the show for nine years now\nDemocrats don't have a long term perspective they don't they don't they don't have the patience to sit and learn how the system works they don't have the patience to sit and work to make the system worked for them the Republicans have a couple of advantages they've got money boys on their side\nAnd stowed them with all kinds of funds to them the resources they need the Republicans also have the luxury of time because they represent the rich and the comfortable\nThey're not out there saying looked at all these homeless people are starving you know and the Democrats live in the moment because the Democrats feel everybody's paying all the time and I know how to do about it and how\nHer Democrats never ever planned for the future Democrat for the Democrats are the most pathetic bunch of people I've ever seen in my life and I'm being very serious about it you can't\nGet them organized they refused to organize everyone knows what's best for everyone else and I suspect David Ferris is one of them as well so very with all that cold water I just threw all over every body my question remains Hattie a bell the cat\nThat very weird and we get better at where do I\nGet the political will to take power\nAnd then explain to the people who've now\nWhat the Democrats in power that they need to patiently work block by block day by day minute by minute to implement this over decades they'll never never stand for it they'll call you a corporate shill you're too close to a stranger or stumble bomb you're a moderate get outta\nHere where Bernie I'm a\nPart of my heart I don't know\nMan government we have to focus on the positive and all of the Democrats it's inaccurate rhetoric that progress [laughter] I don't think we are not the corporate Democrat went on\nThe other guys you're the guys who stopped us from winning in twenty sixteen\nI couldn't go no such thing I voted for Hillary thank you very much\nAnd I and I voted for Bernie in the primary but understand that you understand very because you're educated that it was Seventy seven thousand votes spread across three states with his fuse eleven thousand in Michigan outta for ... million cast\nThat gave this I said that gave all the yes voters to bring him into why were the voters suppressed in Michigan because the Democrats in Michigan or a bunch of bombs who sat on their ass\nAnd didn't do anything and they let the Republicans take over the states so that they can regain same in Florida same in Pennsylvania seem in Wisconsin because the Democrats don't\nWork the Democrats don't work day in day out understanding that it's that it's election cycle after election cycle the Democrats are purists to say I didn't get what I Want in a system where there is an ocean of\nApathy with Ninety million people never participating to them the system rules them\nThey are ruled by the system Ninety million people have no faith in the government in a registered to vote they they don't care they don't know to care\nThey don't give a rat's rear ends and then I'll never reached Ninety million people they don't want nothing to do I start talking about that they're gone tuned out forget it they don't understand this is about their lives and the reason they're life sucks so much because they're they don't get involved in politics I Can't explain it to them so you you take Ninety million voters off the bat\nNow you down to a hundred and thirty million and or a hundred and forty million and you take a bunch of people who are in Brazil's who fall for the stuffed the Republicans give you this half now you've got a half\nSitting there going okay what do we do and then the slice of them says no you're not good enough\nThat's how you lose elections in Florida by five hundred and thirty seven votes because you'll let these people take power in the states they rigged the states the state's run the elections they take over the legislatures because the Democrats don't know how the system works they won't do the work to get it done and\nThe evidence is everywhere look at it I ... in Minneapolis Hi Julie\nHi may not find me don't hang up on camera crews something but I'm going to make a very gentle sweet quiet request regarding\nJudge Kavanaugh when he's on the Supreme Court he's not going to show up at the waffle house okay but if you happened to me at a rarified restaurant where he's paying twenty dollars sure his beer just quietly walk up to church table and a very sweet and snide in Ninety quiet boy say\nYou know I don't appreciate paying your salary\nJust

you know I Would like to say I listen to we feel that\nI'm listening going [laughter] okay I got a weird phone I Would just like to say that I Hope that Susan Collins got a big fat\nThat is not know that was the last seven and then at the first speech I listen to it all that with a small that's slicing and the icing on the lights\nAnd gracious hair job out of sexual assault let them that I've ever seen in my life she was going to get out of ... just the opposite of Grassley sad and I quote well\nKavanaugh was in the chair and have it and we all that things are teenagers which right away

there Julie I'm ... I got to leave it there but thank you very much ah I Do believe the Susan Collins ended her political career today and I'm not joking around and the reason for that is is that the people of Maine are really really really upset\nHe did the people of Oregon uh probably pretty upset with what happened today I Dave in Oregon\nAnd or outgoing sweat what's up well like\nYou I'm having a great day because I Do see this as a as a some sort of a\nOf a of a necessary awakening ah for people who believe in what we believe and I'd like to I'd like to give you said with an end to quotes the date is April twelve Eighteenth sixty one are you familiar with that\nApril twelve Eighteen sixty one was that was that that's what I noticed the civil war was that when the civil war goes up they attack on Fort Sumter\nExactly right and I see this is nothing less than the opening salvo of a political war\nI mean this is one of them\nNow is the time and wherever you are is the place the citadel makes it easier\nTo earn your degree by offering master's degrees Roger certificates and undergraduate degree completion programs that are entirely online these programs are convenient for working professionals in those serving in the U.S military continuing the ... legacy of academic excellence classes are held to the same high standards that consistently named the ... the\nMS RPG envoys list\nPrice dealer price to be happier if your car shop and you've probably heard these terms\nWhat do they mean it's so confusing well it was confusing not anymore and tell you about true price from ... it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including season accessories and vegetable you'll know if you're a true prices competitive ... shows you what other people are paying\nFor them sports time capsule sports fans of Sandy lasted I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in sports history let's start back in Nineteen Twenty one and the first broadcast of the world series on radio in New York Yankees beat the New York giants three zero [noise]\nThis weekend Nineteen fifty five Baltimore cult full back Alan and meet she becomes the first rookie an NFL history to top one hundred yards rushing and the first two games get a hundred and fifty three against Detroit Lions after his one hundred and Ninety\nNeed at home tech makeover that's by is here to help the tournament to free and home confrontation once you find you the perfect tech can deliver it and make sure it's working before I really need help afterward on we support all your attack all the time that's fine let's talk about was awful\nStill putting off building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider will find you a loan them right for\nCall a civilian let's get storey\nFor yard performance review against the Chicago Bears [noise] this week in Nineteen eighty four Walter\n...

Francisco forty niners thirty one uh fourteen in Mexico city Mexico Thatcher hard radio weekends for its time capsule\n\nJust this is a very special day because not only use it a one topic interview with our friend now like science wall but it's a very very rare day because we've got\nThe not now we know we have any new Supreme Court justice coming in this one is very special but not in the best way any way it is the day we review the week with our friend Alex science\nWall and reports great work at NBC News dot com MSNBC dot com and alec sites all does on TV on MSNBC and now it's a special weekend deep thanks for coming back on the norm in Goldman issue\nAnd armed thanks are me back well Alex uh you're in Washington DC you're a reporter at NBC News we're in Washington I'm In Los Angeles we got people all over the country and all over the world [noise] so\nNow that we know what the final score is it it looks like cabinet is getting through on a bare majority ... what is the final score and other any Democrats involved here\n[noise] yeah I think uh the we're we're in the end game now too in Congress just went to the Senate floor and a better big reveal she had been playing cards close to the chest and but the key swing vote\nA but she came out into this lengthy speech not only said that she would vote for Kevin uh but basically suggested she had been there from day one and gave\nActually probably the most Folsom\nA and cogent argument and and Kevin I favor that I've seen anyone give what the White House\nOr the you know conservative legal scholars she was really out there going point by point and saying basically she filled in for confidence that or she is going to go to Kevin uh the vote is set for tomorrow now that they have the votes and they're right after she did that Joe Manchin\nCame out and said he would too so they uh fifty one votes it's a basically a done deal Lisa Murkowski is the only know of of the swing votes but it's not enough and barring some kind of you know crazy divine intervention or it looks like this will be rammed through a cap and I will be\nA a Supreme Court justice elect or whatever you call it a sometime tomorrow evening\nWhile it so that's so basically Lisa Murkowski of Alaska gets to go\nHome and tell the native tribes who were very much against cabinet I voted against him she can tell women I voted against him Lisa Murkowski has to be a hero to Alaska and two women generally Susan Collins is now the villain but also one democratic crossed over\nThat's Joe mansion he's kind of irrelevant because with Susan Collins it would have been fifty votes anyway and Mike Pence would've broken a time Alex is Joe Manchin doing this just for his own politics for his own re election this November I\nIt's a little hard to say with Joe mansion or I mean I should say first of all that he didn't show a ton of a backbone here he he put out his statement according Kevin uh literally minutes after ... came off the Senate floor so he's not\nFifty fifty which is the ... vote because the vice president Mike Pence can break the tie he's fifty one so it was already basically done and when he came out uh but yeah I think part of it is is certainly as reelection but we'll we'll have to wait and see what Joe Donnelly in uh Indiana\nDoes because he's also in a in a tough state\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota state justice Trump is West Virginia just about said that she is a no so I I think there's you know other stuff going on here or with Joe mansion and it it's kind of from people who have been close to him that I've talked to\nKind of seemed like from day one that he wanted to get to a yes and was just looking for a way uh\nTo get there but needless to say he has infuriated a lot of people on the left which she has shown do and I'm seeing a lot of people are on Twitter a lot of liberals on Twitter ... who did switch parties or that they hope he loses in November which I think they probably were cut saying uh if it actually had tax bill and more importantly\nYou know regardless of how you look at individual he he it's targeted for control of\nThe Senate and so you know one senator is a big deal for control of the Senate and so you know one senator is a big deal or when it comes when you have a fifty one forty nine Senate breakdown like we do so you need him to keep either McConnell out of power to keep that margin\nSmall and you know West Virginia has no right having a democratic center that Trump's biggest margin in the country so I I think if anything he's about as good as you can hope for a Democrat out of Washington yeah\nWe're talking to our friend Alex science wall check out his great reporting\nNBC News dot com MSNBC dot Tommy's on TV and MSNBC TV and I'm\nFollowing him on Twitter at ... sites wall the S. E. R. I. T. Z.\nW. A. L. D. S. A. sites walled on Twitter and you'll see all the great material put out by alec science Walden alec since we were doing a a one topic interview because\nThere's only one topic that anyone cares about this week\nUh you're there in Washington seeing it up close and personal we're seeing it on TV out here the hallways of the Senate all the lost millions of filled with people as protesters being arrested famous people being arrested there's a lot of rage death threats have been flying around\nAlex how bitter is the environment there especially amongst the hundred senators themselves\n[noise] it is very bitter and arm I have never really seen anything quite like I've seen a lot of anger and a lot of protesters got arrested in the capital but this week has really taken things to another level\nOr to the point that I've talked to some Trump voters who are supporters who are worried about violence and you know they're probably overeating at a little bit but I don't think they're that far off the protesters have just been button hauling senators everywhere they go\nOr they've tried to you know sneak past Capitol police which is something that we don't usually see usually they're they're more cooperative\nAnd senators have taken to being escorted a by Capitol police wherever they are going inside the complex because the way it works the capital there's the capital where they actually have to go to vote but their offices are a little bit further away so they end up having to spend a lotta time\nMoving through hallways and there have been a big tensions around this in fights around this with they've closed off as her always which\n... angry but the senators say that they really fear for for their physical safety so people are are furious a meanwhile on on both sides we've seen people donors rewarding and punishing a Centers for both ways what Heidi Heitkamp\nAnnounced that she would be a now I'm having a\nA her online donations shot through the roof from from liberals who would probably have never donated to hide it Hi Kevin the past\nAnd just now well Susan Collins was speaking there is a fund on line where you can donate to whoever emerges as Susan Collins is democratic nominee in twenty twenty and she's not even up for re election right now but they're just saving this money in a pool that will go to whoever is that the Democrat and they had to set a goal months ago to million dollars", "show_name": "Norman Goldman", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "06"}
