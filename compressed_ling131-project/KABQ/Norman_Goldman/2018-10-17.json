know\nConsider as far as we're the only going oh we're spending billions of dollars on the illegal aliens or we got an ethics problem that are going to go to one party or the other it does the

illegally\nNeighbor\nAnd there there are family detention centers\nAnd and all they had to do in some of these cases was released some of these parents keep the children together and released some of these parents and electronic monitoring\nThat was a policy under the Obama administration and they said court dates weatherman ordered them to come back I mean there there there are now\nAbout two hundred and fifty children who will never be re ... reader reunited with their parents in many cases\nThe Trump Administration says they're not eligible secondly they say that some of the parents have already been set back do their home countries leaving the children here without parents without families in detention centers and guess what\nThey may reverse that policy is that okay with you\nOr you don't think that Obama won the no he did not for a in a boat\nAnd where what would your what what did what did you do\nThe same thing they say oh he did people back he did\nHe didn't separate ... he didn't separate families let's be\nClear I don't believe that well you better look it up thanks Doug Richard Richard because I mean I\nCall me back if you think that if you got any evidence that the

he then told me that Trump was appointed by God and Daschle we shall warship town um and then it goes on to the Obama I don't know I've never heard this conspiracy that Obama was a closet

I I\nI start drinking say well ... had the guns All right see tomorrow under Stephanie Miller so\n[noise]\nIn detail Vietnam veteran honored I barbecue that Turkish officials leaked details at an\nMohammed bin Salman been photographed with him as he traveled in Paris as he traveled in Houston as he traveled in Boston they have a debt by these individuals and they are among those individuals who went in to the Saudi conflict in Turkey\nAnd they say according to the Turkish officials\nThat they were only dealing with the show he for ten minutes there was no time for an interrogation the Turkish officials say\nThat they dismembered\n... in it at one point they said that uh the guy\nWith the bones saw as the other Saudi is there to turn up their music and the radio to drown out the sounds of the bones so now this is all from Turkish officials right\n\nSo they said that then they left the same day the same two planes there was a black van that left the consulate then the individuals who went to the consulate left the same day on the same two planes\nThey knew that there was likely to be an investigation\nOf cleaning crew came man allegedly cleaning out the ... the council office and apparently now the Turks say that there is evidence\nThat they repay did a part of the ... office\nAnd so they have pretty strong evidence\nOf the murder and dismembered ... of this journalist Jamal ... pretty strong evidence and Donald Trump President Trump says that he talked with the crown prince and the king\nAnd after he did that mind you with Mike Pam pale they're meeting with them\nTrump comes up with this story\nThat it was road killers perhaps and now the story is coming out as it was all day yesterday and throughout the evening the story is coming out that the Saudis are trying to come up with this theory and this story\nThat it was an interrogation gone wrong and that he was killed in the process and apparently the term road killers was used in the conversation\nWith the king and so Trump has now repeated it the the the rope killing the rogue killing\nSo now that the heat is on Donald Trump and Republican members of the Republican Party countries that we're in now that they are demanding a thorough investigation\nDonald Trump is saying here we go again he's making an excuse\nFor the Saudi regime Trump says here we go again you know you're guilty until proven innocent says I don't like that and then he went on then he went on to compare this incident\nWith the Senate Judiciary hearing of justice Brett Kavanaugh Trump said this is a quote we just went through that with justice Kevin Oh and he was innocent all the way as far as I'm concerned\nHe is giving cover toward the regime and Saudi Arabia they have promised a thorough investigation the Turks have all of this\nFrom Asian and they are the ones releasing the information they're even talking about conversations and the constantly the ... the great details of this murder are gruesome I should say this alleged murder but I don't think there's any doubt right I don't think there's any doubt whatsoever\n\nThat the Saudis murdered ... or had him murdered and member of many of the those\nWho were among those Fifteen who journeyed to assemble\nAnd went into that Saudi council that are members of the Saudi royal guard members of the security force okay\nAnd Donald Trump Donald Trump no no no\nGuilty until proven innocent I don't like that another excuse another ... all because he has this arms deal he says a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal\nWhat is our record as America on human rights were what is what how do we if we go along\nAnd and and you make excuses\nFor the Saudi kingdom and for the Saudi king and crown perhaps\nHow do we as a country face other brutal best bits other rooted dictators if we're going to make excuses for the for the for the Saudi kingdom and Saudi crown prince\n...\nDoes that embolden other dictators like Kim Jong on like president G. like like ... D work day\nDoes it\nI think it's a terrible terrible\nDecision by this White House by this administration to forgive such a gruesome murder\nAnd suggests that oh they're going to do a thorough investigation we can condemn them now that's just like condemning Brett Kavanaugh when he was innocent that's the opinion of President Trump that's just ridiculous just ludicrous\nThere's a lot to talk about but I Want to continue on got a couple of other subjects before we open up the phone lines let's take a break and come back with those subjects [noise]\nI ...

Bush kissing cheeks ... elderly side in two thousand and five\nYear old son didn't he also hold hands with him\nWhat did they also hold hands with him right\nAt the end he must have been kissing cheeks of these people for ages the Bush is doing it over and over again\nAnd we we don't have the guts ... well after our real enemies we make up some like poor Afghanistan and raid and invade Iraq for no reason whatsoever and have a hundred and sixty eight thousand remained both men and women and hospitals will never get out of bed again ... ...\nAnd all we let ourselves a fall behind this issue when we should be way out in front because the Republican ... destroy this country they let that George W. Bush go into the middle east and rule on all of that Syria is a math going wrong or can grow food for itself\nOut in the middle east is a mess and no wonder people are fleeing from they're trying to go somewhere else where they can live in peace but no we have to uh kept down all are are immigrants and said that we don't want to take any more people when we call all the problems in the middle east and the first place and in many instances all over the world for\nHelping the gangs and south and Central America a takeover every country down there and we've done nothing about sit back\nAnd let them get richer and richer [noise]\nUh and and your abs ... are are the main enemy and we should be going after them now but this\nLittle uh a overgrown pilot meet in the White House hasn't got the guts go after them because you know too much money as well well and we have to think twice about this how many interests and\nOur country have they got their claws into I understand that Sun Valley a Silicon Valley olive at University College is a hospital's everything under the sun Saudis have invested in if you go to war with them we have to make sure we can live without their oil and and all of their money\nMaybe we should be doing like Obama did ah to the Russians and a freeze all their assets all over the country and not let them have any money that's in our area\nBut I don't think that would work in assistance ... off but we should be making headlines over this over and over again so that by November six people see what the ads they've gotten the White House\nI'm with you Diane thank you very much for that I appreciate that sentiment I think you're right I think that we\nUnder this administration have so rendered our leadership on the national stage\nWe used to be viewed\nWhat was it Reagan called us the shining city on the hill that's the way many folks I I assume some still do but now we have a president who goes to the United nations and this laughed at\nRemember that we have surrendered our values to the best parts of this country of this world to the dictators did the strong man and we have bad\nRelations with those people who were always our closest allies such as prime minister do in Canada\n\nThat's the long lasting effects of this administration Jeff from Illinois you're on the line and let's talk to you what's up\nHey Jeff how you doing I'm doing well\nYeah I just wanted to know let's say a lot more difficult to house and defend that and not allow that more calm with some and document on undoing out shot she get you get back in the house and Senate one holdout than just the city for them to sit and watch what's up with all\nThat well now that that's an interesting point first of all if the Democrats take control of the house the impeachment\nProceedings starts in the house however he would have to be convicted by at least sixteen members in the Senate and I don't think that's going to happen but\nTo your point I don't know what would happen if it got before the Supreme Court because you know justice Kavanaugh\nIn his in his writings has has suggested\nThat that that the president shouldn't be subpoenaed to president shouldn't be investigated the president shouldn't be called before a grand jury et cetera et cetera\nWhile he's still president and the question is Donald Trump is advocated a pardon for himself if he should get impeached or if he should get indicted questionnaires goody pardon himself\nShould he be charged in a criminal case should he be charged with collusion I don't know the answer because now it's uncertain because now you have a conservative majority in the U.S Supreme Court I just don't know Jeff you raise a good point\nYeah I don't so I just wanted to know a lot of this country they allow somebody like it or not Mitch McConnell yeah oh yeah the guy the guy and making decisions for their future\nThen she'll get up and down the state because he's got it for them you should not allow people to be good for you okay go vote and they could make a decision\nWell thanks Jeff thanks for that call and thanks for that Senate look it all boils down to the election we can't stop people from serving in the legislature as long as people\nDo really legally\nElect them what we can do is keep them out of leadership but we can't do any of that if we don't have control of the levers of power that's why it is crucial\nTo have control of at least one house of the legislature that's why this mid term election is so important you're talking about the youth I think they use in this country is an earlier caller suggested are on the move\nI really do I think they're on the move I think you know David hogging others from Parkland and all across the country they are very concerned about the violence in this country and they want to change and and they've been out marching and they haven't seen any movement toward reform\nSo now the deceptive them go to the polls ... at it as it it's it's up to the young people you can vote you can vote when you're Seventeen\nSo long as you will be Eighteen by the time the next president's term starts\nYou need to vote and I I think I think they've gotten the message I think they really have I worry about complacency that concerns me you're talking about you're talking about a Mitch McConnell I got to tell you we talked about this yesterday I'm coming back to your calls\nBut I Want to tell you something\nYou know the deficit grew last year under Donald Trump\n\nAs a ... Seventeen percent under Donald Trump in one year so what's the answer well let me tell you what the Republicans think the answer is we talked about this yesterday\n\nThe GOP we have a one point nine million or ... one point nine trillion dollar added to the national debt one point nine trillion dollars added to the national debt\nSo what Mitch McConnell said you know what the problem is the problem is spending spending on what Social Security Medicare\nBloomberg News asked McConnell about the boom and the deficit the explosion in the deficit does Donald Trump's first fiscal year\nMcConnell said this is a quote it's very disturbing and it's driven by these three biggest in titled the programs that are very popular\nMedicare Social security and Medicaid Mitch McConnell is blaming the deficit the boom and the deficit\nNot on the tax cuts not on the tax cuts that that that contributed to our deficit of course he's blaming it on the spending on what he calls entitlement programs that's a quote from him\n\nIt's driven by three very popular programs he says Medicare Social security and Medicaid and he says it's disappointing but it's not a Republican problem will be back after this more of your calls\nBut I don't think we ought to be in the same category as Don winding\nDown it isn't because the Donald slap labels on these people to belittle them they had nothing to do with their true orientation their background or a personality well he did what what this is\nThis is just a you know qualifying him and for what he is who he is\nOkay nicotine was thank you I

tactics of Donald Trump and began referring to him\nSimilar fashion as he refers to his political enemies I think it's a sign of ignorance to be honest with you I think it's a tactic to hide his inadequacies I think what the Democrats have to do this guy this guy is as nice as cystic is egotistical\nAnd you have to attack his superiority complex you know he likes praise and he can't stand it when when you you make him feel inferior so that's what you've got to do you get to demonstrate to the public and and to get him\nBy by proving his inferiority proving that he's not worthy to be ...\nDoes it end of the United states you have to find that in messaging\nAnd that's really how did he attack Donald Trump you don't attacking by getting down on his level and started to call names at least in my opinion I don't know many of you may have a difference of opinion I wanted to give you some other good news by the way we're talking about the mid term elections\nBoy the Democrats are doing so well with their fundraising Politico has a story about it it says are talking about challenges around the country sixty one Democrats raised over one million dollars\nFifty one House Republicans were out raised at least two to one according to Politico Seventy one percent Republicans were outspent by their challengers only five Democratic House incumbents were out raised\nYou get that Republicans are being outraged by the Democrats two to one thirty three Republican representatives according to Politico have less cash on hand then their democratic challengers thirty three Republicans and here's what's happening\nThe the Republican leadership council or congressional leadership council or whatever they call it are the national Republican campaign committee they're starting to cut off a number of people\nThey're starting to say we can't handle this we cannot raise the Democrats we can't continue to fund you they're basically saying to some of these Republican candidates from whom they are withdrawing funds your loser you've lost sorry about that [laughter] [noise]\nThat makes the Democrats very happy but the Democrats are doing very well money is flowing to them and that should tell you how people feel about these midterm elections that should give you some indication of the interest in these midterm elections\nThe ... Democrats are out raising the Republican candidates and many of these house races two to one\nAnd why not why not you have a massage in this line president a guy who's been covering up for the Saudis because he's making money personally from the south easy selling them condos\nThey they're investing in his businesses they're staying it is oh tells he bragged about it in the past said they're great people great people to do business with\nThey give a hundred million dollars to the United states to help with the Syrian refugee problem when does the same time they have their own war in Yemen where in thousands of people in Yemen are starving\nWhy shouldn't we be contributing to the Democrats why shouldn't they be raising the Republican candidates the Republican candidates had been sitting on their hands all of this is happening\nAre higher Republicans being torn down by the cult of Trump and his time we took it back and we have to do that starting with these midterm elections\nLet's go back to the calls I let me give me the number again Danny your own but let me let me give it a number of first\nUh eight eight eight\nThree two one six oh one eight eight eight three two one six oh one lines are now open if you want to get in on this conversation wherever you happen to be listening let's go to Danny from Chicago Danny still with us either\nHey yeah so I wanted to just first off Thanks This is my first time ever calling us they hired I started listening to started listening actually a couple of months ago I was a recommendation I now I'm an avid listener but I'm\nGreat and backing for what's your do so anyways I mile point was I wanted to kind of touch on a couple callers ago when they were talking about what happens if\nIf we take control of the house and Senate and or what the impeachment proceeding would be like a ... I don't understand from a Republican stamp when I'm not Republican out but the best strategy wise I feel like they are they're not very ... they're pretty good strategy typically overall and message I don't\nGet as well I don't get as why are they not like at this point like kind of separating from Trump because he is clearly a sinking ship I mean regardless of his stance or political ability or whatever you know like Seventy two I Believe is is that correct\nYeah but what you're saying I why aren't they separate\nOn it right I mean I mean overall like he is I mean he can make a two terms on a McDonald's die I don't think he can make and without the inside I just want ... standpoint and honestly not fit for for being in an office I mean\nWhy not after the midterms even if we do retain the Senate or ups are even if they retain a Senate like why wouldn't they try to rally behind maybe ... should have to try to save their their income twenty twenty that's my question\nWell because because they're benefiting from this look they're the ones that passed the tax break with Donald Trump's help without Donald Trump we wouldn't have this corporate tax break and that's what it is make no mistake it's a corporate tax break\nYou know very ... and and the deficit is booming they they are afraid that he will campaign against them in their districts\nYou know I mean ... there's a lot of districts around the country where Trump beat Hillary Clinton by sizable margins and those districts are up for grabs and the people are afraid that Donald Trump campaigned against\nThem just that simple I think they sold their cells I think it's I think it's office over country I don't think they they they realize what they're doing to our republic but that's my view\nNo absolutely I think that's like a ... on it's just a if there's one guy on the mass [laughter] yeah so\nIn other words the Social Security trust fund is a creditor of the national debt\nWe owe the Social Security money the trust fund money that it was when they retire or bombed one of the treasury bonds that's how we pay benefits so it doesn't contribute to the debt but what the Republicans want to do is if they cut Social Security\nThey don't have to retire those bonds as quickly\nWhich means they have more money\nTo try and pay off the big fill up the big all of that that they created with the tax cuts\nSo in other words what they're really doing is feeling the social money from the Social Security trust fund to pay off the national debt when actually\nNational dissociate three I suppose to be paying that ... they're not supposed to trust fund the creditor of the national debt they're making it go the other way if they don't have to pay off the bond as fast they'll have extra cash on that just like if you don't pay your bills right\nIf you don't pay your bills you are an extra money in your pocket that pay off a bookie seemed to me yeah well that's what they're that's what their plan as\nYour caller i._d. didn't fall is can be and they have now become beholden to this carnival barking\nUm I don't know what they're calling me the carnival Barker he used to do their bidding and now he's got hold of them and they can't get out of it they're basically their drug addicts they're the same thing they're drawback drug addicts and there'll be holding them he pushed her\nTo do your point Medicare and Social Security is snow funded\nYeah Medicare and Medicaid goes ... wrote a book according to the analysis is due to the underlying health care rising costs\nAs it is to the country's aging population the rising healthcare costs and Medicare has done a better job controlling that underlying cause than most private insurance is insurance part\nAs a matter of fact the VA is actually even done better than I ever actually actually has a lower ... that's called a medical loss ratio that's also known as an overhead Medicare has a Ninety seven percent overhead\nNinety Ninety ...
