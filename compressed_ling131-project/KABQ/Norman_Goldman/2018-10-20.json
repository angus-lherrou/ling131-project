case\nAnd I have trouble believing that this was actually happening\nThat appears the highest reaches of the Saudi Government intentionally plotting to assassinate murder brutally one of their own citizens inside their own consulate on foreign soil in Turkey and\nA ... job you went in there he didn't come out at least not alive there's all kinds of evidence in their lives and different admissions Nikki backtracking\nWell now it's obviously it seems to me that from my perspective we have corruption everywhere the Saudis own Trump and so we use in their pocket and Alex ... you're in Washington and how is this how is this playing in Washington [noise]\nWell this has gotten a tremendous amount of attention and it's really dominated the news and conversation here all week\nAnd people are are not ready to tell to let it go I think part of that is because it's a evolves the press so you have the press corps which already feels very much a threatened by this administration and the larger\nKind of climate that Trump and helped create\nAnd then you also have the foreign policy community which new cars show he well he was a a exile\nOr or self self exile but but I just sit in\nAnd day are very animated by this and they have a long standing beef with tremendous passion to and thinking that he's too soft and too cozy with the stick to ... like a Saudi Arabia and Russia\nSo I've been actually surprised at how much support has been running around this and and how unwilling the mystery has been to just kind of do the most basic expectations of any US President and you know saying this is a is a U.S resident he's a journalist to let's get to the bottom of this Trump is to shown no real interest in that no\nEven ... even the lip service to getting to the to the bottom is basically just given the entire benefit of the doubt to the Saudis here who have denied it\nAnd it's a fascinating kind of moment that a ... you know he he says the Saudis deny it they strongly denied so therefore\nI I have to believe them when Vladimir couldn't says he doesn't enact the elections Trump says he says you can I really strongly denies that I Believe that when Brett Kavanaugh says I didn't much anyone or or harass anyone in in high school he says he denied it I I Believe that when Roy Moore says he didn't do that with teenage\nGirls Donald Trump says I Believe it and yet when rock up I don't know as I was I was born in this country Trump doesn't believe it when\nYou know Hillary Clinton says she she didn't use costs animation or email he doesn't believe it and and so on and on and so it it's just an incredible moment about you know who Trump sees as his people and and he will\nBasically believe even the most obvious why he will believe it at taken at face value hook line and sinker meanwhile for somebody who doesn't like for whatever reason who often uh you know there's certain demographic characteristics that those people often are there's not that you can do\nTo get him to believe that the cold hard fact\nIt's really amazing that an American president is so beholden to foreign interests that are we are seeing this spectacle now and uh Bob Corker the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair retiring senator Republican from Tennessee is nowhere to be\nThese complicit all the Republicans are why it this is really amazing Lindsey Graham on a week ago said there'll be hell to pay and now he's out there apologizing it's really shameful and now it's following up on on that I'm On the heels of them we have Trump last night in Montana encouraging violence and celebrating violence\nA a sitting Republican congressmen the guy named Jim forte beat up a a reporter and Donald Trump\nSaid it was good and encourage and everybody was cheering Alex To me this is a distraction these trying upset people uh it's pure tactic but everybody's going forward so Alex it does send a bad example I mean having a guy who claims to be president St Louis beat up reporters and\nUse violence to advance our political Jenna not not an American thing I mean definitely not an American\nIt's not it's not a democratic thing I mean it's a it's a ... of the basic premise\nOf democracy is that we work our conflicts out\nThrough the political process in so that we don't have violence as the entire purpose of this that we don't have a a a a dictator or any kind of autocrat who uses violence to get their way and that we don't have\nYou know a mob rule or a street battles between various factions we have a system where peacefully people can make their voices heard and conflicts I worked out so this is ... it's really dangerous stuff\nAnd I think going after yeah reporter you know the the they put it in the the First Amendment for a reason the very first one and it's a ... this is something that you know bridge that Trump is not cross before even though he has said everything else enemies of the people\nTo about ... about reporters he has never actually explicitly condemning the violence against our border and that's I I've been to a lot of Trump rallies when they scream at us they yell at us and it's a little scary a knock knock on the line and this you know who knows somebody I don't think he's telling people to do this but somebody who\nIs maybe a little bit off a little bit you know prone to violence for whatever reason that they have their own issues somebody could take that and see the president United States and see that as a go ahead a green light to to go ahead and do this and um [noise] you know it's it's not good
