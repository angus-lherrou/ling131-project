development in the case of a missing Washington Post columnist correspondent Clarissa war\nSaudi Arabia is preparing a report in which they will acknowledge that Jamal ... she was killed in the Saudi conflicts that it was not intentional that it was the result of essentially a botched operation a a a botched interrogation\nI mean Trump was asked about this today right so he was asked about Elizabeth Warren taking this DNA test\nAnd he said and I quote who cares right so he denied that he ever made the pledge to donate a million dollars um for a a to a charity for Elizabeth Warren proving this to be true\nAnd then he says essentially who cares right so he's he's essentially blowing her off right from the start here so\nThe question is okay I step into this free right now right why why of all times is Elizabeth Warren bringing this particular issue up if she knows that the attacks are never going to stop\nAnd she knows that she's going to continue to be called Pocahontas or focus on us and Trump is never going to pay that million dollars and I think you're right it's it's about elevating her stature\nI'm amongst democratic hopefuls for twenty twenty or it's about getting her name in the news next to Donald Trump sort of raising her up\nTo that presidential level and I will say this and this happened a just a couple of minutes ago um [noise] the ah the Cherokee Nation issued a statement and this this happened in the last hour so this is new\nThe Cherokee issue a nation issued a statement about this Elizabeth Warren DNA test\nAnd they said er and I quote a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship\nOr current DNA tests do not even distinguish between a person's ancestors with if they were indigenous to North or South America Cherokee Nation goes on for a little bit but the bottom line here as they say Senator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continued claims\nOf tribal heritage what's what's your take on that response\nAh I'd verse off wonder if the Cherokee Nation made some sort of a deal if you see a lot of really nice cars driving around the Cherokee Nation or you know I Wonder if ah if that will be indicative of\nOf them making a deal to to make a statement like this uh but I I think that it hurts Elizabeth Warren I mean I don't think it's good news for her um you know again with the DNA tests um conclusively prove\nAncestry I'm not sure I did a twenty three and me and I wound up has I think a two percent Icelandic are I you know I kind of assumed that it might or might not be accurate I don't know when the Icelandic relatives that I've got so um I don't know I mean I\nI'm I I don't know exactly what what she stood to gain here it seemed like it was to get the DNA tests and to announce the results it almost seemed like it was um a response um you know like she was she was coming out in response to what Trump and the conservatives have been saying for so long so\nBut I'm struggling to find 'em the benefit for her aside from you know kind of a short term media ... because you're going to see her leading off on all the national news you're going to see her on all the national or websites are but how long does it less and um you know what's the next move what does she\nHow can she leverage this or to continue um you know the national name recognition keeping her name and these these news stories in days to come because I kind of see this is something that maybe last a day or two and without anything additional it might just fizzle out\nThat's a great question and we we want to know what you think out there eight eight eight three two one six thousand and one give us a call we want to know is this story about Elizabeth Warren and her Cherokee heritage is this going to matter\nA come twenty twenty time is this going to be a story that continues to be in the news is this going to be oppressed pop that fades away\nYou know another thing that's that's really important especially in these last few weeks is that if you're looking to raise money if you're looking to fundraise and get those pieces in play for\nA twenty twenty a presidential campaign and and let's be clear twenty twenty starts on November seventh right we've got the midterms coming up three weeks from tomorrow and then we've got that presidential election which essentially is going to start the next day\nThis is a way for her to gain\nNational attention and potentially to bring in some of those national dollars but I I think you're right that does come with\nA little bit of danger there you're you're raising an issue that uh people are going to attack you on 'em and it's definitely an issue that the Republicans and it's not going to go away um but I think it's I think there's some some I think there are some pros there I think there's some ... there but overall I think it's a little bit of a dicey situation\nYeah I mean I I I'm Still not certain whether I think it was a good move to do this right now so I think that's a that's a good question for the audience is um I mean do you think it's a good\nMove yeah we've got folks out there I mean I I think we've got some folks out there listening in from the northeast or maybe maybe who know Elizabeth Warren a little bit better know some of her work as a senator\nYou know this is this is a pretty risky play for her to really lean into\n'em an issue like this so we're going to keep talking about this this question we've got some great guess we're going to be joining us and we want to make sure that they weigh in with us as well I'm President Trump ... we had him on sixty minutes last night talking about\nA climate change we had him responding to some of the allegations about the ... murder 'em and it seems like there's more coming out about that\nBy the minute these days so excuse me today so we're going to hear a lot about um those particular issues but\nAgain we're we're thinking about the twenty twenty presidential here um we think about all this with Warren Joe Biden obviously a name that a lot of people are talking about ... Harris do you think that this does anything this new news about the DNA\nA test does anything to change your position relative to those those other contenders\n[noise] again I mean I I don't really think so I look at this is a response to attacks that were being made against or I'm and I'm I'm struggling to find why it was necessary for to do it I don't think it gives her anything additional um it's just a response to something that was being thrown at her and um you know it's it's the type of response it's not going to stop that from continue\nMany facts right where we're talking about facts here and we've known for a while that Trump and the Republicans [noise] they're not that interested in the facts are they\nKnow I mean if if facts don't suit you you switch over to the alternative facts 'cause the alternative facts can sometimes really be where it's at\nOh yeah we we've got alternate we've got climate change going back and forth from Trump's yesterday we've got a we've got a whole number of alternative facts so um we've got a jump off to a a quick break your when we come back\nWe're going to continue talking a little bit about Elizabeth Warren or we're going to talk a little a lot about Donald Trump and we're going to keep a we're going to keep going today so thank you for tuning in this is the norm and Goldman show you've got Jake Lewis and admire her we will be right back\nOff all day thing back who is the best that didn't make any sense to me\nRespects women more than Donald Trump\nShe's married to a city wiener per [noise] [noise] yes it has to be some form of punishment thank you baby Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren is it offensive\nYou tell me oh oh really oh I'm Sorry about that\nThat can be top law on against gay marriage\nFinal game yet to find out\n[noise]\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home here dancing on the cars would be covered have talked to farmers we know one thing or two because we've seen a thing or two we\nAre\nUnder it and I find me ... let me say this season one ...\nCan make a world of difference that you can protect yourself and you're talking co workers how plea neighbors\nTwo month old nice loving specially trained pharmacists but it provided over six million police onto the thousand ten at night for your flu shot today with a zero dollar company with most insurance because protecting the world starts with protecting you are\nI just don't see it makes her look strong at all I don't know what her like you guys are saying I don't know what her endgame is with the yeah and you know ... a month or so ago she released um\nUh some papers that talked about how she was admitted in Harvard and it was it was all of merit\nYeah uh she does need a special treatment and\nKnow Richard you're right you're you've got the topic exactly right so we're going to keep talking about this question Elizabeth Warren was that DNA tests the right move Irma not move or not on the norm in gold man show\nMuch think about ... percent it by liberty mutual insurance\nLiberty mutual customize your auto insurance so you only pay for what you need some wire\nMore things in life customize\nTwice in a burger cheaper when you ask for no one\nTo shouldn't you duck the price of the onion right otherwise I'm paying for the onions but I'm not receiving [noise]\nGo to liberty mutual dot com for a customized quoting you could say\nThat the\nCoverage has underwritten by liberty mutual insurance company ... equal housing\nSeason one long green sleeves I can make a world of difference you can protect yourself and your co workers helpfully having neighbors two month old nice\nLoving specially trained pharmacists said it provided over sixty million police on two thousand and five for your flu shot today with a zero dollar company with ... because protecting the world starts with protecting you are plump green just if it's nice you know one\nThing that just sort of dirty the Asian health related restrictions may pie\nHey though a hero minerals casinos where they've they've ah holidays or what's\nGoing on I think I Want to leave the kitchen where I've been cooking green chili cheeseburger embryos into law didn't come out and say Hi to cousins in a while\nI like to do that but I think out here who have you any ... year well loved rap fix downtown San ...

us we've got Bryan strike or from a algae research Brian thank you for so much for coming on with us yeah thanks for having me Brian tell us a little bit before we we dive into some of these races your tells a little bit about some of the work that that you've doing this year and what you've done in the past\nSure I work for a polling from algae researches you mentioned in my partner there uh we do polling for candidates for oh a anywhere down from President we worked for Obama down to the city council and everyone between working this year a lot of a U.S Senate governors house races things like that\nSo let's start let's start at the Senate levels because I think we all saw over the last month that these Kavanaugh hearings just how critical the Senate races are\nGive us a sense of how you're feeling about the Democrats' chances to take back the Senate this year and maybe one or two of these races that we especially need to keep an eye on going into these last few weeks\nYeah I mean I think you saw with that\nHaving a hearing a couple of things happening in a lot of people especially a and very Republican states I'm tended to activate the culture wars in ways that maybe isn't so good for Democrats\nUm but uh still have a real sort of fighting chances in um Indiana Montana and Missouri states that were pretty hard for us on us you know read versus blue field but have really good candidates\nI'm there may be others I'm forgetting on top of my head but those are sort of the states where\nI'm a you know the question is we've got to hold everything uh in the Democratic column then try and pick up two seats if we want to take the Senate um our best to pick up opportunities are Nevada and Arizona so ah the question is can we hold all of those or can we sort of go into sort of deeper territory find a Texas a Tennessee something like that and ah\nAnd ah and maybe even make up for losing one\nThat's a that's a good point I mean I've been watching it I look every day at the state by state polio the Senate races\nUm and it seems like states that were maybe a little bit more competitive a week or two ago I'm like ah is it North Dakota and um Texas even seems like um Republicans are making some incremental gains day by day in those states so um I mean\nIf if there was some sort of um you know a blue wave that led to a little bigger turnout or better performance or from the Democrats um I mean I've heard talk that or if that's going to happen it's going to be led by women sort of as a response to some of these uh Kevin hearings\nUm you know do you think that that's possible have you seen anything in in other polling that would indicate that uh you know the the the female voters might be at the forefront of a blue wave that stronger than we're expecting\nYeah and I think I'm part of it as maybe segment thing off a North Dakota where or West Virginia where even female voters are very Republican writer pretty pro Trump um versus a more swing sort of house district or even like in Arizona and Nevada where where women\nAre lean democratic um but I certainly think you could see even in the states that look tougher for us if more women vote that's good especially more college educated women tend to be such a good group for us and if they are more activated and you change the composition of even the female electorate\nAre more women of color especially in Arizona Nevada where in Texas where they're pretty significant portion of the population but tendency to\n'em that could that could certainly affect the balance\nOn uh you you were talking about women of color and I'm I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on the reports of some of the um you know states like\nIndiana Georgia um Texas where they're talking about the voter rolls being purged um and the purchase impacting um people of color most heavily of have you heard much on that or I mean would it be what what are your thoughts on some of those reports\nI [noise] I I'm not working directly in any of the states where it's been um as well Indiana some um but I I think that look it's a big deal right and I think that that there's a reason that Republicans are doing it because they think it's to their ... advantage in it is\nUm and it said another reason why I think which is a sort of different uh topic but governors' races are really important to me have a ton of 'em up this year ton pickup opportunities which has\nTwenty twenty impact right if you're looking at and Ohio or I'm In Arizona or Georgia which we feel would be sort of states we need to move back to us or does or does or important that the state policies really matter on the federal level\nYeah so connect that a little bit more for us here so\nMaybe you're in a state and the there is an election for governor right now or maybe it's not a very close election why should you still care about some of these gubernatorial elections that are happening around the country and and connect those dots with us from a governor's election in twenty Eighteen to the presidential in twenty twenty and beyond yeah I mean I think\nI'm a\nThere's two ... two reasons one is right to vote ... if you look at a state like Illinois I'm where we're able to pass automatic voter registration you see it in a an Oregon or in California where you have a lot more expensive voter laws easier access to mean Democrats generally do better when more people are able to vote so they're sort of\nPartisan benefits as well as just I mean morally who you just want people to be able to vote right um but there are partisan benefits of where maybe I wouldn't care about the Georgia or Florida governor's race as much because it's sort of policies that don't affect me well actually it kinda does when it comes to electing a president or a senator who is ever going to make laws in whatever state urine\nOr and then the other pieces redistricting I mean we're all talking about the house math is hard for us and it's so gerrymandered well one of the main places that happens that the governor's level so for example were working for I'm a graduate murder in Michigan or running for governor\nA race looks good but you know you never want us you know we feel optimistic but they're anything can happen it's long ways off um but ah that state uh votes in almost every year more for Democrats than Republicans on the house races but there are nine or nine ... nine Republican\nMembers of Congress and only for Democrats because what you have is the map has been drawn to really benefit so if you get some Democrats in the governor's mansion if you get some Democrats in the state legislature\nOr you can balance some of that out and some of those Ohio's of the world where I think it's twelve foreign Ohio despite being pretty split that that could have make the map just ... you could add twenty democratic seats without without anything just drawn maps more fairly\nSo it sounds like if you're if you're certainly in a couple of states on election night to watch especially for these governors races and it sounds like Florida's in their Georgia's in their Michigan or are there any other ones that that you're paying special attention yeah\nI'm In a place like Indiana where Trump won by Twenty years or a North Dakota one by twice that um but then in the in the house where it's the swing areas tend to be more educated tend to be more suburban\nUm if anything it might have worked against them a little bad against against Republicans and sort of led to some democratic uh interests and the thing that remains to be seen is\nA it's hard to get excited and go vote about something that you already got a which is where Republicans are and maybe that vote happened for weeks to early as far as a you know excited the base type of thing\nUm but I don't get the sense that Democrats are forgetting about it anytime soon so you'd be hard to see how it's going to play out but it could be the Democrats advantage\nBut there are any other issues that are that you're seeing 'em that are really motivating Democrats a sustained motivation to get up to the ... yeah I mean the funny thing about the cabinet issue in the in a sort of a campaign sense is um\nYou haven't seen a democratic or Republican campaign really run an ad on it maybe one or two but compared to the amount of TV that's on healthcare for example on both sides frankly I mean we were working in\nA in Iowa and central I owe a for a woman Cindy Axne he's running for Congress against an incumbent David Young this is an Obama plus three district at Trump plus three districts have classic swing\nI'm and we're running out to talking about him getting protections for people with preexisting conditions he's running ads saying that he actually has stood up for people with preexisting conditions you know just a contrary to any evidence right um so this is sort of the battle is of that race\nUm we're also seeing a attacks has to be an issue where normally Democrats were just sort of get pounded on it but a given the Republican tax plan it's actually a\nA kind of neutral ground or maybe a slight democratic advantage on it and then one other thing I Would highly ... especially in more blue collar areas especially in the areas that swung to Trump\nAnd and the question of you know we've all been over there were Democrats sort of reaching out to a blue collar voters enough but one thing that we found a this year that has been very effective and talking to folks just talking about\nA job training skills training trade school classes you know shop classes and a and wellbeing and you know a whole bunch of sort of different\nThings that might uh give people that aren't going to college a career path and ability that you know class job in a in a family and all that so um those are some of the things we're seeing actually discussed on the ground in campaigns much more than you see a cabinet or a you know whatever Trump's latest tweet us or whatever\n[noise] and so we were talking a little bit earlier about Elizabeth Warren and some of the twenty twenty ... I I Know that uh were three weeks away from three weeks in a day away from election day twenty Eighteen\nBut uh I got to ask did you see the news about Elizabeth Warren releasing this DNA video and and what's your take on on her trying to get ahead of the story\nI mean I saw a five minutes of it on I saw five minutes of a few tweets you know I mean I'm kind of drought and twenty Eighteen a little bit but I'm a you know from what I saw and correct me if I'm wrong she did a DNA test suggested there was a percentage of small percentage of her DNA\nIt was Native American um I mean obviously she's been getting hit on this issue by Trump I don't know how recently um but I think that there's probably a an attempt to take this issue off the table a\nTiring to be seen how effective that is I don't know how much she sort of was that I guess I don't know how much she was trying to win one particular day I'm not sure I Do any of that or just get this backed out there maybe in a time when it's not going to be talked about as much and it's going to be she can come back to that um\nYou know I I I think that uh ultimately she's got a lot going for herbicides this sort of debate I think she's going to be a super strong candidate in in Iowa and New Hampshire familiar where she's you know I'm a represents the right next door\nUm I think this ultimately will be a pretty small piece of the of the pie when you talk about her um\nHer appeal to give us give us some of those those toppling contenders that you're seeing for twenty twenty I mean we were talking a little bit about Biden obviously Elizabeth Warren\nA couple of Harris Cory bookers in that discussion give us some other names that you see and maybe some of the people that you've heard from some of the work you're doing around the country or that are in that kind of top list group for twenty twenty\nYeah I mean I think you've got a lot of people with a lot of name id kinda covered I think that uh there's a sort of\nQuestion of of um you know are there are there sort of other candidates out there that can catch fire because we've seen a Bernie Sanders should have had no money he should have had no but then all of a sudden right it just sort of explodes and you can kind of put bronco bombing that same place um\nI think that uh uh you covered most of it but I think there's one going to be a question of are some of these more red state types the Steve bullock of the world that even a shared brown from Ohio right this sort of represented tough area\nThere's a natural appeal if I can win these sort of voters who who who Trump took away from us\nUm and then you know I think also remains to be seen is there will be a fight to sort of get to that sort of true progressive lane of the primary in ... in that that person doesn't always sort of they can come out of nowhere some time so I don't I don't know who that is yet but I'm kind of interested to see\nWe've got we've got three weeks in a day till election day twenty Eighteen and then as we were saying before the twenty twenty campaign starts November Seventy\nI mean there is not going to be a any break there isn't going to be any downtime so I think you're going to see these twenty twenty candidates I mean it's it's starting starting today it started already but I think you're going to see some of these these folks start to you know throw a little bit of an elbow here and there and make those trips to Iowa make those trips to some of those early states\nUm in terms of the issues that you're saying I mean are we are we going to be talking about health care and taxes basically through twenty twenty or do you see other issues that may start resonating especially when you get to that presidential level\nYeah I mean I think healthcare is going to be really the key of this thing is sort of one how do you fight back especially in a general election or how do you how do you do to\nProtect people's coverage and then expand from there\nI think there will be somewhat of a debate on single payer versus public option versus expand Obamacare I think those differences among voters a little more muted than people might\nThink Democrats just generally want to expand health care and they're kind of open to different ways of doing it I'm a I think immigration will certainly play a role in a Democratic primary just given a especially when you get into a state like Nevada which is pretty early on 'em but but overall\nUm and then I think there were also be sort of questions of Trump an investigation and all that sort of stuff that will be uh you can't get away from it in a primary especially right\nYou can't get away from any of this stuff came I mean we've got we've got twenty Eighteen coming up\nWe've got twenty twenty immediately after that uh Brian thank you so much for for coming in and sharing some of your wisdom with us we are so excited to see to watch some of these races going on in these different places around the corner I I didn't know much about what was happening with that Michigan gubernatorial race so I'm excited to hear more about that\nI think I Am thank you so much this is the norm in Goldman show we'll be right back\n[noise] [noise]\nNow's the time to make a difference now the\nNow's the time to do much\nTo offer a helping\nNow's the time to volunteer to raise a hammer and drive and [noise] now's the time to build a wall that\nNow's the time to open a door to a new law and health may come true\nNo time to help habitat for humanity ville hope and change lives with a family and your community\nNow the time\nEver\nVisit habitat that or [noise]\nYour music popular topics at that particular price death is that now I'm ... show\nCalled Alan death Saturday change of heart I'm In Saint Paul Allen who cofounded Microsoft in Nineteen Seventy five with his childhood friend Bill Gates has died at the age of sixty five earlier this month Allen said the cancer that he was treated for almost a decade ago non Hodgkin's lymphoma had returned\nThe issues that voters care about especially in some of these more swing areas\nYou're talking healthcare ... you're talking to health care for ... with for people with preexisting conditions you're talking about the economy and not just oh things are rip roaring for people at the very top of the food chain but our wages growing\nFor middle class Americans the answer to that is no they're not um are the jobs that people finding are they good jobs the answer that for too many people is no so I I understand that concern you know about some of these flashy headlines that are coming out and and\nI don't necessarily disagree about this Elizabeth Warren is but when you get down into\nWhat the issues are that are going to motivate people for twenty twenty and like brand Hussein and the guy brain does not talk unless he has informed by the numbers that he is seeing that and that's one of the reasons that we wanted to bring him on the show he's seeing numbers that showed that voters trust Democrats more\nIn swing areas when it comes to health care and when it comes to the economy and that's going to be good for Democrats for years to come\nI think that's right and uh one of the things that the president will often point to is look at the stock market the economy is roaring and I think that those two statements um aren't necessarily inner connected in the stock market up until last week was doing very well because I don't think that that means is the economy overall is doing well especially for\nFor folks who are I'm looking at their job security get a little bit less secure or earning a little bit less watching their benefits or degrade over a year over year over year\nUm you know and so despite all this news of the economy doing so well and despite how well someone's four oh one K. might be doing if you're thirty thirty five forty years old you like to see the four oh one K. or your your retirement account is doing well\nUm but right now that doesn't matter because what you're worried about is um is my income going to go out to cover the cost of living next year and back there for so many people\nIf you can hold the line um and just stay even year over year that's a win because\nFor the you know for the the last two decades or more um you know the cost of living we haven't been able to hold up with it um you know and so those are the issues that I think drives people\nTo the polls I've got my own very strong opinions on um you know the justice Kevin hearings and many of the other front page issues um but I Can't say that they're necessarily the make or break issues that are that are informing my vote I think that there are a lot of Americans a lot of Americans like that that are are more concerned about\nUm health care and um you know rising inequality and and things like that and so you know I'm very encouraged to hear what Brian had to say especially about the house um you know that he feels fairly secure um that Democrats are looking well looking looking strong in the house and that we haven't we haven't ... too far in the Senate they're still shut their\nI'll give you one more economic indicator that Trump loves to point to that has ah that doesn't have the best connection to how people are actually feeling about their pocketbook\nAnd that's unemployment the unemployment rate in this country is down uh it's it's at lows that we haven't seen for for many years and Trump loves to talk about how that's fantastic news and that means that the economy is roaring\nYou know it it it is definitely the case at a high unemployment rate is concerning thing however in low unemployment rate does not necessarily mean that people have good paying jobs that provide them with the benefits they need to\nHave money or in a savings account in case in emergency comes up or that they have a job that has a\nHealth care that they can depend on and not we're not talking to the health care where you go to the doctor once and you're getting thousand dollar bills in the mail but real health care um that you can go and you can rely on and you can get preventative care so when you see the talk about the unemployment rate and again this is front page stuff\nUh that maybe doesn't necessarily get to what's happening out there in the suburbs in some of these swing districts this is flashy stuff\nUh it doesn't necessarily capture what people are feeling I'm at that got levels so I thank you very much for the call we've got one other person who's been holding for a long time here we want to make sure we get to the Michael in Ohio Michael are you there\nStill hair or they are hanging on like that I Am sir I Am a little later ah I'm Arizona\nAnd what's your reaction news or yeah\nOkay Elizabeth Warren I'm I'll be honest with you\nWhy didn't do this when ... percent that are being a a ... author and honesty ah most ah native nations really don't care what her status as a um has nothing to do personally\nBut your correct it really don't care about DNA at something and you know we don't do you know if you're born into it\nYou have that what what well yeah then you're accepted but most of the nation ... well not now you want to talk to you if you come up and say yeah well my great great grandfather's day and age is that\nI'm now I'm back in the nineties the Navajo Nation was warned or not to go ahead and open your answer to that guy named bill why\nOr why they're not all of a nation regarding all these donations for all these manufacturers and companies that you know came up on millions and millions of dollars none of that money ever came to the nation's yeah and I guess that's the natives\nUh we we don't know no we don't we don't want we don't want to get involved with your politics but we have to\nOkay I mean that there is a there is a very interesting ah you know a very interesting point and I guess um something that I hadn't really thought about but um do you find that um you know with with some of the natives that you're a that you that you talk with that you deal with is there um you know a partisan leaning one way or the other um you know you mentioned Bill Clinton\nUm do you find that as a result of that funding not making it to those communities um is that something that that sticks in the memories\nOf folks that you know and uh you know pushes them may be loaded our toward the right okay\nWell we're not saying we you know we need help we're not saying that what we want is helping adds up so we want we ... we don't we don't want to hand out the one hand you check it out on North Dakota\nOut there is nothing but corruption up there and it's like what do you go you got the nations that are up there you got for for all at one

right\nNow I you know I'm I'm In a job that you're you're you're absolutely right in North Dakota is one of those states that has one of these hotly contested races Michael thank you so much for the call I I think that this is a good reminder to that\nA political move like this has impact in a way that the politician or the person sending the message they may have no idea how that's going to run in a mate last longer than they ever could have guessed exactly no that's exactly right even today we had Jim Messina Obama's President Obama's twenty twelve campaign director\nUh who said on Twitter about the Elizabeth Warren announcement why can't Democrats ever stay focused\nAnd essentially argued why is this announcement happening twenty two days before a crucial elections so you're you're seeing the way that this plays out for a folks in the Native American community you're seeing the way that this plays out for progressives who are focused on the twenty Eighteen election\nI'm not really sold on why this had to happen right now\nYeah I I agree and uh you know we've got to jump off at a break a but when we come back um I think we'd like to talk a little bit more about another

Goldman show but don't sound like Norman Goldman that because uh\nBut ... and I'm here with Jake Lewis were filming in coming in for Mr Goldman ... to tone a little bit like a little bit like little bit okay\nUm we did a lot of great conversation over the last couple of hours here about some of the news of the day but right now we are very excited to get to a very very special guest or we have got Bridget early and she is the executive director of the national public pension coalition Bridget are you with us\nI Am gay the evening I get evening Jake so good to hear you guys\nDo you you know we'll go back with Bridget she's a she's a very talented woman and uh we're we're delighted to have her on the show so uh first why don't you tell us a little bit about the national public pension coalition in some of the work that you guys are doing\nGreat so the national public country in coal shed came to gather a about ... years ago right around the time when a lot of states we're struggling with how to handle 'em\nHow to figure out what to what to do with some of the unfunded liability around pension funds are and what ended up being the answer to a lot of the legislate legislative issues wise to cut benefits\nUm so you know folks from the various\nUnions that have public membership representation came together and um you know that organization was born and so our goal is to make sure that we educate and defend public ... public\nPensions for those hardworking people who you know our firefighters are nurses or teachers but like\nYou can also forget you know winter is coming the guys that file your streets I'm and saw your streets and make sure that things are safe out there that you're a you know that they have a care retirement when they finished working\nThose great budget and what you're what you're talking about\nUm you know goes so well with so conversation we were having earlier with Brian striker from ... research um where he was talking about\nUm retirement in security across America huh hum and I think that what we're seeing here um you know the the conservative or Republican led effort to kind of classified pensions\nAs a terrible thing that has to be done away with instead of or cause that has to be cut just like a line item um to be to be struck\nUm these are people's retirement that we're talking about and\nAnd when with retirement becoming that much more difficult to see if we're in America and so many fewer and fewer Americans\nAre having you know the resources to be able to retire or this this is kind of sticks out as as another kind of attack on retirement so um you know what is what's your take on sort of overall um the picture facing Americans are are Americans currently saving anywhere near enough money for retirement\n[noise] not not at all not with the is you know these plans in systems that have been put into place that are a replacement to a defined benefit plans are\nSo in a session for actually delivering retirement security for public sector workers and I mean across the board right even in the private sector you don't see a lot of people able to\nPlay a lot of money away that they would need to to then retire and not worry about um\nFinancial insecurity there was a really interesting New York times article that came out not too long ago that demonstrated to I think one of the fact\nThat correlates with the ship to four one K. is ...\nSenior bankruptcy has skyrocketed I'm a white somewhere from like maybe two three percent in the nineties up to I Want to say like Twenty one percent in the last year which may seem like a small\nNumber but that still shocked\nSuch a jump from what they were seen and that kind of a safety net has been taken away from too many workers and you know the other thing that is troubling about it is\nThe plan that are put into place afterwards at that you know thought at the cure all for maybe some state budgets are to take care of pension liability end up costing more is less efficient first date her on a defined contribution program\nTalking about the only one case which states has repeatedly said to be at the switch to four one K. plan to to save money is I Would do when you're getting it\nExactly show with the four oh one K. is what you have is so\nYou know a state decides hey if we move everyone to a four ... four one K. will save money by heart of the funding mechanisms that maintains a defined benefit plan\nOur new employees putting money into the ... and I think what we've seen a lot at stakes\nThose public employees are the only ones who have consistently given to the system where you've had legislators\nDecide oh looks like a holiday will skip the pain that you know if you're a public worker and you're having a heart meet your car breaks now or what have you and you need a little extra cash\nYou can't say oh I'm going to get my pension payment but then there are the same people who the state legislature turned around and say well we're going to have to take a little bit away of what we\nPromised when you first got hired\nUm additionally there's just some other like just interesting ramifications that have come out of\n... ... four one K. is one example but I Want to point to one of our national partners that National Institute for retirement security did a study on Palm Beach Florida and they moved their\nAh cops to a defined benefit plan thirties and defined contribution from a pension\nAnd not only did it you know a lot of free\nSo good to be back this is the norm in Goldman show but tonight you've got a motor and I'm here with Jake Louis and we are both here with Bridget early the executive director of the national public pension coalition or just before the break we were talking about are\nTalking about the the movement of the wealthy to underhanded league kind of attack the retirement of the middle class starting with public employees um and defined benefit programs but um\nYou know I think everybody should or should hear a little bit more about the folks that are behind this movement so so bridging why don't you tell us a little bit more about um you know some of the some of the culprits here\nLately faced guy and so you don't want to have that same point out at their cat you know put up by her point on what you got that I was you know when you look at ...\nAli factor is far far more against that eat at the private sector and ... another way to sort of crack pulling out I Try and get a chance go public ...\nAnd then just Jan as it's about getting at the benefits that they can potentially provide working for a while because you know you're getting the only and you're only frontline and that that was a park and they're trying to make it difficult to access\nA public and shed like that", "show_name": "Norman Goldman", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "15"}
