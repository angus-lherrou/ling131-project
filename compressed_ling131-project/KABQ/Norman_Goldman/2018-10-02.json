NAFTA but they're calling it something else\nCanada made some confessions I'm staring market a hot button issue for President Trump and the audio against American producers access to an expanded three point six percent share of Canada's domestic market and eliminate other barriers and exchange this settlement terms now and it's chapter Nineteen or main impact\nAnd they get a fashion for the Trump Administration that means and international panel will continue to settled train distance between the three countries not us court\nThat is Stephanie rule and we think MSNBC for that and this\nThis new NAFTA will be known as the U.S Mexico Canada agreement or us and say hey it sets new rules on financial services digital businesses and the auto sector starting a twenty twenty or ...\nOr or a truck last ten Seventy five percent of its components manufacturing within three countries to qualify for zero task that is for sixty two and a half percent in addition at least thirty percent and the

noticed though there will be additional dairy imports and exports from the United states and Canada both ways back\nAnd forth so the dairy men\nOh the dairy people of Wisconsin should be very happy about that the only problem is is more dairy coming in from Canada as well and the dairy industry and can is very very upset so perhaps the government of Canada\nMade some concessions on dairy but on one step of the rules talking about automobiles well if you're raising the price or you're raising the price of labor that high\nObviously Mexico is not gonna pay that they're not going to pay that so that might bring some jobs here might move some jobs to Canada but please remember it's kind of be within the three nations requiring\nMore jobs more car parts come from three nations is great Mexico was one of those Canada's one of those it Benedict Donald was trying to make this about America I I still have a lot to learn about this new NAFTA\nI'm going to be reading as much as I can about it from my first blush I don't see how it puts America First it puts the three nations together in the same trade deal and basically it's shifting things amongst themselves from what I can see so far so that's the new NAFTA\nAnd I'm not quite sure that uh it's cause for celebration\nThis is also a historic win for American manufacturers and American auto workers who have been treated so badly we've lost so many jobs over the years under NAFTA\nUh well uh you know he's all hype and hyperbole so I don't know if I'm believing anything he ever says let's go overseas what's go overseas to a\nGiant

hundred forty or dead from this earthquake and tsunami what they are still expecting a number that because there are towns in areas that were very hard really having a hard time reaching\nA row during

you're here on the main goal Mitchell Hi Russ\n[noise] hey Norman thanks for taking my call her a air side need your help I'm catching up off the whole hearing and a co worker brought up some some comments I Want to get your your perspective on a first was mentioning that apparently Feinstein has had\nKnowledge of a mess for stuck there for a accusations\nUm but that this was never a brought up and interviewing him and I wonder from a legal perspective why that would benefit there would be for not addressing that earlier for our country as opposed to and it's a last\nWell at first of all hang on no let's take these one of the time let's take these one of the time I your premises are wrong and a couple of respects firstly was not Senator Feinstein that leak this you seem to be coming from a position that Senator Feinstein had\nThis thing new was explosives stuck it in her back pocket and then waited to spring it it just the right moment and none of that is true here are the facts as they have been a ... as they have come out\nThe only question that remains is who was the actual leaker but here on the fact in July I Believe it was or even earlier than that\nChristine blondes the Ford heard that Brett Kavanaugh's name was on the short list of people could be nominated\nKnowing what she knew she wrote a letter to Congress woman or a member of the house of representatives a woman named Anna Eshoo E S H O o who is not a senator she's a member of the house representatives congresswoman issue got the letter from our constituent Dr Ford called her and they had a conversation\nDr Ford ask for confidentiality in the letter\nDr Ford and and congresswoman issue agreed to apparently to turn the letter over to Senator Feinstein\nDr Ford said OK turn it over then Senator Feinstein called Dr Ford and they had a conversation because after all Senator Feinstein represents California's one of our constituents to so Diane Feinstein the U.S senator agreed to keep this confidential\nAnd she kept her words that and she said this publicly and you can verify all this on the Internet and it's all the video clips and everything Senator Feinstein said I wanted to respect Dr Ford strong requests for anonymity and so I kept that\nWell right at the end of the process now's the time where we're talking about where it got out Senator Feinstein shared the letter with various of her democratic colleagues and one of them\nLeaked I don't know who nobody's fast\nEnough but Senator Feinstein didn't leak she was very troubled by what was going on\nAnd so Dr Ford was in a bind she wanted to get this information out but didn't want her name attached to it she discovered that that was impossible she tried to find a middle ground she discovered that was impossible Senator Feinstein also try to find a middle ground and she found it to be impossible\nSo you can knit picket whoever you want and the Republican certainly a beating up on Senator Feinstein endlessly or bows and use\nThis up you set this up as an but it wasn't an ambush it all Senator Feinstein\nIs a woman Senator Feinstein understands that sensitive nature of this I think more than any man really can or most men and so Senator Feinstein tried to respect the ... the confidence J what Senator Feinstein should have done was never said a word to anybody about anything and taken this information to her grave\nAnd thank Christine Ford Dr Ford she had the decision to make whether to take this information to her grave she tried to find middle ground she found out you can't do a middle ground you can't you can't anonymously make these kinds of accusations\nAnd so you either got to make them publicly or you don't make them at all and Senator Feinstein found that the same thing you can't sit on this is too explosive you gotta have\nIt out but if you've got a person and that was senator Feinstein's problem if she had Dr fourteen please please please don't let my name out and says or find some water to respect that so\nWhat do we do with these facts now a rust that we have them [noise]\nYour your your guy\nBy by four twenty Seventy nine\nIs the biggest music festival of

experience [noise]\nAsian\nMan tell I our radio you want to hear uses some up and down by to let our programmers know how to make our radios found out that\nThe cabinet probe Trump's well I'm In case Washington is standing by at the FBI continues to look into sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh correspondence ... report says accuser have not heard from agents\nBut of course this hour I suspect is going to be dominated by you know who and\nI just want to any political and kinda civics dimension to this year because you and I have talked about\nThe war power for a long long time and and it's thrown around right I mean people seem to like conservative and liberal progressive everyone uses it and everyone thinks everyone else knows what they mean and nobody knows when anyone means and I seem to be the only one who's like pointing that out um hey the emperor\nHas no clothes allow me to be the first nobody knows well liberal or conservative are progressive is\nAnd and we ...\nTo get the word leverage because the word power\nPower is away right there along with the word\nLiberal or progressive and conservative is the word power\nNow we're not talking to electricity here so let's put that aside we're talking about the the the textbook can a definition right the dictionary definition of power\nWhite politicians crave power we use this word and we we bandied about all the time right B. A. N. D. Y. B. A. N. D. Y. we bandied about\nAll the time as a vest were thinking like a badminton match right or a tennis match\nSo anyway power there is an actual definition is the ability to compel someone to do something they otherwise wouldn't do isn't that a great definition I Love it I think it's accurate and it's perfect it's the ability\nTo compel someone to do something they wouldn't otherwise do allow me to give you an example ripped from today's news there are one hundred US Senators I Do believe you know that kind of and I'm Glad he does there were one is fifty states to per state regardless of size and population so we have one hundred senators and\nOnly three as in three percent right three out of a hundred is three percent kind\nID it's easy when you've got a hundred math they're very simple math so three percent of the United States Senate that is Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona three percent of the U.S Senate does their three percent\nThey have the power to stop this nomination because it looks\nLike the Democrats believe me but I did I say that believe me it looks like the Democrats at least Sam Stein is reporting and I I I trust them Stein believe me\nHe's a good reporter and he says his sources are telling him this being a report in the corporate media now you called me up are treated me but I mean I found them in the corporate media and Sam stands out there saying his sources are telling him that looks like the Democrats and be able to hold all their own together and put it on the Republicans so\nWith the Republicans only having fifty one to forty nine and by the way did you know the Doug Jones did you know Doug Jones that democratic senator of Alabama five days ago he tweeted out that he's against Kavanaugh he's voting on camera you know that that's I don't know\nWell there you go a democratic senator from Alabama Doug Jones is already five days ago said I'm not voting for Kavanaugh he's a no vote so it looks like the Democrats I'm a pretty substantial chance\nI surprised but they may be able to hold all their Democrats forty nine together which means if the Republicans lose two they're cooked\nAnd there's three on the fence right they they need if they only lose two they're done and they got three on the fence\nSo here's where power comes in\nBecause Benedict Arnold did not want the FBI to investigate right none of the Republicans Mitch McConnell would have a break cabin on the Supreme Court and re yesterday was the first Monday in October ... ... you know there there are there already starting the new term right so if we're up to Mitch McConnell Benedict Donald those guys justice cabinet\nWould be the knife Supreme Court justice already so they would love to use their power\nMitch McConnell would like to use his power\nHis ability to compel people to do things they don't want to do but he can't\nBecause three percent the crucial to reproduce remember I don't do something about these contests so far in the margins it's always about the margins three percent is holding it up because Mitch McConnell has he thinks he has no Democrats it looks like he has no Democrats\nAnd he needs to lose no more than one Republican and\nHe's got three employ so those three have leverage and that leverage gives them power and those three have said you will not get our votes unless there is a full and comprehensive FBI investigation well what about that voted to bleed FBI investigation\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh ... behind the calls for days they had a friend there were allegations by Deborah Ramirez that\nExposed himself to her while they were in college oh\nThere's Katy tour we think MSNBC for that and we're talking lying here now Jeff Flake has said that if it says on sixty minutes Sunday night that if it's proven that Brett Kavanaugh lied to the Senate under oath in testimony then that's it it's got his nomination as over\nAll right here's a clear one here's a clear one accuser\nNumber two right we just have to do it in a chronological way I don't mean to sound crass about it but I I just in terms of uh chronology our first our first indication there was a problem here in this area of course was Dr Ford the second accuser second victim uh was Deborah mirrors and she's the first year undergrad\nAt Yale who said that Brett Kavanaugh got super drunk right and and took down his pants and waved you know is junk around okay so\nThat second claim\nIs getting lots and lots of cooperation\nIt and here's the best corroboration catching Brett Kavanaugh in a lie trying to cover up if he if that consciousness of guilt mess conscious of guilt we're catching Brett Kavanaugh in on Brett Kavanaugh said under oath to the Senate Judiciary committee the first she heard\nAbout Deborah Ramirez this claim about that party at Yale with the taken on his pants and the junk waving around first you heard about it was when the New Yorker article writing remember Ronan Farrow in Jane Mayer that was their article Brett Kavanaugh testify ... said that was the first she heard about that was the first heard about\nThat that that he didn't know that Deborah Ramirez was coming forward with these claims about that party in him being drunk the first ... heard about it was when the New Yorker Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer came out with that article making that allegation well it turns out he got caught in the blame lies\nSomeone who did not want to go public\nAbout someone who has potentially very pertinent information has been attempting\nTo get through to the FBI has made several attempts finally I hired a lawyer yesterday a but it's getting no guarantees she's Thai contacting a local field office and told that this is not their authorities and take this information so let's break it down she is a mutual friend\nAbout that even merits and Brett Kavanaugh knew them\nFrom their days at Yale Law school she is and at Yale University shares in possession of a series of text messages that she says she has not done any conclusions about\nWhat that suggests that they definitely need to investigate further what was going on in the lead up to this New Yorker piece exposing ... stories she wanted to get out these tax that show that cabinet I\nMay have been trying to discredit that they were married and they run up to the New Yorker story running even though he told the Senate Judiciary committee that he wasn't aware of them are are sorry until it ran\nThere you go that's Heidi ... and we think NBC News for that so there are text messages going back\nAs early perhaps the July and remember that was the end of September ... September twenty third I Do believe was September twenty third when that New Yorker piece came out so there are apparently text messages dated weeks weeks before that\nShowing that Brett Kavanaugh was aware of ... and was aware that she was making these claims and that he was trying to pre but right it's not a ... bottle 'cause she had made the allegation yet it was a pre bottle it was like Manafort\nRight the thing that got Manafort locked up you remember he was trying to do encrypted text messages people saying hey it's Paul this is our story right this is what happened\nRight that's why in the FBI caught him doing and they went through the judge that due to morning perjury he's obstructing justice I Am in what he's doing his orchestrating a bunch of lives as to the judge put them in jail put Manafort in jail and that's why he was in jail for trial well isn't that exactly\nWhat we're talking about here is weeks before the revelation came public right Brett Kavanaugh and his people are out there sending text messages to people about\nThis is Debbie Ramirez story and the only reason it became relevant was because he swore under oath that he had not known about it until it came out in the New Yorker and so there's a clear lie so Senator Flake you said if he was caught lying there it is\nAlso leaves understand that this investigation near the FBI they they've got they now need to really do a lot about his drinking and is in temperate behavior\nBecause I just thought my hands on a copy of that police are bought for like maybe five and it says Brett Kavanaugh was Twenty one and a junior here at Yale get a copy here at the Apollo Theater which is now the ... street near the costs and opted out constantly went to a bar called ... that is where he got into an altercation with another man\nIn Nineteen oh three were the first World Series begins play Boston American beat the Pittsburgh Pirates five games to three and a back to nine series\nThis week in Nineteen thirty two it was Babe Ruth legendary call great points to center field before\n... into the Wrigley Field bleachers in the fifth inning with game three of the world series and the Yankees won Seventy five this week in Nineteen fifty one third baseman Tommy\nThompson hits a one out three run home run on the bottom of the ninth inning to win the national tennis for the New York giants Thompson's Homer wrapped up in an amazing come from behind run to the giants the giants went on to lose the series and the Yankees\nBut Tom miraculous home run remains one of the most memorable moments in sports history referred to as the shot heard round the world\nThis week in Nineteen eighty Larry Holmes retains W.

person although they really are I mean it's it's what's more important I think for senator if I were a senator I'd be concerned about his lying right now that's the issue\nBrett Kavanaugh's lying now about his actions then because apparently he believes if he was honest about his actions then his actions then we're so reprehensible that he wouldn't be on the Supreme Court so we figured that lying and covering up has got to be as pat well the problem is there's lots of people who were back there who knew what happened\nI have direct repeated knowledge about registering ... there was this

their first two years in jail undergrad now we're talking about how we're a little while ago the word power in the definition of power the ability to get someone to compel someone the ability to compel someone to do something they otherwise wouldn't do three senators\nTold Mitch McConnell and Benedict Donald three senators three out of a hundred they said we're not going forward ... until and unless we get a phone comprehensive FBI investigation well it doesn't look to me like\nWe're getting we're getting we're not getting one\nThey'll have a vote by the end of the week and it will be a positive out but it will be defendants or watch comes back from the FBI\nWell that's the gym job this double Jim job you're Benedict Donald is Gemini FBI to finish up and they're not they're not in contact with many many witnesses the media the media is finding these witnesses putting\nAll this stuff out the gym job number one is Benedict Arnold telling the FBI you can only do a few witnesses and I'm I'm going to tell you which ones the other one is is Mitch McConnell and he's doing a gym job on those three Republican senators he's going to grab their ankles and put their feet firmly to the fire and say now choose\nJudge Kavanaugh's nomination without a committee or considering it here on the floor\nAnd make your program will be voting this way\nOr you go nuts that's a politician and a really good one I mean he's a horrible guy but he's really skilled politician that high stakes high stakes poker that's Mitch McConnell telling Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona hey\nTime to choose and he doesn't seem to be impressed with what he's hearing about Brett Kavanaugh\nWas taught to New York times on this major story got the judge Kavanaugh\nMay have been accused of throwing some ice across our college bar in the mid Nineteen eighty\nOf bombshell one can only imagine what new bombshell might be published today or tomorrow well\nThere's Mitch McConnell is so that brings me to this issue of men verses women because it looks to me now with Benedict Donald saying\nIt's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be a ... you may not be guilty\nAnd that clip it's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be a sea of something that you may not be guilty of\nWell how about the Central Park five how about the Central Park five but not going to spend a lot of time on five young men for African Americans in a Latino gentleman were arrested and charged with a rape in Central Park in Nineteen eighty nine they were convicted even though they were\nIt was coerced confessions there was no physical evidence and they were convicted by a jury to separate trials ... amongst the group and that was all piled on appeal they were sentenced to prison five Fifteen Years then this many years and years in prison and then years later in two thousand and two remember Nineteen Ninety thousand to\nA ... a a guy who was already in prison said no I did it\nAnd in fact the DNA evidence match his and he knew details of the rape one single guy who said I did it by myself and so of the central\nPark five Benedict Donald took out an ad in the newspapers in New York calling for the death penalty for these gentleman so they were accused of something they spent years in jail and Michael Bloomberg refused to settle a lawsuit when when the guy confessed in and said you know here's my DNA and they matched\nHis DNA and the and he knew details of the rape that only only the rape is to know uh it was obvious that the Central Park five were innocent\nAnd Benedict Arnold has never apologized he took out full page ad hundreds you know dozens of it was eighty five grand or something at the time to call for the death\nPenalty for for black men young black men and a Latino jet who were all wrongfully accused\nIt's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be a guilty of something that you may not be guilty of hay\nAnd just like the Central Park five he identified that's exactly to Central Park five young men accused of something they didn't do and they spent years and years in prison for it and finally when Michael Bloomberg was out as the mayor\nOr the lawsuit got settled of the city's part of the lawsuit is still portions lawsuit going on I Believe it or not with the Central Park five or they settle if he was over forty million dollars no that's split amongst the group I wouldn't give years of my life for any amount of money but Benedict Donald of course is a racist not see I mean it's obvious\nAnd by the way speaking of racist Nazis there are more federal charges in Charlottesville case you remember the white supremacist unite the white eye unite the white unite the right unite the Nazis\nIn Charlottesville and twenty Seventeen Heather higher died and thirty five other people were injured new federal\nCharges today we have a lot to do I've got that in the third our and when it comes to senior legal analysts time\nBut it looks like men I mean with this clip\nIt's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be a guilty of something that you may not be guilty\nMen are finally having to learn that women need to be respected and that no means no\nAnd that the way that men have been behaving some and not all I've been behaving all these years is wrong and they're going to have to change and so that seems to be upsetting to some men\nAnd so that is my perspective on matters because of the leverage that those three Republican senators have\nThey exercise their power to compel Benedict Donald and Mitch McConnell to allow for an FBI investigation\nThey force Benedict all the Mitch McConnell to do something they didn't want to do that power those three three percent of the Senate because vets to get you from forty to fifty one there's your three and so that's leverage that's power they compelled the these guys\nDo allow the FBI to investigate the FBI appears to be under a tremendous amount of pressure and they're doing a slap dash nothing of an investigation\nThe media's finding a lot of people and bring forth their evidence and so the question for the Senate is are they really going to vote this Friday Mitch McConnell's doing this jam job Benedict Donald Gemini FBI an executive branch Mitch McConnell's jam in the Senate and the legislative branch and\nAre\nUnder my farmers to buy insurance exchange products on an airplane every state\nThis flu season one long green sleeves I can make a

the FBI continues to investigate sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh majority leader Mitch McConnell says here's what's going to happen\nTheir constituencies are number one their constituents right Jeff Flake retiring she doesn't have to worry about the near as much as Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski who still want to get elected to things from their state so they've got to worry about the people in their state the voters constituency number one it's like the audience for a radio host\nConstituency number two is the political party that's where Mitch McConnell I think that was really kind of what you were focused on was you know Mitch McConnell is basically taken a hammer\nAnd he's walking over the Lisa Murkowski hitting or over their head and saying you ready to vote for cabinet and she said out that hurt and he said if you vote for cabinet I Want a job and that was my hammer anymore and I'm being a little gross in graphic and probably politically is insensitive about it but he's putting as much pressure as he possibly can\nAnd she's got to respond to the party because parties everything these days and\nThe third constituency for Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins\nAnd to a lesser degree Jeff Flake is the lobby is the money people right you got to have money money is the mother's milk politics so you're a Senator Murkowski in your senator\nUh Collins you're over there and the money people saying look it's really important that we get Brett Kavanaugh near\nWe're really not going to be willing to give you a whole lot of money if you vote against him if you get rid of Brett Kavanaugh we're not going to give you any money no money from the pharmaceutical companies no money from the from the uh telecom companies no money for many companies and you'll you'll drier\nProbably why you shouldn't let them first right well\nI eat but you still need the voters and voters seem to be engaged in around so my question to you is not my at first I Want to challenge your your premise I'm not sure they want to vote no I think they're looking for ways to vote yes\nThat's my sense of the three of them these three Republicans is they're looking for ways to vote yes they're looking for ways to do excuse all this and they're having an extra hard time and every day is making more and more difficult so I think at some point they're going to have to choose they're gonna have to pick a constituency to upset\nIf that's the case then why did um why did flake or you know throw the monkey wrench in everything on friday by saying you know we've got to have the FBI investigation\nI Believe and I don't have facts to back this up so let me just get that and I don't have facts to back this I got to get Herman in there I Believe I Love that guy\nHe was not speaking for himself\nI mean he may have been in me he could have stopped the thing in the in the in the Senate Judiciary committee but he's only one senator\nAnd if Mitch McConnell knew that uh that Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski were on board and he would lose only Jeff Flake the Mitch McConnell would have said okay Jeff I promise you whatever you want and then Jeff Flake would have done and Mitch McConnell would\nPull the rug out from under him because Jeff Flake of leaving the Senate Mitch McConnell could have lied to him and gotten away with it and then ...\nAn image with how is it to his friends are lobbyists on K Street in Washington\nIt give Jeff Flake a really nice cushy job make up for the fact that I I lied to him I Do them into you know voting a cabin on out of the Judiciary Committee and then I double cross them on the Senate floor because Lisa Murkowski and Susan calls with me so that tells me that when Jeff Flake did what he did he was not acting\nAlone he he was speaking and very quickly by the way very quickly can we can influence because very quickly thereafter\nAre both ... a a Murkowski and Susan Collins came out in support of what he did so that tells me that Mitch McConnell knew that Jeff Flake was not just speaking for himself but the thing is with Jeff Flake though he's retiring doesn't have to worry about the constituents\nI mean if he really wants to upset the lobbyists of they don't give them a job he will orchestrate the demise of Brett Kavanaugh and then maybe I'll just go back to Arizona and you know do what he does his own a rather stay in Washington is so many of them do but Jeff Flake is less\nOr you know less prone to party pressure because he's retiring and he's already the reason these retire Benedict Iran amount of office so Jim what's your evaluation of all of that\nI think it's very interesting what you're saying I I I it it makes me a little sad to think that they're they're looking for a way to vote yes or no but I'm I'm I'm praying that um that flake will maybe a last great act of the senator\nGo against the party in and vote no and show 'em all\nBut even then if he is the only one of the votes no they can still get get them through because if ... you need a second one that fifty one if they lose one of ... and here comes Pence with his typewriter so they've got to get to the gym I Jim enjoy dinner\nAnd I just want you know there's this great alternative out there called beyond the meat and they're doing a really nice chicken alternative and there are some really there were like chicken patties it or not really chicken I've been dabbling and more than dabbling and I I\nHave to tell you I'm very impressed the impossible burger replacing red meat

the norm 'cause we already recorded it but the jury found\nFor Led Zeppelin and against the copyright infringement claim that's the point of the one suing for copyright infringement\nAnd uh the ... a

I found it fascinating\nThat the ... are our friends here in the studio thought it was interesting so there you go but they have some rock rock background as well anyway\nYou'll recall that under President Obama the Federal Communications commission and that's the thing known as net neutrality net neutrality says that those that operate the Internet\nLet's think of them as varieties in AT and T and Comcast those there's others right a giant corporations that basically are the Internet service providers they\nCould theoretically\nCharge more for a guaranteed super fast lane on the

that was on the press\nAnd Obama the FCC said net neutrality the Republicans came in the new you know who when they repealed it\nSo the state said okay we'll do\nFederal government as you heard from

L. E. N. as in Norman A. R. Y.\nLenora ... power wide broad Vance deep police power the states are sovereign they don't need no federal government to give them permission to do anything they just do stuff so if the federal government the big bad\nFederal government with limited power is coming into the federal courts they tell us they they can't do it and we can't be there\nThey have the burden of proving that\nAnd there is this thing called the dormant commerce clause I did it beyond the norm on this some months ago so if you want to go back in there but let me give you a really speed version of let's pick a state and does it matter pick any state in your mind you can make yours or state you don't like if they do like it doesn't matter\nOne of the fifty states pick a state\nThat make them more of the forty eight contiguous cause it matters are\nLet's say a state passed as a state law that the governor signs and says\nOur state highway system not the interstate I was just because of the federal government state highway system right states have their own state highways right so a state passes ... governor signed the laws as our state I was just ... is a shambles\nAnd it's going to cost a lot of money to rebuild them\nAnd we have found after said they put this in the law the legislature fines and declares that interstate truckers using state highways are destroying the state highways therefore\nUnless an interstate trucker\nHe's using a state highway to deliver goods in the state or pick up goods in the state\nThey cannot otherwise use the state highways they can all they cannot use the state highways just passed through\nYou cannot you can use the interstates ... said I was to just pass through you interstate truckers you Eighteen wheelers with all your heavy loads matching up on highways you've got either delivering the state or pick up in the state so that we get the jobs in revenue\nOr you can use to pass through tough figure out a rude around our state okay that's where you get the dormant commerce clause the reason it's called dormant as in sleeping is it doesn't require Congress to do anything\nCongress doesn't have to do anything the dormant commerce clause is a limitation on state power\nThat prevents the states from discriminating in interstate commerce\nStates aren't allowed to pick winners and losers right a state that allows due to impose a tax on booze coming into the state uh states not allowed to discriminate in interstate commerce sue if a state passed a law saying if you're an interstate truck or you can't use are state highways to pass through\nThat's imposing a rather significant burden on interstate trucking and that's imposing an interstate burden on instead of burden an interstate commerce is discriminate against interstate commerce into my legal opinion a court would strike it down\nI'm using it as an example so it's a nice example I think it's readily understandable right we all know about highways state highways day being wheelers so anyway that's what the dormant commerce clause does and by the way it comes to start in like\nEighteen twenty four\nThat's when this doctrine first started it with the Supreme Court the idea is\nThat a state can't discriminate against other states and interstate commerce because otherwise we'll be chaos what's one of the reasons rapping you know the whole United States and and no papers from state to state so the federal government could argue\nRight because it lets say they go into court and they say the court we want you to tell California they can't do that in the county and the federal judges you haven't shown me that there's an express preemption you haven't shown me there's an implied preemption you're gonna have to give me another argument so they're only good that they're not much else to say dormant commerce clause and the judge is going to say OK\nHow is California discriminating against interstate commerce aren't they doing the reverse isn't California discriminating against itself why would the Internet want to deal with California\nWhen when they have all these onerous and burdensome as you say they are a net neutrality rules would they want to do business in Arizona here in California by enacting these laws repairing\nBusiness away from California as opposed to discriminating against interstate commerce aren't they doing the reverse\nAnyway I don't know what the outcome is going to be and I'm Out of the production business but I Will tell you this is going to be a heck of an interesting lawsuit and the federal government seems really really interested in doing the bidding of ATM deep Comcast of rice and and the other boys because that's who they're doing the bidding for that to Benedict Donald represent\nOut of it and I work
