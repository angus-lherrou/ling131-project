L. E. R. he's a democratic congressman from New York City and he's the guy who took over after the guy\nI work for passed away so I Know that district that's the west side of the ... piece of Brooklyn little a Bronx anyway a general ... who was assemblyman is a state assemblyman back in the day when I was working for congressman twice I mean I\nKnew him way back into that this is how it's done you move up you know Jerry ... became a congressman after Ted wife died in Nineteen Ninety four I Believe it was in a very nice man ... great congressman and they called him a liberal all boy he was the most liberal ... anyway\nJerry Adler has been a member of Congress since the guy before him Ted wife passed away and that means that ... has a lot of seniority which also means Jerry ... is the ranking Democrat on the house Judiciary Committee and Jerry Adler\nIs out there saying publicly hey if the Democrats take the majority next month I Will be the chair of the Judiciary Committee and I'm going to be investigated and Brent Kavanaugh\nLike ... ...\nEmail you didn't say it and quite those words but the messages\nOn the mistake of all there will be investigations and so it seems that the Democratic party now is realizing as a political matter that the installation the jamming of Brett Kavanaugh on to the Supreme Court the way the Republicans did it\nIs a big winning political issue and I'm hopeful that the Democratic party will keep this issue alive look I'm going to do my part I'll keep these you Brett Kavanaugh sitting there and by the way Neil Gorsuch I mean that's Merrick Garland seat that's Merrick Garland seat so\nWe got we got double illegitimacy up there on the U.S Supreme Court and I'm Sorry this is what happens these are the wages of sin\nWhen they jammed these people on and hold off on Merrick Garland and break the constitution or you know they've destroyed the institutions great ... I'm just acknowledging what they have done so I'm hoping the Democrats will see this as a winning political issue and that they will campaign on investigating kicking cabin off the court and\nHowever it is got to get them off the court just get them off the court if he resigns great impeachment whatever it is got to remove him we got to get Neal cap pardon me Brett Kavanaugh off the court he's illegitimate the court is illegitimate certainly as a result of him and that\nGorsuch guy isn't helping and the legitimacy so the Democrats should be pledging that they will investigate cabin all like the Republicans investigated Hillary's emails in Benghazi and if the Democrats take one or both houses just basically have a cabinet investigation and how the man out office hound them out\nAnd the pressures on the chief justice by the way John or the so called chief justice the illegitimate chief justice the uh you know his name is John Roberts hey John John Hi there John you know it's all coming down on your head now I mean it's all you you're going to\nHave to go to Brett and see Brad what would you wrong here man you gotta go that's how it's going to have to be done because impeachment in the house does not remove anybody from anything\nBill Clinton got impeached did he leave the White House Bill Clinton got impeached you remember that right it was on that long ago Bill Clinton got impeach President Bill Clinton was impeached by the house represents that he loses veto power no\n... no none whatsoever\nImpeachment is\nA symbolic action only unless the Senate follows it up with step two of the process which is remove all by two thirds of the Senate\nAnd that's next to impossible so if you want Brett Kavanaugh off the court like I Do he's going to have to resign and the only way you're going to resign is if he resigns under a torrent of scandal that the Democrats brings through the investigations and that put so much pressure on the chief justice that he goes to cabinet says dude I'm Sorry you got to go and\nThe other justices just say Brett I'm Sorry you're killing the place you gotta go that's the only way it's going to happen at ... am I predicting it'll happen I mean are you kidding me when\nI'm Out of the production business anyway I wanted to start with Brett Kavanaugh because I found an\nABC News in this that the b._b._c.\nNews desk corporate media ABC News women lead support for further investigation of Kavanaugh\nAnd so there you go and this polling results on there and now the Democrats are finding some spine and that's really really nice to see our so aside from double senior legal analysts\nTime we just did one of the Brett Kavanaugh he's on the Supreme Court there's only one way really to get them off which is to hound them off the only way we're going to do that is to keep scandal mongering and get all of the pie\nWell that the Republicans hid all of the witnesses Republicans Barry all of the witness statements are Republicans didn't want to hear all the evidence has got to come out because I Am working with the fact of living with the truth and I'm quite confident that once we hear the full picture about Brett Kavanaugh they'll have to go maybe it'll be very simple they'll go to them as they\nGet them out I mean you know I get it on their art then\nWe've we've got we've also got the pope right the Roman Catholic Church we've got the sex scandal again the pope quote unquote accepting the resignation I always like that is accepting the resignation of the archbishop of the district of Columbia who has a very checkered past particularly in Pennsylvania\nAbout covering up sex abuse in the church the Dow went crazy again today I saw I trusted you saw that and also this is kind of sort of like the beyond the norm a tonight but\nI don't know if you saw this in a new Sears is about to go out of business Sears is about to go out of business fears is facing bank Kmart I mean they're facing bankruptcy and I wonder headlines was Sears has to find a hundred and thirty four million dollars by Monday I don't think they're going to do that and so\nSears, Roebuck and company ... that's a legendary American name that brand that name what they did for this nation especially you know a hundred and ten years ago means Sears was really important to everybody and Sears is now going away it shows you that Im permanence\nHow's that for best ward how's that now\nThat's not my didn't make it up as a vest works him permanence the only think permanent as him permanence and so Sears, Roebuck company and Kmart by the way ...

I mean gun violence archive ought not exist the function that they are doing ought to be done by the Centers for Disease Control of the United states government because gun violence is a\nPublic

deaths report specifically suicide by gun a new study by Journal of the American Academy of child and adolescent psychiatry\nClaims that Seventy one percent of the first time suicide attempts are successful and that\nOf those eighty five percent are due to guns so\nAvailability of guns making it very easy to kill oneself and of course if you are an enemy of the Saudi royal family you don't need a gun not only is it\nJust absolutely bizarre that a a a ... well known person a columnist for the Washington Post could go into a diplomatic a building and then be\nButchered and tortured and and potentially cut up into pieces and then throw it out on the charter plane not only that mind blowing up but then there are these numerous reports that this was ordered by the top levels of the Saudi Government and that\nThere is this report that earlier on\nThe the crown prince ... bin ... who effectively runs the country right now are the ones that are more or less as a one man show he's been arresting\nHundreds thousands of of critics are putting them under under sometimes house arrest us sometimes on a real arrest\nEyes he is taking a hard line that he had initially had a plot or wanted a plot to lure because she'll get back to Saudi Arabia with offers of reconciliation show he has been very critical of the sound threats and according to this report\nHim yes wanted to say everything can be done let bygones be bygones that show didn't didn't didn't buy it he was suspicious I didn't accept the offer a and he\nWas trying to keep a distance from Saudi Arabia until it was he went in on that fateful day into this conflict building he needed some paperwork that he believed apparently that he couldn't get anywhere else and never came outside\nAs Richard Engel and we think NBC News for that\nRichard Engel is one of the top international news reporter certainly from an American perspective and I would expect he would be on this story a lot of people are on this story CNN Richard Engel works for NBC News so let's switch over to CNN CNN is reporting that Turkish authorities have\nAudio and visual evidence\nThat shows the journalist ... being killed inside the conflict\nNow the reason I'm bringing that to your attention and the reason I think it's significant is because there's only two ways that turkey is going to have video and audio evidence\nOf what happened one is the book the consulate and they've got their own spy stuff in there which you're not supposed to do and they've just revealed it and so if you're Saudi Arabia's gonna tear the play sports they wear those hidden cameras it's either that\nOr somebody from that Fifteen member sense of humor someone who had access to the Saudi tape the Saudi video\nUh gave it to the Turks or they stolen or the ... only two ways this could have happened\nAnd by the way if you're wondering why would you video and have audio of the interrogation torture and murder and December men I mean they apparently did the whole thing because they needed to go home and to show their bosses that they had done it the way the boss was\nSo they had to be able to go home and say hey boss you lay hey get a bowl of popcorn let's turn on the video screen and watch what happened so they have a video and turkey apparently has the video and audio and they are hopping mad\nBy the way by the way\nSaudi Arabia is so close to Benedict Donald bending down not going to do anything he's not going to do anything\nFirst I Want to find out what happened and we're lucky again this took place in Turkey\nAnd to the best of our knowledge\nTo show he is not a United States citizen is that right or permanent resident okay we don't like it John we don't like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten dollars from being spent in this country [noise] knowing they have\nFour or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable that\nBenedict Arnold is owned and operated by the Saudi regime he is compromised he is financially in their pocket and so is this good for nothing son in law and Saudi Arabia in my humble opinion would never have done this a rock Obama were though the president's President Obama would have said hey\nDon't do it and if you do there's going to be all kinds of problems you know you don't like you're on I'll get even cozy with Iran I'll do all kinds of things that can make your life miserable I'll make you go by your arms from China and Russia you want to buy in from us because we have the best stuff well that's not going to happen with this dude\nOn Capitol Hill lawmakers from both parties say the Trump Administration told the Saudis accountable and that the U.S must stop doing business with than there is evidence and protecting the regime\nWell that that my uh that's everyone's life under under Trump or not healthy\nBut the point is well you know are you in that\nPeople have got to understand that they are Saudi Arabia is in a vulnerable position and they need to be kept over ... Mohammed bin ... cannot do that\nWell he's Thirty years old he's already three ... three years old they these\nGuys what what did you do when you were thirty three and a lot of mistakes when you're thirty the menu\nAnd I know I did I was practicing law back really made a lot of mistakes yeah I did\nThis is a really dumb mistake by thirty three year old he needs to pay I'm I'm fifty eight okay he needs to pay for the gum gun steak\n... this isn't just first this is his first dumb mistake who obviously who launched a disastrous war in Yemen Scott Scott calmed down do ...

thing where you have to you have to identify what is an important fact\nWhat is a really important fact what is a not so important fact they're looking for the skills of differentiation to be able to tell what's important and what's not and Jesse I'm not just wasting your and everybody's time telling you this story the reason that we are here now\nWith you and me and everybody justifiably upset about children being ripped from their parents arms is because we did not differentiate between facts\nNot All Facts are important allow me one more moment please\nRight now not only are we fighting about the kids being ripped from their parents arms the environmental protection agency has been gutted and is being destroyed and is now in the pocket of the polluters I just posted on social media and I'm going to leave it there for a long time because I Want everybody to see\nMitch McConnell has jammed through not just Brett Kavanaugh he's jammed through so many federal judges since Benedict Donald got sworn in that Benedict Donald's appointees are now Fifteen Percent now Fifteen Percent of the federal judiciary sometimes they say use yeah they say is huge because fifth\nKeeper right now the ... has been in office just these months\nHe's already got Fifteen Percent of the judiciary as Donald Trump appointees because Mitch McConnell is jamming through 'cause he slow walked a bunch of Obama's wouldn't let Obama Merrick Garland so the point of all this is is that you and I and everybody we're fighting defensively now we are fighting massive\nDefensive efforts were losing a lot because the cast\nIs the die is being cast\nThe important facts or elections and when having elections for president and senator and house member doing things like and you know exactly what I'm going to play right now because I'm going to play it and I am proud of it [noise]\nHillary was too close to Wall Street and Jesse ... you know I'm having trouble with your phone Jesse try and get to a less noisy place please do not want to come back to you but Jesse my point is is that people who said nah I'm I'm doing is the way the law school aptitude test it\nI'm not I'm not going to bash on the people who said Hillary's too close to Wall Street I Want to look at the\nProcess what they did was they said that fact my objection to Hillary is too much a corporate Democrat is an equivalent fact to who's on the Supreme Court to guarding the EPA to ripping kids from their parents arms\nWhen people do not separate fact and situations and facts within situations into\nWhat's important what's not important what's more important what's less important this is where judgment intelligent human judgment comes in and what I was doing before that election was saying\nWe're going to have four years of wars in fights and battles over Supreme Court nominees and is now the other thing and all that time is going to be lost and we're going to be defensive we're going to because we don't have the power we don't have the White House and then it turns out we didn't get any of the government\nAnd so Jesse my point to you is this\nYes you're angry about this and you ought to be angry about this however\nWhat there's nothing we can do about it we can protest\nWe can demand people do this we can work ourselves into an emotional lather\nUntil we've exhausted ourselves and in frustration quit and give up which is exactly\nWhat the Republicans want they want us to work ourselves into an emotional dizzy and that's why they intentionally do things to get us worked up so that we get disgusted and walk away they're playing us and we are not doing the intelligent differentiation a B discernment that's the best word right their\nDiscernment as a best worst movie in the middle V. I. S. C. we need to discern\nWe've got to be able to see the distinctions and understand that the important facts are re elections you've got to put the people in power when you've got your own people in power then you can yell at them and say you're not doing good enough because even if they're not doing good enough they're still doing good you don't\nPunish your friends by handing it to your enemies because then you are saying that this fact of I'm ... I'm unhappy with my friends you are then saying I'm willing to make that equivalent to all the other fact and what I'm telling you is is that there are major factors\nThere were minor factors there are no factors and we didn't do the mental work prior to November twenty sixteen we lived in the moment we made decisions based on things that emotionally satisfied are dissatisfied of the people who voted for Donald Trump or in these rural areas or a bunch of MBA cells they didn't think the matter\nThrough now they're feeling even more pain 'cause they're really getting slam now\nNo body did any real thinking and that's why we're in this pedal Jessica\n[noise] I I agree with the norm I remember that that is looking at the long game on our openly yet but I'm Talking about the short\nTerm if we get another short hair how did we get into the short term is my point because we were living in the short term in and if we keep living in the short term we just keep bumping ourselves from crisis first what you're saying to me just you\nKnow but look here's the problem right now\nAnd I'm saying yeah that's right there's a problem right now\nThe other problem right now and then there's another problem Jesse there's outrages other day you should read my email for to Norma normally I get emails from everybody tell me oh look at what Trump's doing here and now look what you're doing there are now looking for Trump to live with the Republicans don't here and um\nGreat I understand that we have to wonder stand to prevent this going forward we've got to start winning elections and just getting ourselves that weighs about this now is not very helpful because\nWe can't really stop most of it because all of this was set in stone in ... in November twenty sixteen and the fact that we don't even know that fact has really pathetic Jesse I'm Sorry it's sad that we know so little about how all this work and we're being played Jesse were being played and it's hard to watch\n[noise]\nGo try and get the urban trying again the Durban and and and Tammy Duckworth and everybody to go do what they can just see\nI got an email box full of outrageous and that one's a major one talked about a major versus minor that's a major outraged ripping on the kids I'm with you we've got to stop this\nI'm Serious now we've got to stop it we've got to put this into place no more emotional meltdowns oh my God look what they're doing we've got to be smarter\nWe're not going to start winning we're not going to get this thing fixed if we don't act smarter I'm not kidding around here we've got to understand how the system works and we can't be plucking one thing out and saying this one thing is the equivalent to all these other things because no it isn't\nWith that let's be senior legal analysts time because yesterday our friend Paul from Washington called and he said no I'm the great state of Washington now does not have a death penalty because the Supreme Court the state declared that unconstitutional under the state constitution and all the Republicans are going crazy All right here goes\nPrior to I Know this is gonna sound weird but this is true this is true\nBefore the civil war right like eight the Eighteenth fifties Eighteen forties back them\nThe federal government's constitution the U.S constitution saved constitution you and I\nAre familiar with right only applied to the U.S government it only applied to the U.S government the U.S constitution did not apply to the state governments that sounds weird to\nOur ears and believe me oh then I say that I said believe me believe me when I was in law school and they're telling us this I'm like that can't be right wait a second if you're telling me in Eighteen twenty seven the federal constitution Eighteen thirties ... all those years the federal constitution only applied to the U.S government\nWhat you mean Pennsylvania legally could have declared a state religion how do you do that how do you do that in the United states\nAnd the answer is the states have their own constitutions and the ... the states it very often and those constitutions those states mimic\nRight a lot of what's in the U.S
