[noise] new information tonight concerning the packages with suspected explosives into several high profile officials correspondent Brian Todd reports at least two of those packages had stamps on them that had not been cancelled and are believed to have been hand delivered\nA basis to investigate if the reporting is correct that it wasn't the U.S males for each and every one of these deliveries and there was a human being\nEven if it was just a regular legitimate delivery service somebody hire them right and if it was done over the phone\nYou know cloak and dagger saw what was the number there are ways for investigators to find leaving get leads one eight eight eight three two one six zero zero one I asked the question in the first hour I continue to ask you know keep asking it\nHow do we deal with the Republican Party led by an on American unpatriotic Nazi literally and he's calling himself a nationalist okay great white nationalist you can't just drop the word white ah so\nWhat what do you do with that when they destroy the economy when they destroy the institutions when they make it so disgrace when their\nConduct it was like look I I'll just let me let me quote them back to themselves\nBecause people are animals so when you've got a bunch of ... people consider animal when you get these animals\nWere conducting themselves in this disgusting fashion and now they're sending pipe bombs to democratic leaders what do you do Michelle Obama said when they go low we go high well I I Love her I think she's wonderful but what do you what do you do when they when they send you buy bonds\nHow do you go higher when they're sending a pipe bombs\nHey Pam thanks are contemplating these difficult issues with me on WC peachy in Chicago I bam\n[noise] hey how are you I'm good what's up\nUp so they have a question that a lot but certainly related to the pipe bombs but\nI Am I'm concerned about the fact that we have over and left that have volunteered to get free ride for people that get their way to the polls on election day and I don't see that advertise it hit me in cutting the advertised all over the place\nUm I Would tend to think first shot at them through any of this and all that I can get to them why don't we hand out flyers for that effect and they said well good idea will pass it up the chain but I I'm really frustrated\nOkay I I understand your frustration and and I it makes a lot of sense here's why I think it's happening and here goes\nWho were and lift are going to have a very difficult time during all their\nDrivers nationwide on that day to give free ride I don't see how they have that power if they've been spending a lot of legal fees and we're not their employers are we're not responsible for their independent contractors\nSo it's going to be difficult for them to try and do a kind of a top down the issue in order from on high you will donate your time today there's good cause I mean what if drivers is no I'm not volunteering that day I'm busy\nOr what do you do so I think it's it's ... from what I've seen and we've gotten calls and emails are talking about exactly this and it's a wonderful thing than\nI mean I'd love to have a lot of people giving lots of free rides on on election day\nHowever it seems to be from what I've looked at when I looked at it briefly on the Internet it's a local thing and it kind of\nHas to be a local thing it has to be the were lift drivers in particular are saying we agree to do this or some of us agree to do this so I think it's being done from what I can see it looks like it's being done on a kind of informal ad\nHoc not nationally organize regionally not even state wide organized just kinda metro area by metro area and so because it's being done on this kind of you know an informal basis\nThat it is kind of hard to organize getting the word out for something that's not organized does that make any sense at all\nOkay yeah that makes\nYou kinda got a check on your local area you may have a lot more of just let me just make up a hypothetical here on the spot you may have theoretically a whole bunch of ... and lift drivers in the Seattle\nArea we're all fired up and ready to go say sure I'll take anyone to the polls for free no problem you may have a bunch of people in Topeka, Kansas and forget about it I ain't taking people to the polls no I mean\nI'm just I'm picking up the peak of Kansas 'cause in the nature of the state\nBut my point is is it's got to be kind of a local thing by local thing because it's up to the individual who were in lift drivers to decide whether they want to donate their time their gas right they're they're wearing their car right they can't be ordered this night that\nI mean if a taxi cab company right which has regular employees said hey you're on you know your regular pay or whatever will make up your loss affairs you know I mean if the taxi company employers willing to take the hit you know the employers are the employees um ... as long as you're hold me harmless from financial penalty I you know sure I'll drive anyone to the polls you want\nBut how do you translate that to a new relive model\nWell is there any specific way out I'm a channeling a like getting people to donate money specifically for a ride to the polls for people who don't have the money I\nMight get her labs my guess is it's a local thing I Would talk to the local Democratic Party I Would talk to you all the county Democratic Party the count the local indivisible groups the local were and lift him and I know they've got an\nApp sets as their businesses there may be something in the ... and or lift up saying free ... just a button that they added free rise to the polls kind of thing and they can direct you within their apt to where they've got to win lift drivers willing to do it I'm just saying there are ways to find this out\nSo what you're going to have to do with the local by local basis because it seems to me that's how it gets done locally\nRight okay well thanks so much for your answer to visit helpful was helpful thank you for all right about something like that for next stop right next presidential election and by the way things are wrong and I\nDon't give the Democratic party short shrift there you know in in in each local area there could easily be lots of volunteers who are not ... lift related who'd be willing to give rise to the polls ... raising the gas up had wonderful you how do we linked up\nYou know people willing to give rise with people who need them efficiently effectively over the Internet when a lot of the people are too poor to have computers or they're older and enough ... apps right our phones it's a challenge it's definitely a channel\nThat so Pam this is where we need our creativity and I love you for raising these really really important issues thank you for being part of the team won eight eight eight three two one six thousand and one is our number Richard Hi Richard or W CBD Chicago Richard\nHi how are ya well what's up here for\nA first thing about that Robert De Niro and he was in the maybe they are of the Marines and he was on a boat

Republicans are said he was a you know call them out either have offices that are going to sue you and you never did but at any rate\nWhile I I don't or not the only thing that I objected to ... about with Pat Robertson is the same as I have one objection to him and all of them stopped\nCalling yourselves Christians because there's zero evidence that they actually are and I object to them using the

intimidated by it and\nThat is New York's Mayor Bill de Blasio and I was hoping we wouldn't be here I was hoping and begging before November twenty sixteen that we didn't do this now that we're here let's try\nThe best of it see we can make some lemonade out of these lemons so here's the lemonade that I'm seeing that\nWho's an American issue is presented justice clear and front and center if your with Benedict Donald you're disqualified as an American you're disqualified as a patriot you're disqualified as a Christian you're disqualified as anything associated with the red white and blue it's very simple the fight is on now\nWho's an American and we're getting to make a really clear choice Benedict Donald foreign Nazi me and you\nReal red blooded Americans who is an American that issue is presented front and center\nThis nation is coming apart at the seams it's being torn apart at the seams there's only one way it's going to be held together if the normal people band together and something Nazis\n'cause that's what this has become those times or something not seize because the Nazis or out they are presenting themselves and they're either going to take it further and further and further or going gonna stop 'em in their tracks\nBecause this is unacceptable sending a\nPipe bomb from some people are political enemies this is what we have sunk to\nOne eighty three two one six thousand and one is our number one triple eight three two one zero zero zero one and believe it or not that's really not the biggest story of the day I Know that's hard to believe\nLet's say five years ago twenty Thirteen\nLet's say a story was published in the New York times five years ago that President Obama was using an on secure cell phone that was being listened to by China and Russia\nChinese and Russian Spies are reportedly listening in on some of president Donald Trump's phone calls that's according to the New York times which report to U.S officials were made aware of the intercepted calls from people working with in foreign governments that time the sources that China is trying to use information from the president calls to help and it's ... feet with the U.S\nThat country is also reportedly using businessmen to pass along the Chinese government schemes to people President Trump talks to regularly and the hope they will then relay that information back to him\nThat is the u._s._a. today audio service and we think USA Today for that it was about\nHillary's emails you remember Hillary's emails mishandling classified information\nRight so now we go from hash tag Hillary's emails to hash tag Trump's cell phone\nSo the idea here in this new New York times report that just drop tonight is that the president is sitting around talking on his personal phone\nAnd on any given day for any conversation spies for China are listening to those calls they're totally not secure cost totally open to foreign countries listening to them and recording all of them\n... since they're recording them they can also Dr those recordings and release them to the world as if the president said something he doesn't actually say\nOr they could release when he actually said who knows what would be more scandalous but what U.S intelligence has further turned up is that China is using what they're hearing on these calls to come up with new ways to manipulate the U.S president to China's advantage\nI that's Rachel Maddow I trust you recognize the voice that's last night's Rachel Maddow show\nLast night the New York times published on their website this story that Benedict Donald is using a private personal cell phone that is not a secure and\nThat it's a it's back when I was a kid they use them the remnants of a thing known AS Party lines you remember party line there's like a genius back\nI don't know if they're in the west I was in the east back then but you know back in the earlier days of of commercial telephones you know multiple people could use a line right and you pick up and there were other people's conversations they get off on it was a party line and when I was just growing up as a little kid they were they were on their way out there weren't too many of them left\nBut I got the concept and now you got the concept and the kids are they going what are you kidding me there was a anyway yet the idea of one line shared by multiple users okay that's\nA concept that's what Benedict Donald's got going on right now his personal cell phone is a party line\nBasically when ... when he finishes a conversation what he ought to do is say goodbye everybody\nTo be just got a whole bunch of people listening in\nWhat it comes to like this is what American\nSpy agency is the official said had learned that China and Russia were eavesdropping on the president cell phone calls from human sources inside foreign governments and intercepted communications between foreign officials\nThe Chinese have pieced together a list of people with whom Mr Trump regularly speaks in hopes of using them to influence the president's\nUs on the list are Steven Schwartzman the chief executive of the Blackstone group and Steve when former Las Vegas casino magnate stepped down from his company after Syria sexual misconduct allegations earlier this year both men are frequently speak with the president I have a history of major business ties and say that\nThat's very handy for the Chinese government right ... the Chinese are not relying on Chinese businessmen and others with ties to Beijing to fade arguments\nTo the Trump friends quote the strategy is that these people will pass on what they're hearing and that Beijing's view this will eventually be delivered to the president by trusted voice as\nSad as Rachel Maddow and we think MSNBC for those good from last\nNight's Rachel Maddow show so basically China and Russia are listening in and they know who is talking to and they've got they've got links to the guys trumpet saga do so what's the stopped China from going to these guys are saying hey have you ever want to do business in China again here's the price this is what we've allowed to happen\nOne of the

there saying they're phony it's a rigged and fix system right he was pouring battery acid\nOn trust in government he was saying don't trust government he gets in there he's destroying the FBI he's

Mexico\nHi Norman Pam I'm In Albuquerque and thanks for being with us on a beach you\nYeah I was calling because you were talking about Robert Bork and how the Republicans are all up in arms because Democrats sabotage pork\nAnd I wanted to give me some background but I haven't heard very much and that that Robert Ford was Richard Nixon hatchet man on the Saturday Night massacre\nYes all the others the attorney general the deputy attorney general they were trying right rather than find\nWhat goals house it was ... house\nElia Richardson I think it was a special counsel anyway those names are deep in my memory banks but yes but there there's a there's another thing about Robert Bork though that and you're right Robert Bork when Richard Nixon did the Saturday Night massacre\nRichard Nixon said to the attorney general fire the Watergate special prosecutor\nThe attorney general's said no and quit and then mixing told the deputy attorney general fire him and the that'd be a no equipment to Nixon just went down the line and Robert Bork was the guy who finally said sure I'll fire the dude and he did and so we're Robert Bork there was a hero for the Republicans\nBut there's something else ... did that got him torpedoed in my legal opinion you want to hear that one\nWas that\nThe reason Supreme Court nominees since Robert Bork never talk in detail about their policies and theories of the law they speaking generalities it's because of what happened with Robert Bork\nRobert Bork in his testimony laid out he's legal theory of basically roe versus Wade I mean it was being applied to roe versus Wade he set\nOut in the wizard lead detail I think it was like a four\nBorder five point test where he said if a man of the Supreme Court is a B C D and he then it gets up hill living not ABCD or eat it gets overruled and everybody especially the Democrats said hey wait a second you just sit out a new legal test\nFor over ... roe versus Wade and that's why the Democrats went after him because he said he's being installed by Ronald Reagan to overrule roe versus Wade\nAnd the legal test that he's going to import Jesse manufactured this series is loaded up out of his brain and\nAnd it's going to imported into the law is the Supreme Court justice with all his fellow Republicans and so the Democrats said you just gave us the formula to defeat you because you showed us how you're going to overrule roe versus Wade and it is my humble legal and political opinion that that's\nWhat ultimately torpedoed the guy uh uh uh and and so since then\nOldest reporting on these that they never do reported don't tell them what you plan to do that's my theory on the matter I\nAbsolutely that I heard that absolutely so they you know visits\nBut since then but since then Pam since then\nBasically the Supreme Court has been\nA giant battle ground old do only lately has become the massive battle run I mean even Elena Kagan was was confirmed and Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed by some big numbers so it's it's gotten so toxic now the the whole institution is illegitimate and that's sad Pam thanks I think that was born with justice was served\nHi I'm Jeff Cohen founded an

remember the name Brett Kavanaugh that's who we're talking about Brett Kavanaugh is been on there and what a couple of weeks now\nAnd I have been asking have we forgotten about Brett Kavanaugh and I'm very happy to report that no we have not yet forgotten about Brett Kavanaugh and I I for my part will never let us forget about Brett Kavanaugh this is a disgrace\nAnd that's nicely put that's putting it nicely okay\nYou'll recall I Know it wasn't that long ago your call that the the overriding theme about Brett Kavanaugh was can we investigate all these complaints that are coming in right that was the whole point was that people were popping up everywhere and they were making allegations that I\nHave no way of evaluating them it's not my job nor is it your job we have no way of evaluating this stuff people pop up they make allegations Brett Kavanaugh denied\nHow the heck do we know who's lying to tell the truth\nThat's why we do investigations so everybody was saying\nWe please take some time and investigate it now of course let's not forget the politics Democrats trying to run out the clock the Republican trying to a gym through right it's all about the election coming up so you know there there's no point to to to have\nAny claim to principle by anybody here it was just a wrong naked political exercise we understand\nAnd so when the Republicans refused to investigate right Dr Christine Blasey Ford's allegations when they did they had the F the FBI do the most slap dash\nComical ridiculous non investigation and as they see it's okay now right when they did that what the Republicans did was say we refused to investigate we wanted\nInstigate the claims of a lot of these claims that they were people you'll remember popping up saying I knew Brett back then and I can say listen I have this information\nRight now all these people just ignored and then of course we had Julie sweating it do you remember Julie sweating it I Know that name sounds familiar and Michael ... we all know Michel ... right okay Julie sweat neck remember this one she alleged that back in the day\nShe was at a party where she was basically fed a Mickey\nRight you slipped to make you somebody got a very very drunk and she was taking advantage she was a fat gang raped that is her story Julie sweat and he says she was gang raped\nAnd she said that Brett Kavanaugh and his buddy mark judge we're at the party but me to her knowledge did not participate in her gang right which to me sounds very honest I mean you know you're going to lie why stop anyway so\nThat to me was a a a credible enough allegation I mean she was in school and the play and there were all these associated facts around Julie sweating it that that screamed out\nVery Rapid City truth I mean she was in the place right there it's not like she was from you know Nevada\nOr Nebraska you know or some place in as all of a sudden like how did you get into Maryland at this time me she was out of school at that\nTime she had friends who could verify she was part of that social said she was at the the parties there around I mean she was obviously somebody who was in the place at the time to in a place in a position to tell the story she was telling so all of those what I call associated or background facts\nRight that to to get us to the point where her actual allegation of this is what happened to me that night in that\nHouse and this is who is in the room to me it's like okay go investigate and Michael ... well the Republicans of course is you'll as you know as the historical record will now reflect didn't investigate\nCharles Grassley here senior legal analyst I biggie Charles Grassley who is not a lawyer he's a farmer so they say he's actually he's actually a money he's the mummy who's been shipped from Iowa and I don't think they want him back\nBecause he's been in Washington for about six years now\nAnd I think he's mummified ... and he's not a lawyer back you know maybe when he was a teenager you know back in the Eighteen twelve or whatever I you know he was a farmer but from my part for marijuana sound smog I really don't I mean I I go after other people from being smog I don't want to do that\nBut I just think as a matter of wise public policy making is probably a good idea to have a lawyer in charge of the Senate Judiciary committee Mitt just helps because again it's like being a quarterback in the NFL yeah I'm a broader view of the playing field you see all the nooks and crannies and nuances that's why lawyers run the legal system because it's\nComplicated and there's a lot of reasons why it's complicated and it's not just a milk people for legal fees to protect their rights\nAnyway before I go down that\nTangent overrode Senator Charles Grassley who is not a lawyer\nWho presided over the the debacle that was the whole Brett Kavanaugh experience\nUh Charles Grassley now has found a sudden new interest investigations yes I'm not I'm not making this stuff up I mean Mitch McConnell going to help me a message I mean you can make this stuff up and and I am not\nSenator Grassley is now demanding an investigation of Julie sweat neck and Michael ... saying that they made false statements before the Senate Judiciary committee [noise]\nAll right so I'll let you fill in all the punch lines and the ... that you want cars that situation Senator Charles Grassley demands investigation of Julie sweat Nick and Michael I have an id this comedy material just waiting to be had there I Will go with the law part and that is this\nWe have seen this in the past where\nCongress for political reasons uh demands were makes reference to the department of justice to say investigate and prosecute and the answer is yes they can ask but they cannot compel they cannot directly compel\nThey can sort of compel I mean the department of justice is funded by Congress so when a senator\nWho happens to be the powerful senator of the Senate Judiciary committee or the ... they mentioned the chair of the Senate Judiciary committee whether he's a lawyer Nazi relevant he's the chair of the Senate Judiciary committee at the very powerful position and\nIf he gets mad at your agency or your little unit within ... he can go over to his buddies on the on the budget committee\nAnd and and take out a giant chunk of your budget and so that's kind of how you know the the Congress can coerce the bureaucracy to do with Congress once but not directly can't directly forced them to do this and so this kind of thing\nGoes over to the department of justice and they have the right to kind of back pocket the thing and say yeah OK Senate ride them a letter saying we acknowledge your request for an investigation will certainly take a look at it will get back there and then they back pocket the thing and and you you don't hear from it ever again\nThat happens and it is the right of the department of justice and more to the point the prosecutors because with Charles Grassley is really asking for is not an investigation he wants to prosecution he was punishment and he wants it images and so he doesn't want investigation with prosecution and no senator can force a U.S attorney to\nProsecute a case that's the the the independence of the you know checks and balances right the different branches because the prosecutors during the executive branch and the Senate during the legislative branch so the to the extent though the legislative branch has as\nInfluence over the legislative branch is through the money is through funding the agencies and all of that\nBut in terms of who's the boss of the U.S attorney\nBike for the district of Columbia it ain't the Senate\nIt's it's it's the guy in the White House right by the executive branch through the through the attorney general right to the U.S juries are part of the department of justice like the FBI is part of the department of justice and the attorney generals in charge of the department of justice and you know who's in charge of the you can hear we smiling you know who's in charge of the department of justice right now\nHe's a little guy was with ... years he's a little elf he looking guy\nIf I

CPT in Illinois Geoff good evening\nGood evening did you learn a first time\nThe recalled in a radio show up and I really enjoy your show\nI'm honored wow that's quite an honor you'd never called a radio show before\nThough out a lot of talk about is a ... do we have anarchy if there is no law or people in the upper echelon yes I mean\nWhat we have we have the ... of institutions when it appears that there's two systems of justice and the the rich get away with everything and everybody else has a different set of rules that everybody says why why why why abide by these rules and the whole system falls apart that it leads to that I Would go ahead\n[noise] [noise] well the thing of it is um these guys have\nUm\n... they've destroyed the rule I mean poor people have trouble they get they get thrown in jail\nSure ... when they get in trouble they they ask them or did you do this you know [laughter] no I didn't do this ... what do you expect somebody to say yes [laughter]\n[laughter] I agree [noise] I had a guy on the show let me jump in real fast I\nHad a guy called the show Jeff used couple few years ago and he said the reason the black people are all in prison is because that's where all the crime is and after I stop laughing in his face I said OK if the police went into the wall\nStreet firms they wouldn't find any cocaine\nIf the if if the if the securities Exchange Commission was really really doing their job and audit these firms they wouldn't find financial fraud you don't remember what happened when George W. Bush and his and his criminal friends on Wall street brought down economy none of these things are crimes so\nI hear you loud and clear Jeff and the problem is is that what we saw when George W. Bush and and the criminals on Wall street brought down the economy was exactly what you're talking about two systems of justice this country is still upset\nAnd I believe one of the big reasons Benedict Arnold got as close as he did stealing his way in was because we didn't hold Wall Street accountable they stole all the money they rig the economy they took it all it came down crashing down people lost their homes lives were destroyed\nThey got bailed out then they were left in place and they're all still they're making even more money now the the depths of seizing\nThe air is still not understood by the political leading this country and so a lot of people saw that and see what's going on and say\nWhy am I knock on my head against the wall here to do live under a system as rancid and corrupt they you know the rich are getting away with everything the boys on Wall street are getting away with Eric Snowden cocaine by the bucket full right drinking champagne while they're doing it\nMaking all this money and ... you know I got to be worried about going to jail for a dime bag of pot\nYeah that is that what you're referring to buy anymore [laughter]\nExactly and the other thing is when they say the corporations are people shouldn't they be prosecuted what what a corporation does something wrong should they be prosecuted like a person\nOperations or people in my ... how do you put a corporation [laughter] and\nYou throw in the city or the corporate and\nGo there you go no I agree with you Jeff as a matter of my personal opinion of course I agree with you a hundred percent I mean what do\nYou think in my opinion of anyway here's the thing it it it if the CEOs and\nActually the seat owes if all of the cold the control group and the law they're called the control group and it makes perfect sense if you think about it for a second who can cause a corporation to do something you know who could make Exxon\nInvest in this oil well who can make Exxon decide whether to give its workers are raised who can decide whether to build a new facility here or there if you're if you're Exxon it's the control group is the chief executive officer of the chief operating officer\nBoard of directors these are the people the small group of people at the top that can cause a company to do things the janitor who's cleaning the bathrooms after hours isn't the in the control group that person doesn't do it so my argument has been all along\nPut the control group and put up with a whole lot of ... president all of them or if you know that then\nPut the board of directors in there too that will send a signal to the to everybody that you got a mind your peas in choosing you guys do things right where are you going to be held accountable and and so if you just start doing some kind of group incarceration Z or I Want to have to do too many before they wake up\nExactly exactly\nWhat what are the odds of that ever happening Jeff ... it's never going to have well let me ask you let me ask you how it can be made to happen\n[laughter] [noise] well if like eighty percent of the country started voting\n[laughter] if Bernie Sanders where president or Elizabeth Warren were president ah and we had a strong democratic uh you know group of people with a bunch of spines in the house and Senate and\nAnd we had you know then ... you know that kind of trickled down if I can use the phrase to the regulatory bodies right and then it could happen if we could\nJust as a point I've been trying to make and you seem like a smart guy so you get it\nWe can have whatever we want we really can't undo the United States Constitution as it exists now we can have\nWhatever we want we get a Medicare for all you know free college we can do the transaction tax on Wall street we can do any ... any policy that any liberal or progressive as ever proposed on this show we can have it there's nothing standing in our way except\nPowell and to have power you need to win elections and to win elections you gotta work really hard and once you wind power you got to use it the way I look at how\nThe Republicans are using it you've got to be tough and they're tough and the Democrats don't know how to win elections they don't know what to do save one me like I mean it's it's sad to watch but the truth is if if if the citizenry\nGot angry enough and got aroused enough and was willing to stick with it long enough and have no short attention span and engage in truly a you know listen to the show for example is that oh this is out of the system works\nThey wouldn't need to be socialists they wouldn't need to be democratic socialist they wouldn't need to be arguing with me about who is too close to Wall Street they would understand that the real key is to take over their county their village their town their city first their county\nFirst and everything beneath the county the city the village first then the state then the members of the\nHouse in the Senate US Senate from that state\nDoes Hillary and Wall Street stuff is irrelevant the way the system works as a state based system and you take over your state and the Republicans know this look what they've done their clothes their close to having enough states under their control the call brand new constitutional convention and if they do that we're all in very deep trouble\n\nCountry you know the polls this fall\nNo matter how times have changed but you know what now is it changing back again just\nFollow one where they\n[noise]\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase
