I look I got to leave it there because our two was behind those hours three seconds let's see if we can do this one a little smoother where justice is served [noise]\nWe all make promises big and small tested over time in distance tried by circumstances decisions\nI pledge allegiance to the flag\nOf the United states of America\nI Do solemnly swear to bear true faith and belief [noise]\nThe

hurricane Michael has grown to a category three storm and is expected to pack a wallop when it makes landfall on the Florida Panhandle meteorologist Tom said her since the storm surge will be life threatening\nSo that's it anyway let me run the show and when I say you're on the air just get to the point and we'll have a wonderful conversation I'd like to discuss the merits I'd love to discuss the merits of the topic I don't want to discuss the extraneous stuff\nHow I handled the previous call this and that and the other thing Paul your professional you called talk just you know how this works for crying out loud\nIt doesn't really matter norm whether socialism leads to whatever it is a cook out of the people there is no there is no pure form of economic theory anywhere in the world anywhere there's no clear socialism\nThere's no cure communism never was Russia was never communist number was what right to totalitarianism and\nIt's drifting back to its oligarchy go up conservative or divine right a monarchy roots\nDesires and that's what\nThey were were drifting towards the pure economic system is right here you see what the right wing wants is pure capitalism on capitalism where you work your money words or who works as other people for a lot less\nAnd this is what cracks me up is while all this crap and goes on and my mom can points on social different right arm or three [laughter]\nA Supreme Court justice the most recently confirm Supreme Court justice hold the distinction I think of being the only Supreme Court justice confirmed with out a majority of\nVotes from the Senate drew fifty votes couldn't get to one vote for him to be an arm you had a sixty what\nThe minority rated so you can't even apply to a federal judge the federal bench\nAre getting ... justice is kind of hard fought not even a majority of all it's not about whether or not showing them really don't know what ever well\nBut then it's my fault 'cause I brought the topic up because I've been waiting to\nHave that moment I thought the moment presented itself and I loved that Bernie Sanders example of who owns the Brooklyn Dodgers and so I just been waiting at the moment on this one ball and and the Green Bay Packers in socialism is going to buy stock image you have to have money I don't know too many homeless people might not get a Green Bay Packers in any event\nThat there's ... there's no pure example here are the only parent sample like of communism I can think of where the Israeli bought ... existed in like the night\nBeing late forties and fifties I think there's still room left these and they lasted about Fifteen Years I think there's still you\nCan follow it look good to start it any more than what I had some of my own stuff to\nWell I think there's still a few left but I\nMy I I have a very very dim view of human beings and and I include myself in there I'm Serious I Am a very dim view of human beings from my observation of near sixty years human beings are disease on this planet I'm Sorry that's the line from the matrix by the way I'm not going to be accused the blaze arising but I mean look\nAt look at human look at what we've done look at what we've\nDone to this planet and this notion that we're all going to work together in some cooperative way for the greater good are you out of your mind\nLook man we could have been doing that all along I don't wear\nWhat by what magic picks the dust is be are people going to start all of a sudden be cooperative and working together for the greater good and ... in the greater self interest when when did that happen why how\nIs that going to be achieved if not by a government to tell the carrion system in forcing it on people which by definition can't be socialism because socialism by definition is the group working cooperatively together which means it's democratic\nOkay but Norma let me speak to the progressive here to 'cause I I can see it all happening all over again just for four weeks from today for the elections for weeks from today I I've told people this because of the\nYou know I I Would when I was in college normally that United the same age\nI learned about feminism I learned about feminist issues my very first one is your class what feminists wage or I mean I was ready for a dad and glorious dining and Mary daily and ... and then I was I was also on my eyeballs I'm going what is this stuff about I just come off the rock and roll stage are from Jordan\nAnd I got out and let me find a girlfriend of the cars you finally drunk driving through my head and it sounds to me that this kind of a confirmation hearing went through in the in in what thirty some years later\nI got to say that storm here the progress of purity idea I when I'm going to vote in my local elections from the bottom of the\nBallad I mean the most the office that I can vote for my out\nAll the way up through the U.S congressional districts and the governor\nAre all Democrats as a matter of fact in my legislative district state of Washington legislative district there are any Republicans running for senator stay centered or two Democrats running against each other\nAnd for the for the represented by two robs it was two Democrats two independent you can't say Republican all the Democrats that are going to represent me they're not all the most progressive Democrats that I've ever met 'em all\nPersonally they're not all the most progressive Democrats I've ever met in the world they're not my ideal but somehow there's this energy that Washington state keeps moving in that direction that even though not any of them is the most progressive very person in the world we keep moving in that\nThe right just bumping along I'm just trying to find a way for all of us to live together without killing his show in the process and\nIf we go and we're going to spend each day as it rolls by ripping each other limb from limb overpass transgressions were going to just keep letting the

norm\nAll right so we're talking about employee owned companies right or employee managed companies were employed companies you you had two examples where employees have a say in who gets hired who gets fired I that's where we left off a socialism involves the the\nSocial the public ownership of the means of production so far there companies where the employees own everything and run everything that you can name\n[noise] not necessarily entirely no no I'm not that I'm aware of I mean I'm certain there are probably small businesses out there were where\nThis family owned businesses perhaps where thousands in all ... all work together cooperatively but from what I've seen from what I've seen about families that probably isn't ... so lovely [laughter]\nBut but uh but I Do think like you said we need to have a a hybrid economy and one of the things that I found interesting when you were talking about capitalism\nIs that you did sort of you didn't mention the word profit in your definition of capitalism and that it is in essence is what\nAllows capitalism or at least the capital list to survive in our economy if there was no such thing as profit you could not have capital capital lift you could still have capitalism and at private ownership\nWell the reason I didn't do that because the different the definition of socialism is the public ownership of the means of production and capitalism is the private ownership of the music production so I just I didn't go into profits because to me the basic test is who owns the means of production\nAnd and so we'll that's the acid test that that's the pregnancy question all you're pregnant or you're not pregnant there's no middle ground who owns this stuff where all the forms who owns the factories is it private or is it public and you can't you can't and that's it just tell me if you want to say you know the ...\nIn America the constitution says its own privately but the government regulated in taxes and so all of that pre suppose a profit so Dave I mean yes but but private ownership of the means of production kinda\nAssumes in it that there's profit no\nWell not necessarily not necessarily there are small businesses all around this country who\nExisted don't rely on profit\nYeah like this one for example this one's never made a profit\nBut there are a lot of there are a lot of small companies that exist because most of their money goes and I'm not saying I'm not saying that they can't put money aside for investments or for for other means but there's a link ledgers that are set up for that\nUh okay so that so you could say I'm going to allocate ten percent of everything that we sell to a future\nExpansion okay that's not necessarily profit that's allocating a certain amount of income toward that anything over that can that be booted back maybe to the employees\nWhat I'm saying is that in a fair system where things are equal the money going out ... the the the money coming in from the sale of a product should eat all the money\nInvested in the work invested in the production of that product and if those things balance out and it works great why do you have to have profit\nOr because the private owner of the music production wants profit to make a living to pay his or her own bill to provide for their family\nRight but could not be accounted for and simply wages in a ledger\nArt center on a sister who was going to mandate this is bad and it starts with a G right they who's going to mandate the system starts with a G ... true government right that's\nTrue and I agree with you I agree with you there there has to be some way of doing\nI'm no fan of big government I mean I don't know I I'm sick and tired of people call me a progressive and liberal as I have big government I don't know I'm afraid of big government I'm afraid of big business too But Dave I got I got to leave it there I hear you loud and clear I think\nThat we are not looking at recent and past history I really do because if we look at how human beings have actually done it and are doing it now I think that would give us a really good set of clues and ends\nInto how people behave just looking at this is sociology you look at how people behave and you say wow look at how their baby this is what they're doing and you write it down to chronicle it\nAnd so in terms of just socialism versus communism and capitalism and all this stuff\nWhen I'm trying to do is just get us understand what the heck these terms mean first of all and then we'll take a look around the world is any of this has been done and so the reason I did this by the way is frankly I've been watching all these people one around call themselves socialist number run around all these people call themselves Democrats even the Democratic socialism America and stuff\nI mean you know you don't need it\nPeople who call themselves socialist in democratic socialist also probably fit the label of liberal or progressive at least and so all I'm saying is get to the policy\nYou want Medicare for all you want strong Social Security you want free public education for everybody\nIt'll take you ten trillion years and you'll never succeed trying to turn America into a socialist nation you're taking a side road ... into it into a cul de sac in the dead right then\nAnd now do it if you really care about the policies and this is my challenge my challenge to the liberals in the progressive if you care about the policy just stop calling some liberal and progressive because you know winning that way if you care about the policies will stop pulling yourself socially\nThat's what you do is you call yourself a patriot you'll fight them for the word patriots you'll see you believe in the constitution because the constitution gives you every means to the ends that you want\nYou want Medicare for all constitutional do it for anything and everything you want to give me a policy you want and I'll show you how the constitution can do it and it's easy it's one eight eight eight three two one six zero zero one\nHobby thank you for calling from Chicago hobby year\nAre you doing today ... little worked

tonight it's about Obamacare right I I play these you know these little dropping clips here where you know like Dr Cornel West saying hey this is life and death we're talking about here right now in the game were playing so\nIt's always about policy very often we get lost in the details in the minutiae of the of the gamesmanship of the Senate and the house and all that and we have that exact situation in tonight's beyond the norm because there is a very complex kind of maneuver in the Senate\nThat was used to try to overturn a thing that was done to overturn another thing and it's easy to get lost in that\nWell what I did I think I did we already recorded his I think I top list that I think his mission accomplished is to take that complexity and just you know take that bolus spaghetti a kind of make it straight so that we can understand that all of the fighting\nOver all of the detail and all of them and knew that can be so frustrating and make us why throw up our hands and say I'll never understand this we need to understand this\nBecause we don't understand this Obamacare gets destroyed because it's always about policy it's about cannabis legalization it's about roe versus Wade it's about Medicare for all it's always about policy really important policy that impact people's lives so if you're beyond the norm or I thank you so very much\nTen dollars a month goes a long way when you add it to everybody else was beyond the norm are and we still are short so if you're a beyond the norm or thank you and if you're not you get a lot for ten bucks for a month or a hundred dollars a year at Norman Goldman dot com you get all of the show\nAll three hours without any commercials on your schedule it short as a show without the commercial breaks and of course you get the extra segment a day and that's what I was just talking about\nA really really interesting law civics in politics class that all comes together on Benedict Donald's attempt to destroy Obamacare and the machinations machinations in the Senate and Congress to try and overturn it and they failed alternately in this ...\nPardon me this politics in it so if you're a beyond the norm or\nI Try and give you extra value thank you so very very much and\nIf you've been part of the team here for any time\nAt all you understand that\nUh you know I got into politics very very early\nUh basically I was four when President Kennedy was assassinated and and my mom was ironing and crying at the same time with the black and white TV with the rabbit ear antennas right Walter Cronkite telling the nation the president's just been murdered right and so that kind of had an impact on these little four year old and your mom is standing there ironing and crying and\nI still have that image you know it's it you have almost like the the has the right to memory the memory seared in there\nAnd so that's not my attention I was like wow this is very interesting stuff that my mom crying\nAnd my dad was very interested in politics and he got me interested in politics and so we watch the CBS Evening news with Walter Cronkite was on seven o'clock then and I asked my dad questions you know they're very very he was always very nice and he was always very helpful and\nTaught me stuff and I we read the paper together and I'd ask them questions and he got me going and I had been a political junkie since President Kennedy was assassinated so\nI spent a lifetime learning this stuff working in it working on campaigns doing the lawyer thing and so for me politics and advocacy and fighting for the little people and you know those clips that we play we care about this month ... about this for the right and do some meaning vote\nFor it it's all it all comes to us\nWe each go on our own path and our own roads and I trust you know that you're living your life and it's taking its own course than it's unique to you and nobody else's walked your path and nor nor can anybody do it so\nJohn Legend I Hope you know John Legend is John Legend is a major major do raise a musician John Legend a ... did in ...\nYou will see NBC CNBC and John Legend was talking about how he got involved in civic engagement and and public politics and all this kind of stuff and he's and he he was he won an essay contest when he was Fifteen Years old\nAnd by the time it was Fifteen John Legend but that was Fifteen Years old he was he ... he wrote an essay said I'm going to become a famous musician and use my fame to bring justice and and and you know goodness to the world and I think it's fantastic John Legend came to politics young\n... kill ... for a two to criticize from substantially yeah because he deserves the criticism he's done some awful things in America as a way is I think a a really terrible person as well\nThere you go I mean ... that's ... that's John Legend and he wasn't done\nIt doesn't matter whether you like this guy personally what matters is what he's doing and officers she's chosen to do is use um the office as a tool for white supremacy to say we don't want certain immigrants coming from certain countries because they don't look a certain way\nOf treating immigrants like their animals separating families and it's not enough to say\nHe's a polite he's racist he says things that are about other people but if you put his policies at the actual uh they cause real consequences for people and it's and it's just not really debatable whether those consequences are awful they're pretty awful\nThere you go there's John Legend as I'm sure you can imagine I don't disagree with any of that I think he's a you know obviously right and he's not missing words and I'm really really happy that John Legend is using his fame and his celebrity\nFor the good for the cause for all of us he's a sane normal and path that feeling decent intelligent human beings we need 'em all because these are very very very difficult times\nSince the war and [noise] and every single word given out

degree murder in Illinois is not that significant second degree murder is actually like an offshoot of first degree murder under an Illinois state well\nThis shows you the difference between the different state laws and it's it's actually a lesson federalism I mean there's no joking around them because the fact that it's Illinois state law says that it's not California state law or Iowa State law every state gets do its own thing\nAnd that is significant because in a lot of jurisdictions you don't have to charge second degree murder separately it's known as a lesser included offense depends on the jurisdiction and it can be and sometimes it is and I'm not saying this is I'm not practicing law on the air I'm just trying to point out differences from state to state\nAnd so ... and and in many cases even if it's not murder you'll get a charge of assault and there are what are known is lesser included offense is under assault and they are they are still crimes but each of the lesser included offenses\nAre still crimes they're less served in terms of the severity and the punishment\nBut they are kind of in the same line there's subsidiary to the main crime so apparently and I'm a California license attorney only but from what you've told me I think I can make a reasonable inference that under Illinois law the prosecutor has\nTo charge the specific crime and then the judge gives a jury instruction and I know from the news reports when I when when the trial was happening and I was following it I remember reading and hearing in the news reports that the judge had\nInstructed the jury on second degree murder and I said wow that is a very very wise move for the prosecutor because there could be one juror him remembers a criminal case you need unanimous\nRight beyond a reasonable doubt unanimous jury beyond a reasonable doubt if you're insisting on first degree murder you're running the risk that one jurors going I just can't I I Will go there and you get a hung jury by giving them the option of second degree murder it's not supposed to happen\nAnd they teach it that it's not supposed to have it but you end up with well known this compromise verdicts whether they're explicit or implicit the jurors say yeah we can't really agree on a first degree so will agree on second degree\nAnd and so if that was the move of the prosecutor in this case it was a a smart move big ... and I'm sure it was a season prosecutor who said hey\nI think the jury might have a problem with first degree murder I may not be able to get all well beyond a reasonable doubt so let me give them an option for ... for what is essentially a lesser included a fence and at least getting convicted a second degree and then I I I agree it really moved up to at sixteen counts\nOf basically Elvis solved a you know for for one for each bullet I think that's really and if it's true under Illinois law those cannot\nBe concert served concurrently 'cause normally when you get things you know sense of like this district concurrently if you get six terms of six years each you just served six years and is not ... it's one day served is one day off of each of the sixth sense is that ... current\nAnd that is that the typical way it's done normally it's done concurrence is weird and it's not usual where it's done consecutive although judges can do it in the last and says\nYou know you have the option or not and so if it's true under Illinois law that he that that the judge doesn't have any wiggle room I I don't know I don't know whether the law it would be a heck of a sense you know sixteen\n... even even if he gives them one year per that's still sixteen years just for the assault charges\nWell there's other issues that are due to drop in this case\nUm the next time everybody's doing quarters October thirty first of but sentencing probably will not take place some bad according to the recent reporting but\nThere are several of the police officers

pretty difficult to get a Chicago Cab for lying about what happened to that at the scene of a crime\nA but apparently in this case or what they asked him it's so\nObvious that the some of the other
