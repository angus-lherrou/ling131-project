me\nYes and are now getting back to a Trump's a soldier learn to Pittsburgh [noise]\nI Am you know I Will say this first of all I'm not Jewish\nAnd so don't really know you know what you know type of things you know people are going to everybody's mind however\nI really wish that they had a lock the doors of the synagogue and that the either the rabbi or one of the you know of leaders of the congregation simply stood there and said you may not critter Trump you may not enter this temple\nYou your presence will file this set the temple it is your language of hate\nAnd the trail that caused this you know leave us do not enter\nAnd there isn't really bar Benedict dollar from entering the synagogue\nApps yes ... said and I heard that when I heard [laughter] cow [laughter] does not only only you know ask [laughter] how many syllables does it take to say an absolutely that's I don't know\nIf any rate\nYou know I Wish that you know I again I don't know what the repercussions would have been although realistically\nYou know it's it's not going to make the anti Semite anymore anti Semitic and I think that that temple you know it's got a you know\nUh basically at target on it right now and I think that they you know it's I hopefully the but the I'm sure the Pittsburgh Police car act aggressively protect you know patrolling it\nBut I think that will be a target you know four years in the future also but I I Can't I Wish that he had done and make a statement like that I Would be curious about your\nYou know few if you think that that would have been the right decision to make\nPhone it certainly would have been a statement\nI mean they get to decide what is best for them and what you're suggesting is are they any moment of very very wrong motion to then throw in a super hot political controversy by physically barring the door and making that kind of statement\nI would've done it\nBut it's easy for me on the sidelines out in the peanut gallery to say that\nIt's very easy to say this\nI yeah I mean responsibility and I'm Glad you noticed that but I mean at that shows that you're a good person you are an honest person does you have the ability to recognize that you're sitting in your home or wherever you're sitting and it's easy to have\nAn opinion that but when you're in the responsible position and Chris I knew lawyers back when I was practicing in the day and they were very partisan lawyers for their clients and you know they get on the bench and I figured ... and then they start making rulings ... you know it's like that's not what I expected this because their capacity changed it became a judge and they said my role has changed now\nAnd that's what responsibility does and so for the rabbi the the people who are responsible that synagogue they have they would have had the responsibility on their shoulders to to like bar the door and say you have to file everything in your horrible and go away\nYou know it would've been quite a thing I mean ... do you think that would have just with the bonfire even higher\nNo I mean how you know if\nThe if a if it's already in flames you know a little more gasoline going to change their views as I said I don't believe that it's going it would make the anti Semite anymore anti Semitic I don't think it would have you know the Trump I are out there\nThey would feel like I don't think it would make them hate him any more hate the Jews any less or any more I think it would not affected at all I think quite honestly it would be I think it would be a real shot in the army\nAnd shining doesn't shunning work I mean Trump invited the leaders of the of both houses of Congress Democrats or Republicans nobody went with him none of the city for Asians were there I mean they were running and\nBill able to get a get make the nice little gesture of oh here I Am I'm the unifier and\nWhat you need a bad ... look at the optics of this if the rabbi done what you're talking about who would have been the bad guy\nWith a rabbi would have been standing up for me it would be sitting there and standing barring the door you know be it would be like if you will to choose a different religion Martin Luther you know nailing you know his up both on the on the chair and they ... the ... door\nOr would have been perceived as George Wallace of Alabama's standing in the doorway to the college saying segregation now segregation viable\nNo he said they saying we will not allow evil to come in and\nDoesn't already George Wallace said no I don't I don't\nWant to Simon ... George Wallace you'd say you'd integration is evil I mean all those Republicans down a pardon me they weren't Republicans and Democrats or independent or independence but I mean there were Republicans non ...\nThere weren't Dixiecrats they Dixiecrats right well Chris look here's here's all I've got which is they made their decision I mean we can say well we can say and I appreciate you stick\nWith me I got to keep it going but Chris they made their decision they allow them in and so my perspective is is that Benedict Arnold is the bad guy and you know\nHey DC for a limited time measurement you can get killed complete pair of glasses frames lenses that work for just forty nine dollars on single life as an eighty nine dollars on the ground that and that's a good deal but we offer that pricing on over five hundred at France which makes it a great deal of right now\nBy to complete a single they can glasses protests forty nine dollars or two pairs of progressive\nVision with just a darker Baltimore's champion get serious limited reserve yours today on secure innovations Facebook page\n[noise] our\nHey they're Norman so you know as concerns gun violence this is the fiftieth\nAnniversary of when Robert Kennedy was murdered in law sent um Los Angeles by gun and since that time and this this is since twenty sixteen by now it's been more there's been more people killed by gun violence done and all and all the battlefield end all wars in\nHistory when this has been this has been ... ... yeah some this has been verified as mainly true by snopes with some degree of allowance for ...\nOr a whole day with me you get to do the rare triple segment call and that's not that's very special where justices or\nIndeed knows finding the right higher takes time away from your business hiring unqualified data engineer felt like a second job more job seekers using deep than any other site so there's no better place to find someone with the skills you're looking for I needed someone with a masters in computer science and database experience\nWas indeed screener questions hope you find your shortlist fast now I'm back to having just one job see one more than three million companies worldwide using the higher poster job in ... dot com slash higher indeed the world's number one job site source ... guy\nResents I witnessed interviews with inanimate objects\nThis isn't Belinda ... live on the scene of a recent hailstorm here to describe the events of all\n...

be turning out in pretty good numbers even young people so\nIf it turns out this is a giant I F this is the biggest friday or if a big chunk of the Republicans a bigger chunk of the independents and a

all the time\nAnd and even stuff I don't subscribe to go out and I look at other stuff that I don't look at\nQuite as regularly but there's one group but I'm not going to mention their names because it's not fair\nThey just sent me earlier today a massive setter revisions to their projections in in the upcoming elections\nAnd for the most part like three quarters or even four fifths of the changes there was like thirty different races house and Senate\nAnd they were changing most of them were the Republicans were in more and more trouble there were couple where they said the Democrat is it more and more trouble at two of the races where they said the Democrats in more more and more trouble is the Senate race in Missouri that's Claire McCaskill\nAnd the Senate race in North Dakota that's Heidi Heitkamp that this organization is moving them from a from leans Republican to pretty much Republican\nAnd so that if they are right that means two Senate seats are going from the Democrats the Republicans that's Missouri in North Dakota but here's the thing is why I'm not mentioning the name because I don't believe them\nI don't believe them I don't think the polling can really be accurate this time around because and it's\nSomething I Want to give ... to shout out here he's our friend on Fridays right now today is not friday but you can find out at NBC News dot com

give Alex the credit because he's the one who put it this way and he did it on our show a couple of weeks ago he said the composition of the electorate and that's the phrase the pays as they say in radio and I think this election even more than the last\nOne the composition of the electorate is is going to tell us everything because\nIf you're a big chunk of Republicans just abandon the Republican Party if an even bigger chunk of independence just abandon the Republican Party and the Democrats turnout really big numbers than the composition of the electorate is going to just wash\nAway a lot of these poll numbers the poll numbers are using models as best they can but when the composition of the electorate changes dramatically the polls can't capture it that well although although the polls are seen something\nOf a headline coming out of a U.S the LA Times poll it is a political earthquake\nI that's the Joe Scarborough clip and we think MSNBC for that so we've got six

contact with Mueller which you work with him ... years ago with a law firm and that he was never inappropriate or second woman who has been identified who spoke to reporters in recent days tells a similar story about being offered payment saying she never had any encounters with the special counsel\nThat it's your time is of ABC News when we think ABC News for that and what we have now is the

them was ... they withdrew the screen and he agreed to testify but it was quite obvious Bill Clinton knew that if he pressed the question of this being a from from my Ken Starr that he was going to

more heavily democratic\nOr the independence moving to the Democrats or Republicans staying home if Republicans are staying home if just marginal shift remember when you talk about margins we're talking about just little bits on the edges here right a marginal shift as a one or two percent shift and look\nHillary got roughly the same number of votes in his last them going to say on it 'cause I I think I'm be missed one death\nHillary in twenty six team got roughly very close to the exact same number of votes as Obama didn't twenty twelve ... twelve not the first ... second time Hillary got almost the exact same number of total votes\nAnd Trump in twenty sixteen got virtually the exact same number of votes as Romney in twenty twelve the numbers for twenty twenty sixteen were eerily similar\nAnd on Halloween things should be eerie but\nThere were these will shift for Hillary she shifted downward for Hillary she shifted a little bit here and they came up Jordan Michigan came up a little bit short Pennsylvania ... will be short in Wisconsin right voter suppression out a lot to do with that\nA lot of factors prudent but what I'm saying is is that the composition of the electorate is crucial and if we see an electorate this coming Tuesday that appears to be the electorate that is going getting you know very very active\nThat I don't think any of these models or any of these polls really going to be all that productive\nAnd I give out of sight for all the credit for all of that and I think he's right and so that's that's where we are right now I Will have\nA big

All right so that's Randy hold runs ... is that the fourteenth yeah that's a ...\nRandy Hultgren okay he's a ... a Republican it's been there for some time and if this was the ... if there's ever a time to get them out this is the year but King County is kind of gone democratic because of ... and the whole you know mark Daley tell me you know mark Daley\nI don't actually\nIt's spelled Google it's spelled G you it's kind of a different spelling G. U. E. T. H. L. E. but it's pronounced ... as in a gate and then look but it's spelled G. U. E. T. H. L. E. he's\nI think he's still the chair of the Kane county Democratic Party K. A. N. E. I Know you know it's ... we've got people listening everywhere and and Kane county used to be a very Republican area there was some development I mean there's been some development that brings Democrats when you get more of an urban area\nBut our gate we did a lot of work and a lot of people helped him and he's a very very season guy and do page county\nThere's a guy Bob ... who did very much the same thing\nThey they took a red county and made it you know Bob pie crust and the egg of a job getting a lot of people a ... page to vote democratic it's more going more to more democratic I've gotten emails from people said the Republicans do pager freaking out now and they're sending memory I\nHave lots of Democrats get looked into pay just trying to pull the fire alarm so I've gotten those emails and I send them off the bump my garden and on our friends that W CBD saying look what good we're doing here so that the the key is\nThat that organizing and hard work and turning off the clock bath and having no short attention span and saying if you don't win today a win next time in two years one years three years four years and I went in eight years and I'll just win and keep going at it\nThat's really the the key to the thing the Republicans for fifty years ago right now Nineteen sixty eight George Wallace was saying you want to hear ... eleven seconds just listen to this\nIt got some that do a lot of that word that\nThere are also a heroin overdose or I was\nBeing handled by a bunch of long had pot smoking hippies who are giving them if you see the video of this is a lot of video of George Wallace back then I mean the the the white kids were really heckling him and they were given a Nazi salutes or giving them the finger and he didn't he didn't appreciate\nAll of that so he got into it with them but the George Wallace of fifty years ago was Benedict Arnold right now\nIt has taken this nation it's taken the cancer\nThat is Benedict Arnold and his deplorable it's taken them half\nA century exactly Nineteen sixty eight twenty Eighteen to go from fringe George Wallace KKK southern based Nazis to now in control the entire US government\nBest I can now I Know it's Halloween and that to me that's a perfect Halloween metaphor\nThat is the ultimate horrible example but it's a wonderful example horrible but wonderful of no short attention span of turning off the clock and best whenever I have\nThis conversation I get emails to Norman Norman Goldman dot com saying norm I understand that but they've got a lot of structural advantages they've done it or a never ending river of money the Koch brothers and every giant corporation they've been a jacket with Citizens United so they have all this money and with the money you can buy all the talent you can organize\nYou can do things like you know with the with the uh the tea bags one at the buses and they fed them and they you know struggled them around so they can go hassle\nThe Democrats and so yes the Republicans have some well built in advantages they've got that whole electoral votes system per state right they've got two senators birth dates even junkie him on American states like Wyoming in\nIdaho South Dakota right these these a phase where they need to learn out of Being American they get two senators even though they got fourteen people with a group of puppies I mean this is unfair it's fundamentally structurally unsound and\nThe minorities now running this country so what do we do about it best\nShe's actually out raised the Republican ... like it's been pretty interesting and the first time the Democrats actually send somebody out there so they sent Joe Biden out the county\nI'm really happy to see him before\nAnd you answered the question is perfectly you out raise them you at work them us hustle them you out organize them and best I Would like you and me to just remember the lessons of George Wallace and Donald Trump ... because there's there's no getting around\nThe lesson of George Wallace and Donald Trump is that they are the same\nGuy and they went from nobody fringe e laughed at why go\nTo in the in the White House and in control of all three branches of government they got Supreme Court now to they took them\nHalf a century\nAnd they had reverses in their right they didn't like Bill Clinton at eight years of Bill Clinton and like any of that\nThat for years a Jimmy Carter oh my God Jimmy Carter right that the deal with the black guy oh my God there was a black guy in a while I was in in order to you can make right they don't like any of this stuff\nBut they didn't say oh that's an arguable ball it's all over though and throwing hysterical temper tantrum and run away like a bunch of children they said okay we'll work around it will take some more time that this is the magic of\nTurning off the clock and organizing hope I've made a decent case what are you there yeah [laughter] well ... you're wearing Kane county are if you don't
