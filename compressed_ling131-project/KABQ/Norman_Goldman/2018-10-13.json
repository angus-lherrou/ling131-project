I'm Sorry I got to pronounce your name right so that but it's a it's still your point though she's not resigning in protest she's resigning to get herself extricate it from a mess\nYeah she really felt that worked in the journal for them to speak out she didn't do that so she's sugar savvy politician and she's going to try and play it down the middle and trying to avoid a changing because she was probably like most of them\nI think you're right I I tell you Fred you made a made a compelling case you can you convince me I got to leave it there because there's still time that we have to cover on other things afraid that was awesome and I thank you very very much I suspect you're right that's the\nI think would do is put herself in her shoes and look through the world through our eyes and say what's best for me let me let me stay friendly with Trump and all those people when I got to get out of your that makes perfect sense\nYou know it does not make any sense whatsoever why we keep having white police officers shooting young black men I don't know if he's seen this story but twenty five year old he will never see his twenty six birthday twenty five year old Daniel ...\nWas running away from a cop three shots one hand him in the back\nOf my head when police are seen them while he's off on\nWith the ... you can [noise] he's won them police officers chasing the Holocaust cases\nAwful places along with his long while some plans plows\n[noise]\nPolice officers song for Tom way involved well written down\nInto the ground [noise]\nTo be tough [noise]\n\nCampbell around sometimes\nThey did the same thing with Michael Brown you remember that in Ferguson, Missouri that that voice was Joyce kimbro she is a lawyer and she represents family of Daniel ...\nBy the way the officer has been arrested and charged with with I Am trying to figure out which degree I Am I'm ... I'm I'm quite gotten there yet some degree of murder I'm quite figured out which it research will continue however\nAn autopsy the reason that we now know that there were three bullets them from mine is because the autopsy shows this didn't happen yesterday this happened weeks ago and we're only hearing about it now but once again if and when I started seeing seeing the story and reading about it I said oh this is just like Walter Scott\nDo you remember Walter Scott in South Carolina running away from a police officer police officer pulled out his gun fired eight bullets five of them hid Walter Scott from behind and the only reason we know about because there was a bystander on a with a cell phone with video righty video the whole thing\nAnd the officer you know calmly just aimed at him and bang bang bang and then dropped the taser next to poor Walter Scott as he's leaning dining underground and and tried to frame him said oh he tried to grabbed my taser\nYou remember that right so this continues to happen\nThe Supreme Court has said very clearly don't shoot if people running away from you\nThat mess has been pretty clear don't shoot if people running away from me there are other ways to apprehend them don't fire shots but yet we still see if we continue to see it and it's really really a shame you know what else is a shame Facebook is in cleaning up its act we found

sites wall he is a reporter at NBC News dot com NBC News dot com MSNBC dot com is on TV MSNBC we've been reviewing weeks with alec science wall almost since the beginning and Alex is always great to have you back\nOn the norm and Goldman join another crazy week paint on thanks for having me\nIt's always the right way to end the week with you and we've got to end the week the way we started it which is Brett Kavanaugh he was jammed onto the Supreme Court last weekend\nAnd on Monday he took his seat but there is continuing lingering litigation their complaints about him that have been referred to the tenth circuit Jerry ... said he's a Democrat in the house the nerdy said if he gets the Judiciary Committee gamble in the majority in January he's going to re investigate\nCabin all this promises lots more evidence coming out against a Alex have we heard the last of the brain Kavanaugh case\nI'd I Know I think we have not I mean\nHe's on the court and it's basically a settled for now but usually that would be it first or justice and then uh you know and until they're\nPassage from this model birther until they decided to step down that would be it a but there is an outside chance that we'll be hearing a lot more Brett\nBrett Kavanaugh especially if Democrats take back the house\nAs you said Jerry nether it'd be the chairman of the district committee wants to bring investigate this stuff at the FBI looked into but you know kind of Chris Wray investigation\nThere's a lot of other stuff out there and they're even calls for his impeachment there was a Christian going around that got like a hundred and fifty thousand signatures a large group actually of House Democrats basically the entire congressional progressive caucus sent a letter to Trump last week\nSaying that if they found Kevin not to be lying under oath which I think we can imagine that the progressive caucus probably thinks he did then that's an impeachable offense\nSo you know we have an impeached ah Supreme Court justice since\nI Believe is Eighteen oh four or something like that we've only done it once and and that was Samuel Chase you the cornered by George Washington himself\nAnd he was not removed from the bench so I don't think this is likely I don't think people should be holding out hope that Brett Kavanaugh is going to be impeached and and even less likely that he'd be moved because you need two thirds of the Senate or to do that\nBut I think it is very possible that if Democrats retake the house\nThere'll be new questions raised new clouds raised around by Kevin I Would just continue to\nUndermine the legitimacy of the court has ruling and it's ... or ... next to his name\nWell it was my thought that the only way we'll get them off the court is to hound them off the court and it seems to me that's kind of the way it's going to happen we're just constant\nScandal mongering and drip drip drip of new evidence and it seems to me at some point is just going to have\nTo quit and the Supreme Court chief justice that has been my argument the chief justice should be the target just telling them you're courts illegitimate we don't accept your rulings were going to do everything we can to not obeying we spit in your face we laugh in your face I'm Sorry I mean not physically literally spit in your face but I mean the Republicans have and\nDenigrated every institution they were spitting on John Lewis and congressman when they were walking into a vote on Obamacare I Am so basically says they destroy the institutions we don't respect yours anymore get Gorsuch Ann Cavanaugh add to their\nPut a mirror going along and maybe we'll start considering you will get them in institution but now it's I'm Sorry I've taken the gloves off as to me I don't consider him legitimate anymore they've destroyed the institution I'm only acknowledging what they've done\nWell I think you're not alone in feeling that way a norm but I think the question is about priorities right we all have been spending a lot of time talking about Brett Kavanaugh on top of mind\nBut uh if Democrats do retake the house there's gonna be a ton of stuff that they're going to want to do during that there will be in a a key point position there there are a potential Trump impeachment would have to go through him everything related to the traditional sorry to the Russia investigation\nHe would have a hand in that sense it evolves the department of justice oversight of whatever Jeff Sessions or whatever else the the new Jeff Sessions if he's going to be a place\nWhatever he's doing would be under the Judiciary Committee\nAnd then you have you know investigations legislation there's a lot that's going on\nUh so I think it'll be a question of whether the ... the Democratic base that the people who you know these are Congress people are held accountable by if that's what they want then I think they'll do that but if they've moved on to other things come January which I think is very possible then it might not be at the top of the agenda as much any more\nWell we're going to keep an eye on that in the news cycle continued Alex this week uh Nikki Haley announced that she's leaving at the end of the year the timing is kinda weird normally those announcements or after the congressional elections\nOr she said you leaving at the end of the year there's plenty of time Abu congratulations to announce them leaving at the er during the holidays there's all kinds of speculation as to Lindsey Graham is going to be a point there's a new attorney general after Trump fire sessions and then she'll be appointed a senator to fill his seat\nAlex is as Washington just wagging their tongues about all this right now\nIt's it's really tough to make predictions about Donald Trump's personnel appointments I Will cautioned that for everyone because you know usually in in normal administrations there's a a fairly large circle of people who\nPut together a list that these people who who get nominations and so that leaks out and then you have an idea about what's in the works with Trump it's basically like it's one guy\nA and he's already been carrying ill and you know in the morning he might say wants to put\nA Jeff Sessions or sorry I I'm a Nikki Haley and and Lindsey Graham Senate seat and do the whole switch through and then by the afternoon he might have changed his mind so uh I I yeah I don't put a lot of stock in that we'll see what happens when it happened but it is very interesting her timing I mean I think she's been one of the most\nPolitically savvy or operators in Trump's ... at\nJust that it's not that far in New York to D.C where where she's a at the un just on the ... a seller right away but that just didn't seem to kind of insulator from a lot of uh what's happened in the White House and the\nControversy and the scandals and she's kind of managed to to be a little bit on tainted by that which is pretty miraculous it's pretty much everyone else that Trump brings into his orbit or gets to try it\nSo I I think she does have a political future or she was quick to rule out running against Trump and twenty twenty you know who knows that can change she didn't sign a contract saying that\nAh but she could also be looking for beyond that she could be\nYou know I think she's she's going to be well positioned or she could go make some money now and if the Republican Party has a real big collapse in ... after Eighteen and twenty of troubles as she could be well positioned to be a kind of you know
