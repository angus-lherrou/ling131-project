intervention isn't about Iran Nineteen fifty I mean why stop with what you're talking about there's a lot more evidence to support what you're saying\nAnd let me just add some some arguments for to your argument ah how about what we did to Pinochet in Chile with Richard Nixon and the CIA and Seventy three on all of us know Ronald Reagan was doing inside Honduras trying to get rid of the uh the Congress and Nicaragua\nThe invasion of grenade on I don't even know if we should count that a Ronald Reagan adventure resume American intervention is um I mean we've been reading it fits in elections

that argument don't you think\nYeah I I Do because nobody call for Congress to task for people in another country what is it that\nThat's part of American exceptionalism I think ... what I'm saying that only with half a snotty tone or because of this whole notion of American exceptionalism kind of leads to that we can go around the world kidnapping torturing and when we want because we're exceptional which is what I've been arguing with these people have been all along they think they're special\nThey think they can do what they want because they're special and no one else can\nIt's the same notion of American exceptionalism there's only one set of rules applying to us that we create\nBut there's a whole other set of rules which we also create that applies to you and guess what they're not the same set\nBecause we're special that's been their argument all along and we've heard it right I Want my country back\nAt that when the black guy got in the White House oh my God they

pro public\nBut now there's a lot of peas and as they are my pop tilted going here\nAnyway pro public or is a private\nOrganization private nonprofit that was seeded with like a lot of money by some very high minded people who said hey print journalism and especially investigative journalism whether it's print or otherwise especially investigative journalism is dying and so\nThe folks behind pro public up and down to fund created a fund then said we're going to support your financial support to investigative journalists who will do investigative journalism\nAnd they will partner up with media outlets that are already established like say for example although the Washington Post write war in this case the New Yorker and that's what we've got here this private nonprofit and they're wonderful I mean\nI'm not mentioning names who's behind them and all because a lot of people quibble with some of the people behind them the point is this is a very good organization and\nLet's just work with that fact okay so pro public oh they're the good guys they do investigative journalism in the public interest they partner up with corporate media outlets to expose facts that we the public should know now pro public up as a woman named Heather Vogel\nWhat the trumps were doing was they would go out and they would publicly say things like you know in ten of my pocket saying well more than Ninety percent sold when in fact they were only Seventy nine percent at that sold at that point and so it was er sixty percent so old when they were only Fifteen Percent sold at that point\nOn Donald

are they able to maybe make\nA legislation sitting in the future where if you deny your right those and there's no good reason you don't have to pay income tax in the state for that [laughter]\nI [laughter] I\nI Would I Would go careful I Would be careful on the whole destruction of government if you don't get your way thing because the Republicans love that\nThe Republicans are always destroying government because they worked for the rich and big business the Republicans their ideas to have as little government as possible one of their guys Grover Norquist said it best he said I Want to shrink government to be so small that I can drag it into the bathroom and drowned in the tub their ideas they want the Republicans in their their their corporate masters\nHave a very simple agenda tia they want no tax on themselves and no regulation of their businesses and if they get those two things they don't care about abortion their daughters are going to get abortions in private medical clinics with private doctors and nurses there you know the gays and they don't get I don't care about the social issues stuff\nBut they know they have to fund the Republican Party which keeps you know feeding red meat to the to the animals to get them to vote you know Jesus and Christian even though it's all you know savings agenda\nBut ah but the key is we need to win elections we need to win election you know and when we win elections will have power and when we have power we can change the law for example the check this one article one section for the U.S constitution says that Congress can dictate to the states all their voting procedures and\nIf the if if there were a heavily Democratic Congress where the Democratic president Congress\nCould say you know all of this election shenanigans that we've been seeing and all the hooliganism we've been seeing by the Republicans enough of that or the Congress invokes article one section of war and they say here's a set of rules for every body were preempting the field you're at the state you out you proven you can't handle it you're done\nAnd the states can do it I mean that the states will be toast that's it\nThat's constitution says it very clearly what you need the power to be able to do it you need to state legislatures to drawn lines that are fair and free rights everybody gets it cleans just actually winning an election rather than bringing in fixing the process you gotta win elections and to do that you have to vote and you have to do it in big numbers and\nThese days you got overcome all the rigging and fixing they've already put into place and that means we have to come up with an extra margin of votes we have to turn out fifty five fifty six fifty seven percent is not enough to go fifty percent plus one because they were getting fixed it\nBy not thank you so much actually made me a little more optimistic and I appreciate it and I'm gonna join your cat\nYou're very sweet that's very kind

fashioned loophole to immigration laws ... of\nCourse his party runs everything he's a liar but he uh he the thing he did was the ... gene forty the Republican congressman who beat up and Jacob's border\nAny guy that you're doing body slammed Mica\nThat's what everybody's going for my argument is is it Benedict Donald doesn't give a rat's rear end about any of this stuff it's all done quite intentionally you get us all melting down I see it as a tactic\nI'm not fallen sport I'm smarter than am I was smarter than him when I was six years old and I'm just I'm asking you to just look at it and say he's not an American and that's the way to really deal with this guy\nIt oh did I say that this guy this guy here's how you deal with this guy All right when he does a stunt and ... like this what we do\nInstead of falling for we say are\nYou are not an American you're not a patriot Benedict Donald you have just shown us again why you are fundamentally anti American why you're so unpatriotic because what you have done is you have used violence\nAs a tool and you of encourages violence as a tool against the press\nAgainst anybody else there many find people in Charlottesville that is so radically fundamentally on American because in America we settled disputes at the ballot box and we're supposed to count the votes accurately and we're all supposed to know the rules of the system out in the open and play by the rules what he's doing his rigging and fixing the system\nAnd that makes him on American because one of the ways these rigging and fixing the system is using violence as a tool of intimidation\nAnd that is so radically on American ... so that's my argument is when he starts in with this stuff just say more proof he's not an American and whoever supports them you're not an American either you don't have the right to call yourself a patriot I'm the patriots and with that want to get to the main point here which is\nI've been telling you that this is the place where you learn how the system works and every time I was almost everyday lately I've been saying I'm telling ya how the system works All right let me tell you how the system works\nAt its most fundamental\nUnderstand that there's four layers of government four of them that you and I need to concern ourselves with and we pay taxes to four layers most of us have four layers of government think of them is layers from top to bottom that silly semi brain views it anyway\nIt's called the federalist system\nThat ... overall includes all the four layers the whole thing it's like the universe the name of the universe is\nThe federalist system and\nThat's why they call it over there on the Republican side the federalist society they're trying to wrap themselves in the flag\nAnd patriotism and all this stuff a federalist system says there is a federal government\nAnd then there is a state or provincial level in Canada the provinces\nWriting in Japan there prefecture as there are different names for them but it's the lead it's lower or second layer of government it is the moral local layer it is the is taking the nation and breaking it into pieces we broke our nation at fifty pieces and we call them states\nSo a federalist system as we do it\nAs a federal government and then state governments there's two layers of government right there and we pay taxes to both so we ought to know what they do\nNow within the state there are generally two more layers for everybody there is a county to county you live in you're paying taxes to them\nAnd they do stuff too so that's a county layer and for many people I live in the city of Los Angeles if people who live in the city of San Francisco the city of Oakland right that is the fourth way or the one closest to us that\nAnd for some people they don't live in a in a city they don't live in a village they don't live in a town ship right like in New Jersey they have townships and and so this is a way within the state to organize localities\nIn some places and for some people they live in what's known as in unincorporated area meaning they don't have\nA city or town or a village they have the county so they only have three layers of government because the county functions as the local and the county government why oh why oh why do we have this system why do we have four layers government why is it just they want to soak us for taxes in the answer is no\nThe theory the overall the read the whole point of the federalist system and doing it with all these\nDifferent layers is to keep us much of government as close to us as possible\nIt's about self governance\nVis is designed to be a self governing system which is a federalist self governing system\nThat is designed to give minority views\nSubstantial protection that's why there's this electoral system right electoral votes and that kind of stuff and and as slaves were three fifths of the people I mean the idea was\nTo protect the minority views and in those days and what's in the constitution is the minority views are Republicans and and you know slave owners and that's just the system we're stuck with like I say I'm here to teach the system I'm not telling you it's a wonderful perfect system I'm telling you we can work with it if we understand it and we can make it work for us\nHowever we need to understand it for if we understand\nThat there is no ... that's the whole point we kicked out of king we got rid of the king there's no king there's no one to come and set the whole thing right it's up to us who ever happens\nTo grab the machinery of government gets to exercise the power that goes along with it and today you know who is in charge oh so\nWe have multiple layers of government because the theory is the people ought to be able to have as much influence as possible\nOn the local conduct of their local lives in their ordinary daily existence think about it in Eighteen hundred right when this nation was first getting do and people didn't travel a lot they were concerned about their local lives in their local areas\nThey're state mattered all live what state you lived especially back in the old days right before the civil war we in a slave state or a free state right knows life that's a big difference now today\nOr you know look California has lots of different laws that that you know governor in my life as opposed to people who live in Texas or Alabama and so we see the variation\nAnd the idea is that that's not a bug that's not that's not an unintended consequences that is a design feature that's an intended saying\nLet the people move freely among the states they can live wherever they want freedom and liberty right and the states have a lot of room under a federalist system to make lots of different adjustments and and so within the state you can live in different places is rural\nAreas and all the states is urban areas right and you get to govern yourself\nOr have some influence there I have a Los Angeles city council NGO crab it them if I'm if I'm Upset about something right but I Can't go I I make the right way to go into one of the rural counties in California and give them a piece of my mind but they look at me and say what are you doing here you don't live here you don't vote here you're not a stakeholder you don't\nGo back to Los Angeles and complain to them\n\nNo one

home\nSomeday will eventually to folks around on\nWhy the gap in fact if I\nCould do without it [noise]\nOr those of why or why butter [noise]\nUnited States government really wasn't that powerful and\nIt was very controversial whenever the federal government tried to do anything that was reasonably powerful if you remember your American history where you want to go back and take a look at the old ... at the fights over the old\nBank of the United states could there be a bank of the United states there were some pitched battles over that people were very very concerned about the big bad federal government taking over their lives and that still echoes of course through to today however\nAfter the civil war and the expansion of the government certainly after the great depression now the federal government is very big and very powerful and very intrusive in our lives and a lot of people don't like that but it is what it is and so we need to understand that there is\nA system that covers the federal government says the same system that governs the state and that is is an executive governor in a state president and the federal system to house or the legislature in the state legislature in your state capital or in Congress except for Nebraska where it's only one out and\nThere's a judiciary state judiciary in each state and the federal judiciary and there are lots of rules and laws as to which gets to do what when\nThe federal government does not collect the trash\nRight the federal government does not run the police or the fire service in your area the federal government has its own errors right the bankruptcy court to run through the federal government didn't the constitution and so\nWhat we have is a system that has\nA lot of discretion and open space and breathing room minute there's politics there for everybody the whole idea is\nA skill little system of government was created in the constitution it is a federalist system it reserves a lot of power to the states the states and get to do a lot of freelancing on their own to fashion\nLaws that the people there want and\nIts politics they decide who gets to run all of this and by the way the system was built with all kinds of advantages for minority viewpoints that was to protect\nThis you know the slave owners and all but that's what we're stuck with so I'm trying to teach the system here the point of it always take over your state and to take over your state you got to take over your county and\nTo take over your account you've got to take over your city and to take over your city you've got to take over your neighborhood start local and build up from there\nThe Congress people and the senators who go to Washington come from your state you have a house district and you get to US Senators but everything happens in your state\nI wanted to live in California and I love living in California one day I decided that I Want to live in New Mexico or Minnesota or wherever it's one of the great features America can move there but one of the main factors in me deciding where to live is what laws do I want to govern me\nAnd I really want to go see Cal avoid you governing me all ah more than the laws of Mississippi or Arkansas one of these on American states\nThese are not accidents these are features designed by George Washington and the boys to give us the opportunity to band together and to as an organized group\nMaintain and acquire maintain and exercise significant influence over the laws and the and the forces that govern our lives and that's self governance\nAnd if we ignore the system if we just drown in an ocean of apathy and we just say I\nToo important is not a boarding it so I was too complicated it's corrupt whatever justification we manufacture in our own mind to give us the psychological comfort to say I don't have\nTo participate I can just watch TV or whatever and not do anything about it well then when somebody else grabs a hold of the machinery right the bare bones of the machinery says okay my politics is different than yours I'm running now because you let me Abbott\nAnd then we get upset well\nI can only say one thing when you say you gotta know how the system works and if you don't grab a hold of it and make it work for you someone else will you may not be so thrilled with the results are\nBad is how the system works and I'm Glad I put it in just one straight simple place now let's talk about this poor man who got chopped up\nWe've heard from the Turkish foreign minister ... ... have a show like today I think that the people that are out an investigation into the parents' economic ... with the world\nLike body weight has had such inside the Saudi concert here in Istanbul and also it's a colleague consul general's residence a few hundred yards away and there have been some report which we cannot independently verify that democracy body may have been disposed off in the ... general resident\nThere you go that's highly Williams of CBS News and we think CBS for then I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised that it was all premeditated they they had the bone saw they had the\nThe doctor that does the forensic I you know autopsies Ryan investigations and the doctor that has now been identified as the guy he's really Well hi highly placed politically and he very apparently accomplished like ah you know an autopsy Dr\nWho's very good with the bones saw they assembled this assassin\nIt and just remember my team with great care\nAnd New York times reported we talked about a yesterday the New York times reported that several of these other suspects had been tied directly into the top reaches of the Saudi royal government I mean they're busted they've been busted it's obvious what happened here\nTurkish foreign minister let's have a show is that how he has not said any audio recording with any us if they show including secretary of state Mike on that contradict reporting by at least one other news organizations I think that ... may have it\nAudio recording when he within tacky Eliot weight\nAgain Holly Williams up end of eight and a pardon me a CBS News I got to get my network try Holly Williams of CBS News thank you CBS by the way they're reporting that Pompeo is heard this evidence on pay up these so called secretary of state Pompeo permanent they\nI've seen a threat [laughter] and networks have reported that\nKnocked down the headline says I have\nAnd palm pale I say this to you for that words ally and so\nSeconds media is reporting that investigators have expanded that to a forest on at least on both as well as a farmhouse in a nearby\nAnd that is highly Williams of CBS News yeah they're looking for the remains and my suspicion I don't have facts to back it up and my suspicion is\nThat they're never going to find and it remains those were disposed of it was all for that well in advance and so Benedict Donald is is compromise he fully in the pocket of the Saudis and he's still helping them concoct lies and this is where we are\nAnd so we have to use the civics of the system just outlined so that we can take power and prevent this from ever happening again the moral of the story of where we are now as I see the moral of the story is this is a tremendous cost they were great great damage is being done when I say right now I'm In\nAnd target so if you if you

that crazy judge we saw in the Manafort case the judge who was a pain in everybody's rear end if you get assigned him over there are plenty of other judges in that building\nHowever however the chances of they're actually being a trial are slim and none probably more like none because as you heard from the Williams she is not in custody we don't have\nPhysical jurisdiction over her she is in Russia and she and going anywhere where we can get our hands on her SOS unlike Maria Butina ride Maria Regina believe that infiltrated the uh the n._r._a. on behalf of ...\nOr she is in custody and and the judge said you ain't going nowhere lady you're in jail and you're not leaving because they know\nThe moment she's out she's going to vanish and so\nWhat we have the years another one of these

have them in custody and you don't have no chance again why would you do it obviously the prosecution is sounding an alarm the prosecution is trying to tell us\nHey hey it isn't the special counsel that you just worried about this this is not brought\nBy Robert Mueller prosecutors this is not part of the special counsel investigation\nFor a couple of reasons the ... the ... the main one is we're

Mississippi Stan\nAlabama Stan Oklahoma stand Arkansas stand all those on American unpatriotic states if they sat there if they really now they don't think right now many brain so they'll say but if the if somebody sitting there going you know\nThis guy on the radio they're saying that this that the Supreme Court's illegitimate you know there's some real power to that argument let's let's take a look at what we can do with that if the Supreme Court is illegitimate\nThat means they're rulings are real legitimate\nThan means that tax has a stake and say you know what let's pass\nA resolution of disapproval\nBoth houses of legislature the governor signed it saying that roe versus Wade is an illegitimate decision and it kept me in forest in Texas and because the Supreme Court's illegitimate\nRoe versus Wade has no application now we tried the south Carolina led the way with that before the civil war and it got us into the civil war school no vacation right in the states know vie in federal laws\nWell this is where is leading\nBut look at the choices that we have been presented either either we tolerate and stomach and accept the Republicans breaking the Supreme Court rigging and fixing it and we still respect decisions or we say look all we're doing is acknowledging would\nYou guys have done which is destroy the Supreme Court so it's illegitimate and then they say wait a village intimate no gay marriage in Alabama Roy Moore was right\nWe just don't want to be the Supreme Court and what happens if that starts to happen what happens what happens if the if the Democrats somehow get control of the Supreme Court and the Republicans say which is not going to obey your ruling doesn't that lead to the breakup of the United states\nAnd is not what people want and is now where the Republicans gave them the opening\nAnd they're working it looked so let's let's end senior legal I ... up during the rest of the hour over to you at one eight eight eight three two one six zero zero one one eight three two one six thousand and one but this woman here and and all the hooliganism that she was doing she didn't have a rigidity logical view all she wants to do is just stir the pot\nThat's the point of who was actions ear and he's helping Republicans do it what ever they can do they'll take they'll be pro Bernie if that'll help get people upset there'll be anti
