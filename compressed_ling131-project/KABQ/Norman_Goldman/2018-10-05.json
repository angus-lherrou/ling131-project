eight three two one six thousand and one\nI found myself at eleven years of age in an orphanage\nMy dad just died I was in the orphanage a month and a half before he died he was sick and he was getting sicker and sicker and so I had to go into the orphanage even before he died\nAnd once he died and I was already six weeks or whatever it to the orphanage\nAnd my mama died six and a half years earlier she died three days after I turned five years old\nMy mother died at age forty five of colon cancer three days after my fifth birthday and my dad had three boys and we killed him and cigarettes didn't help and being overweight didn't help and not have any money and a lot of stress bad genes DNA anyway there's a lot of things so neither one of my parents made it to fifty\nAnd I was born late I was the last the three boys and my parents got married like me by the time I was eleven you know there was all over and so\nI found myself in a very very difficult situation\nAnd I had on a psychiatrist and social workers if people tell me my life was over that I hated my parents that are you know basically I needed therapy forever and my response was my dad had a bad heart and my mother had colon cancer and I had nothing to do with any of that\nI'm a victim of a very bad circumstance and I really don't appreciate you into insulting me and my intelligence so you back off\nI'm going to go make something of myself because I'm looking to the future you are inviting me to be bitter about the past\nI Love my dad and my mom seem very nice time I got to know or I mean she seemed very nice my dad I loved him we spend a lot of time together he had a big influence on me and they die from organic causes this stuff happens\nI'm worried about the future and I battled I mean I'm ... many of them are probably still alive I don't know if they even though I'm doing this but I'm sure they remember me 'cause I was a rambunctious little piece of you know what I was a pain in the rear end 'cause I was like just leave me alone stop with your rules\nIn the sounding familiar I just wanted to be independent and alone and do what I wanted to do\nBecause I saw my life's stretching out in front of me and I wasn't gonna blow it did you ever see Hamilton and seeing the play Hamilton that was Hamilton I'm young scrappy and hungry and I'm not going to blow my shots\nAnd that was my approach and I haven't changed I'm always looking to the future you can make the future what you want to look I did\nGreat I got a lot of help boy did I get a lot out I Am not a self made man I got a lot of help but I had to work hard and I got support\nWe can do this\nI did it I'm not special you can do this it takes a lot of time\nAnd you're gonna have to bust your rear end and you're going to have to keep doing it and it's going to take a lot of time and I'm Sorry I there's no magic answer and that's just it Roman thank you for calling from Illinois Hi Roman\nI don't know I'm OK what's up my first phone call where they ah\nI tell you right now I'm a I'm a moderate Republican I've been listening to your show\nThat makes you a Democrat these days or how to [laughter]\nI was I was watching Fox today and I just said I Want to see what the other side things earlier I think and I just got a couple of ... for an hour and a half ago you mentioned that uh [noise] uh that uh you're right to see a a cat or get in there which he's going to\nAsk you how do we stop this and it says there's no there's no way in order to stop this true right\nAnd then he's talking about but it's talking about OK well a lot in the future for say when when the Senate we wouldn't occur house can when patients guys and you certainly\nRight that yeah but you need to know what you need to understand but wait a second you need to understand what the man's question was was not can you impeach the guy the man's question was\nCan you get him out of office and this is a problem Roman what people people call me up and they use the word impeach as the equivalent to get them out\nOf there and that is simply fact\nTruly falls ... two step\nProcess impeachment is merely the first step and\nCan't believe that people still to this day don't understand this we have a living ex president who was impeached the dues name is\nClinton we all remember him he had that thing with miss Lewinsky he was in ... they kicked him out of office because he was in the answer is how now Hannah trial in the Senate and they didn't get sixty seven votes\nI don't understand Roman why people think impeachment is a magic thing you can impeach any sit with a simple majority in the house and the founders of this nation\nKnew that why do you think they put it as a two thirds threshold in the Senate they didn't want a simple majority in the house the Senate say hey we hate the president let's get rid of the president put in our own they're not that stupid Thomas Jefferson was not stupid I mean George Washington they figured it out\nThey said sure you get a simple passionate majority in the house and peace the guy that we can't make it that easy to get rid of people politicians will eat them alive so they put in this two thirds threshold in the Senate and that's why nobody ever gets kicked out of office you're going to teach 'em all day you can't kick them out on 'cause you need sixty seven in the Senate\nAnd don't forget though couldn't start there was a cook or a few Republicans without them not to correct\nIt wouldn't have mattered you didn't have sixty seven Republicans you didn't have sixty seven Democrats\nDecember of anything I'm not saying hey frankly I got it down the street you're sixty seven human beings and\n[laughter] okay [laughter] okay well my my point is right now is that in the cabinet are going to make it OK of course you know\nThe thing is okay and the thing is All right what what is it so terrible that he did it say it's been a conservative\nI

R.

very upset\nAnd when I'm trying to do is to give us a sense of perspective and me telling people look I told you this is what was going to happen in November twenty six and that's not getting as very far Jamie we need some perspective and you're you're the perfect guy you're my friend you been doing this a long time Jamie How do you get through tough times like this\nIt's hard uh you you got to remember that I think two things one is for every action there was a reaction and\nSometimes the reaction creates more justice should more change\nThen you give it credit for so called paws on that but the second is you've got to stick with this you gotta you can't you know you you got to stick with what you believe in\nUm another event this week that brought this to my mind is is a good friend a guy named Bob pack who went through maybe something worse than anyone's ever gone through he lost his two children eight and ten years old they were walking down the road a\nWith their bikes with their mom and dad well California twelve years ago and uh a woman who fell asleep at the wheel because she was prescribe a lot of bike than a lot of narcotics that swelled the bottle of vodka fell asleep at the wheel veered off the road yeah to kill them\nAll the kids lost his kids\nWhat are you doing something like that which youthful kids Troy in a lot of the pack\nWhat Bob did was he went about creating a change that finally came to fruition this week twelve years later he fought to create a database of all the prescription narcotics prescribe than the state of California to the doctors knew how much they re striving to patients just wanted a\nGod multiple prescriptions she was a doctor shop or she was an addict\nAnd she went to jail\nUh but that didn't help bring his kids back he wanted to prevent this from happening on the other kid and he fought for another half decade after we built this database called the cure is database Raul are prescription drug ... prescriptions love\nYou fought for another half decade against the medical lobby with consumer watchdog and others to force doctors to check it before they prescribe narcotics for the first time to patients they know that they're not prescribing to an addict will fall asleep at the wheel threat\nAnd as of Tuesday October second doctors and the state of California finally after check this cures database report before prescribing ... narcotics for the first time we did a ballot measure together than succeed Bob\nBob was very upset about that we went back to the legislature\nLegislature listed the took another year for the attorney general to certify the database get up and running and Tuesday Bob's dream became a reality there was a long road to make that kind of changed and it's a change it'll save lives and it'll be replicated elsewhere and it doesn't brings kids back yet another daughter by the way beautiful daughter\n[noise] uh and you know it made sense to him just keep fighting and Bob can do it we all could\nIt was a ... year odyssey how many set back where there were along the way there was the ballot initiative that failed\nThere was the legislature saying no how many times the legislature\nKaiser Kaiser which ... which was the one the dispensing the narcotics to satisfy them every step of the way he was attacked personally want to raise the snow legislature\nTried to do it to the budget process the medical all became after him but finally in the ... there was a patient I think it was a guy who was on our cottage should give them a death threat and I remember having to talk to the attorney general's office in California to get some protection for both\nSaid if you keep up with this bill I'm going to kill you left a message on this phone uh I mean you know unimaginable\nObstacles and Bob saw them through with a smile and\nVery sweet if you know Bob just nice guy how he stayed back so nice for all of this prevail so for all of us who are feeling like this nation doesn't represent us the score will represent us in and be fair\nYou know Bob also had a true Vail we still have to get a true where you you try to sue Kaiser and how to settle for a very small amount because of this forty year old cap on damages that have\nPlayed all the patients in the state that limits compensation for pain and suffering to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and

Joe Donnelly of Indiana said he's voting no now they may flip and vote yes I don't see it happening they've already announced their voting if they flip it just looks ridiculous it was very political so it looks like\nTomorrow will be the final vote will know tomorrow what the final vote is but the day was a preliminary vote what they called cloture to get to the final vote so\nToday's vote was kind of a a preview\nAnd one Republican voted no Lisa Murkowski of Alaska one Republican one Democrat voted yes that's Joe Manchin of West Virginia so with one Republican oh and one democratic yes that's fifty one to forty nine and so there you know\nSenator voted if they want to forty nine to advance the Supreme Court nomination of ... that is as slim majority and a margin as you can get\nIn the United states at it and the final vote is expected to be held at some point tomorrow\nIt is not over yet all eyes are on three senators who voted yesterday on that procedural measure Republican Susan Collins and Jeff Flake and Democrat and Joe Manchin any of 'em said vote the other way when it comes to the actual vote to confirm\nKavanaugh that is Dana Bash of CNN and we think CNN for that but I don't think it's going that way and nobody else seems to think it's going to go that way it looks like the final vote will be tomorrow and the final vote will be fifty one to forty nine when one Republican knowing one democratic yes our\nLet's assume that you and I\nFind Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S Supreme Court and they just jam through despite all that we've seen and gone through in these last days okay the way I approach this\nWhen I was considering it earlier today was to say let's put the shoe on the other foot\nRight let us do what the law school professors torment law school students with endlessly all the time and a half forever they give you a case right there is in law school you're working over the facts of a case can be any case\nProduct liability criminal it does not matter so you've got a case in the law professors leading this class discussion about this case and the professor you know you're pretty far into the discussion you got a good handle on the case on the facts\nAnd the law and all this and then the professor has the fun part and says okay now let's change one fact\nAnd then the professor of course picks one really pivotal fact and changes in says how does that change if if at all the analysis the outcome let's change one fact and it's a very very useful tool not just in law school with law students so very useful tool\nWhen you and I apply this to just ordinary current events right\nWe saw the New York times blockbuster report this week on Donald Trump's tax fraud alright\nHow bout of a middle class black family tried that's done do you think the iris let him get away with that\nHow about all the shootings of white by white police officers let's change one fact what's making black police officers like ... and white victim right change one fact and things change you can see how things change that tell you expose issues are so that's what I did today and I said let's change one fact\nFlip it\nThat's it we're changing one fact that that fifty one forty nine Democrats Democratic president jamming through a Supreme Court justice that has been accused of being a drunk and costing women and and the lying under oath and was belligerent to the Senate change one fact Democrats doing it\nRepublicans in the minority Democrats than majority\nAnd once I did that and I started to look at it from that angle it all fell into place and here's what I saw\nThe Republicans would never stop fighting the Republicans would never stop fighting\nThey would say okay you think you're clever you see do you find them on the Supreme Court and we're just going to shut up and go quiet and go away you think we're just going to accept this we're the Republicans we never stop fighting here's what we're going to do\nYou go after the chief justice his name is John Roberts he's a politician in robes yes he flipped on Obamacare at the last minute to rescue it because he didn't want to spark the next civil war and he saw it coming however the chief justice John Roberts is he's got to be freaking out right now because he knows what's coming he knows Brett Kavanaugh and all that baggage\nIs coming to the Supreme Court and all the political controversies come in with it if you want to get rid of Brett Kavanaugh hound\nThem out of office by going after the chief justice all explain where justice\n... through a deer down

important situation going on here with the U.S Supreme\nCourt and to finish my present patient in my view of the Republican Party they would simply there they would be so incensed at what we've just witnessed if if we change one factor versus and it was a Democratic president got in with two point eight million less votes right I mean it just no\nFacts change except one\nDemocratic president Democratic Senate fifty one forty nine Jimmy\nDrew somebody with all these allegations you know the Republicans would be apoplectic\nI have the best word they would be so melting as a vest were able to get the right and so you know they would go and destroy the U.S Supreme Court and here's how they would do it they attack its legitimacy the Supreme Court does not\nHave a police force right there are U.S Marshals right I mean the the the U.S Marshals Service been around Seventy nine ah but the ... how are they gonna where how are they going to do\nThe Supreme Court lives\nOn our acceptance of its legitimacy and the Republicans know that Mitch McConnell knows it and now you and I know and so\nIf this situation were reversed and there were you know Democratic president jama democratic or judges on here after holding a seat open with a Republican president boy they would have freaked out right think about this the situation just flipping Democrats or Republicans Merrick Garland right withheld for a year the Republicans\nWould go after the Supreme Court and de legitimize they would they would have infiltrators saying you're not you're not a real court they wouldn't call him chief justice Roberts right they would do everything they would it would be like South Carolina before the civil war passing\nResolutions of notification thing your federal laws don't apply on our land this is where the Republicans have taken us they're getting us back\nTo the question of what does it mean to be an American\nAnd what does it mean to be America\nAnd ... over there kept\nPlaying and by the way he didn't do this boot and didn't do this the Republicans started this is my president Obama was inaugurated when Mitch McConnell got 'em all together and you know that meeting the night President Obama became President Obama January twenty two thousand I\nThere was a Republican leaders meeting and they said we will obstruct everything right and you remember what they did during President Obama's term okay we'll booed and said hey\nI'm a turbo charged that the he hijacked their movement he he joined in with them and they know it and they joined in within the Republican Party has the lead with Russia\nAnd and ... Donald Trump is ... and here's where we are so\nSeems to me if the Democrats\nWant to do something other than accept red cabin on the Supreme Court forget about impeachment forget because the word impeachment does not mean removal okay in removal means two things to things impeachment in the house and then remove all by the Senate\nYou need sixty seven and it ain't happening so if you want to get rid of him I'm Sorry you're going to have to do with the Republicans were doing hound him out of office and I mean how look what the Republicans would do they would not let the Supreme Court function they would disrupted they would deny the legitimacy of its rulings they would be in the public I always just throwing battery\nAcid on the court saying these are legitimate this so called court you know it and I know\nYou know what else John Boehner knows it to you know and I know as we all know so\nIf you want to do something about it my suggestion would be do what the Republicans do however I don't see it happening Democrats are like Republicans Democrats are not at all like Republicans so what do you do\nMy thanks for calling from Chicago Hi am I\nPaying our by doing\nI'm I'm getting through the day what's on your mind\nOkay first of all I mean just come out and say I'm a Republican or Chicago let's talk about America early or number Nineteen Ninety to Joe Biden on the Senate floor sitting president as last year to not nominate Supreme Court let the voters decide\nHe said that you said it right he said it at our life whether they were on their way no no no no no no no\nNo way go way you're going to have a conversation with me or we're going to not do this okay here goes Joe Biden said it didn't do it Mitch McConnell went and did it okay here's my question to you and I'll give you back the airways is it only for presidents or does it apply to senators to\nGo ahead\nNo this is a presidential year\nNo no no no no no no no no does the rule that no lame ducks put Supreme\nCourt justices on is that only presidents or is it only is it for senators and presidents are only presidents because you're saying you're saying that Joe Biden saying this in Ninety to set the rules and then okay rate Mitch McConnell then one\nFollow the rules I'll go along with you one of those great so does it apply to senators to replies that really great and why is Jeff Flake and Orrin Hatch and Bob Corker voting for this guy they can't they disqualified from the Joe Biden Mitch McConnell rural and you just agreed with me\nActually shut shorts at the same thing and two thousand eight\nSo great ... so we're all on a Saturday So we're on the same page if you're a lame duck president or you were a lame duck senator you can't participate in the process of putting a Supreme Court justice on because the rule is lame ducks don't leave lifetime ... just behind\nRight okay that's great so we're not so good by so bright cabinet so you're gone and so with Brett Kavanaugh you just through Brett Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court\nYou're you're such a troll you're so interested in being a ... not that you just lost the argument grow on the merits\nHere's what you should have said if you were if you were a better troll than that what you would have said was known or it only applies to presidents because presidents pet sent me the only devices that can sense and my response would have been\nIt takes two in the U.S constitutions it takes to\nTo get someone on the Supreme Court they are constitutionally equivalent a president to nominate but as we saw with Merrick Garland it doesn't work that way if the Senate doesn't do its\nPart right it takes two to tango so if we're talking about the lame ducks leaving lifetime Supreme Court judges on there is no logical commonsense\nReason why it doesn't apply to US Senators the only reason it's being applied to president says because right now Republicans rent control and they wanted to stop Obama and Jim is do through so they were OK with lame duck senators like Orrin Hatch of Utah Jeff Flake of Arizona Bob Corker of Tennessee that's\nThree if the if the McConnell Biden Obama rule applied Merrick Garland ...

first of all you're right I mean we're not you know people like they like to get out to march but they only want to do it once a year and then have a big big march and then but not do it on a daily or

a Democratic president Congress and Senate is to increase the size of the ... of the house of representatives by at least a hundred maybe a hundred and fifty because it was set back in Nineteen eleven and do you know what the population of the United states was a Nineteen eleven\nHundred million a closed Ninety three there you go and today is what three hundred and thirty one he yeah something like that\nSo you know I think it's perfectly justified to increase it significantly\nAnd that would then go give a lot more weight to the large states you know and help to help to um overcome the advantage of the Senate that the Senate gives the small states regarding the Supreme Court [noise]\nThe only way that the Supreme Court is going to get back and stop being the institution it is it's going to become very rapidly\nIn a ... and take it from the forces of darkness an evil or into the forces of goodness and light it is one of one of two things has to happen either a few things happened happened simultaneously which are a Democratic president a Democratic Senate and then Clarence Thomas dies\nOr if that does not happen and I think the odds of you know all of a trifecta like that are small when we began when if and when we ever have a ... you know a unified democratic you know administration or government a presidency in Congress and Senate\nIf we increase the size of the Supreme Court to eleven and you know I realize you're going to say that's going to the Republicans are going to come back and do it so what\nDo you agree at Christmas at this point I'm ready to destroy the Supreme Court\nI'm ready to turn them into a partisan rancor institution because that's what the Republicans do look they destroyed the presidency they've destroyed Congress they've destroyed the states they're destroying everything they liked destroying government and the relish the Benghazi Democrats don't want to destroy government well I'm One Democrats is willing to destroy the Supreme Court's\nBecause right now the Supreme Court the enemy of the people\n... and we're not what I was in robes so I and why would use the Republican playbook Christian destroyed the Supreme Court\nTurned them into a joke turn it into a joke just say there did didn't just go on a long sustained campaign Chris I got to leave it there at the end of the first hour however what I Want and what actually happens or never the same thing because I don't get to control things I'm not the Koch brothers I don't have all that money I don't get to fund armies\nThey build besieged Supreme Court anyway if you want the guy off the street or if you want cabinet watch gonna have to hound them out and the way to hound amount as to how this report you've done this I don't think it's going to
