this man has no moral authority to go out and campaign and I'm acts laws into effect that you know hot affect the American people\nBecause he's a thief in a criminal himself\nBecause he's a threat

Ninety nine and his mother passed away in two thousand so keep in mind this was divided up among Donald Trump and his surviving siblings because if you remember his oldest sibling passed away well before his parents did\nAnd um you know the family saying oh we don't want you we want our privacy and you know we don't\nI Want you to degrade the memory of our parents than ... on I'm thinking you know this guy's president of the United states he's lived so many times about his taxes and he won't release his tax returns but they said the statute of limitation is so long ago that he couldn't get in trouble for any of this\nWell not so sure that's true there's an exception for fraud if you commit ...\nGetting ready to say that yeah go ahead you're\nReady to say that they are the exception for

I Believe five hundred and fifty million dollars in debt and in her bed they paid over fifty million dollars\nSo they ... they didn't pay over half a billion dollars in taxes attorney\nFor the president has blind that they call the tides allegations of fraud and tax evasion one hundred percent falls and highly defamatory\nNow that his ball or read of CBS News we think CBS News is a threat of a lawsuit there's always the threat of a lawsuit their time to stand by its and bring it on I mean I'm paraphrasing but that's what they're saying because they've got lots and lots and lots of facts to back it up\nWhere you spent um an enormous amount of time with it because you can see from I'm from just a sure way of the story trying to piece together using\nYou know over a hundred thousand of paper that we swept up over many many months of reporting and trying to really build back a whole bunch more layers of not only comes of looking at the financial biography of of the forty fifth procedure\nThere you go to David Barstow he's one of the three writers in the New York times and you start to wonder really a new one a new you're wondering why Benedict Donald was hiding his tax returns right why he's always been I mean his tax returns well the New York times\nActually they didn't get his tax returns they didn't get his personal or Trump texture as they got family tax returns they got some very interesting stuff and lots of it\nSome of the notable phase of hope you far reporting both its ... tail is that we were able to um [noise] ... sweep up ... pages\nOf previously conflict or\nFinancial records that really detail in her workings of the very impressive real estate empire that the president father\nConstructed over many years in Brooklyn and queens including more than two hundred tax returns [noise]\nUm that are not the president's tax returns or tax returns actually for the first time give us a sense of the money that flowed from Fred from real estate empire to the president through various family partnerships in trucks\nThat again is David ... of the New York times I Believe that Benedict Donald did the whole Christine Blasey Ford bashing you did last night to try and get everybody off of this story now\nI'm going to look I can chew gum and walk at the same time I don't know about anybody else but you get to figure it out yourself we're going to cover both of these today in death were already into the tax returns and so what the New York times and it was a hint there was a hint there wasn't\nOne of the other authors of this story was on Rachel Maddow show last night and she kind of hinted\nThat there was this own goal in the family or somebody in the family who's long fins dead but a hat\nOr maybe died not so long ago who had a basement than in the basement where all the documents that oh my goodness look at this it appears that the New York times\nHappened upon I'm sure it's through investigative journalist said you know who has is maybe ... who is this person where's that person live go talk to him and this is you know shoe leather and the Internet and telephones right and all this kind of stuff so the New York times found someone very close to\nTo Benedict Donald's pops right Fred Trump is the guy he's the business ... magnate here he's the tycoon\nYeah Fred Trump he's the daddy he died diving Nineteen Ninety nine so Fred Trump is the guy who built this entire empire you just Benedict dolls are good for another minute living office pops all this time well with the New York times do is they found

is all it is we know how all Ninety seven other senators view this Brett Kavanaugh's nomination\nBrett Kavanaugh does not have fifty votes he does not because three Republicans are holding out one of them is Jeff Flake\nFalling prey\nSo tied required\nTo\nPolitical rallies [noise] throng\nNow of course Jeff Flake is a guy okay my question regards the two women Republican says remember they only have fifty one so the two Republican women senators say I don't care I'm not going for Brett Kavanaugh even if Jeff Flake or to cave the two Republican women\nCan get rid of his nomination\nAnd end his chance to be on the Supreme Court so when Benedict Arnold did what Benedict Arnold did last night how did those two Republican women react credits comments or just plain wrong there you go that Susan Collins of Maine and then\nSusan Collins Lisa Murkowski Jeff Flake have repeatedly said things that President Trump has done or said strike them is beyond the pale and almost inexcusable and yet when their vote has been called a a been reliably marching right along the Trump agenda there you go there's\nMajor Garrett and we sang CBS News for that so my question to you\nPut yourself in the eyes of Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski yourself and measures of the road through their eyes let's leave Senator Flake the guy out of this and\nAnd just to women that all the fifty one Republicans minus two we know what that is laughs at high to forty nine doesn't get the job done\nAre so if you are\nPolitician US Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska or you are politicians Republican Susan Collins

would be three of them that would take them from forty fifty one to forty eight and I do believe Charles Schumer can hold on his Democrats together\nOn the premise of let the Republicans take this across the finish line if Mitch McConnell this'll be my my thought about how Charles Schumer would handle\nJoe Manchin I think the only left the only Democrat left in might consider voting for cabinet bill everyone else seems to have taken him out and they think Heidi Heitkamp is not going to vote for cabinet so if I were Charles Schumer\nThe politics of this is you go to your Democrats the few Democrats who might consider voting for cabinet say look you see what's going on with the Republicans and and the times of up in knots and everybody's going crazy let\nThem get this guy across the finish line this guy\nHe's not Brett Kavanaugh's not a guy that would be nominated by a Democratic president nor the guy who would be confirmed by a Democratic Senate so let them he's their guy he's the Republicans ...

I mean is that this dress all over that situation\nYes it is but what really stressing me out nor man [noise] and when you\nBoil it down to the reason that Democrats lost is because we didn't get out there and vote and you're blamed the voters and I understand that you do is say one of the few who speaks up\nAnd says uh you know the Democrats are don't fight hard enough and all that and I totally agree\nWhen and where they got to show when they have the power\nThey didn't have the power that much lately either because it's their own fault you know everything the reason we're here now and I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me on that\nThe reason we're sitting here now in twenty Eighteen with this illegitimate more and and the White House is because of what we didn't do over the last fifty years\nDemocrats have never stepped up and fought for us we don't go out and vote really well\nYou know why because they don't give us any buddies\nOr your ... you just want to sit back\nAnd and and wait for now writing in bed I'm Alone that's what you just said\nOh you're giving me a gel and argument this is one of them here and I'll give you a chicken in it and you're telling I'm telling you it's your responsibility get off your rear end and make this sentiment yours and like your job and it's not your job you don't have the white I object to your contention that you have the right to sit back\nAnd say if politicians don't excite me I'll hand it to the Nazis known and see that's\nThe problem you don't ever writes zip back proactive you've got to go and shake the system up and take it and make it yours and I said well I have said that you are sitting back and\nThey never game has anything to motivate us so we didn't vote so they don't have any power so when you get mad at 'em and then when you said\nWhen I say way I'm Talking about everybody in general I'm not talking about the people who like myself didn't agree with Hillary Clinton and thought that I'm burning got railroaded and of course you're going to disagree with that but they don't put up the best candidate they don't fight for what\nIn your deciding who the best candidate is and that's the problem I have damaged credit like you said that's not the right candidate I\nAm the progressive barely below Nancy you're going I mean I'm making you a general\nYour general in the progressive pure no I guess it's the police they don't have that are not leaving all your chapter captain\nIn the forest your police force you are that'd be ... it was all set yourself up above everybody else and then you're blaming our land when they don't sound like your bird yeah it's a good by\nNancy you are the problem you and everyone like you are the problem\nAnd unless and until you take\nPersonal responsibility and getting the system and start making the deals necessary to take it over and make it work for you it's exactly the same road you've been on the last fifty years\nBut Next Fifty is going to be worse you are a big part of the problems that attitude now they don't give us candidates worthy and you're sitting there going I get to decide what candidates are worthy Nancy ... because he you I blame you\nWilliam I don't want to blame you what's up\nHello Hi hello hello\nOh we can do is I'd be like a march brothers routine and we can do this for five minutes we like ... or ... that'd be three decades\n[laughter] the norm and I love your show her are your ...\nThank you I don't know if she got me work I'll do it [laughter] I mean\nYou're talking about a show earlier member Margaret Allen calls that I've you know a great people now you're part of my life and I love it or you're a you know I ran the roads and step man everybody but you know your your meal whoever it is our call\nTheir like she's like the ... the people you know because they say they're letting everybody say they want to control ... or ... you know that's another thing about it because as a ... hello\nI'm listening I'm listening go ahead and you got me man and go you know I'm here so\nLike the millennial guy you know I'm here and you know I ... the lady like her who didn't vote for and why you know I just spoke to sixteen\nWell no I think she did actually she actually did vote for Hillary I mean she's you know she actually she did she get it out but she's my mom is she's letting herself and many of the other Democrats and independents who ought to be Democrats and Republicans who ought to be Democrats off the hook by saying\nYeah problem is is the party giving us junkie candidate and that is that is a in alternative out is known by the way is the great man theory William there's this new how if only one great man will come along still said everything right and Benedict Donald styled himself is exactly the\nRight does that mean has it made me sad\nCan fix this you have to know what you're doing right I mean he he styled\nHimself as the great man and this is the problem with that theory is it's a nightmare very gives me great politicians and everything will be great well why don't you become the great politician don't run for office he'll be the great politician you're the only one who's going to meet your purity standards so you go do it [laughter] don't sit back\nAnd say no it's your fault where we have no power because you weren't getting enough as a candidate oh please and then she started then would be any rigged it for Bernie yeah\nThe voters rigged it for Bernie Sanders in the south we are and this Williams the Republicans they have these exact same fights they have the exact you and me and that's the way I'm exactly the same fight but when it comes to election time they forget all that and they get in line like lemmings in a march that's what we don't\nExactly we don't yeah go ahead no that's the\nProblem and like I like I said you know I'm I'm trying to fight against her ideals like living in my eyes humanity as a human being you know we all bleed the same rate and I want to be there for women and that's one of my question to you I'm not sure if you've already accent or fires are active already but I'm even Kavanaugh because\nI'm a Supreme Court member\nIf he's still um for the for the um the thing the lawyers for\nYou know I can still be bison bart well see I\nSee a radically yes theoretically I mean he's still a member of a bar association I Would think uh

I'm afraid of phone you can check our website ... dot com those from them do and you can see when that Puerto Rican I got food for another well granted it come out of the kitchen to the special how come visit\nUs that there is sixteen than ... downtown and in height minus ... and ...\n\nNo one wants to be in an accident but the fact is accidents happen so if you've ever find yourself in a motor vehicle accident remember these three to some more safe medical attention if necessary and called craven law at five five four\nTwenty Seventy nine Richard grave and just ready to fight for you he's worked in the insurance industry he understands insurance adjuster and he knows how to make them uncomfortable don't hesitate following an accident Colby injury experts at Cravens law by by four twenty Seventy nine\n[noise]\n\nI have a very sad update for you earlier we brought you the breaking news of an active shooter situation in South Carolina five police officer shot and now one has died and the shooter is is in custody there was apparently a domestic dispute\nAnd it turned into gunfire and we know how guns are in America and now we've got five police officers shot\nOne of them did and that's the latest I've got and incidentally it if you miss the first hour it's always free and commercial free at Norman Goldman dot com and in that first hour we covered the New York times to me that's the big story the New York times\nBasically giving everybody with Julian facts to back up the plane that Benedict ... been a frog all one we've known it all along the fact that Benedict Donald went and was so grotesquely insulting\nTo Dr Christine Blasey Ford to me it was just cynical distraction and of course people go for this he's a disgusting pig and I know stop the males Norman Norman Goldman dot com I Know I'm insulting pigs whenever I Do believe that it's not the big big he's all horrible guy\nAnd so people are constantly going for it the way to punish\nHim for doing what he's doing is\nTo deny him his Supreme Court nominee but in that first out\nNew York times the star of the show because they expose the tax fraud and all\nThe New York times did another thing yesterday that seems to be flying under the radar and has to do with Brett Kavanaugh\nThere's a letter was obtained by the New York times it was written in Nineteen eighty three we have a copy here when he was Eighteen years old Kevin are writing to his high school buddies he says is and I'm quoting where loud obnoxious drunks were prolific sugars among us his own words [noise]\nHow he presented himself to Fox News or in his committee testimony\nIs Don Lemon and we think CNN for that\nIt's the New York times on earth that letter\nAnd our friend poll in Washington did the research and sent me an email to Norman Norman Goldman dot com and he said norm Kavanaugh said\nThat he was a legal drinking age when he attended Yale but he did not turn Twenty one this poll and Washington he did not turn Twenty one or two February twelve Nineteen eighty six and you just heard\nFrom Don Lemon there's a lot of it was obtained by the New York times it was written in Nineteen eighty three we have a copy here when he was Eighteen years old\nI was in high school three years before legal drinking age and Brett Kavanaugh was writing letter the New York times got it says that they are prolific drinkers are prolific ... and so there you have it ... it is no reason the way to punish Benedict Donald for his disgusting remarks towards a doctor for the ... Supreme Court nominee teach them a lesson\nJonathan thanks for being with us in Massachusetts Jonathan\nYes I'm Sorry to revert back to the old topic first of all I Want to give it up for the phone during the break I Know you're a programmer she uh she programs specific music but I appreciate the staple singers and you've got to be down with the funk\nWell actually that was that was Michael who picks the music criticism oh okay so Michael ... author music so anyway but I guess it's a division of labor I mean Chris does Haley clip channels the phones my anyway so we have a division of labor around here believe me [laughter] you should believe in the reviewers\nPrevious caller I'm sticking with Nancy just wanted to come out with a very different perspective because I think when people come at it and it can be bought a bad manner it's always a recipe for disaster so\nYou mean like we went in there I mean like my like that call\nYes exactly [laughter] and so I I just want to come out with a different perspective although I was a pernicious major Bernie supporter I wasn't\nI mellowed at you and I ended up living there even I just I Love or any\nYeah of course but I just want to explain or just from one different perspective\nA when challenging Trump supporters say on Facebook I've tried to come up with different ways of leveling the playing field and to fusing the argument and it's worked pretty well generally they can't really argue it they just kind of just change the subject or they move on and so one way is like for example\nIf I say well you know if you're only pointing the finger at the opposition and never calling out your own or you're not a sheep\nI mean I remember listening to conservative talk radio that constantly call Obama supporters sheet while they're sheep on both sides of the aisle I'll call out Obama and Hillary all day I I Love a bomb and Hillary but I'll call them out on certain things I might mention a few things related to accepting money from certain corporations\nAnd what can they say that they can't say that because that's a fact so one point regarding Bernie is that I don't I never demonize Hillary but the fact eh one fact
