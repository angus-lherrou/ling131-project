the\nRats up in a paper a correlation between uh taking ibuprofen and stuff like that and all very cancer when [noise] no I don't know if there's a crew that but if it does them a correlation what about man well\nIt's it's long term use when you're talking about ibuprofen the drug ibuprofen and it's an Advil and various other things I've read not only about what you're talking about the ovarian and women but\nAlso a ratcheting up again we're talking about long term used here in which these drugs were never designed to be used on a long term basis five to seven days of the very most in a run uh I've also read about lung cancer being associated with a ibuprofen and also I think a brain cancer\nSo uh you know when you're dealing with drugs they're there for a reason they help people to improve quality of life but the most important in a bigger things on the ibuprofen if you read if you look it up is irregular heartbeat\nPeople take this because he got low back pain or they've got to shoulder pain or ... and they take ibuprofen thing and well it's over the counter must be safe right\nThese same pain killers\nCan also raised a person's risk of heart attack that'll get you before the cancer will\nAnd we're talking again about\nIbuprofen these common drugs and you know when remember years ago when they went from ... at eight hundred men eggs\nAre down to the two hundred and serving now in the ... in the drug stores\nIn ah Advil and other drugs there's a lot of these drugs that contain it so I I think what you're referring to his long term use and you shouldn't be on these drugs long term use\nUh they're dangerous ... province just one bigger aspirin it believe you bleed out if you take 'em off your your kidneys will stop working your liver it has to be metabolize somewhere\nAnd again this is a highly effective anti inflammatory but used judiciously that's the goal but people don't use them judiciously they figure if a little as good a lot better let's keep throwing 'em back I have I've had people come into my office is over the years especially people in the workforce usually a male\nWho gets hurt on the job they hurt maybe their their nectar back there need their hip or something and they are literally living on ibuprofen because the company yes man the empty doctor who is telling them oh there's nothing wrong with you go back to work try

T. nine\nAlright it's time now for the health outrage of the week\n\nAll the United states the United states of fast food or the CDC or Centers for Disease Control and cause I prevention\nRevealed this last week that forty percent of Americans eat fast food every day there's just amazes me is that ... I think it could even be understated forty percent of all Americans eat fast food every day\nAnd people who are wealthy or affluent are more likely to eat junk food\nAdults between the ages of twenty and thirty nine are the most likely to consume fast foods with about forty five percent eating and all that is surprisingly who came in higher where the higher income households\nThey were one point three times more likely to eat fast foods on a given day than people from lower income homes men were more likely to report eating fast food at lunch and women were more likely to eat it as a snack with more\nThan one third of American adults being obese experts say they're setting themselves up for conditions such as heart disease type two diabetes cancer and many other preventable diseases by consuming\nFast foods on a regular basis well this is all about not getting the nutrition you need and exposing yourself to the toxins out or in these fast foods it's so simple it's outrage is though and of course that's why I qualified as health outrage the week\nAll right let's go right back to your telephone calls and questions next up is uh Debbie she's going from Palm Desert California Welcome to the show Debbie\nHello Hi Dr Martin is a quick question again regarding when you're fifty or sixty years old I used to be taking a low dose aspirin a daily\nI realized that you know the drug companies that aspirin makers have\nBasically brainwashed people into believing that it's not true though in fact daily aspirin was found to be useless\nOffers no benefit but exposes so many people to unwanted health problems Danny you must not have been listening a couple of weeks ago because I address this had on a couple of weeks ago and you go and listen to it in a pod cast but I'll I'll repeat some of it\nWas a study of about what Nineteen thousand people I think I recall and a researcher uh there was looking at this\nBasically said that the benefits do not out weigh the risks and put people at serious bleeding conditions\nAnd potentially life threatening brain hemorrhage is called ... stroke\nAnd further on top of that people who took aspirin I remembered daily were more likely to die overall as aspirin appear to raise the risk of succumbing to cancer so why would anybody want to take aspirin on a daily basis just because they've heard\nThat an aspirin a day keeps the doctor away or a baby aspirin it doesn't matter you bleed with every single bit of aspirin you take\nYou were born with an aspirin deficiency what you were born with\nIs the lack of education to know that you need to stay hydrated need exercise eat well and keep your blood send out by doing healthy thing so it doesn't become so thick so you have to take blood thinning agents like aspirin and ... and all these other rat poisoning that are out there and all the new does your flavors of it\nSo no I'm I'm not telling you not to take it that's a prerogative you have to side of it I'm telling you that that's what the science says even in spite of all the brainwashing that people have had on that topic", "show_name": "Dr. Bob Martin", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "07"}
