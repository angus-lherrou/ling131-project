almost certain derives officials said there is virtually no cell phone service in Mexico Beach Florida damage been virtually wiped off the map Senator Marco Rubio this morning show the devastation is widespread on the Florida Panhandle\nWell it's true young children should not be given these decongestants because there there's no proof they work\nAnd yet you have doctors bragging about the healing art of medicine always right never wrong nobody else nothing else works\nThey simply have had no prove they've never had proved that they work yet they went ahead with it\nIt's unsafe that's what experts are now saying\nAnd think of the millions of people who have been subjected to this poison in these decongestants and the children who have been maimed or have died from them that's what we call the science of modern medicine FDA approved\nResearchers argued drugs used to relieve blocked noses should never be given to children under the age of six years of age and only given rarely and with caution to children twelve years and under\nChildren should instead be told that their symptoms will get better over time in other words the texture of time do nothing be safe yet that's not how it's happened for many families who have been touched by this ill advised recommendation it's been going on for decades and millions of people\nMost colds are caused by viruses which can't be treated\nBut cared really by themselves in other words there's no treatment that cures the common cold besides the human body what you have to do it just get out of the way\nGet out of the way of the body and let it heal itself by making sure you're getting plenty of rescue stay hydrated you take nutritional supplements do help hasten the healing process give it the raw materials that needs to\n\nGather enough energy for the immune system to work as best it can work\nAnd if decongestant drugs don't work on children the question becomes do they really work on adults like you should you be taking the same drugs these decongestants these nasal uh drugs to open you up\nHow can they not work on children and yet they claimed to be working on adults I question that\nWhat is known about nasal congestion drugs for blocked nasal passages and stuffed up noses is they may cause\nAnd here are just some of the side effects of this class of drugs high blood pressure drowsiness seizures anxiety dizziness tremor stomach problems insomnia headaches rebound Oh yes here it is rebound\nWhen you take these drugs what does rebound well rebound you guessed it is that the same class of drugs which are earmarked for congestion causes\nDrum roll please\nCauses stuffy nose and block noses so that's one of the side effects that you can expect from taking decongestants you get congested\nWow that's what I call science children suffer around six to eight colds per year the researchers said while adults around two to four\nOne of the easiest ways to catch a cold is through someone sneezing on you droplets produced by a sneeze can travel at Ninety miles per hour\nAnd can reach people within thirty feet a thirty foot radius or somebody sneezes in your direction run like hell because Ninety miles an hour cubs quick and so does that thirty foot radius protect yourself\nBy avoiding sick people mostly and obviously and also do things to make your immune system stronger\nBetter able to protect itself from these viral infection should they come your way get sleep stay hydrated exercise mildly to moderately eat well keep a positive mental attitude take nutritional supplements to help maintain and function like vitamin C.\nUh oregano and Rosemary\nHCC\nOr you know there's so many things you can do ... and a good multiple of some short likes the bench or televised I mean there's so many things you can use a humidifier and use also natural decongestants that don't have adverse side effects\nYou've got all kinds of options waiting for you to learn about a little eucalyptus little lavender hot bath the steam sauna or elevate heat shock proteins that's where it's at and we talked about on the show me for\nNow the researchers were from the University of queens in Australia and the University of a dent in Belgium\nExposing the problems with these decongestant drugs in the most recent edition of the British medical journal so of course it didn't make its way into anything here in the United states where you can put your eyes on it and\nBenefit by it\nSo that's why we bring this information to you here on this show decongestants are bad news always have been always will be especially to children twelve and under and people that are older than that\nUh well you you can a guess for yourself what my attitude is about it there I was a ton of stuff you can do besides taking these drugs that put you at higher risk and imperil just for swallowing now there's so many other ways to go about helping yourself you just need to employ\nDoctors and health care providers
