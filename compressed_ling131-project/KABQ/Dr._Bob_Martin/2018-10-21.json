marijuana but before I Do I Want to let you know that I've never smoked marijuana directly\nInhaled it or exhaled it directly I'm not interested in it I've seen too many people become Lakers\nHave no motivation or just I I just don't think it's it's a good thing now do I believe that marijuana has some level of advocacy with\nPeople who have health problems like maybe epileptic or people who have end stage cancer disease or somebody who's you know having some other extraordinary problem for which medical drugs don't work or are\nNot indicated and the answer is yes I've seen medicinal marijuana help a lot of people there's no denying that\nBut for recreational use\nA it's a total and complete disaster in my mind\nAnd old yeah I have smoked marijuana in the past but it's always been slip stream secondhand marijuana where a while I was attending a concert\nAnd even some of it in an open air concert and there's the skunk ... my direction the stone of the skunk smoke I Can't stand the smell\nIt's bad news so I'm biased but let me report the news to you in a very unbiased way smoking marijuana may boost your stroke risk\n[noise] uh okay so by Fifteen Percent\nCompounds in marijuana may cause blood vessels in the brain to narrow who would want that I Want mine to be wide open not narrow\nSmoking marijuana reduce the risk of having a stroke researchers are suggesting researchers analyzed hospitalizations of more than two million talkers\nOr two million marijuana users between the ages of Eighteen and eighty four I guess that would cover Willie Nelson between the years two thousand ten and two thousand fourteen\nRates of stroke among non marijuana users didn't change however rates among recreational marijuana users jumped by Fifteen Percent that's recreational I guess that would be like maybe weekend talkers donors\nWhich usually leads to you know daily\nUh use which usually leads to about every other our use I've seen it over and over and over there's never enough marijuana eventually for serious a marijuana users\nSo think about those users of marijuana beyond recreational use what risk are they putting themselves at if their token up every hour or two or three times a day\nThe researchers conducted on adults marijuana users and the compounds in marijuana in their studies are showing that the blood vessels in the brain are narrowing and when you have narrow\nBlood vessels in the brain it could trigger the most common form of stroke called esteem mix stroke\nThat's what the scientists are leaving and of course now we know that marijuana can be taken for medicinal reasons in thirty us states\nAll over the place and more and more states are now legalizing it for medicinal reasons Oklahoma was the most recent one\nAnd over four years the rate of all strokes among marijuana users in this study rose Fifteen Percent who wouldn't want to increase the risk of stroke I don't get it now there's been conflicting information in the past\nAh they've talked about in studies about how smoking marijuana actually reduce the stroke and helps people who have had a stroke recover faster\nAnd you know I can only wonder after reading this study if that was sponsored by and it was sort of like eight bought and paid for by the cannabis growers USA\nI don't know I I you know that's why I pointed out that you know\nIt's a serious condition stroke is a hundred and forty people die of stroke every year it's like the fourth leading cause of death in the United states first as medical miss care\nSecond is heart disease third has cancer and\nThen we have stroke we won't want to anybody in their right mind would not want to increase their risk I Would believe of\nTaking the chances of having a stroke just by getting high ... smoking marijuana so there you have it\nAnd I'm positive the store owners are going to be ... coming out of the weeds sending me the nasty emails I you know I've been smoking marijuana since I was too and I'm great I can jump over high buildings buildings with a single bound\nI get it I've heard it all and I've treated more than my fair a number of\nMarijuana users and again I I I'm not against\nIt for medicinal reasons when there's nothing else that will work but usually there's that's not the reason people are doing it it's for the sole purpose is of becoming and staying stone\nWhich uh eventually in most

imbalanced their body chemistry by using too much refined sugar in the diet junk food\nToo much caffeine alcohol and other adultery that foods eventually go down hard those same people need to be exercising on a regular basis in getting regular sunlight just those will often extricate the feelings of depression\nNow I liked the fact that you're on your under the care and you're getting

renewable by Anderson to give you an exclusive offer replacement windows and doors right now you get an extra five hundred dollar gift card towards your project by visiting I Har renewable dot com\nPeople with restless leg syndrome because we find in the news this last week that restless legs syndrome triples the risk of suicidal thoughts\nPeople with restless leg syndrome having greater risk of suicidal thoughts that's what a new study is suggesting and the researchers say that this this order they call a neurological disorder which I agree with in part\nIs mostly my words now mostly a nutritional disorder causing sufferers to constantly move their legs\nIt makes a person nearly three times more likely to say hey if this is the way life is going to go every single night my legs are dance and all night long and I'm just exhausted well then I don't want to live any longer and that's why this is a triple down for suicidal thoughts of those people who have it\nAnd those people unfortunately are consulting with our path to doctors who do not know how to deal with this and usually make it worse by getting all those different\nPharmaceutical nostrum so that they hand out now passed research has shown that people with disrupted sleep have trouble regulating their emotions and this is what it does it beat you down night after night after night and people try alcohol they try all kinds of things and it never works\nNow the team that is talking about this triple risk is from Yale School of medicine in Connecticut and it's they say it's it's it does not they do not know why the syndrome causes people to think about suicide but\nSays the findings show the doctors need to closely monitored their patience with a condition to catch any signs of suicidal tendencies and then of course drunks come out oh we'll give you a drug once you have a depression caused by the uh wrestle ... restless leg syndrome will just give you an antidepressant\nOr sleeping pills which just adds to the problem it's a band aid chemical band aid approach which makes the problem worse\nAnd of course the reason why people think of suicide when they have restless leg syndrome is because when you deprive somebody of sleep long enough and you stress them long enough and they don't see any escape from it\nThey're going to think about suicide eventually ending it ending their pain it would be better not being alive and that's tragic\nRestless leg syndrome\nIs a condition that causes the suffered constantly need to move their legs because of an uncomfortable sensation often described as a creeping or crawling or fidgeting or ...\nOr the legs jumping around or the muscles in these little twitch is that's what restless legs syndrome is about\nAnd the reason it happens is the body becomes imbalance when you write that imbalance the problem goes away and there's no drug that I'm aware of that does anything for this problem besides make it worse\nThere is no surgery for this symptoms are most often severe at night when a person is sitting in lying in bed meaning that the patient they're unable to sleep well at night that leads to the thoughts of the depression and suicide eventually\nAnd drugs like muscle relaxation sleeping pills to relieve the symptoms they are absolutely not going to do anything they are going to make the problem worse\nAnd so what I have noticed in my own experience as a doctor for forty plus years with people with restless leg syndrome\nThey respond well to finding out what the problem is and you see that a lot of restless leg syndrome patients they have iron deficiency anemia\nSo they need to have their iron measured their total lion binding capacity total iron they should have their ferrets and measured in any one of those can help direct\nClinician as to what deficiency that person has and then recommend make recommendations and it'll solve the problem whether it's a beep vitamin\nDeficiency causing anemia or an iron deficiency and there's many kinds of different any us whether it's a magnesium deficiency or calcium deficiency vitamin e helps restless leg syndrome getting the person off of caffeine\nDrinking more water getting them to exercise making sure that you don't have a structural problems going on in their lower back where the nerves are being irritated to their legs that would be the chiropractor doors domain\nSo there's lots of things you can do to help a person with restless leg syndrome the latest information is about doping meat and how some people who have doping mean deficiency which is a narrow chemistry can also generate these or restless leg syndrome symptoms\n\nAnd for that there is a supplement called dope ... four hundred dope of four hundred from velvet beans seeds by a company by the name of America's finest incorporated they sell and distribute this dope of four hundred which elevates the doping mean levels\nWhich not only helps the person was restless leg syndrome and helps with depression it helps to generate human growth hormone helps people sleep so that might be a consideration if you have restless leg syndrome [noise]\nLet me grab the phone number for the company here for anybody interested a dope of four hundred\n'cause finest Inc there it is eight hundred three five zero thirty three zero five eight hundred three five zero three three zero five and on the other levels\nGet to a board certified clinical nutritionist that would be either a nature path a chiropractor a functional medicine empty DO somebody who understands how to measure blood for these various things from iron to be complex to magnesium\nAnd then some changes in the lifestyle and some other factors\nYou can break free of restless leg syndrome is a completely resolve all problem and I've had it\nResolved in many of our patients over the years is very few people who don't respond to this kind of care [noise] All right when we come back from this break we've got the
