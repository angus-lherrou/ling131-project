do\nSo ... you're on for example we have the Dodgers hear it on this station and a Dodger games are all day because it's post game pre game and everybody talks so I remember one sitting in the studio when I was doing some recording and I was listening for a few minutes or to the game\nAnd I walk past and I looked at the screeners the screen which uh that's how phone calls a come in\nA post command

to take you back on a journey to this week in sports history [noise]\n\n\n\n\nMoney or time for handle on the law marginal legal advice Mike Mike You're welcome handling along [noise] you're running Yes sir I'm trying to\nFigure out how to get someone to live up to their their false advertising\n[laughter] she had good luck alright I'll just tell me what happened\n[noise] um I had a car that I bought from a dealership and a two years into the leaf they sent me a a written a letter and also emails wanting to buy my car back and they said they'd give me up to a hundred and ten percent of the appraised value my car no matter if I bought their car or not\nAnd then when I when the front of them on it and they have praised the car and we out of the hundred temperature because the car was an excellent condition\nOr they will give you the deal will give you a hundred percent but you gotta buy what our cars but in their printed advertising and my emails especially especially [noise] definitely says this away races are paired up are you up to a hundred and ... percent of current market value for your vehicle [noise]\nIn fact we're so interested that we will buy your vehicle back even if you don't buy our\nShowcase so now the issue is the value ... you got him on that All right there's no question that this is what they said ah they're out is up to a hundred and ten percent that's for one or one aspect and connected to that is what is the value of the car\nOr that they're saying it's not that much or they say they're just not ... not buying the car back no matter what\nIt is in their ... by the ... say they did the appraisal on the car so I went ahead it appraised by car ... and then I came to them and they were the original ... deals to show me the car two years early right\nIn are they not recognizing the ... the appraisal or they're just saying we don't care\nYou know there are paying higher than ... oh my God okay so\nSo so they ... they printed it out to me and brought it out to me and then and then I said well what about the hundred ten percent and like I I don't know nothing about that so we brought the manager out I gave him the document and the email and he goes\nOkay we'll get we'll give you a hundred percent because your card I mean you're a card was showing condition it was ten thousand miles under ... should have been particularly on at least that time\nAnd he goes it will give you the deal but you need about when our cars and I and I go out to highlight it and I think I'll go but it says you'll buy micro matter but by yours or not and he says\nWell and they they just stumbled on themselves well\nDidn't get mad or anything yeah okay let me let me ask this\nUh and that is a why wouldn't you buy one of their cars or just in I understand there are a bunch of jerks but if they're willing to give you a hundred and ten percent legitimately and they give you a reasonable deal on one of their cars why wouldn't you jump on it or even though they're watching the lying scum\nOkay I bought two new cars within a week of each other when I bought the ... my Chrysler [laughter] I bought one from across the street from ... from them and that and my truck I drive thirty five thousand dollars a year in my car sits on the garage so I'm sitting there going you know I'm spending over five hundred\nOr you then are you are so are you not going to buy a car then you're just not interested in buying a car period I Would just try to get out of the week\nOkay uh and they offered that yeah they're going to buy your car back ah and and they're releasing it too right\nYeah yeah they are releasing a too yeah yeah I'm just trying to think they are in breach just one of the damages a and now here's here's\nWhere I figured out the doubt because it's been a year and I've gone through\nBut right now I got it okay all I have a a you can sell the car or to anybody else at whenever the value is and the difference is they're responsible for the ten percent\nOkay well the problem was that was a hundred and ten percent I Would only had to chop up three hundred bucks and I've been out of the least at that point I couldn't sell it for what that hundred ten percent would have been\nWithout you know picking a bigger hit so I've kept the car and I just put it in on a leash so what I'm really on the hook for just is eleven payments and car insurance and vehicle registration which comes to fifty six hundred dollars\nAnd they would have been like ... and they were going to let you out of that and you're but you're not going to replace the car correct right\nOh okay ah but you [noise]\nWow yeah I'm just trying to think of a of a clever way of doing this without hiring a lawyer and that's the problem and what the damages are and how you figure out\nI God because I ah the difference is we can try figuring out the damages in small claims court but the problem is going to be that you're on the hook for a belief you have to say I wasn't going to buy another car\nAnd the judge is going to say really uh therefore but you could have and you didn't have to and you turned it in and you took the deal\nAre saying they'll pay you a hundred and ten percent I so it's a little bit complicated but whatever your damages are uh you can try to take it to small claims court\nI but that's the only way to go I can think of and just trying to figure out your damages and frankly as I was going through the entire scenario and uh the formula I didn't understand a word it so ah that works out now isn't it\nThe ... when it comes to math beyond like fifty plus fifty or a hundred and why to buy two I have a hard time see how that works Tammy\nHi Tammy yes good morning yes ma'am\nMy question is I Am one of four owners ... on a property and I have them pay the property taxes for several years I have a recourse can I put marine that property\nYou already on the property you're one of four owners nope when you get what you can do is to the other ones for their pro rather share okay that's it how much and so in terms of taxes when you see several years all over the course of those years or how much should be paid in taxes\nI probably say roughly around twenty\nTwenty thousand dollars so that your lawsuit against each other ones is five thousand dollars okay thank you All right and we'll see what the judge you have to say about that one", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Handel on the Law", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "07"}
