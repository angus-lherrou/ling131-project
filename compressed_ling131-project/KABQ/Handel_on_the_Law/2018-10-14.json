I I get a burglary or ...\nOr ... that are in each other or whatever like that so she clearly has been devastated there's an emotional issue here\nBut how much is that work is pretty speculative and the jury would have to determine that assuming that goes to a jury or the other issue is the contract that she signed and there it is we're not responsible if someone breaks than well she signed it however\nShe saw while she was burying her son and then the argument is goes wait a minute no one in their right mind or they don't know what the hell they're signing\nA it so she didn't have the mental capacity at that time or the emotional capacity to know what you assigning so I Would argue that right so the point is well what's worse it's valley so the ... out there uh she's never going to replace the ring it\nSo uh so what what is money what would you want\nI think part of that I could go twice a week and just looking you know I understand the point\nIs that no cameras or any kind of I guess really good for Kerry and she says I can look at me over that\nYeah they could have but it's a could've would've showed up or you know in the eye they don't necessarily have to have cameras okay ah I don't know if that's reasonable or not and he had they had cameras that would have stopped\nThe the stealing oh no that would be exactly who there you go you know so\nMy question I got it got me going to get up because I had was hit by the cuts that way she didn't listen to it but I remember her you know I remember that\nYeah so that's\nWhy it's time to time to contact a lawyer and I am one and I go I go to a personal injury lawyer because this is emotional distress on a pretty high level of getting around like maybe I don't know maybe it would be a contingency wouldn't be pro bono ... for a percentage of whatever and now you get to look for a lawyer\nIt this is an interesting case and I I don't know if there's anything close to it\nOn that ... that has been filed and won or lost and this is where you start talking to lawyers and see if any of them would be interested in it it's just what kind of a loan or can we go I mean you go to the handling law dot com you go to my website to start\n... and you and you want to go under the personal injury lawyers if there's anything there they all say no or then you can keep on going out and if five or six or eight or ten say no then you don't have much there\nI get it All right that's what I'm Wondering I think All right yeah it's a heartbreak or with a with a mom that really is and when you talk about what Thirteen thousand dollar that she can't\nAfford but that's what happens when a loved one dies and you're responsible for ah getting\nA figuring out how to bury and what do you do with the family and arranging the or the services etc you you're not you're right mind and the funeral directors\nIn I'm not saying it's fraud introducing\nBut they're really into honoring your loved ones\nAnd the more you spend the more
