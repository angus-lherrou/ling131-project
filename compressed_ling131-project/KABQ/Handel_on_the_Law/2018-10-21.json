which credit card you have no idea now they front and the company but it's a superior court action a ... you know at this point uh I Would contact a lawyer\nA that's representing the or the company that's suing and all and just and send them a letter first of all say he was going on and just say hey I I had nothing to do with this\nNothing and lay it out and\nJust say I really appreciate if you were dismissed this because I shouldn't be a defendant ...\nIt's one of those where you will win but you have to go to court have been dismissed ... lawyer actually gives a damn and views you as an instant is an innocent party here\nAnd you truly are then there should be a dismissal just because he's a decent guy\nRight sometimes not but that's worth a shot just a lot of the counter no there's\nNo there's nothing to counter to nothing to counter sue on a because even if you are not liable I in the end there is not a frivolous lawsuit or he did work on your house the allegation if you were caught up in this is legit it's a legitimate allegation and may not be true\nBut it is an allegation and it's not as if he just grab your neighbor and started suing your neighbor and there's no connection so but you do not counter to but at first I just asked to get out of the damn thing and then and then you're probably gonna have to see a lawyer especially if it's an enormous amount of money\nOkay well I watch it then I write in a alerts the attorney but I also have to file every bond\nYes you do yes you do when the thirty days you have to follow the response and you need some help with that on the out of\nThat I have an attorney I could just be that\nMight do that yourself you write well actually I go to a paralegal and because you want to put some if you want to just there are some legal language that you have to know now you can go on the Internet and do your own research ah that talks about the fences and there are affirmative defense is but uh it's yeah you can do it

lawyer they fix my brakes which were perfect when I took the car and drive again\nSure you have a case in and then you have to pay for all right ah yeah yeah yeah\nFigure out first of all you want the money back for what you paid for and that's it that's all you're going to get a fact that they didn't fix a the noise or you're still the same place with a noisy car and it could be the battering you're hearing aid is going south and you're hearing rattling noises and uh I have no idea how that works\nBrian Hi Brian welcome ...\nWanted to ask you for your whenever I see my dentist he's trying to uh\nTalked me into installing a bridge on a a I have an open more that ah I've been chewing on for ten years no no uh no problems who even trying to talk me into installing a bridge on their thing and it was a piece of cake\nFor three and a half weeks ago I allowed him to do the cursory thirty five hundred dollars and part of that\nPreparation for bridge is your grind down there to\nTry to do something you saw yes I have one that I've\nBeen in structured and crying for three and a half weeks he thought it was settled down at that and\nI've been on ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you know twenty four hours a day for almost a month now he sent me to an end though Don fist\nYesterday and ah he says that I'm going to need to root canals that grounded proved them too much or the hope is almost to the store\nThat's lovely okay so what's your question\nSo his response of uh my original done a response is it's just one of those things that happen\nNow now does that first of all I don't even understand why a dentist would push for a bridge today when they're dental implant\nI mean all you have to do I have a bad do you put it in a dental implant so you don't have to do a bridge which I mean I have a bridge but it was put in decades ago before implants were even around so I I have no choice but I mean the guy is from what you said this is pure malpractice\nNow you need a I have to go to another Dennis it'll say yeah this is crazy and then as soon as that happens or you get to take 'em for malpractice problem is how much is dental malpractice worth\nA but now you start going and doing all kinds of research first step get another Dennis get a second opinion just say this is crazy this is not just one of those things that happened this is malpractice on its face\nAnd then you go from there and then you start talking to\nMedical malpractice people are in there's plenty to specialize in dental malpractice\nAnd I'm not really interested in pursuing\nI'm well you can get it right now than get it straightened out and send them a bill I mean you can assume anyway and if it's under ten thousand dollars a year go ahead and then there is no problem to go to small claims court and then the problem is going to be you'd have to bring a dentist in there\nYou're gonna you're going to have to bring in a dentist a dental a dentist who is going to be a witness 'cause he's going to say in my professional opinion this is one of those things and it just went south and he's within the that is you are within that tiny little percentage that no matter what job I Do it's going to go south okay\nAnd and I let her be be appropriately being scared of it then\nYeah maybe or bring in lots of them are bringing two or three and then see what the judge has to say\nOK okay alright try that I can yeah tennis is he spent all these years talking unit doing something\nWent in and when you when you look at a dentist hockey when to anything you go to a dentist when you need a

concerning the ability of a person to decline a portion of an urge them specifically my father has a time share if he leaves it to me can I say yes to the rest of the inheritance but noted that sure and what would I fish may recourse\nI don't think so you know you don't get I mean there's nothing in the world I mean how can you be forced to accept property and in the case in a case of\nA A N good for you by the way of saying no in the case of a time share that's not property that's a liability\nGotcha at that point it is so now you can just simply say uh you know whoever the trustee is say please do not transfer the property to my name I have no interest in being an owner of this property do whatever the hell you want with it but uh I'm done\nAnd could go back again to the state somehow\nTheoretically they could but uh they're not going to they're not going to sue ... they're not going to sue the state or its they're going to walk away from it\nSuch a thank you very much okay yeah I mean I mean could they go after the state of course for breach of contract or do you say does the money but then it gets interesting because I I guess theoretically the trust you would have to negotiate\nWith the time share company to pay it off and get a get rid of it because you've got the time share company could sue the estate because he's still owes the money dead or not and\nUh but that would stop or the estate from being distributed because it has to be enough money put into that\nTo cover the cost of a the time share I mean it becomes a mess so timeshare companies normally just walk away or that's what you're trying to get him to walk away anyway but I mean the bottom line is you're crazy to get into a timeshare\nThat's for starters especially now with type shares because there are no longer you know on her own the property it used to be you'd say you at a time share you buy one week writer two weeks or you would own two parts of to let's say one fifty seconds\nOf the property there it is there is a deed you own property now they just give you points\nYou all nothing what your own is a contract in perpetuity\nWhere they have the right to raise

you can take away their license\nNo why didn't oh you can do is to him\nAnd if he doesn't have any money or you are and I want you to look this up as O L okay that's a legal doctor and you know that don't you yeah you're screwed beyond screwed\nOkay ah I Love that isn't that special All right norm Hi norm\nHey you know handle Yes sir\nWe listen to your every morning my wife and I love your chair hope our cats\nI'm sure of it correct okay to literary question tore a bill\nBecause I'm a ... times so literary I understand because yes because\nYou're so literate yes I'm I'm I've written one book and I'm writing another one and then the first book we held off on publication because we were worried about we would describe a couple of experiences and hotel and it was all positive\nNothing negative and we were wondering if those hotels would try and do an indoor legally because we talk about him and we give their name that oh\nNo no no matter of fact even if they were negative and you give your name too do you give the hotel name out the what'd you can't do is make stuff up in a negative way that's defamation or a or you could tell them what go ahead\nNo no go ahead yourself\nAlright so uh let's say a year accusing uh the hotel and having bedbugs in your story and he named the hotel uh you know I don't want to name any names but Hilton Marian Wright Wyndham let's just go through the names it suddenly what was the name of the hotel\nOr don't want to say that on the air bill why they don't know who you are a well actually\nTruthful and I'm not sure if I can remember\nNot faring of a it's been it's been a few years\nYeah okay fair enough by the way they're ... they couldn't go after you because uh there is a uh uh just to let you know you've heard of the attorney client privilege there is a there is a hotel talk show privilege that's recognized under the law so they couldn't have\nLaws that what you got you know\nI either or a sales a receipt I mean my daughter had a a very old car a that she gave to a friend of hers\nAnd and and\nShe made sure that it was ... she has to copy that is registered or you were going to say what\nThey auctioned off the bike and someone else bought a record it with her covered Africa for him\nYeah because they impounded so just say no because you sold the bike and argue and I don't understand the three thousand dollars but a a mark your defenses are are attacking the three thousand dollar impound vi\nAnd somehow proving that you sold a biker gave it to your body and uh that's all you can do and maybe your body will testify saying yeah ah he sold the bike to me uh and I saw him registering at ... I I think it's too easy to argue you're a liar on this one mark\n'cause you don't have to have the ... not that you are\nOkay I'm not at all as saying you're a liar although you do sound like one a but it's just too is just too easy to uh attack you on this one so argue the feet you obviously you tell the collection easy to go pounds ... pounds sand on this one tell them to sue you and uh then you have to defend yourself it'll be a small claims to probably\nAnd then you have to worry about your credit being dangerous ... even a disputed has your credit already been attacked\nRight yeah it probably will our credit\nYeah probably well you're gonna mess on your hands and there's no there's no good way out of this\nWhat my friend I mean half the money to settle it\nWell then maybe you want to pay the other hand it was just negotiate with them\nNegotiate saying I'll give you half the money now\nI have and but the thing is I I mean it's a Monday morning anybody I'd rather give him the money or\nCurrent well then you negotiate it on a payment you tell them to go pounds sand or you look at your credit you got your choices none of them very good unfortunately\nA not a good place to me sometimes and I often say this is a everybody looks to the law as an answer\nAnd quite often the laws very sloppy that it's not very clean ah for example what's what's clean about the ... have you committed a crime yes or no right it's very clean the jury determines yes or the judge determined here's the statute\nYes thirty five miles per hour is law went thirty six or thirty seven boom you violated see that's clean stuff I loaned you a thousand dollars you don't pay me there it is now dogs barking next door because they're too loud\nAnd I want a restraining order what does that mean\nWhat is too loud it's just a sloppy way of of dealing with things and this is one of those where the ... answer this is just there's nothing clean about it there really isn't so all I can say is I'm Glad it's him and glad it's not me\nThere you go silver lining every moment\nOkay or Alexander Hi Alexander\nHarm here yes there are we going to do for you\nOr I had a debt owed to a credit card company fifty nine hundred dollars or judgment was ... years later that judge back this up here at our receive a cat's always shut up that from the are are rash showing Nineteen thousand nine hundred\nOkay wait a second you oh hold on a you a cancellation of debt for Nineteen thousand nine hundred dollars correct so you're so you're dealing with the IRS that's you're not dealing with the original credit card company you're dealing with the IRS someone ten Ninety nine you for Nineteen thousand dollars is that correct\nYes okay so the IRS is now saying you will or you were given this much\nDebt and die and they got a judgment against you correct no they didn't do they sue you or they just wrote it off\nThe original credit card company I owe Fifteen\nI understand it they write it off I don't know if they did ... were you ever suit or no but there was a judgment so that means you are now that means you were sued okay All right\nAnd so uh you got a judgment against you in a ... it's a little complicated because ah they forgive me ...\nLet me tell you the whole story okay if\nYou can follow it a little bit better be original that fifty nine hundred I received a judgment the Ira I mean the credit card company after giving up years later checked the IRS\nI understand the rest of the ten Ninety nine on your behalf because ...\n... what's inside the amount that they fed I ah you said Nineteen thousand dollars the original ... nine hundred I think that they are a copy of my credit report that showed fifty nine hotter\nIt doesn't matter it ... it doesn't matter I don't care\nWhat did the IRS reduced it from I think about nine hundred fifty nine hundred I pay that off so um where my question is that the credit card company and white at fifty nine at Nineteen I Do I have a record\nBecause because no because you didn't pay the tax on the Ninety nine you ended up accepting the ten Ninety nine was for the fifty nine hundred dollars that was originally in default the point is they're not being there ... there are no ... but the reduced did he get\nNo not that I'm the Ira is that\nRight but that's the only thing you have is the IRS they already have a judgment they'd given up their collecting on the judgment\nSo a credit card company has no record now it's only been there done that you just done even though they're like the ... the nine hundred ... does it matter they inflated the fifty nine hundred on the ten Ninety nine\nNot on the judgment they issued a ten Ninety nine for Nineteen thousand you got that were due to the original fifty nine hundred dollars a year damages\nThe question is that the credit card company and played at the original um\nOut yesterday did work time over yes there is no records I guess only because you have not been damage\nIf you are you in dollars that I can you do for a hundred thousand dollars and then you end up paying me two thousand dollars I expect it and I accept that well I've been damaged Ninety eight thousand dollars no habit zing\nO\nTalk we went through that over and over and over again I Would have been I Wonder if you need to twenty five thousand dollars just as a patient tissue God take me
