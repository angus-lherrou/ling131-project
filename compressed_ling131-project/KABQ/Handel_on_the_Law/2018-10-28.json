Know you don't worry about it now you just keep on paying it no one's going to touch you can go bankrupt do you want\nOh okay I don't worry about it that that part is you and that's usually the case is assets are deal I dealt with with the bankruptcy court so you file for bankruptcy and the court looks at how much money you old versus what you have\nAnd then if it's a liquidation the splits up the assets but cars are almost never\nEver put into a bankruptcy unless you've got a Bentley or a Rolls Royce\nA that is a paid out and that's been paid for but other than that what you have users

All right trying to portray it I said if you pay me ... ... feet from doing its part about that and my question is should I get an attorney to hell with upset at me dealing with this man\nWell it depends on how serious you're a medical issue is\nA ... but I think that the dollar\nConsidered talking to an attorney Betty okay\nThat there's enough money there that you want at least talk to a personal injury attorney yeah this is not one of those things where uh here's the medical bills and here's another thousand dollars a first of all I think you're going to have a hard time even you know arguing the medical bill because he's going to come back\nAnd this is typically what happens with the ... and this is the insurance company of Michelin right this was not Michelin per se ... percent\nOh yeah you know I don't believe me you're you just started talking to them or if you're on your own or missiles going to go and they're not going to I that the guy that you're talking to is not going to write you a check for medical is going to go to their insurance company who is going to go through the medical\nAnd figure out what was legitimate what wasn't and gee you didn't have to go there and you didn't have to do this kind of procedure oh Edie Edie\nYeah go you have talked to earlier about this [noise] okay do you need a medical malpractice attorneys and it's just that simple [noise] ah this is handle on the wall\n[noise]\n\nNothing small or not your [noise] your passion your hours your reputation all huge\nYour partnership even\nWith small businesses can only be indicted you'll get the ... and one on one partnership to help your business ground because of the reliable down PCs with end processors you can focus on what matters now getting done\nIn my down to speak with

...\nAnd ... helped me find them back home in my area in the handle any kind of project you can read reviews them from their mental ability even book appointments on line and when my wife loves it\nIs that Holleman minds are completely free to you\nYelled at ... dot com or download the free to get started uh\nOur radio you want to hear [noise] use some up and some down by Gillette program or you know how to make I our radio sound our bed\n\n\n\n\nIt was because I understand but I think they can charge anything above that now you could be that the only charge ten cents\nA and uh that's the way it goes I don't know what the law reads I mean you can look up the law that's easy or just look at the statute where they changed it and just read the damn thing you know just go on the Internet ... ... you know ten cents a bag law mandatory bag payment whatever a search word you want\nBut I based on if there isn't a law that says the stores can only charge ten cents\nAnd they must charge ten cents then all they can do is charged sense but my guess is that there is a ten cent charge in the stores can charge way beyond that\nWell yeah\nSo it ... the answer is you bring your own damn bag you when you go to the store and I always bring their own recycle bags\n[noise] right right right yeah\nOkay there's your answer or what a big legal issue on that one isn't there oh hey can I sue them yes yes I'll give you some lawyers a good lawyer six hundred bucks an hour\nOr what does my lawyer charge a whenever I Need legal work to keep in mind or my expertise is\nIt's a limited as most lawyers are limited in their expertise and mine is insanely limited to third party reproductive laws you know I I went to my lawyer charging I just had an issue with a a lawyer headed I needed some a business documents are six and a quarter an hour\nSix hundred and twenty five dollars an hour and by the way that's not off base either for a good lawyers summer seven\nHundred appeals lawyers can be nine hundred thousand dollars an hour senior ... senior partners in a law firm you can run nine hundred thousand bucks an hour\nSo when you have to pay for a lawyer and a good lawyer you have to look at whether you have a good case or not\nAnd that's why I Love law it's the principal thing I Want to file a lawsuit okay go go for it you know you'll enjoy yourself and then the judge says you're absolutely right thank you the other side can't do it anymore and you're out Fifteen thousand dollars\nA Israel Israel I Am here yes or what can I Do for you\nAll right I'll faster for ten years um you know and I was a pretty conservative denomination\nA long story short my wife had an affair on the nomination did not care whose fault it was if you're not able to lead the outcome God or lead your own house Kelly the help of God so I was removed from ministry while kept my ordination\nUh for two years I was I'm working back and forth or email talking about getting in ... the pastor\nA finally here's later I was given my termination notice however they back they did it take decades before my ten year where I Would have invested in my tension play a lot of my church lots I wipe it off like I say it that there might just rude\nAlright well first of all I did what denomination is is\nA Methodist\nI'm Sorry free method is yes you know I deal with that is have you considered becoming would say a Muslim or a Jew\n[laughter] oh actually I met you ought to use I should just go that route\nOh you are if you don't like I Love that because you know what the uh you know what people called messianic Jew so people that believe in Christ\nWith that Christians that's all we call them they're not messianic Jews just saying just throwing that out I always had a pleasure talking about that a ... where you can do ah I think you can go for your pension because uh that road knocking you off one day a is retaliatory\nAnd his printed tear a predatory I mean that is I mean they're just a bunch of pastures they really are to do that well they sure have that Christian outlook on life don't they\nAh and yeah absolutely\nAnd that's the issue of uh their belief you can hold your own house in order you can't leave you certainly can't a lead a house in God or which is also a complete ... if your wife leaves you and a has an affair as somehow it's your fault I Love that\nMan that's another reason why he decided just switching ah religions Israel I mean this this is a tough way to go it really is\nNo no I'm I'm thinking like that just I don't like the people I I like God to stop people from much\nYeah All right ah is ah the other possibility of getting in another a person is your ah another church\nKids how do you say that actually I was just approached by one of the new leaders that just stepped up and and one of the higher positions and they asked if I were so interested and uh I\nKinda wondered if if uh if I did do that if they would have to take off the fact that they terminated me and kind of kept me on fourteen years\nNow that's the other issue is as you talk to or the new folks that you are I'm considering going back to the church or at least having a a a a church or what\nWhat do they call that a person who use a congregation congregation that's the word yeah having your own congregation you want to say can I please be credited\nUh with the two years so my pension kicks in and have a ... not only are we in statement but credit for the two years and if I were if if I were them\nOr or ... I Would uh I'd give it to you in a heartbeat because it's so unfair to what happened to you I mean it really is I mean on the face of it just said you know the fact that you have a a good attitude about this if it were me I would've towards the church [laughter]\nSo uh the issue is yes I think you have a legal a right to go after the pension based on their actions but if you can undo that with a new congregation and the higher ups on the church willing to do that\nThis is there some day thirst and host of sense I or radio podcast with twenty ... listening in and I chat with brothers Darren

OK of course all of course\nYeah you don't need a job to be an emancipated minor so you want to look into that but you know the bottom line is I don't think there's going to be a custody issue I really don't\nOkay 'cause I think some cookies around Michigan I\nYeah I Know I wouldn't worry about it [laughter] okay so so much alright yeah by someone was [laughter]\nYeah my kids want to stay

would take my case on contingency basis um my father died I got sixty three hundred my brother's should have been over a hundred thousand and they're telling me the only way I'm\nWhy does you only get sixty three hundred\nBecause she took the other money I guess\nOkay so you have to sue the she was a a trustee was it a trust there wasn't a well it's a world that I have All right and ah she was a I guess the executor\nShe was not appointed she disappointed herself\nSo how did she get access to the money\nI guess he trusted her with the cold or you're the ball right well I I don't know\nI it depends on what the okay that's the problem is that she's going to argue that was my dad wanted me to have the money otherwise you wouldn't have put my name and their high and when the will does the wheels specifically talk about the bank account\n[noise] yeah I'm On the line that I have it to you know whatever's left in there was supposed to go to me\nAll right but that one has ever left there and they ... and it was specifically mentioning that bank account\n[noise]\nYou know what I was told because you know again I I wasn't raised with them my brother's everything but my brother almost dies so he couldn't be in\nCharge you know I think you're going to have a hard time I mean you can easily go to the website handle on law dot com and we have trust in a state lawyers but it's a it's not going to be easy you know how long ago did this happen Regina\nMy father down how long ago how many how many years ago did this happen to know\nHe just died okay so the money how do you know the money's been taking\nBecause the bank told me that the account has been close she closed in February that's when I got\nAnd how do you know it was over a hundred thousand dollars now to cancel\nMy brother shot before he almost died he was in a bus accident and so\nI thought well you it's going to be tough getting someone to do it on a contingency but ah you your brother said he saw it and how did she see it\nWith my father wanted him to be in charge he took him around the\nWheel with will specifically says the money goes to you yeah All right well he tried ... I talked to an attorney or because there was an affair and now the trick is over a hundred thousand dollars taken a contingency that one is a problem because if the money's gone\nA ... and and she doesn't have any money or where do you go see where's where where's the winner gets paid\nYeah so there has to me and she spent the money a regime or what do you do\nYeah if I was trying to get someone to try to maybe helped make somebody said if you go to and file ... they can make make myself um how do you say the ...\nThe executor I don't know that's not so easy to do but it doesn't matter what can happen is all the accounts are frozen once you file your score to freeze the account but it's certainly worth talking to a trust trust in a state where I go to the website to do that because there was a lot of pieces on this one\nFor sure sunny hello sunny\n[noise] probably more in the crowd at grad school to let you all for itself okay that I didn't do\nIn Georgia well I here's the problem you're probably going to need a warrior in Georgia and there are\nA the law schools generally do have clinics where they do help people who don't have any money\nOr it's a these pro bono odd organizations ah we're a law students get to work under a lawyer and get some a practice but you're going to need you're gonna find that out in Georgia sunny\n... that that that's hard\nIt was on vacation in Georgia you don't have to call a lawyer in Georgia we call the law schools in Georgia and find out if they have any clinics\nOkay called enough yeah call every law school you can get your hands on and Georgia and then you may also want to just find out all organizations that that do pro bono work sunny or are you are you bro are you broke [laughter] that helps All right what kind of civil case do you have\nTo go out there and my mom a bill at a lower Britain or ... or he was\nA it was a a lot of a combination is known for this hour\nAnd then the audience I Want to see that I gave them they uh they they're ... and I asked them what to do it if they said that they forget and pay I pay for the deaths of that but the average\nOkay I none of this makes sense on ... you can get the death certificate in two seconds that's that's a public record\nYeah you're going to need a you're probably going to need some kind of a clinic no lawyers gonna take this on contingency and clearly you're not going to be able to pay hundreds of dollars an hour so called the law schools you want to look under pro bono a legal help in Georgia\nRight okay All right All right All right good luck you know it's er just occurred to me that some law schools do have ... [noise]\nAnd actually the lawyers and oversee those clinics are generally pretty good those lawyers are ah what they do is they get paid about twenty eight thousand dollars a year to oversee the clinics and uh they couldn't ah a probably\nA so pencils on a street corner if it weren't for ah those clinics nicely said hand on Sherman way to get one or two calls and say come on bill really\nAnd I will say you have any pencils for sale\n[laughter] All right Tom Europe welcome\n[laughter] okay I get right to it [laughter] okay I worked for an employer for about three years I left that implement about a year and a half ago\nFirst of all you have all these are the same for me to keep it yeah first of all I can tell you I never said OK\nOkay he's alive he's willing to throw you out if he's willing to say you have to this weekend to pop off and get out of there than trust me he's going to lie about any verbal agreement any agreement you ever make its been writing he finds it\nOkay All right a verbal agreement you know the rules at this point verbal agreements mean zero and that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years to common law and common law\nIncidentally the law started\nNot as human rights or contractual rights and all the real estate property and the and it came out of that which is why in terms of common law that is ancient English law which a lot of our laws derived from\nA it says that in real property no verbal contracts everything has to be written this goes back five hundred six hundred eight hundred years\nA steamy hello Stevie\nOkay I get you know yeah if you're on a ... if you're honest uh what do you call it phone speaker phone get off\n[laughter] All right I'm okay this is the bottom line I I'm going to just continue my insurance or with Kaiser okay and\nWhat I wanted to find out let's say my own insurance or just me working out riding my bicycle staying healthy is the federal government going to say when I Do my taxes are they going to impose a penalty\nOn me sure because under Obamacare you have to have insurance and if you don't you uh there was a penalty why would you give up your I help ensure victory Kaiser I'm a member of Kaiser why would you do that ...\nOkay so it's really the reason I'm going to do it is because I have Kaiser so go to another so by BP oh yeah\nI mean I I don't understand why you know the first step is why would you give up health insurance because anybody who can afford it is out of his mind not the habit and second of all yes this at this point it is the law that you must either have an insurance plan or you pay a penalty questionable\nOkay simple and I heard the penalty is based on your income\nI have no idea okay you have no idea yeah I'm assuming it's now it's two hundred and five hundred then it goes up to two thousand I have no idea if you can\nHave the penalty subsidize that would be hilarious that would be all areas because they do subsidize your insurance if you don't have the money but the subsidize a penalty if you don't have the money that probably not\nOkay yeah so so I'm like no legislation\nNo it's not in legislation there's nothing in legislation\nBut the Republicans are trying to appeal you\nKnow they're ... yeah but they pass a law and there's not even been a war that you introduce right now\nUh so this could take this one new chicken take\n... years but China may neighbor passed but get yourself insurance you know please\nHello Pam yes ma'am what can I Do for you on the part had a partnership with the people that are for nine years we put out two years ago we had originally\nFrom bankruptcy personal bankruptcy a few years before so I was able to file on it but my partner file bankrupt and stuff but they still come back after\nA while or what kind of ... first of all was talking about the business was in a in a wealthy or corporation\nForget that partnership\nA and yet they can't come after you are as a one of the partners in since you've already filed for bankruptcy you can't you cannot go bankrupt on it has it been ah I think what seven years since you file for bankruptcy\nIt happened quite\nAll right well theoretically they could go but once that seven years is over you can re file I mean you're never going to buy any credit again Pam that's a given but you can no re file and you could refinance at any time\nSo it doesn't matter if they're suing you doesn't matter if they have a judgment it doesn't matter any ... anywhere in the process all the legal process or you can stop it cold once you file for personal bankruptcy it's over for anything that you would be responsible for what kind of business by the way we talk about him\nAnd it was it was right the ... western and that type of the ...\nAnd why did he go under not an and then there weren't enough customers a or a\nRobbery I got in my shirt and the guy had to close down after nine years\nYou're got Rob what kind of neighborhood where you and that was so crazy\nTerrible Marino valley huh wow that\nIt got really bad after nine years and we get that the shut it down but I was on the pressure that like my partner filed on it that that would have\nNo because you have a partnership\nAnd go what happens is uh you know I don't even if a partnership can file bankruptcy 'cause everybody's into your individually responsible for it right so effectively it's a it's the two of you know I don't even think it's a business it's a straight partnership where you're just personally liable why why wouldn't you do an El Al see you're a corporation\nYeah I Do

those phone calls or they're they're just\nThey're just fun to return now normally a yeah of course it's a scam and no they can't do it and they are in violation of the law and here is the problem you call the authorities and whoever a is a God or whoever handles sad\nIt would probably be the FCC I guess who is in charge of that and why they put in a complaint and then they put you on the list because they've got two hundred and thirty million of those to deal with\nAnd I don't think I'm exaggerating either now I returned phone calls I got one the other day uh it wasn't even a a robocall it was well robo call them a sense of the dialing but I got a live person who I said I I'm with the IRS\nAnd do we have a A N ... urine not a ... and do you have to pay and nice and you have to pay right now and I went really uh yes it will take a will take\nCheck over the phone I Will certainly take a credit card and my favorite one is we'll take a I tunes card or apple cart that's my absolute favorite because you know the government takes apple cart Appleton or I chose\nAnyway [laughter] excuse me so what I did is\nI said really a IRS leaning it was absolutely a go once you give me the number of lean because what he's talking about I said there's no such thing as an Irish document that you're holding onto it doesn't have a\nFinal number on it so why don't you give me the final number oh we're not allowed to do that\nReally\nAnd so I just had a ball with this guy and of course hung up on him and I hate the fact that he called me the bottom line when everybody ever make that

absolutely no ... alright\nHenry Europe welcome to handling the law Yes sir\nYes bill my wife went for a foot better care uh\nThat's usually where they get pedicures you know it was on your feet just wanted to tell you that OK okay\nGo any any way later that night her she got extreme pain into the big toe [noise] and I'm In the morning she couldn't even walk so she couldn't go to work [noise] so we went to emergency and they had to cut part of her male off credit was infected do the pedicure\nSo we gave her medication antibiotics pay off your feet\nFor the next couple of days so she she got to know could go to work\nThe next day it didn't it didn't and got it got worse so we had to go back to the emergency pay there are other co payment\nAnd then they cut another part of her mail and they said go through your doctor so the next day she and her doctor to doctor said I Can't do it our need to send you to pressure so she was off work for four days into the specialist or the following week again she missed like six seven days\nBy car we seen the specialist it got worse but at the removed whole now [noise]\nAnd she couldn't go to work again\nSo she roughly ... ah two weeks of work because of the one creditor do we have a case\nWell yes you do the problem is certainly no lawyer in the world is going to pick it up and read a missing two weeks of work or because of bad pedicure and you have an infection and they ripped off a nail a I mean that's\nNothing there and so what you have is a small claims I don't even know I don't think that the uh small claims I was going to hear a small claims a a a matter of effectively a a medical issue negligence too where you were a method where she was medically hurt you can try\nAnd saying here's what happened uh I've gotten the infection of course if I were the odd person on the other side of that or if I'm being sued and I run the nails will a shopping today wasn't me you got the infection someplace else\nSo I it's one of those saying also what kind of insurance you think now people have\nA while the other thing that we thought of of of going back to the salon and and telling them that we're considering to sue and what they make any restitution\nOkay that's fine you can do that\nAlthough I don't again I don't know how much money you're going to get so here you're damages the the work that was last what two weeks how much how much is your wife when making a she\nWorks part time so maybe I don't know maybe a thousand dollars in the last two weeks\nShe works part time and make five hundred bucks a week All right let's go what did she do she works for a school district\nOkay fair enough so ah she's not a thousand bucks so there's that and then whatever the co pay is on your insurance there is that\nUh so you can try\nI can guarantee you that uh the nail salon I don't know what kind of insurance and has\nA probably it only has liability insurance for the building if someone falls down\nA and breaks a leg that kind of thing I don't think they have insurance for the other thing but yeah what we do is just go there and say hey you know I'm Out a couple of thousand dollars here and do what do you wanna do you want me to sue you and see what they say I'm assuming that the owner is Vietnamese right\nYeah no I Want a shocker a Vietnamese nail salon especially here in Southern California I shoot they carry insurance [laughter] yeah I Would think so although I don't even know what kind of mean ... what kind of liability insurance you have for nails\nI'm ... yeah they sure but so what assuming I'm willing to bet they don't Henry okay so you're I think your ideas as good as any show up there and say I'm going to sue you maybe it'll give it to human trait you got two thousand dollars worth of pedicures there's a lot of pedicures you know that\nA lot of pedicures\nDodge Jerry Jerry welcome to handle\nOn the law right now I'm going through a divorce oh I'm I'm Still waiting for the first court date but we can go to court to the mediator\nNow so why attorney and me a letter they want me to go to their office and they want me to bring in my financial records like track and stuff and they want me to answer your question under oath or like a petition I obligated to go\nThere yes if you're ... you're obligated to go to a deposition and uh you have to bring a lawyer Jerry you can't do this on your own\nBut I I don't I don't like the United states is over with\nYeah so far requested it you know what you have not been mandated to a desk or a deposition yet\nOdd because it just a letter saying we'd like to pose you okay ah no I mean they have to actually uh send you a legal document saying we are going to be deposed back and forth that's the way I understand it I don't do a divorce law but I don't think it's just by letter\nI because you know you say no now the court could order it but again it has to be a court order and has to be under\nA the guise of a court order in other words has to be a legal document which letter is not Jerry\n... it's ... it's it's from her attorney die you know again but it's just a letter I mean I'm thinking well\nI'm Sorry I'm not I\nDon't know not a puzzle or not if it's just a letter you're obligated you but you but you need a ... year but they're going to do those you'd be they're going to depose you and I'm", "year": "2018", "show_name":
