little bit of good news and a world of rather dim headlines I must say the two are set the answer we haven't talked about them on the show before I think are just worth giving a brief bio about them one is Dennis ... who's a Congolese\nPhysician who in the late nineties after that country's civil war I created a hospital treating victims of sexual violence he's treated thousands of people was

started by\nSaying BS I mean they're related and so far as both um are\nKnow urging women to speak out more and they're telling their stories is very important but she drew distinctions saying look sexual violence\nIs not the same as sort of um societal norms which me two aims to address that sexual violence needs to be talked about on the same page as the use of chemical weapons in war it is a war crime it is a type of psychological and emotional warfare and in the case of\nThe ... things like sexual violence rape were used almost as a way of cultural genocide right basically watering down a distinct genetic pool I'm so that they use the lineage could not be passed on but in the positive answering this question I\nCaught that the head of the Nobel Committee said look you know this is it you know these the sexual violence doesn't just affect\nWomen it affects men and the one example she cited which is a cause for much embarrassment and shame for Americans will be for a long time was hey look men can be victims look at what happened up Alou gray prison\nIn Iraq I mean it really is a bad week for the U.S when we are spending international justice in the same breath as you know these campaigners for sexual violence or being praised by the Nobel Committee American actions in the war in Iraq are being condemned it was personally hearing all about him that mostly on the table

detail she went into because we're learning a little bit more as this progress as well we're we're now hearing these up the warehouse workers are no longer going to get bonuses each month for their attendance for for\nExtra productivity which amounted to hundreds of dollars a month on average the Associated Press reporting this make people may be losing about three thousand dollars a year because of these last benefits and one that really caught my attention\nAmazon has this continuing its stock reward program for a long time employees and that's really important because the Amazon you know share prices now about\nAlmost Nineteen hundred dollars a share and when you started employment in these warehouse jobs apparently\nAnd this'll be good to have you're a listener follow up up an employee would get one or two shares a not a ... you know and significant amount of money and then one extra share per year someone in the AP articles saying how was an employee even making Fifteen

'cause there are no water rewarding it um to what extent will they say a year from now well gee look at us our productivity is down our ... we never should have given that pay raise we're going to go back to minimum wage\nThat would be extraordinarily cynical I Hope we don't see that and I will to Amazon's quite say they were not at minimum wage to begin with a ...

to hear from you and thanks for listening to us down there in Texas a Michael in Caldwell New Jersey a Michael you wanted to talk about judicial review hey\nTom left an eye on in your book that crashed it quite sixteen you said there were three way under the Citizens United decision I'm referring to the second one the second I'm quoting here we're here to second it's for the American people the president and Congress ... understand the consequences to unite and break with the court\nAnd you mentioned Dred Scott decision packed the free amendments pat you've legislation choir find the right\nAnd the war I'm Keith explain to me how would that work in the case to send you I did\n[noise] I'd have to go back and read that paragraph Michael to to know exactly what I was thinking about what I can tell you is that uh both Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln set the precedent a three times between the two of them of ignoring Supreme Court decisions and don't pay\nAny on some people can ignore it and you can say basically Supreme Court got it wrong and you could like ... wage a campaign against the court by saying concerted but got it all wrong and maybe like\nThat's what Jackson Lincoln did but but you know in in the case we had her Jackson there were two two Supreme Court decisions that he ignored\nOr the first had to do with the second national bank the court ruled that it was just fine to have the bank Jackson showdown anyway and claiming that it was unconstitutional and the ... the second was the trail of tears the court ruled that the ah the relocation of Indians was illegal and Jackson did that anyway are initiated that I was finished during the president who followed him\nUm in case of Abraham Lincoln was Dred Scott it was the Eighteen fifty six hundred and fifty seven decision that said that that uh African Americans could never become citizens of the United states and you know Lincoln overtly ignored that\nAnd then you know with the Emancipation Proclamation when even a lot farther than that and fought a war over frankly\nA white cake being regard to unite and you just say eat do you do an article ... section to action said the Supreme Court was mistaken and flawed\nWell that's my recollection of one way or ... when I wrote the book is that that was the argument that I was making is that article ... section two gives Congress the power to regulate the Supreme Court and Congress can simply pass a law saying you know we are passing term limits or excuse me we are passing a fight campaign finance reform\nAnd the Supreme Court may not\nRule on this case and he was simply embedded as called court stripping new embed that into the legislation it's been done in a few cases it's very controversial um\n... ... you think the Democrats will start doing that you're black power the Supreme Court where do you think they may they may take additional action that may cause chief justice Roberts\nTo focus more judicial restraint instead of judicial activism because I'm quite certain that even the threat of batting additional ... says would scare their body itself\nI Would think so that's what happened in Nineteen thirty seven I don't I I think in the current environment there's you know the court basically has nothing to worry about but because they've got a Republican president and and the and Congress's in the hands of the Republicans\nBut by twenty twenty if if the Democrats have achieved a super majority in the house in the Senate and they can recapture the White House\nAnd if Donald Trump and the Republican Party has been discredited and the easiest way to do that the thing that most people pay attention to is not sex scandals it's crashing economy and you know that that uh when that's going to happen is the big question not if\nBut if that was the case and this court with Kavanaugh or Amy Coney Bryant or whoever\nYou know a Trump ended up putting on this court if the court starts handing down these these locking or error kind of decisions where they say child labor laws are on constitutional right to re right to unionize laws are unconstitutional though Medicare and Social Security are unconstitutional um\nYou know government support and housing is unconstitutional these are all decisions that the Supreme Court in the past has made they have said they have said exactly what I just said\nAnd I'm Nineteen thirty seven for and Franklin Roosevelt scare the hell out of them by threatening to pack the court and suddenly a you know one justice in particular ironically his name was Roberts started changing his votes and and going along\nYou just do pressure is necessary\nYeah well this will be losers pure political pressure\nOver all I mean you could just add to the pet when they go\nAs a couple of there's a couple of ways to pull it off and want us to records European legislation another when the through an amendment to the constitution which is what move to amend the vt

Bible Evan five eleven camera news one stronger and why ...\n... with these picking up\nYour phone calls and Paul and wouldn't they'll washing hey Paul what's on your mind\nWell you start to mention a little bit about my topic is what is to become the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh\nWhich ... you mean the sexual assault allegation\nYeah okay and uh you know we we have to look at least to talk to this is not a matter of beyond a reasonable doubt if not even a matter of\nPreponderance of evidence it's a matter of sufficient doubt the fish in doubt as in playing Russian roulette Russian roulette is one in six or one in eight no one would do that right right talking percentages that are very low uh and I would say that\nRegardless of Christine Blasey Ford's F might lead set that aside his own testimony left plenty of doubt deal\nWhich is why the NBA has reopened their inquiry into whether is downgrade to merely qualified status should be drawn downgraded further\nAnd twenty five hundred law professors yeah that was signed an open letter against his is a domination or I guess is a confirmation and twenty five hundred by the way this was on another program a is a Fifteen Percent of all the law professors in the country because there's only about Seventeen thousand of them\nWhile I was wondering I was wondering about the context that's fascinating\nBut this is what I Want to talk about why after I think what's to become a if\nThere's an article in the national review it says well you remember the book Harper leads to kill a mocking bird were a black man was accused of raping a white woman\nAnd the movie Gregory Peck play Atticus Finch who successfully defended the black man they're saying if if we are in this context of concerns would be a right to hire so go playing racism\nAgainst sexual assault\nWell this is this is my point in my first hour ramp Paul where I I I was going off on you know you've got four different Fox hosts now who have said that this is all because Kavanaugh as a white man\nAnd and so ah okay who's going after the white man well there's only two people of color on the judiciary committed about Democrats won demand Wonder Woman Cory Booker income Harris is that what they're saying you know I haven't been watching Fox News so I don't know if they're showing you know a black senators when they say this\nBut you know racialized in this is insane\nWell let's look at an even keel we're century laughter hung out to dry yeah Democrats were in ... were in control the Senate at the time and so what happened and it was re fight against sexual harassment\nAnd Joe Biden was like a holiday after what a black\nOn the court because a black man just died left the court though so it's it's insane and this is what we have I I'm very frustrated time because we have\nA white woman being a ... a alleging sexual assault against the by the fucking sexual assault when you when you come in covering her airway that's just plain first degree felony assault rifle but\nWe have this this is these are two white people and fifty three percent of white women voted for Trump\nI don't know how to advocate for women for women when that's what happened fifty three percent is not the women fifty percent of white women women obviously the majority of women but that was made up by women of color\nThere was only three percent of black when I voted for Trump or as I recall and and and and this was by the way Paul and then let's you know reminding each other in our audience this was after the Access Hollywood tape came out in which Trump bragged about grabbing women by their crotch\nAnd and uh you know bragged about sexual assault and said you know when you're a star they let you do it at cetera et cetera I mean this is this is widely\n[laughter] so are we certainly leave Christine Blasey Ford hung out to dry\nThe only way it sure looks to me to continue this investigation these allegations is for enough people to get off of their snooty whatever and start voting and if we can take control of the house of representatives then they can open up hearing cetera\nContinue looking into this but otherwise this is going to vibrate and we're going to be in the same as it should not be happening twenty seven years after Clarence Thomas\nWhile every member may you know after ... class Thomas was put on the court um and again Democrats control Congress there was no follow up on those hearings and right\nYou know ... and ... and ... ... and the other thing is uh you know black people being subject\nEvery sort of is mostly black being shot while I'm On black black vote him very small number\nThat you know part of that is where is the legacy of Jim Crow\nYeah we all need for the young people voting you know basically the only minority group the Trump wants to go after the vote heavily are are older people and even there he's surprised at the mall thanks a lot of always been here for seven anyway and he says while he's at the end of the show\nSo I thought we'd have another hour\nPatio thanks so much for being with me that I Hope you have a great weekend calm and was sending comfortable weekend don't

McDonald or the Central Park five before we get to you attorney gray and Melanie Campbell and the rest of our panel we're going to go to attorney Lori Lightfoot because Reverend um [noise]\nThis is really unprecedented what happened here\nWell the rule of the camera must not beyond estimated the consciousness of people in Chicago's diverse um [noise]\nIt does happen and it's just like what I Want to make sure isn't that a Van Dyke is not just the photograph of the system of losing the tape for two days even do that\nThe police lying is his cover just doubled previous cushion he's simply a parliamentary system that must be dismissed Gloria\n... well I agree I agree with that a hundred percent um we've already seen the fallout\nFrom a lot of what's happening in the aftermath of it they release\nIt got to have a hip and kind of have fires we have a male who now is not why and there's no question that but when she suppressed\nThat video was standing in a lecture\nAbsolutely played into the decision not to run for re election but we still have a lot of you to do the guardian should come on and accountability camera that will come with a consent decree that to be imposed upon the police department I think we can't underestimate\nLasting effect that the death the pressure of the video and then the fifth wheel had um people all across the city for ... light charities want African American farmer panel\nSet aside all the distractions you fall in love two options for defense team tribal for a long way to white racist appeal hoping that the light the tumor on that panel\nWould appeal and sympathize with Jason Van Dyke and McConnell Donald all that was put to the side and the jury rented a bird is the only one that was consistent with the other is the truth guilty of multiple milestone\nMultiples you knew about the situation Laurie\nWas unique because if we look at the history particularly\nRecently in other cases where there have been a video and South Carolina that plan to pick up the hill in in ah in Minnesota the case\nIn Oklahoma but a man with almost half a mile away from all female cop and shot him all we have videotape it\nEvery single one of them and what not a single conviction there for the first case say there with the conviction of an on duty cop killer\nShootings and cooperation that's just not happening in the United states\nWho was the difference in Chicago\nI think the difference lies ... heightened consciousness people all across the city had and and frankly that that I have to get the prosecution team up ... and I actually think it hurt Jason Van Dyke\nBut he took the stand had testified because of the church that we appear to be able to push\nHis testimony completely contradict that videotape evidence and he said he and his team are such they say that believe your eyes but you know we're actually pushed me to get\nPushed me about this testimony was he said the white guys were bulls and they kept coming in he didn't see as the stereotype quite Bolger guys coming out only with the [noise]\nWell I think the I think also the Tony ... is evidence that came out in the trial but I had met her before long bike was listening to the radio fees and asking why the officers when you see the ... and that explains why he barely\nCredit card power has come to light up and shot across this partly to kill the climate so he'd already made up in his mind that he got to use lethal polish\nWill you know every now and then after a long line mentions the something unique above the immaterial situation kept us differently so much food for example in Chicago or something called us different\nAnother plumb these with the funding moments politically chase a spokesman for the new goes back to the bushes who will\nI thought about it but they couldn't go back and he spoke to her grave when no one in the beginning of the end of the machines we knew it was for them to\nPeople yeah BLM cross party lines and maybe just maybe look though Trump unleashing something politically it's very different in the city and it may be around the country\nPart of the what the judge gives a defense bill district almost every ... every blood jury do real\nWell frankly I I think it was unconscionable suggests allow that to happen um the the fact that the defense made up a pretext\nTo get rid of virtually every black jokes and the only ... during the heated it's when the prosecution finally told me the jacket can you the fence using it starts to get rid of the blast juries but it it they may try to ... Jews have on it only white people\nThe only people who are expressed support for police officers under escalated the power the capital and they underestimate what happens to the ... almost every time when most jurors are and pat on\nThe hit my listen to that evidence they take this job than she is a critical part of our democracy but registered voters and I want to emphasize that can register voters get drawn into a jury pool on the panel to judge you\nAlmost all of a city that's a very very serious and they certainly took their job seriously when they came back with a light for you to\nDo with Mrs wishes was the in the case of ... to ... bloods arose ... we didn't have the right to vote\nTo them one gloves or other twelve hours suspicious but this year or two students seriously and it seems to me that when you're saying you use your stereotypical descriptions of Columbus though it just didn't fly but\nI think they I think some of the records that I've heard of the issue is publication so offended by not only the thing\nIs that Jason Van Dyke says the overtly racist appeals fenced it they were playing the age of seven white Jewish\nI'm holding my number three men and the editor estimated first\nTo make a day it is supported by those distractions and focus on the other one [noise]\nThat that you read the situation\nI mean I think I think that's all right you know my my focus on when I talk about an article was\nYou know what was their readily apparent hypocrisy have everyone you at the same time we're clamoring for how long about how important the presumption of innocence wire\nAnd the case of Brett Kavanaugh ever incredibly ironic to have their sandwich\nAs I'm On the ... trial a national conversation about how important it is to prevent people in a sense but of course\nI'm you know the little comic like Donald with not offered any of those um because I'm ... and uh he was considered to be on like the resell are lacking in value\nWe'll be we'll be right back and just a moment\nEverybody keep calling us had one eight six six five nine for hope one eight six six five nine full for six seven three and attorney likes that don't want to hear you weigh in on this\nAs a candidate for mayor because the Central Park five case and the little pond McDonald's these these were municipal cases um but you also have substantial experience in the corporate world and so we want to see what you have to say more people live just a few minutes\nYour\nOpinion one eight six six by nine for hope no one in five nine four and seven three [noise]\n[noise] this weekend Asia box office [noise]\nSummer maybe over but there's another marvels superhero film on deck in the form of that um which is along the side of but not part of the marvel cinematic universe Tom Hardy stars is the title character and we see the origin story of Allegheny superpowers\nBut only when he shares his body was an alien somebody wrote Michelle Williams ...

I'm I'm struck by the\nSeemed to just as you since you mentioned that up to ... ... is the last the today in Georgia ministry ... up to the nice used is does the do the assumption that you know a little more liberal move toward Fifteen but really the ... the national day for older attrition\nWell some states are even more restrictive than that right in Arizona you have until Tuesday ... to register to vote and so you know if you're listening right now I'm thinking about oh well I should check when the deadline is no you should go to vote dot org right now before the deadline\nMake sure that you're registered to vote and make sure that your updated you know if you've been listening to the show you know the millions of people have been purged from the ballot\nOr they've been taken off the rules are the only way you can make sure that you get to vote for people like Stacey Abrams or Andrew Gillum um you know accused and cinnamon in Arizona a is to make sure that your registration is active in many of them but\nThe trouble on Tuesday or not to the mines is more or less the same day okay look look written\nAgain [laughter] what\nAm I going to try to argue over yet we can write because many many of us we're not talking over\nBut you know but I Want to get to this point because and I'd like to go to to you ... grade because this credible article that you've written and Melanie Campbell and you and I mean men I'm not excluding you tape and I got all these great limit here attorney might foot um\nI Want to know the intersection analogy I was so glad to see someone time Brett Kavanaugh to his chagrin I'm sure and horror to Central Park and don't want to die but why did you do that\n[noise] well you know I knew what was on my mind that me and\nWhile the national attention was very much better than that Kavanaugh I found myself watching um [noise] a officer Van Dyke testimony\nAuthored a sitting at my desk at work in between cabinet are well then I just I couldn't tell me that have hotter the uh how the conversation around um [noise] you know pop McDonald shooting\nWith though so different from what what the population would ask you to believe that are being asked to try and and Brett Kavanaugh when I listened to Donald Trump's speech I think it was true the night in the city when he was mocking Dr Ford\nAnd talking about why it is that we should support judge Kavanaugh's nomination it kept coming back and back again to how just have it all live\nPerfect ally in my gosh you went to Yale he says it's over and over here the perfect ... he went to we had kids\nHe has a white and of course the question becomes does he not think the same of the ... executions\nOf course the attorney grain he said he has he said he's a perfect person because he finished at the top of his class I mean how does it lead to them is just on here in ... but you know what it's always been there right\nNow that she was one of the things that thinking about it too is that what he's talking there was no accident he went to Mississippi Canada says there's a U.S Senate race in Mississippi\nAnd so you also have that and and with my answer to it right now we're just going on here is not really dog whistles they really out loud loud\n... from bowl yeah [laughter]\nYou know it's so good so ... myself and maybe a bottle of\nThe phone from the south understand why people think it's a delight that I grew up with an even now and you look in the audience you're not seeing grandfather's here than\nThe sun and the and the daughter you seen the new generation of white\nSupremacy being a developed before our very eyes of how they think about white privilege and and white combination in this country that's why I keep going back to that because at the end of the day they did not care McConnell number they will they were very disciplined when Dr Ford finished testify and they went straight for the jak over why because they do they need\nTo have enough people inspired to turn out for our side and so when he could be able to connect these issues into positive prescriptions at the Democratic party can actually offer to our own people and not just talk negatively about the other side\nAnd when we get back I just want to get some comments from attorney Lori Lightfoot because we're in Chicago we've got a contentious mayoral race coming up\nAnd we're not just looking at the federal a federal level seats were looking at women at people who have a certain sensibility let me put it this way who could become mayor will people be excited here because we look at look\n... yeah but\nI'm saying when we look at look ...

who else has to build up in\n... and I think you brought that up most effectively of course not Van Dyke was an employee of the police department [noise] she was a\nLike a foot soldier on the street he took orders and every level of that trial he was merely the person on the street and executed a liquid on the cover up\nA lot of flip the complexity of the face attorney\nAnd the detective who are assigned to that case the complicity was with the fraternal order of police who are ... who give provides the guidelines for how a police are can be\nSuspended or removed from duty I mean how long that one has to wait before you can real fast\nAnd they ... the the city held a tape blood that would let them use and and gave for the million dollars five ... five million dollars that's a pretty sight unseen it's kind of heavy well\nYou've got the mayor the corporation council who had prizes draft the settlement agreements with a supporter of his or her team\nYou have the city council who've also profiled this stuff so that's a whole chain of systemic problem in our system in this city and cities around the country and that is a for the more grief as\nFar as the greatest of what a van Dyck that he he shot that boy\nAnd doubt comfortable that nothing would happen because the cover up had it not been exposed by the air for a ... a release of information about Jamie Calvin and and

him directly you said that all they could do was put a a Van Dyke on student but the tape was being held by the city\nAnd the corporate council made the recommendation that they pay the five million dollars silence scenes so that putting rules legally put parsley loved the mayor and the corporation could also be those cows who voted for a million dollars sight unseen\nTo cook I think I don't feel
