{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "\nListen to some other show I'm Geoffrey Smith\nWith us now Luke Vargas talk media news talk many news dot com look what's going on what new information we've already we're already reported here at least pass along reporting here that in the ah the the suspects and taken into custody these rich Republican the Trump stickers on his van\nHasn't been convicted of anything to be clear now than they are now been what eleven eleven by Bob's et cetera that twelve uh what else do we need to know what are you covering\nWell I I'm a covering the story in so far as I'm I Am on the group a messaging\nBored with the rest of my colleagues who are working on the story that they seem to be saying that uh well let's just say this at two thirty the department of justice will give a formal update on this and I think until then I at least will hesitate I'm passing along information that I Can't quite\nA you know a ascertain it's Providence this is not really my beat 'em so let's just leave it there with your permission I I think what I've been focusing on today are are events over seas which often get quite buried or as we get a swept\nUp you're saying the world is relevant if I'd bombs are male nonetheless world is still relevant how dare you sir how dare you have\nThe one thing I've been looking at with with some interest is that the defense secretary Jim Mattis or whom many folks think might be on his way out there than some reports that the likes of 'em\nAre made up their acts that that model exaggeration but everybody's got fired after the\n... yeah yeah I mean the ... and it looks like John Bolton may be responsible for circulating reports to the press suggesting that uh\nMadison is on the way out that we have some palace intrigue here where are you know Bolton and some of his ilk seem to think ... is an annoyance and that Trump or could replace him with\nSomeone who will let Fay go a little bit harder on Iran if that's possible to do in the current environment um and and yet what it appears uh Madison is going to do even though some of us have may view him as sort of the rational savior in a world of of Trump tumbled\nIs he's going to give a speech tomorrow in Bahrain which is a very very close ally of Saudi Arabia and according to embark owed a bit of that speech he is going to basically say that if if the U.S\nQuestions in any way our relationship with Saudi Arabia but we're going to create a very dangerous political vacuum in the middle east and that Russia will sweep and instill that vacuum I think that you know one completely over states\nRussia's a power to be able to be an ally anything like the U.S has been in the middle east and seems to be in the exact conformity with the kind of throw a status quo policies toward Saudi Arabia that the U.S has\nEmbraced in democratic and Republican administrations for decades so again if if you thought for a moment that's the ... killing the subsequent cover up\nA and everything else that's been abhorrent about the Saudi reaction to this is going to prompt a major rethink of this alliance in Washington I think Madison is a comments suggest otherwise that uh you know we're not just going to hype or over hype or mistake the jobs impact about\nReal relationship uh we are actually going to be actively sort of talk up um what would happen if we dared question this and and we met us really seems to be implying\nA we'd be leaving a very very dangerous situation if we really thought this relationship I I'm an ear to ear these remarks but they don't bode well as to a possible sort of shift in policy here\nSo let me make sure I've got a I've got the he said he said correct so short the uh\nMadison has been viewed as maybe on the outs certainly in some conflict will jumbled and I think we have this mythology that there's well they were the good Trump people that will save us I I that's not how I see the world I don't see a lot of facts that bear it up but you know\nSomebody's willing to post an anonymous ah bad to the to to that a fact\nAnd and what you're saying is that Madison's comments where instead of just saying the same old line of no no we need the Saudis because we need a bowl work in the middle east\nYeah and I would say you know um I I agree with you that trying to draw some sort of line I'm separating out the like rational good Trump\nFigures and the unhinged bad ones is a little bit of a complicated task what I Would say and then maybe not one worth\nEven engaging in what it is I think something we can see pretty clearly is a difference in the caliber of person who was brought into the administration early on when I think ah yeah I mean Trump's ah I'm based instincts were still pretty clear to a lot of people but he hadn't done a whole lot of\nSpecific harm in office yet and I don't think you would get people like Mattis\nTillerson Nikki Haley now I think those were people who are willing to take a bet on their careers um and that's probably why they some of them of move on to other things I was listening to Nikki Haley at the U.N Security council\nOr on Wednesday when they were hearing testimony about genocide and began more I mean she was giving these\nQuotes from John Adams about pesky facts and things like that and I said this is you when you are not going to find\nA new hire to the role of UN ambassador who no matter what the issue is going to go in front of the world and talk about how much\nThe U.S values facts I mean any replacement to her at this point is not going to be in her model and so I think the same is true of mad at us\nEven if it's a stretch to say that you know perhaps he's one of the good ones but uh yeah I I Do think you are a lot of that type of talent that came in a early on you're just going to get different people now who who probably are okay with a short term stint in this administration and care less about\nRejoining I don't know serious foreign policy circles after their time in in in the White House\nAnd what do you think we we only got about forty seconds left but ... what do you\nThink should happen ... many news ... news dot com\nHow should the United states the reacting to Saudi Arabia\nIs a is mad as wrong or is the administration wrong that that that alliances important should we draw from the middle east because we've only made things worse or is constructive engagement given are still need for oil or something we should be engaged in what do you think or you just want to quote someone else feel for doing that\nWell the oil is five percent of our imports that's not giant and a Saudi Arabia is a huge I purchased a ... a producer of our military arms but overall you know engagement\nWith that country is still relatively low compared with others and I would say you can still is constructive engagement but not just be willing to do anything for your ally and let's see if those are those military trade as leverage on our side not the other way around\nMubarak is thanks so much money\nYou have a good weekend [noise] we're gonna be right back it's not the weekend yet [noise] we're gonna be talking about one of the biggest things happening in media right after this [noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to um [noise]\n[noise] Hi I'm Randy\nThis is Dave where the founders of bomb makers of the most comfortable socks and the history of feet so comfortable we sold him donated over eight million pairs yes\nDonated why we learned that socks or the number one most requested clothing either been homeless shelters so we started bomb us but the mission of donating a pair of socks for every pair we sell to donate and saw a lot of socks\nWe became obsessed with comfort we reinvented the sock from the ground up using the best materials available like this off this and most comfortable cotton getting rid of what wasn't working like that annoying co seem you could probably feel if you wiggle your toes right now\nAnd inventing a few new comfort innovations along the way like art support that feels like a hug around your mid foot\nAt work people tried them

Tom and get twenty percent off your first order that to be out and be a ... dot com slash th L. M. bonded dot coms last time [noise] three\nYears ago making a murderer became less a TV show of\nForce of nature and data uncovered and re injustice in the criminal justice it was also completely death on it and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this ... Brendan daffy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too hard to re budding emerge\nInstitutions like community colleges in public schools\nAnd that that people have the ability to communicate with each other that's my call access channels are set up in the United states\nSo as a ... even more just really present personally examples the very first media thing I ever did was held by beyond wore a television show I didn't help very skillfully if I was a you know I had a middle school and my younger brother and my younger brother right now\nUh one of his job he works too but one of his jobs is running video for a successful local artist\nUh and now I Do a bunch of stuff in media helps train people to do stuff as well as covers stuff that's helping out covering local stuff\nWell I think it's as that's why I think it's it's actually at the media diversity success story um that you see in public educational and government access television because you're training grounds for people who want to do creative things they may not be in New York City or Los Angeles I'm the maybe in small towns all across America\nAh but they have a desire to be able to communicate with others to to use the skills to be able to build skills in many cases build a career so that when you're talking about that use media experience that happens at a\nPublic school or perhaps in a community setting after school of public access center has a lot of impact on on the creative community in\nIn in many many states across the country and actually we she just her case after case of people who got their start in community access media either on the the public radio side or the commercial television side\nUm and it's actually one of the success stories or media system that we actually have the ability to be able to have people in small towns across the country and maybe and media markets that are\nLarger than that but they actually may not have\nPower they may not have the the inside track to be able to get into a says she'd be Asher and NBC Universal\n[noise] the system to actually allows\nIt is right drink a lot a lot of coverage allowed access not only to information but also to the to means communication to learning those mean what is happening now with the SEC trying to do right now as I understand that try to change the rules\nThat a lot of this stuff is funded it's almost entirely funded by cable franchise fees and the cable companies have been lobbying to change that and are having a little more success now and please explain\nWell what's happening right now is the FCC's trying to ... to find a balance between local communities and an industry\nBy tipping the scales toward port industry and specific uh they're trying to make sure that industry gets breaks or the use of public property to be able to make money the cable ... the local communities give out\nOr is it kicked in the balance so that the public property that that a a cable company has to use to be able to get to your home um\nAnd they don't own all that land they need to get an ease meant to uh or or some other permission to be able to run all that cable they're not just going over the airwaves like\nThey actually need to get a license to be able to get to your home or to get to your apartment building\nUm and the humidity owns the property to be able to go through the the entire community itself rights or the public rights away are are controlled by local communities one of the things that was enshrined in the Nineteen eighty four cable act was a that local franchise fee and local support\nCould be a could be gotten by local communities from the cable industry to be able to make money\nBy having cable channels go to your home\nNow what's happening right now as the FCC is trying to tip the balance insane and said that you know a cable company is not making enough money\nTo state that again for your job the cable company is not making enough money um how\nNot a real hard time I really I I I I very out in fact I've been starting to send money a little bit each month to the cable company because I'm worried about him away now I Know that it's called my cable bill it's expensive it's a lot more expensive than my community media memberships that I'm ... and\nAnd I think you know because you give you one example\nYou know we've got like a minute to make sure I Want to make sure the most important stuff gets out\nOf the most important thing to know is that what she sees specifically looking to\nChange the change the rules are by which we define what a franchise the is and what other kind of support for community media is and it it will in danger um the ability for local communities actually have these channels the thing that we are very fearful of and the rulemaking that's going to be happening or this or this fall\nIs that you have to actually redefine what's support is allowed and we actually will see these channels disappear it's it's a it's a terrible thing\nRight and so so you have these these community outlets only the only outlets that actually gives an accent the media that's not controlled by Mark Zuckerberg or by you know media oligarch and below the chance to use them that is part of the deal\nFor them using the public right away and they're trying to change it so that instead of getting money they can say well we'll let you the channel in them that we're going to charge you for the channel and they would be able to afford to go out and this is when the rulemaking happening when people find out more we got five

piece\nYeah I mean if you want me to ask you a question right away I couldn't do that but I just want to introduce the audience again to the concept of civil information which is something I came up with a Nineteen excuse me two thousand and two\nIn Reno and it's a different tool in the bag of activism we understand civil disobedience civil resistance what your post sort of negative or reactionary civil information he has got to do it\nUm your civic duty as a citizen and then civil behavior and how we deal with people and and connect with them and the information in part is that you collect your own information not from Olive Garden media but your own way\nShare it with others and then you talk shared grow organized locally and then from that we have political power trickling up we're constantly to do it yourself program\nAnd it's completely opposite of the big event only activism which is the breeding ground of sixties seventies activism and also the residual effects of it going on right now with those who organized so the question that I Would have to you have\nTo ask you a Jefferson it's simple which would you prefer okay would you prefer one million person march\nOr would you prefer a million one person marchers that's my question that you can answer all take it off the air and then the other major point of view is\nAs soon as the left stops arguing with fools those people who have sort of personalities those people who are the Limbaugh Fox News Trump Tea Party I'm a ... it did\nUnderstood you just stop\nArguing those and then we just take our time to cap communications with sixty to sixty five percent of the people who are actually a progressive and thoughtful and who has evidence shapes their opinion sooner to stop\nArguing share backs of people who don't hardly persuaded by ... actually have a question about whether you're whether you're wasting your time uh I I tend to think that there are more persuadable people than more than most political consultants seem to think\nYou are but I think it takes a while and I think that takes a takes a while to respond also to your thought about uh do that on civil information and it's a new term to me so I'm I I don't know that I'll respond athlete but I Will go a little bit further at least in this respect\nThat much of modern activists culture was built in the industrial age or the uh Mario savvy a line of well after that saying it's all you gotta throw your body out of the gears in the machine the idea of the industrial machine is the thing that was moving and the workers' strike is the thing that could lock it\nIn an information age is not the means of production that are at ... at risk or being purchased it as a means of communication at the most powerful companies now more powerful than the trust hundred years ago the most powerful companies now are Google Facebook Amazon and apple and Microsoft should be included as a fifth\nTheir information companies they control the means of information\nActivism that is only physical there is not also informational the doesn't understand that we are engaged in a conversation that needs to be made a little bit better rather than a lot worse I think his misunderstanding both big and the small picture so at least agree with ... in it with you in that respect\nA Montgomery, Alabama Norma go ahead\nI guess I'm One of the things that I wanted people to be aware of when they go to vote you need to be thinking about who is going to be the governor and the state\nBecause as I see some groups like the heritage corporation alec the federalist society may have been putting their people into offices from every level from your city council on up\nAnd that when you think about the governor's races they have in the background a constitution and they want to call a constitutional convention and it is your governor who's going to be voting on that way that people may not even see a constitution until it's already ratified\nEverybody [noise] so most of the weekend [noise]\nI Hope you have plans\nAnd maybe your plans include democracy\n[noise] got a question a moment ago about whether or not the bread is going to be indicted they were thinking in terms of the uh the the ... bombing that the answer that question is almost certainly know that crying fire in a crowded theater\nIt still is a hard it's hard to prove causation so then if somebody gets trampled that it is the fault of the given person who calls ... who caused fires it's their fault that somebody gets injured but this was not even that even if you could prove it this was even further removed from that so I'm not good I don't want to\nGo that far but it does raise another question is can the president be indicted at all\nThere is a major debate so that question\nAnd if one agrees with Oliver Wendell Holmes who says what a judge will do is all I mean by law\nThen you understand that the answer to the question of whether or not the president can be invited it could be indicted is relatively similar to the question of\nShould Brett Kavanaugh beyond the Supreme Court\nBecause that question might well get the scream court\nAnd Newt Gingrich said just this week whether yesterday\nThat well if there is a painter for Trump stack record tax records then we'll find out\nIf the Kavanaugh fight was worth it\nCharles you got something to say about Fox News from ... Florida it might be ...\nTo\n... go ahead\nAnd forcing them and that's where some of the male Spencer when I was\nGot it right I'm not my thing is though um basically I don't want us to go out\nAnd what I mean by that is because as a Democrat of this planet and our leadership um we have taken advantage of opportunities that they were on the verge of vice president\nFor instance just out of the other day when they were when he when he learned out there among them and and I'm the kind of man or middle Easterners\nThan a ... ram it and all that and then when the thing then I'm like well why\nSchumer are closely coming out of there will if they are I think you should go get them right now you know well yeah that's what America before dinner\nI'm Charles I appreciate I got to answer your question\nRelates to something that Tom says also the generally put too much agency we do too much of our own us on elected officials to control what's happening in the media\nWhen with the exception of the president\nMost elected officials have relatively little purchase with what ends up\nOn TV and the radio and Internet feeds\nAnd so anytime I hear so I so I Wish the Democrats would just say black\nAlmost ... almost every time I can find a Democrat who did say that very thing but they say that that a lot of people\nAre they pointed it to a few thousand people or got retweeted some tens of thousands of people but not to millions and millions are repeated times\nThe other though is you raise a more specific questions why didn't in this instance is it OK well put up or shut up ... we think your bluff and\nWe don't think they're Muslims there if you think that there are terrorists they're Muslims are terrorists other different things\nBut if you think they are criminals there go investigate part of the challenges that feeds the story\nThat if the if Trump gets to call the tune the bully pulpit of today is not the bully pulpit to talk all the time to be the first mover to garner the attention of the electronic hordes\n[noise] and it we feed into it he says oh we we were spot everything he says sometimes we've got to sometimes we shouldn't\nAnd that's a question of judgment it's a high can be a hard decision to make those are my two answers to your good question I appreciate that Charles a mark the uh uh about the Supreme Court you're going to just about our last caller might melt it gets too many else go ahead\nYeah about the Supreme Court you know what are we going to hold the Supreme Court accountable for it\nBasically ah being able to buy a politician us having a party that sold out the country and basically runs on hate and fear because it has nothing for the American people\nAppreciate it marked and let me just say this when are we gonna hold springboard accountable hell no I think there is going to be a moral bus conversation around either expanding and don't say packing court already got packed got backed by the public ... over the last ten years twenty\nI think there will be a more robust conversation about expanding the court or adding term limits to the court about saying yeah lifetime appointment about twelve years there's still a pretty well shielded and with no chance for reelection so really all you're doing is trying to manifest your judgment to make it a little bit less political in that regard at least\nI think there will be a more robust discussion but it's one of the reasons why Nancy mclane wrote her book democracy in chains\nIs it in fact the big move as men by John seek out home by James who cared about Koch brothers for not years or decades but more than a century\nIs to shackled democracy is to make sure that the will of the people is limited\nBy strictures by the Supreme Court and it's been only brief periods Warren Court for instance when the ... which happened to coincide with a lot of the dawn of the modern media age and it got really famous but it's only been brief periods where progressive change has happened because of courts\nProgressive change usually happens because of bigger pools of people not smaller rose but bigger rooms people engaging and operating and activating more and this is why I say that you're priceless\nThat you are the coalition of the ... irrational\nThe good people doing good things for no good reason\nWhat do we learn today we talked about legislative races we did get updates that says or say Iraq has been arrested under suspicion for being the pipe bomber he had pictures of Donald Trump on his van\nWe did have a chance to talk about what's happening with cable companies try to take away community cable and the funding for community cable we did have a chance to talk\nAbout well if you had a laugh or three wishes [noise] what would you wish you and me [noise]\nBut I Want to leave you with whose job is to make ...

I'm In my thirties as I said it [laughter] so I don't ... I don't remember a time in my life where the government has been so right when it's\nBeen like the right words have been so right I Do that you\nCan fix the one and I can't remember a time when it was it were and\nSo I just for a young child from a millennial perspective we we've haven't\nDo you think you've taken the gains for granted I mean I'm In mind you I'm not coming down on you know yeah nothing because you grew up with please I was born in a colored hospital right yeah\nUm I don't remember any of that because we're at pearls ... on on Monday the soul food restaurant owned by one of my white classmate me and I were in kindergarten together mhm so yeah I mean I only know desegregated America to a very large extent right\nBut you good Kevin Qena and Trevor\nHave gone way down the street on this I mean you ... president\nSaid yes ma'am my sister died desegregated the elementary school district the ... and of course I was in Vietnam and civil rights and clay and I mean I I've grown up\nWith that and things have gotten better if we have we've had progress but we can't forget\nMe think about it who who who does America drop bombs on who we were dropped off bombs Austin in World War two right people of color and what kind of government that we support the government steps of press freedom of speech and and basic freedoms for people and so now we have a president\nWho is an open white nationalist who ... who came into office with Steve Bannon and the ... what's that about Steven Miller who expelled white nationalism first thing they did\nWas to go after Muslims and what the what what by the way which and then to go after Mexican migrants would file language and to go after black football players what filed language it is it it's it's\nI've seen this before but I Know this could not in well the people on the thirty percent of America elected basically a mobster president and now what you see a lobster like acts by his followers\nThat's exactly right and can I just follow up\nOn the knees goes on a ... if one goes back and study the rhetoric that Timothy McVeigh who effect until nine eleven had committed\nThe worst terrorist attack in the United states history if one goes in studies the rhetoric he employed to justify his murder of all of those uh innocent people including children in Oklahoma is now interchangeable with the rhetoric of President Trump\nOr if it was once of far right fringe idea\nNow it's coming from the White House and beginning in the Obama administration we saw a tenfold increase of militia groups hate groups neo Nazi organizations a radical right wing\nArmed and dangerous so called patriot groups\nAnd one of the things McVeigh said when he attempted to recruit someone it has caused in the nineties was a man\nWith nothing to lose is the most dangerous thing in the world\nAbsolutely reading recorder yup oh yeah and we see that with a lot of these are fervent some supporters in the far right radicals there on married there a childless and they're\nUnemployed or marginally attached to the labor force and that's what we saw this week with the killers who perpetuated these acts in Kentucky in Pittsburgh and the bombings so it is going to get worse it is going to get worse and uh it's\nThings that we all need to be very cognizant start to be vigilant about I thought we cannot kick this lightly\nMhm I think that that's right I think there's also one other piece that we're missing so far so based on our Twitter poll there are a decent number of people who disagree with us and then they say you can also blame the left yes I'm for kind of the increased\nI'm not just the actions but also just the the rhetoric as a whole\nHere's what you can't blame the left for is that the man who killed eleven people yesterday had Twenty one firearms registered to his name\nYou walked in with an A. are Fifteen and you cannot disagree with that those on the right have done everything that they can to make sure that if you were ever to commit something like this but she would have access to Twenty one firearms and he didn't break a single law until you actually walked into the building started shooting that killed somebody you know\nIf you know what I I must admit when the ... when they named the fella that we're sending out the pipe bombs are posted a lot of pushback on opposed\nTo complain about like the the the word I thank God you're so want to be the word lie because because you had a bit of black person Muslim or someone from the left\nWhen he wouldn't be in custody frankly they will know that you know I Want to do it last\nNight we know that the person that we're sending bombs were\nWhy do they have to learn as well and\nAnd it was one person not a whole group right because remember when they were looking for the the the gentleman in Boston who said they killed his his his pregnant wife Charles somebody I forget his name\nAnd um they locked down the black part of Boston mhm they locked down looking for this black person this black man he said he killed his wife course he killed his wife but\nThat's another that's another story it's the same same living at the same story but you know what a before I get to you Betty okay magnets 'cause I'm sure you're going to want to react and that's where ... feel like I'm Talking to his dad and he and his\nGrandpa [laughter]\nExecutive pastor of the Salem Baptist church largest African American church in the state of Illinois\nI'm but his father's it in his family tradition you have and and you know we love the idea that say [laughter] there's going to beat me up for that on the other side but that's all you know we we know we want um you brought up something that I had overlooked I guess it was maybe it was just so\nHuh and disturbing to me\nYou know Betty ... what were you saying that the bond that we the other bomb that we missed this week\nWe had the bomb that we missed this week with a meeting or that I was like an adult with the ah the African\nAmerican millennials young leaders them for [noise] yeah yeah well you have a Seventy\nTwo year old white supremacy speaking to a group of young millennial African Americans with the show\nAnd they're chanting they're an agreement and my question is I get there and watch what he will not recognize that he's not put any policies in place to protect you that look out for you you're sharing them\nHow they do in a car and driving you and those that will come behind you correct them dramatically but\nWhat is their thinking I mean really what do you what do you think because I don't\nI don't I wouldn't want to I Want some of the American Peter worshipping older capitalism on and and they were buying\nInto the height has made money move band that has made the economy better and I'm short but some of them who have been targeted to be the representative of that type of entrepreneurial ship 'em\nBut wait a minute it'll happen some orange and green I mean they all your brain as if The Apprentice regardless of what\nHe did All right I actually know how to do these things but The Apprentice put him in the light of over eat right and is green a good thing and look how much money I have and look you could be this too and I I still think\nThat's why there's so many people that do support him right now as president even though like you said Kevin Greg who's doing everything against all these people but\nThey see it's still The Apprentice was coming out there so that could be me aspirational and that but many right which gets like God yes David\nOh just very quickly it's just like John Steinbeck side all through the grapes of wrath he said in America a poor people don't see themselves as poor they see themselves as temporarily embarrassed millionaires\nAnd you can only Weinstein\nBut you know I think that's the real reason that social democracy or\nHas not or democratic socialism excuse me has not taken hold in the United States Congress that aspirational delusion of I can be part of the powerful I can be the one with a boot on the neck of all the people\nWe are so many people defended slavery for the confederacy right because they thought that one day they make a big building your own other people\nWhen you know I often when I don't know if people were against slavery as opposed to slavery as much as they oppose being in slave themselves and you can then that's part of the human condition which is why you know the divinity and brilliance of Dr King saying wait a minute\nI'm On bothered by the police being tried to understand that because there's I mean that's a big church so um I you know I I look\nAt all I Am here and I'll feel safer I just feel like okay they're part of it but I Do appreciate appreciate the fact that we had them here go figure and I'm you know the toxic toxic administration or were in talks at the at the\nInvite everybody would go up and said I don't want people to shoot him what anybody what bothers me\nWhen you don't have to tell you I think that we don't want us to put all of the hill historical\nIll of our great country on this administration [noise] we've been sick a long time trying to get well there's also been sick and we didn't we just see we've been slave and we've been free [noise] disallowed would not allow women the right to vote and then we did [noise] I mean it's just\nWhat we all live in the top of\nAmerican American exceptionalism with aquarium in Congress based on slavery\nAnd that's why I was making the point was Keli let's not you don't don't move off the shores\nToo fast let's deal with the sickness and we've been higher on next year's Broadway here more people to live with Reverend Jesse Jackson stay right there David I'm

Reilly you have this business for quite some time Jay Jay are well I call them Jimmy if that was ... years ago but he went into this area before gentrified gentrifying now but\nWe went to school about ten blocks from there\nAnd so he has an affection for the area and when it was\nArea in decline he said let me open up his restaurant a nice sit down restaurant\nUm for the people in the neighborhood has become you know neighborhood institution\nBut let me go to you David ... boy we've had and thank you Facebook flies our family as we've had some fun with them today and he asked you to mark Columbus come around and we love and you take some today David mask yields who you are making a point\nYes you're absolutely correct since he didn't know what you were saying before the break a that Donald Trump does not the disease symptomatic of the disease she is an illustration an expression\nOf American values a Joe Biden said that Donald Trump is putting American values to shredder but those of us with some historical literacy with all due respect to the former vice president know that Donald Trump as a manifestation\nOf this country's a clear history and continue to practice of\nRacism classes I'm a massage any so but Martin Luther king junior is also an American leader who was expressing some American values a we have the Reverend Pat Robertson we have the Reverend Jesse Jackson so\nAmerica is a multiplicity of countries on a collision course with one another and this week we surveyed some of the wreckage that is resulting from that collision\nOr the great historian Howard's instead you cannot be neutral on a moving train the train the trains are moving toward one another and then that movement as demanding\nOur participation and our move toward correction and right now it appears that there aren't too many Americans\nAre allowing themselves to drink the poison of apathy and my hope is that we'll have some positive indication on the mid term if these early voter registration numbers bear out but I wanted to emphasize the validity and value of your insights cheated that\nTrump is not the cause of the problem\nHe is a manifestation of problem\nAnd we're not looking at all of the ingredients in that soup I mean when have you ever seen the CEOs and the chairperson of the biggest corporations on earth leave their jobs to run the government mhm\nI mean what's really going to find something out of it is here I mean whoa 'cause it 'cause that's where the power in ... so I mean a ... year we've been we've had a rabbis Gordon and reads on a our Jewish rather than to weigh in on this horrifying\nTragedy in Pittsburgh yesterday at the tree of life that tree of life congregation eleven people killed six persons wounded\nAnd a whole nation but the whole world is ... ... right well we're all in the morning it let's not forget the two people killed a Kroger new bank skilled in clover we get killed so often you know at the white man who walked out bumped into a white witness who saw him with a gun he had a gun\nAnd the white witness thought he was an active shooter guy he said oh no no no no women don't worry why people don't know why people just ... I'm not I'm not going to hurt you know he didn't just he he just had white people don't get why people because the man's son was on television reporting it he was disgusted by it\nAnd then the fourteen bombs of course Maxine Waters got to pass through hit near ironic that these fingerprint came from the bomb that was sent ... law that's Maxine doing it again you know you got the magazine to see the hot and then pass through hearing\n[noise] yes ma'am they um [noise] the sadness of the tragedy from yesterday as just another reminder of kind of this cyclical decline that we find ourselves in as a nation\nA Donald Trump Wylie is a symptomatic of a different condition he is just the most current symptom he's not the only historical symptom that we've seen\nAnd so there comes a time when there's a a galvanizing or a polarizing figure\nThat inspires the rest of us to decide what are we going to do are we going to sit idly by and Ritalin or in this situation or or are we going to\nA rise up and take a stand and say that our moral center\nIs stronger and more important than what we've seen a from from the other side so I think blaming the president gives the president too much credit\nWe know the undercurrent of the hostility of ah just long standing white supremacy that goes all the way back to the founding of the nation has just taken on a twenty first century variant\nOr in terms of its presentation\nA and recent uh you know demonstrations in terms of who goes to the federal courts and the assaults on inclusion as an American principle it's just an indication that the nation is still mad the entitlement class still upset\nSince brown v board was passed the fact that you would have folks in business leading the government that's called an oligarchy\nOligarchy has come to power and who else there there are now or in real time three or as I buy my last count trillion dollar corporations [noise]\nOne is apple the other was Amazon the third is the United states government and so folks would leave their jobs because where else can you go to influence the distribution of over a trillion dollars of interest\nAnd if you get to determine who gets to benefit from that interest then you're in a pretty influential position and how else do you make your peers beholden to you\nThen to find yourself in a position where they now need you to do something on their behalf\nBut no no stay right there past year eight because that's what I'm trying to get to because while we are looking at President Trump went looking past the people who got him there\nYou know what I was living in the river and I'm thinking well by definition of fake news would be that people on national television on having this discussion that were happening and laying it out that that is not all about Donald Trump\nIt's about the condition of the nation from start from the start to where we are now\nAnd then a man walked up to two black people in the grocery store and killed him and said why people don't care what people are not going to be almost in the black people killing because remember he tried to go to a church first he tried to go ... when I couldn't break open the door to write\nAnd all of that was this week the system all them them a boost with four or five days to servers gamble", "show_name": "Keep Hope Alive", "year": "2018", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "28"}
