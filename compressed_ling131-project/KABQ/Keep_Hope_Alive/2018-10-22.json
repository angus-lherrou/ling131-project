I think came out last year which is scarier by the by which is scarier the book\nThe Nineteen Ninety movie or the twenty Seventeen movie\nI've not read the book nor have I seen the movies but that might be kinda fun what are we kick that around as well the scariest movies ever made the scariest movies ever made for me it was actually a trailer not even a movie\nWas a Nineteen sixty six it was a cult classic B movie called the queen of blood as anyone out there seeing that I haven't actually seen the movie I as I say I only saw the trailer and that was enough um this was a ...\nWho is in that the ... I think and a young Dennis Hopper and John Sex and and a forest Jay Ackerman who of course went on to publish a very famous magazine called famous monsters of film land\nA which first started publishing in the late fifties and and famous monsters of film land inspired countless Hollywood directors are not only in the in the horror genre like people like John Carpenter a but but people like Steven Spielberg as well\nWe're very inspired anyway a forestry Ackerman made an appearance in the queen of blood and then there was this lovely check actress named\nFlorence Marley and she played the alien queen ... also happened to be a vampire [noise] uh and as I say I just I saw the trailer um\nMy parents back in I think about Nineteen sixty seven sixty eight I was three or four years old if they wanted to go\nTo the movies they had to take us us being five children with them usually try getting a babysitter for five kids not that easy so and this particular night we piled into the ah family station wagon a Nineteen sixty two valiant\nAnd my mom and dad went they wanted to see that Debbie Reynolds Dick Van Dyke movie called divorce American style I don't know if you remember it so we went to the breezes drive in in Branford or it might have been the sunset but I think it was the breezes drive in\nAnd we had um a padded kind of a a phone pad in in the very back the station wagon was covered with some nice Terry cloth and we piled in there with our pajamas how exciting was that when you were a child right you were going out into the car after dark with your pajamas on\nSo I'm Me and my four older siblings piled into the valley and off we went to the breezes drive in and we were sort of expected just to kind of fall asleep\nIn the back well my mom and dad washed divorce American style not an inappropriate movie but not a particular interest to a four year old but before I fell asleep of course they ran the trailers before the the main feature and there it was the queen of blood\nAnd as I say I've never seen the movie I'm sure if I did I Would laugh about it now because it looks like it's pretty happy but for a three or four year old this alien vampire in outer space I tell you\nA so Florence Marley in her alien queen get up would haunt my nightmares for the next twenty five years so\nThat was it for me and later I watched the pilot for TV series called the night stalker this was the pilot that aired I think it was like an ABC or NBC ... night premier anyway it was like a Monday or Tuesday night and this was the night stalker the pilot\nBut I don't know I've got a I've got a bad taste in my ... from things from the past with that [laughter] I I I really don't want to go in that direction for help if\nYou don't want to go on the conservative direction\nIf no not at all [noise]\nWell what if they would if they end up forming the next government [noise] I mean\nI don't even know I don't really want to think about it and uh I don't I don't even know what\nTo say both good I'm really hoping that's not the case but the you know\nI I think that they're trying to solve a problem from the end I'm trying to take a from right now is more important than that I don't\nSee why I don't see why I'm I'm getting that kind of reaction from every well\nYou're not sure why you're not being listened to is that a rhetorical ... is that a rhetorical question it's insane is that a rhetorical well no I mean that's pretty much how it goes his niche\nUm once ... once they get in power there they're not really interested in in listening to us that tell you one thing about the pipeline I think it's ridiculous here we are in twenty Eighteen and the fact that we make our energy resources we have something like a hundred times\nUs oil or are in the ground a hundred times we we should be an energy superpower the fact that we do not have\nA pipeline stretching from the west coast to the east coast to me is is just mind boggling I mean I don't care who's in power or the fact that they can't get that done it should've been done ... years ago I just I just think it's a joke it's a joke\nUm anyway uh good luck just keep hammering on that tour maybe someone will answer to hear from you\nOr any way I mean if you were to come across someone that could possibly steer me in some direction that uh\nThat uh you couldn't get a hold of me 'cause it's it's you know it's just been in my head in my ideas so simple um if I can get it across and we're actually viable than it might save a lot of people out of headaches\nLove you tried to have you tried your ... or ... but I actually nor are him down here with a high school with them but he's a he's um\nHe's conservative\nRight okay All right well what did you think if your idea\nOh I

I think for a scientist is how do you even approached this topic because we've done an excellent job in sifting through almost eight hundred issues I think that the fate has published\nOver the last Seventy years but when you look down the table of contents I mean it illustrates perfectly how\nComplicated this whole issue is you've got a Nazi component of an article in there about the Nazis in UFOs you've got to creep did with the mosque men and you know people also report big foot sightings in conjunction with UFOs you've got to go swan talking about\nRemote viewing and a number of people have talked about the psychic connection between each teasing themselves and so forth it's just so complicated I don't even know how we begin to study this thing from a scientific point of view\nWell it is rather daunting and I'm One of the things that Mac feed their door and put off a dress and the interview piece that I did with them was the extraterrestrial hypothesis and that really took

cover some inconsistencies\nThat Kaufman a change some details in his story from time to time\nAnd that a lot of it could not be corroborated um but nonetheless it's a another piece of important I

even the children of the other witnesses Roswell are getting on so his darn Schmidt likes to say we are really in a race against the undertaker\nUm I at this point I don't know that we'll ever ever find out definitively what happened at Roswell so you\nProbably not and even as documents get declassified uh it's still a selective de classification\nAnd uh I think that um we're allowed to know what a government agencies want us to know and many of these cases and we we may never find out the real truth we have compelling testimony from people who say they witness\nAt least pieces of what went on a and\nThere's there's really no way to approve or disapprove of their testimony\nOr\nThe idea that uh we have had alien crashes certainly is plausible that if there are beings are in physical craft visiting um there would be accidents just like we have air accidents and\nOr are these completely cleaned up by government agencies are that's the big question\nIs also an interview with a doctor Jacques Malay included in the anthology is interesting because he has sort of reemerged\nOr on the scene after I'm not sure how long\nUm maybe a decade away but we started showing up occasionally a UFO conferences again told me a little bit about the the valet interview that's in the in the anthology\nWell one interesting thing about the legacy is um that he did evolve\nUm or I should say he has a he has evolved in in his views about a UFOs\nAnd now for example he was an early critic of John kills and killed came out with a a lot of really radical ideas in the early seventies and it looks like operation Trojan Horse and Disneyland of the God\nI'm arguing against the extraterrestrial hypothesis that\nUm what we're really dealing with as an intern dime ... phenomenon and that of an alien beings are tapping into our consciousness and they're playing around with us\nAnd our ideal took a very dark view on this and and for that he was roundly criticized as a crackpot by you you follow just a and valet was one of his critics\nAnd then I'm within a couple of decades I'm In a valet came around to a lot of the same viewpoints that was um an eight there is an alien intelligence\nUm that um is\nAble to um to interact with us in ways that the extraterrestrial hypothesis can't explain\nAnd wrote a book called messengers out a secular not stupid you know they know what they see and scientists should pay more a more attention to what the eyewitnesses are uh are describing\nAnd I'm a you know I ...\nI went through a similar evolution of thinking and um I\nThink it's it's good to point that out because there are researchers in the field who um get wedded to of viewpoint and they stick that viewpoint no matter what evidence uh is\nDiscovered and then look for you know increasingly ridiculous ways to to stick to that viewpoint when in fact we really do need to to be able to um change our theories and our opinions are as the evidence uh advances\nRight you mentioned John ... and he came to a believe that there was sort of a a a a sinister agenda uh and you mentioned that that I'm Dr of LA sort of came around in a way of thinking because he he wrote a book called messengers have deception\nAnd I'm just ... I don't know where adoptive LA is right now and his thinking has he does he do believe that you know that there is that that there may be kind of a sinister agenda though with ... as\nWell as as far as I Know I um I I don't think we've heard much from him um\nRecently um but that that was the evolution of his thinking and uh you know he examined a lot of the abduction cases are we really didn't have a whole lot of literature on the adoption cases\nUntil the the um um seventies and eighties or even though abduction cases were taking place before that just look at the top hunger canyon cases from the fifties and in Los Angeles and in ...\nBrazil um and I have Scott corral us a documenting the\nBrazilian cases including the fiesta bowl is case and what she was very famous\nSo some researchers have come to that conclusion\nAbout the deception end of it that uh the way these encounters take place in the way a human beings are kind of played with and manipulated [noise] um and\nLed to and to think certain things about the aliens that there may be a lot of deception going on [noise] um heels opinion was that hey there's nothing we can do about it and there's a cause cosmic trickster at work\nAnd uh we're just um victims of it will never really know the answers [noise]\nUm and I think we will know the answers at some point uh I think All right well\nWe'll take time out here Rosemary stay with us the magazine present UFOs and eat he presents back with more of the conspiracy show don't go away [noise]\nPolicy that you buy American General life insurance company Houston, Texas had available in all states for details as an IT direct dot com\nIf you're young and healthy you don't need life insurance right yeah that's what I used to think too until my brother died at thirty eight\nJoe left his wife with two kids a mortgage and a stack of bills she couldn't pay\nMary had to sell the house and move everybody into this tiny two bedroom apartment just to make ends meet\nI never want to do that to my wife so I got life insurance I called A.
