and hours and hours at a time and your primary weapon is magnetic propelled rifle whale gun or a guy was rifle depending on what terminology for [noise]\nUm and so you basically with infantry men with a really\nTough a set\nOf full body armor with hydraulic we'd powered with the guy was rifle that shoots a lot of metal rounds really fast without generating much heat or kick a you have a pretty strong force just with that just with the sort of that as their basis but you know\nThe actual tools that you get to using the field come and go because it's a [noise] um at the hardware testing

means I don't even have them in front of me because the classified um but it's\nYou know at least or at least a couple of hundred thousand military personnel but I couldn't say for sure\nBut there's was when we were had completed defenses uh had a\nNumber that was right around ten million for the population the colonies but then not long after that there was a worker revolt because they tend to have a number of the colonies still use a lot of slave labor and as we understand from human history you\nEnslaved people and you know put too much weight on their backs over too long of a period of time and eventually there was a slave revolt that some players are worker revolt so uh they've been in the middle of that the last few years and so we don't have exact numbers right now a lotta people have died we couldn't tell you for sure but it was about ten million civilians\nAnd anywhere from you know a hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty maybe three hundred thousand military personnel\nWho is being and saved a direct ... ...\nHuman beings mostly human beings from here mostly\nThe uh people presto humans who were taken away as slave labor for the most part\nAnd in some cases people who've been there I mean I've been born and raised there for generations since you know their slaves parents work or parents were brought there so in some cases you have multiple generations of people who have been born and raised in that environment but a lot of the original workers were pretty much taken from here\nIn some cases voluntarily in some cases it was hey you want to be a part of our really cool program\nThat'd be great but then you know when you got there it was like oh what I don't get paid for this\nI'm so not everybody who you know was enlisted into any of the colony necessarily got what they thought that they were going to get because once you're on another planet you know people can kinda do whatever they want\nA without much oversight long if there isn't any oversight at all which they're kind of hasn't been so yeah it was at its workers from who've been taken there and family members who've just been born and raised there for decades now\nAnd they are being and slave and some ...\nSome of them that that's what I Want to be clear about that not everybody it's it's the colonies there's five or six colonies they all have a slightly different uh ... economic infrastructure that allows for either a paid workers or in some cases slave labor really defense\nAnd these are billions that are happening these monthly rebellions are they being\nA point down by the the the the ah the marsh defense\nForce I mean I'm trying to understand who who's wearing the white hats in the black hats where they all just green nations of gray or the or the the soldiers the infantry and the army on Mars are they in support of the slave rebellion hunting climbing the slave rebellion\nI've been told that the military this job to protect the perimeter um or to engage at the perimeter is a priority over dealing with any internal squabbles that the caller i._d. themselves are having in fact my understanding that even\nThe FCC and the I. E. R. allow uh some of the the uprising to occur and some of the changes to occurred\nAnd the sense that you have um you know colonies that have divided now into multiple a power structures those revolting those scores sort of represent their traditional power structure and in some\nCases the workers who are in charge of factories that have quotas to meet\nA have been able to meet those quotas and therefore gain some favor with the FCC and the icy the overall so it's not so straightforward as to say oh if you're revolting then you know the authorities are going to put you down because in some cases\nThe authorities I understand that the colonies have been having may albums and you know in some cases just cracking the whip over your labor Carter isn't necessarily a solution\nSo if a revolting parties can demonstrate that they're more than capable of managing a you know themselves and managing production\nOf the facilities where they work in some cases the FCC and the icy the are perfectly happy to see those changes happening as long as the production quotas and send you to be met with a minimal\nYou mentioned production quote is why are they put the ...\nOut of it is now a lot of its military hardware a lot of it that military hardware that were test you know this is my understanding is that they also just do a lot of a manufacturing that becomes part of this\nInter galactic trade system so a lot of a high technology stuff that we know how to replicate and build we've actually got a mate and factories that can produce high quality merchandise that it turns out other species don't necessarily\nA make as efficiently or in some cases even as well and are perfectly happy to trade and or pay for the uh goods that we produce\nSo a lot of its military hardware a lot of it's a high level electronic high technology you know the sort of a advanced breakaway civilization technology\nShips military hardware computer technology a medical technology yeah a lot of high tech stuff\nThe slaves to explain a lot of the the disappearances here on earth so called alien abductions\nAh you know people disappearing from from national parks all over the world is is that when the going missing children is that we're going to Mars\nThere's a lot of answers to those questions meaning anything there isn't just one answer to say that all those people that are disappearing or being put on the military ships or I'm a contractor ships and then take into march to be you know put into labor service or something\nDoesn't mean that that doesn't happen and it does it happens\nQuite a bit I'm sure but all of those things you mentioned are just unilaterally answered by saying people got abducted to go work on you know in the slave minds on Mars uh there's and\nPeople do actually get abducted their abductions by extraterrestrials or few and far they're in between them they were decades ago because of the net that we have sort of keeping people out who

the truth so we think that once you just get your foot in the door as it as it were and we can start talking about\nYou know that there is advanced extraterrestrial intelligence with technology that is visiting us and we can get past that narrative when we can get past that conversation\nAnd then it allows for a lot of other conversations to occur so we think that once you get that first couple of steps going the rest of it will come fairly quickly and I'm not nearly as quickly as most people are gonna want or be happy about but\nAs in terms of how long it's been dragging out for the past seven decades you know it'll seem fairly quickly\n[noise] Gerald ... Maxwell Gerald welcome to the conspiracy shows that Maxwell Ontario\nYeah hey Gerald well hurry Richard terrific thank you you have a question from captain Kramer\nYes I Do I have watched\nTotal recall now just about everything you said tonight\n[laughter] Wrigley without moving\n[noise] now is\nHollywood Ending or call\nExperience\nUm [noise] you know story line sometimes gets pretty close to the truth ah you know production value may as well as where we are going to sometimes part ways on on what ouch truth or fiction um and I will\nMore money to spend on the American government yes I can understand why not\nI mean that's that Randy I'm respond so just finish your thought on that ah Randy\nYeah one of the interesting things about total recall\nIs that of course you're referring to the first version of that movie that was done back in I Want to say the early nineties which is the one with Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd then there is a um a newer version of that film or with some different actors that has a completely different backdrop that the scenario doesn't take place on Mars that takes place solely on planet earth\nAnd it has way more to do with this a separation of again sort of advanced part of the civilization is very poor you know technologically decrepit part of the civilization but the original story which\nThat's based on is actually the second movie not the first one so the first one where they decided to put all this stuff about Mars into it that's plausible deniability for a lot of people where they knew that at some point they were going to start hearing\nOr people who had been there who are going to start having memory recall and we're going to have started having total recall at some point they even that's even a term that we used to describe getting all of your memories back\nThat that was going to happen at some point and so they wanted this plausible deniability so that they could say if so at first with someone like myself you know spending the story the way that I Do someone could say or do you just seem total recall too many times because that's plausible ...\nSomething like that ... even the original again the original story had nothing about that I'm Sorry go ahead ... an hour after another question now\nYeah go ahead Cheryl yes what's your general ...\n... ... the as possible on earth now they can replace term memories with something completely different than what we remember versus Rogers huh\nHum yes and no I mean it's a complicated technological process you it's not so simple as to just\nPick somebody up off the sidewalk and sit them in a chair you know what the hair dryer kind of device on top of it and completely changed their memories it's not that simple it's a lot more convoluted if you want to really really really try and change but someone thinks actually happened\nAnd what their their actual memories are which screened memories are ah are holographic memories or even artificial neurons or things like that that they can use that can be a really involve process if you're really trying to cover up some memories are trying to hide some actual memories it's certainly not cost effective to do that with every single person\nIn the civilian population it only really serves a purpose to use that with select personnel who have way more information in their head and they consider to be um\nYou know secure or safe to have those people walking around with that information or readily available so that is false memories and screened memories are implanted and people who are leave the service who have tons of classified information and their mind that they don't want them\nYou know leaking out are talking about but it's not something that they can just go around and you know take an entire population in a metropolitan city and wipe or change everybody's memories or make them all think you know or believe that a certain thing occurred weight certain way\nIt's a because that's just not technologically feasible that something you can do to individuals specifically for stripped specific reasons but it's not the kind of technology can wave you know a a technological bond of any kind and and due to a mass number of people across the metropolitan area or to cross a nation or country\nGerald thank you for that Frank is in Toronto Frank good morning welcome to two of the conspiracy show\nWell I got a ... conflicting uh uh information on Mars like I was like I I prefer to start off by saying I Do believe that there was a ... possible civilization or because I've seen
