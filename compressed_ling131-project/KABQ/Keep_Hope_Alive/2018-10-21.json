Catholic bishops to state backed\nCatholic Church which the Vatican had always considered to be in ... I'm right not part of the official Catholic ah family and a Pope Francis went to China he recognized the state appointed bishops and said look I understand this is\nGoing to cause some suffering to people who consider themselves true Catholics who follow the Vatican this is going to look like\nA negative compromise but it was part of sort of a deal but it's been explained to me as a you know in the hopes of\nA big causing the Chinese government to respect Catholics in China more in the long run by doing that and I think there's a possibility to see some mirroring of of how that would go in North Korea of course that North Korea doesn't allow their population to openly practice religions but there is a Catholic\nChurch in Pyongyang where a lot of diplomats and other people go and and the thinking or on the Vatican side is that lucky I said this is a away for Kim Jong tuned to bolster his regime to be seen as\nExtra legitimate but we're not President Trump were not bound by the same sort of political calculations this is about it you know of Angela's Asian of a new part of the world war Catholicism hasn't flourished\nAnd let's also note that there have been people troops in the past where there were concerns it was going to play into the hands\nOf a government think back just three years ago Pope Francis goes to Cuba he wasn't terribly outspoken against the the regime there but he did talk about the desire for people to have greater freedom he said Cuba should open itself up to the world that was seen as\nSort of suddenly advancing political priorities in the Bible back the clock\nTo the early Nineteen eighties ... jump all the second goes to Nicaragua under the sand in eastern government\nDefended nieces were really excited for France is a rather a Pope John Paul to go there they thought he would basically condemn American support for the contras\nAnd instead the pope on leashes on the Sandinistas for their human rights abuses so there's sort of an interesting history here popes sort of having the freedom to be able to defy expectations for let's see if this does it happens it would certainly be a very interesting one\nThat would be fascinating meanwhile you've got these are people from Guatemala mostly family said so you know seeing the pictures a lot of kids\nAh people fleeing Guatemala and Honduras bad both had military coups El Salvador you know there's been run by death squads over and all this goes back to Reagan I mean he's the one and ripped to this area part I don't know why we as a country are not helping put you know these countries put themselves back together\nA instead when there are people flee and they are more than a half million people have fled Guatemala just in the last year\nWhen there are people flee a you know a ... Trump freaks out or or actually he's he's loving it I think oh you know there's three thousand Guatemalans hadn't for the United states through Mexico and of course they're traveling together because that that's how you avoid being\nKidnapped or murdered by by Mexican criminal elements who who pray on loan travelers who are trying to make it to to North America so what's Mexico likely to do about that\nYeah well I think you're right to diagnose sort of the hypocrisy of of the government response here I mean on one hand when this caravan sets off earlier this week the president's threatening to nix are aid to Honduras which is predominantly directed towards\nAnti crime you know helping the judge judicial institutions which are seen as\nThe weak point of that society which caused people need to leave and the first place so that would seem self defeating he doesn't look like he's going to cancel that a but it's a it's a very sort of a ... odd instinct that he has\nAnd then you are right again about people traveling to groups I mean we are basically trying to uh we are advancing narrative at least at the U.S government\nThat we are trying to dissuade illegal immigration because it's unsafe pride in it allows a you know smugglers or human smugglers to profit so here these people are\nAre banding together and going through official asylum channels to stay safe and yet we're also condemning them for doing that right and you're right Fox News on this talks about illegals trying to breach the border which is\nNot at all a part of their plans but it looks like in this case Mexico is going to react differently than I did in April the big difference there is that they've now got that NAFTA deal rights and eat the relationship with Trump has been passed over a little bit ah unlike in April and Mexico gave the caravan the first minute left or a bunch of trends of permits\nWhich allow these people to go across Mexico the Mexican government here at the Guatemalan border is basically stopping people they're saying if you don't have transit papers to come through Mexico and if you're not going to apply for asylum in Mexico than we are going to have to turn your back\nUm and they have asked I think and this is responsible policy they've asked the United nations refugee agency to come to the border there and help process these claims rapidly inevitably it's true the ... Mexico's not safe everywhere but it is becoming more and more a place that is recognized as safe at least in part\nAs a place for people fleeing violence in the northern trying to uh Central America to go so I think Mexico changed his tune here they want to preserve the slightly improved relationship with the United states\nReal quick on the road isn't going to change one animal becomes president and a couple in a month to month [noise]\nI don't know I think there are a lot of signs of theirs continuity in this government and the current government in many ways coordinating with the incoming one to preserve the U.S relationship in the long that's good that's very good Lou Vargas who taught me a news you can follow him on Twitter acting career thanking Luke\nTom we'll be back around and it goes\n[noise]\nYou're listening I'm\nSingle molecule help you manage your weight doctor Jay ... on the FDA accepted breakthrough called reduce zone\nThink back to all of your failed diets if you're like most it was hunger and cravings that the real ... it's not your fault it's almost impossible to lose weight when you're always hungry and creating the wrong foods university researchers have found a molecule that helps manage appetite boost\nSo you eat less and burn calories faster ... zone is the only FDA accepted product would that university discovered a module that I Believe is a game changer for managing weight with reduce zone I finally have an answer for patients who want to lose weight and keep it off\nWhen diet and exercise aren't enough at non prescription reduce zone used promo coach Tom and receive up this sixty five percent off plus free shipping go\nTo try reduce zone dot com that's try our id you zone dot com try reduce zone dot com\n[noise] attention I heart radio listeners I our media is partnering with the most trusted replacement window and door company in America\nRenewable by Anderson to give you an exclusive offer on replacement windows and doors\nRight now you get an extra five hundred dollar gift card towards your project by visiting I Har renewable dot com\nOr calling eight three three three get ... this month only renewable by Anderson signature service means they are dedicated to delivering the best home improvement experience of your life and don't take our word for it [noise]\nLouis or lose Abigail thirty for traveling within one year old son it's hard to hear my boys say mom I'm hungry and know that I only have enough money to buy him a juice box\nA Mario David twelve years old traveling all by himself\nAll the money we we have gets stolen by the gangs\nAnd two thousand nine there was a cool the Honduran Army overthrew the democratically elected president a year after the coup four hundred and eighty thousand Hondurans left their country last year it was six hundred thousand left their country\nThis is a full blown disaster\nCreated by Ronald Reagan\nAnd our response to it\nKnow there's there's a couple of thousand of those people come in today and I said oh my God and crank up the white racists\nAnd increasingly thinking that the word to use by the way I've been trying to get my hands around those are my head around it uh this idea that there is a\nThat we have a system\nEstablished\nWhite male supremacy and continues to hold it\nAnd I think that we should probably call this system apartheid because it's a word that everybody understands\nAnd until we have are are eight or South Africa like reckoning nana truth and reconciliation commission and clean the stuff up\nAnd obviously you know South Africa is out there yet either but you know they they took a huge step in that direction\nWe're going to continue to have these problems\nAnd and the problem is being made worse by Republicans using\nRacial fears of white people as a political weapon and they have been doing it\nAnd aggressively\nAnd are are just like panicking with this election\nAnyhow it's anything goes friday let's pick up your phone calls Lawrence in Saint Paul Minnesota Lawrence what's up\nWhere oh man I'm ...

didn't realize that they were taking a lot of them\nEnded up in North Africa in Turkey and um the middle east at slate\nOh that's interesting I didn't and\nAnd I was just wondering if it because I

but somehow where the ... all of a ... right I I was just wondering if perhaps by might relate back to that but\nI don't know I I honestly don't know I I continue to think that it\nThat all of this comes out of this concept of wealth\nWhich came along with the agricultural revolution when the first person figured out that because food was seasonal that they could lock up the food and most have the power of life and death over other people\nAnd that was the first form of wealth and as well from grew\nWe figured out ways to to figure out who would have the wealth and who wouldn't this is the

voters registering here double the number of signing up before the midterms last year we had we had nine hundred Ninety thousand\nEight hundred previously unregistered South Carolina and sign up to

arguments about why they're not voting\nAnd those arguments really don't make a lot of sense when you analyze them but people feeling the oil and we don't know the extent to which social media is being used and abused to influence\nPublic opinion and putting it back but what people say things like the system is racist black America that never got an airfare shake I don't want to participate in a racist system but what that I'm ignored from from my perspective I think is that\nOkay when you're not in the gang right if we ever going to change it we need more voting not live\nI mean I agree but let me just sent a little bit um\nPeople respond to the local if the roads are not being tend to get the garbage isn't being picked up if all they see as a police car rolling through the

council\nThat the resources don't come to the side of the city that I'm On and so people do use that as a reason not to get engaged which means that we have to penetrate as an organization is

responsibility to make them understand the connection yeah I mean we're\nWe're in agreement as I said my my um experience this week with the young man who worked for me\nNot being registered to vote you engage me by asking about Kanye West he said do you think Kanye West will be president and I said not all as a whole bunch of idiots vote for him and I didn't mean to them I said I said I said did you attend to vote for him I said are you registered to vote he said no myth care about my ...\nAnd ... and if you ask\nThem the name of his congressman who's ... he he wouldn't be able to answer that question and so we've got to really I mean people are registering to vote no question because of the Trump effect because they're seeing\nAll this gerrymandering and dispose of suppression and just the whole the whole ... mean spirit that seemed to be in the country right now but we still have to go out and do our job and educate people on the issues and organized people between ... elections

Indiana and the lawyer for the state of Indiana we said how could this be these people are still here and he said\nIt looks that and he says I'm speculating I did say that but it looks like our counties violated a federal court order removing these people that's not me making the accusation that's an admission\nBy the state of Indiana but you know something that just shows how valuable your vote is that's why you should exercise because they wouldn't steal it if it weren't worth anything\nIt is valuable and AOL and it yes if you go to Georgia and I was just there you see giant\nSteps
