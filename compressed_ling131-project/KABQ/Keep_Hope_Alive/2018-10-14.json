I'm Sorry he is actually not left his home in Saudi Arabia years ago he left at approximately a about a year and a half ago and he put himself in self exile Washington DC\nAnd he thought he would be arrested if he returned the nine states\nNow Saudi targeted other people just hasn't made a lot of news riots but Dolly a got a thousand lashes for insulting Islam\nAnd ... himself was not exactly the ah I Want a revolution guy I wanted to mention that he's not a guy that said we should overturn the royal family and in fact he he was quoted Thomas saying that that type of regime change would be quote ridiculous right\nI Want to point out when his troubles started because it's just quite fascinating\nMystery show gauge ... was was killed or his troubles began when he gave a speech to an American think tank after President Trump's victory he argued the Saudi Arabia should be quote rightfully nervous about a Trump presidency\nAt a time when the kingdom was cozying up to then of course President Trump we know the whole history of that now many presidents have goes up to Saudi Arabia I'm not you know saying that but I didn't want to point out his troubles seriously began with the kingdom not calling for revolution\nBut his troubles began when he tried to say that you know the two countries should watch the ties with the Trump White house so I think it\nWas interesting I Wonder if that's why I'm wrong is what provoked a Mohammed bin Salman to reach out to Trump and then you know do do that old song and dance to to impress Trump and suck up to him yes\nAnd also you know the fact that um the president's comments I'm sure you whatever that today on your show\nI haven't yet no here have what basically what Trump said\nIs that a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of arms sales is more important than a human rights record\nAnd by the way it's not really a hundred and ten million dollars with the arms sales it was twelve billion\nThat a Trump a big deal at Trump are so good things he ain't but actually there still is no deal I was just a a memorandum of understanding so there are no arms sales or at least from the Trump Administration a lot of this is you know goes back to deals that rock Obama caught\nSo Trump is lion through his teeth as he always does ah about this but apparently you know the Saudis have handed\nTens of millions maybe hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump in in laundering money or buying apartments and things you know from his companies and they are currently a saying in the Trump Hotels I you know to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars a day in some cases are all over the country\nOr you're correct to show here's what he said twice when he had a chance to at least backtrack a little bit on what she did\nA he has alluded to the fact that show is not a U.S citizen here's here's a quote it's in Turkey and it's not and it's not it's not a citizen\nAs I understand it right but the thing like that shouldn't happen president said again come this took place in Turkey and to the best of our knowledge ... is not a United States citizen is that right question mark [noise]\nSo you know the point is ... is a resident he lives in Virginia and he works for the Washington Post right now people are starting to put out a thing there Tom which is pretty disgusting that all the media never went after Saudi Arabia when he when when one of their own is gone after they've always let them slight on human rights which is not through the media is\nMore than expose it but the United states government\nLets Saudi Arabia slide so I just wanted to mention a little bit of background there's also a very interesting fact that\nBecause uh the president's son in law Jared Kushner is the quote Mideast guy you know and obviously very close to the Saudis as he was at one point in time with a guitar east to alone you know his father tempted to get\nA a lot of wrath is going to go back to cushion or two on this because there are businesses that are ... are pulling out\nOf it is a conference that Saudi Arabia is going to have one after the other including news media including CNN and others are pulling out of this a big economic a conference Hoover was the last to pull out into British fascinating under withdraw because\nSaudi Arabia funds a ton of of you know over money into their system\nYeah they were one of the early venture capitalists investors before we were went public right\nRight and I think this is going to heat up and I think it will become a bit it could become besides Medicare for all\nYou know health care Cavanaugh I think this could become a factor in the midterms to see where you know some of the people especially of course the Republicans trying to hang on come down on this because the president is setting the tone\nThat it's not a citizen you know it's not\nYou know it it kind of wires down to the stand for American values or do you stand for making a buck when those two things come into conflict right\nTo ... you have got to see what happens bombing a author side swipe talked media news thank you mom\nAlways great talking with you will be back\nWith me or it was a third our

[noise] pretty massive\nMessaging before the I was running for Congress or the office all I Would be talking about is the corruption and then you know leading up to the election and how\nElection all Democrats should be talking about Medicare or Medicare for all the big leagues and some of some of the objections we need to\nGo ahead and be ready to take on things like like protection and I got two words but people who don't understand what that is Martin scrambling and if you want to explain what that guy I'll I'll go ahead and take the call line but Martin squarely we're going to be part protection and we can't be scared to you know\nThey need to know how to program actually work\nYeah my ... was the was the sub young venture capitalists who bought a pharmaceutical company that that made an obscure a drug that was absolutely essential\nTo our you know a couple of tens of thousands of people in the United states whoever rare genetic genetic condition as I recall correctly if I'm wrong Albert and many jak the price of that drug rep southern a hundred percent just to make money for himself and then he bragged about it um he's in jail right now for fraud because he also runs a venture capital firm that was apparently\nA you know but I can gauge and fraudulent behavior I Would add another name to that and I believe her name is Heather brash which was Joe mansions daughter who is the CEO of the company that sells ... pounds and she jak the price on those things up another widely important thing for people who have allergies [noise] making sense Albert [noise]\nThat is correct Tom and also a lot of that we can't be scared to that that's the only way you're going to be able to control costs but also with Medicare it would be criminal and I would say it would be criminal if you don't worry about the supply\nAnd people going into the health care bill that should understand that there should be protected and we should not their education because the only way you're going to truly long term public on that more people giving care\nI agree I agree we should also um by law stopped the AMA from limiting the number of people who've been graduated from medical schools in the United states ah this this a lockdown monopoly the man's had you know operating as a union basically\nAre only as kind of the worst aspect of unionism limiting the supply of labor to drive up the price of the labor is not doing a a any kind of\nFavor to the American people Albert thank you spot on\nLaura in Chicago I Laura what's up\n[noise] yeah Hi I'm so ... with clean count Cook County I'm In the actual election integrity activists I'm not um\nWhat's her name print out and try to stay out of trouble so I wanted to talk to you about what people can do if they find that they have been purged from the voting rolls but there are things that they can do\nSo if you discovered an advanced on November ...\nYou had been\nPurged we're asking everybody to check your voting rights a registration online ... if you'd done discovered advance then it's really beneficial to take copies of the voter registration cars mailers from the election division ... copies of emails I'm Down to the election division with at least two pieces of ID\nOkay most states require two pieces\nWriting you need to monitor residency and your and your citizenship\nThat's exactly right that's exactly right and you go down to the election division is I think people in your neighborhood had been encouraged to spell than those down in a group that does help do show up with\nSeveral people my age and he will um and it's you can record what the official said back to you in some manner but you have to be discreet okay and so you go down there and you have to be reinstated\nAnd don't um you know the they made a\nPut some hurdles over you would ever\nAsk every time they put up a hurdle say okay if I Do this then when will I be reinstated pushed them for an actual date that he will be back on the rules so that you can check okay I have heard of many people that have gotten back on the rules if they push push you know it's the squeaky wheel decay\nRoyal otherwise it's after the election that they'll take care of it is that the problem\nYeah well here's the deal that's exactly right so if they you also at the same time\nI think that everybody if you're supporting the candidate or candidates in your area you should notify them that you've been courage and that you're in the process what the election officials have\nTold you so that they can start gathering names there have been challenges to elections based on voter purges so that's very important for candidates to know you do have the right to go on a lecture day or a ... in early voting on the states that have early voting and vote on a provisional ballot\nThat you cannot stop at just ... at the ballot okay here are things that we recommend first of all you have to complete that salad on the outside envelope exactly how you are you think you're registered to vote\nSo carry your voter registration card with you because some people may say say I am too many junior\nAnd forget they registered junior right\nRight or in Georgia if if I said Thomas see period Hartman in one thing and I simply so Thomas see her without the period after my middle name or my middle middle initial in another place right now Bryan capital refused to register to vote\nThat's exactly right that's it so on your voter registration card it will say how you registered to vote so please sign the ...\nLike that okay and I'm In complete it completely a lot of traditional speech actually did a study in Chicago um after an election on provisional ballots and only thirty percent of them were counted and uh but some people didn't fill out the envelope they just didn't they didn't even\nTouch guarantees the provisional ballot gets thrown away\nRight in the next day so a you fill that out you take a picture if you can in the privacy of your a boat voting both of you voted ballot an ear that completed ...\nTurn off the flash okay cause some in some states you it is illegal to take a picture of you about okay so turn off the bat and it's definitely illegal to take pictures of other people voting in a polling place so they may have a real connection so\nUm and then you do down we're here pieces of ID take all the pieces of ID you can down to the um the election officials and during the week after the\nElection day acquitted or on the war and the new argue and if you can do in a great\nYeah you said I'm Laura we just have five

that's a really good question I have never thought to to ask\n'em ... it's got to be an issue and it's got to be an issue that's been dealt with in the past I mean this is a part of the world where we regularly see hurricanes that are massively destructive although they are getting worse and worse\nUm I I I remember a news story after Hurricane Sandy out of New Jersey that some landfills were being inappropriately uh uh you know they were they were dumping stormed are bringing these landfills in a way that was not consistent with the law proper environmental practices\nUm but I Can't remember

it nothing tainted so so to get it legally\nEighty dollars a grant Amy dollars Graham per day is a lot of money them after a year my numbers were still the same so finally I said well I'm a I'm going

case but I Survived it and that\nSo you think and I you know I've seen this with my own eyes and in my own family I you know when Louis wants her chemotherapy for breast cancer she was also smoking pot for the nausea and I think it was helping her in ways beyond just the nausea but it was fabulously successful for that you're suggesting that the Rick Simpson oil\nAlong with chemotherapy was more effective than in your opinion or your experience chemotherapy alone was absolutely okay thank you for that in mind\nThat ... that if you if you're using conventional treatment and and then augmenting them with natural things and I realize there are some cancer doctors who don't like that but\nUm you know that that's the end and there are others who are enthusiastic about Louise had one or the ... one regular oncologist who was like\nDon't take anything else and then I had a another oncologist who ah who Ellen rent or hooked us up with who was up in New York as a regular empty and uh you know

population is expanding years go on line\n[noise] um and I and so now when you find\nOut that there are fifty three thousand on new registered voters who have been put on a pending scatter because of the ... a terrible exact match practice to\n'em and all that much time you know that's what we're up against right now\nWas augment deceased used last week the challenge or what was what was her argument\nAbout you that and like many people have said for quite some time I mean we can't we have the ACLU have have a legal basis but certainly in the path honorable\nElected officials have I have resigned or when they were in the secretary of state's position you know during the ... higher office\nSo there certainly is a precedent for people resigning a you know under these circumstances and across the damage or stop was minority leader\nAh and step down from that position because she just you know quite a while back you can't run a statewide campaign for opposites don't do a job representing um you know you're you're you're\nRunning a ... she's running against a referee\nOr riding the rap brain off of the game\nBut can be done as you as you see on the ground enjoy so\nFrom what I Am you know we have moved when I had been saying and I I'm I'm all up work but the football referee that is that you're not in the south when we started playing integrated sport we knew we had to beat the rap if we're going to be state champion than Georgia\nAh when you brought a team a team of black players meaning you had to make the raft and so\nThis is our message out right now is that a game time early voting starts on Monday a and everybody's got to get out there with an overwhelming show of force and support and engagement and said that the political process\nUh and it's time to be the rap we got to show up at the Paul I'm bringing your ID I insist on voting or an eye on what they call a ... digital ballot a itch they're saying that there's some discrepancy um pumped got to be ready to drop talks to the poll I can their\nPhone bank a lot you know\nYou've got to get at the very very high turnout of registered voters and the state\nWould deserve ... registration looked like this one Andrea\n[noise] well we've done a tremendous job in terms of a of a distraction and frankly one of the things that happened then twenty sixteen at many registered voters did not show up to vote [noise]\nUm so we we've got a pool of registered voters including the new one um that um you know that if they show up and make their voices heard you know we can have a state that's more representative of the value of of the overwhelming majority of Georgia [noise]\nFringe please call them in one eight six six five four hope\nBut one six eight six six by nine for for ... and ... and to the ministry you're concerned about the election reasonable chance to win the election in Georgia and loses by stealing we know that we won in Florida the year two thousand\nSecretary of state in Texas who\nWas a six string in Florida and the scheme was so successful until one of the losses and lose the one with the one that happened in Georgia and Florida this time around a Kevin\n... your take on Georgia well I always thought that we could win Georgia\nOf course it depends on turnout and it turns on a boat or motivation thought I think we look good and I'm hoping that we can do a South Carolina Georgia border sweep because I think it will say a lot to the strongest candidate obviously put my estimation\nLost we sister enjoyed [noise]\nBut the other part of it is it like like I feel you call it gets it the voters have to be vigilant when we read digital campaign and maybe maybe for individual about lawsuits against the state\nAnd we had to take depositions\nWe had to really monitor the election and be engaged at every level so if there were a lawsuit was filed we found them and and so\nEverybody has to be vigilant on this election because of Republican show it was still in\nTripoli loses a whole new corrupt process to decide that you're running against the referee as homecoming time is is is astonishing to me\nIt's happening all across the country I mean like you said at the beginning of the show the fact that fifty three thousand voter registrations were were put on hold in the last few days just before the deadline that these things don't happen by accident and so when you say you're going up against the a referee here we are making conscious choices not only to not recused themselves\nAre but some of them like Brian Kemp have a lifetime\nA history of always removing people from the ballot you know six hundred and Seventy thousand people I Believe in twenty Seventeen alone\nThese are millions of people all across the country and anyone who's done voter registration drives the you know like Betty magnets knows it's not always easy you it takes a lot of effort to get someone a registered to vote sometimes and we certainly have been pushing people to go to voted out or go to eight six six our vote\nYou know make sure that you are registered the registrations updated but you have the\nPeople who are just canceling millions of them are every single day Web and I have some good news that came out of Texas prairie view a and M. they were trying to stop the students and voting they told them what address to use a when they registered to vote and then be at election administrator\nChange that the last minute and said those addresses way no good and they could not vote\nThe congressman that's running my single cent ten staff member with a letter\nTo the election administrator and said uh he wanted to protest a them changing the address they asked him what party he was well he said Democrats they arrested him yet\nThen the secretary of state was brought into it and they had a conference call and now all of those students not only are going to be able to vote they're going to have a polling place on the campus so that's good\nNews shows all all the media focused on WikiLeaks them did freakonomics the on a bash attempt the Republicans to steal those who wants to not the right to vote to suppress the bills are just
