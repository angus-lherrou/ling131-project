England of course we know where this narrative is going there trying to blame climate change for wildfire what's said you to that\nBasically there is from probably affect from climate change but the real driver of these catastrophic fires is fire suppression\nWay back in the Nineteen twenties and even earlier in the formation of the forest service they decided that power was bad for the environment and they've set out to suppress all fires and starting here in the southeastern United States in the Nineteen twenties\nThat had the Dixie crusaders that came by with projection screens and everything and trying to get the landowners to quit burning the woods and\nWhat happened was suddenly the quails star disappearing under the rich peoples quilt plantations here in my area in America the woods here down south eastern\nUnited States and they wanted to do some of the people got together and they wanted to figure out why and they brought her started down to study it and the cooperative quail association and he did and one of the chapters of his ... book\nIs on it for the fire and Quayle and a lot of other wildlife need annual fires here in the southeastern United States in order to survive but\nThe gap suppression was bought out by my father and his associates and her daughter her started was a good friend of out a little poll\nAnd my dad was meant to hurt by her daughter and it was meant or by Dr Lee at the University of Chicago's another one of the founders of the field of ecology and my dad was really the first full time powering colleges and\nThey didn't have much luck out west the forest service and other government agencies are very entrenched a with a Smokey the bear propaganda\nAnd so what my dad had to do is start in Nineteen sixty two he really jumpstart our science by pull together power conferences when people all around the world than even the forest service at that time wouldn't even allow\nTheir own people to come lecture on the importance of our nature even on their own time and that their own expense and\nFortunately that's all changed but you have this culture out well for the fire suppression culture that set\nThat what's happening is is the firefighters get better at putting out fires it creates more fuel accumulation in the forest and that in turn forces the firefighters to get\nEven better equipment airplanes dropping retarded and everything else and keep those fires put out there and until you get into this Fisher cycle of fire suppression and fuel accumulation in that now it's just unloading these catastrophic mega fires\nSo in other words when he talked about this accumulation of fuel you're talking about dead wood older trees that are normally forests would be sort of send out with a a natural occurring wildfire and lightning would strike or something it would burn out some of the dead would it would be a smaller fire it could be controlled\nBy with absence of these smaller contain wildfires you have this late in energy that building up\nIn forests all over the world really and then when it does blow these are huge wildfires and that's why wildfires are getting worse not because of climate change but because of this fire suppression culture it's worldwide this idea that ...\nYeah yeah what I say is is for instance there that use prescribe far metro burning on Apache reservation out west and if it's climate change how come the catastrophic well off are hitting it says it hits Apache reservation fizzled out\nAnd the reason is that they're using frequent fires in the ponderosa pine there and a patchy reservation\nAnd they're using frequent product fires and what that does is just waits for his client and what people need to understand is that fire has always been a part of nature that goes back almost five hundred million years\nBut when the boss was first colonized the surface of the land and created enough oxygen for fires to burn it probably cause that die off of Ninety percent of the species at the time because a lot of those species Tom couldn't handle oxygen oxygen and was poisonous to him\nSo far it's been a part of nature and what happens is is a lot of these what I call life our ecosystems like ponderosa pine out west and bomb we find here in the southeastern United States they are adapted to burning out the competition\nSo they've got these very well insulated trunk and this kind of flaky bark it's very good inflation to insulate the canyon Blair around the tree at the same time they have these flammable needles\nThat they draw the burn out the hardwood than other competition so what happens is the ponds dry the ones that can't handle fire down in the low end into the wetlands\nAnd they occupied like that here in southeast the long leaf pine climax forest are comics force but if you get down a level and you have what eventually happens is you have a beach magnolia ... pitching even though you can't take a lot of far they can take some but it didn't take a lot of farm\nAnd I got a job here because of the music is percolating up which means we're going to go to a break but my gosh it's almost like there's a consciousness an intelligence here with these truly\nOur houses the competition when you put a ... or eucalyptus trees next to your house you know it's going to burn your house up because it's trying to the largest sunlight and in spite\n... will come back and pick up on this\nIn the eastern what happened before our suppression eight or nine states it's not as dramatic but it's been this devastating the nature as what's happening out west is just that\nYou don't fit because what's happened is that you wipe out a lot of the a fire adapted ponds and species and herbs and grasses and all that kind of stuff the Easter not stay in and they were been replaced by hardwood that are\nThat don't carry are very well let's strategy apart was the the\n... like laser that are not very I'm also they don't burn very well so they don't get burned out and the strategy of the times is that is to create hot fires to burn out Hart wasn't filled out the hard was a and the ponds are all battling it out between each other to survive\nAnd and so when you clean out the when the fourth claimed outlook light fires like the native peoples you know did you don't have the problem with thick than red bug it burns up the red bugs\nSo fascinating here's another thing I Want to ask you about and that is the um the loss of nutrients in our soil\nOr used to be you know you'd have a fireplace and you take the would show to your garden and you put that would actually in the soil and that was good it was nutrients in there and you know by the time you know I guess the electricity came around and and um people stop doing that\nUh so do you see a connection then between fire this fire suppression culture and the fact that we have no nutrients in our soil and therefore no nutrients in our fruits and vegetables\nOr that gets in the area ... culture you know and and this you know we have a lot to learn about sustain agriculture and part of the culture living during our agriculture in harmony with nature\nBut that's what the people who have been on for ... thousand years probably sixty thousand years in Australia you know Oprah hundred thousand years and then in parts of Africa and in Europe\nOr even even even the ... calls were probably use and far too ah an advance their own economic agenda and whatever from game game and fruits and berries and all these kinds of science\nSo now ah and we were going to get into this discussion about pyro terrorism because now we have again this late in energy build up in in a forest throughout North America and it's it's you describe it as an it's an absolute powder keg\n'em and you're the first one it made the mistake that fire is bad for the force\nWas caused the team LA she's a few and so\nSo instead of laying on the human relations of fuel and the and the fire suppression activities of policies in whatever we start blaming mission\nWeight blind lightning we've lane arson it\n... you know we've we've lived accidental cat ah bars and whatever and what not but that's not the real there's always going to the people on there is always going to be nature that's got to be like they're going to be lighting fires and so you know that if you build up a powder keg or it's going to be somebody that's called ... ... the the fears and blow you up\nAnd and so the mission is not the problem climate change and not problem initiatives aren't you know not to follow the fire is not the problem nature is not the problem the problem is our own in rents our own separation from nature so stupid things we've built our house is out in the wild ...\nLife urban interface and we put eucalyptus trees next to the house\nAnd that and here's the Memphis is probably the ... one of the hottest catastrophic are tied for the I ... I used to live with a lot of time just doesn't burn while on the ground some of them do but some of them just blowed completely up and catastrophic fires in Australia\nAnd burn everything the ground knows the electorate can spread out all of the Trump after a fire like that so that if you let this or that time that you've gotten right next to your house is dropping leave and they send you your daughter is on the top of your roof you are asked saw were\nAnd whatever and and we wouldn't fighting and whatever it is gone is is out the burn burn out the competition and you're the competition because they're competing with other species and writer for sunlight\nNow though is that why we see we see in these forest fires sometimes we see houses are completely burned out but then the trees around them untouched in which has led to this whole conspiracy about directed energy weapons and is that what's happening explain why we had houses\n... yeah this is this is where ... comes in and again you know and and it's our culture it's our separation from Niger maybe staples to understand what's happening and if you live far and you build up an R. and whatever and and as a catastrophic fire ... fire\nCan stop at the edge of town but\nWhat happens is is the all the smoke and all the embers can go for a mile or two\nAnd drop down into palm trees and everybody's trying to Ron Paul ... dead you know how hot it palm from you know burned cars that goes back to the ... the ... came ... very adapted to fire back about a three hundred and fifty million years ago and\nAnd when and so those amber ... those ... those ...\nDrops bogged down on your roof or the ... on on the pine needles and you've got pine needles in your daughter and your dad asphalt shingle cut your roof on fire and burn your house in the top down but not only that it can the embers can actually come into ventilation systems and burn houses from the inside and so\nLet's see if God if some people have or have metal ruse and they have a fireproof siding on the size of the house and they have defensible space around their house so that the the fires other from other buildings and stuff can't get the you know can't\nComes into the ventilation and I got to take a timeout and ... here and we'll continue to discuss wildfires in Cairo terrorism when the conspiracy show returns my name is Richard Sayre and stay with us\nNow let me ask you is weight loss on your wish list unfortunately the commitment to weight loss often said many people simply give up in the first Ninety Days the key is avenue right mindset\nGetting thin and staying that way lies in our thought processes and hip no therapy can make all the difference now clinical hypnosis therapists doctors Steve gene Jones has created a set of five audio hypnotic sessions that apply the power of hypnosis to reprogram the mind and replaced bad\nHabits with vibrant positive new habits and help you achieve natural and long lasting weight loss\nWeight loss hypnosis therapy really works and it's available now with a special discount isn't it time to lose those extra pounds checkout weight loss you know therapy right now at smart click savings dot com that smart click savings dot com smart click savings dot com\nAnd our house nicer complicated either my wife is freezing or I'm roasting Hi I'm Scott ten and founder of bone branch makers of the world's most comfortable seats loved by three us presidents for a limited time are unbelievably soft warm and breathe ... is back\nBecoming fourteen stunning patterns and colors your shirt or find something you love go bowling branch dot com for fifty dollars off plus free shipping with promo code relief but one branch dot com\nGrilled relief me no matter\nHow modern your family might be if you're pedaling around that rock and a gas engine vehicle you're living in the past [noise]\nMe yards down the era the electric vehicle has a ride with instant acceleration electric cars are more fun to drive and more affordable than ever electric cars are here again to the president's learn more and plug into the president not come down through my group of American\nSunday October seventh what's new today on the free I her radio\nDecorating the house or just setting the burying our pumpkins by the plane has just drags with labor in mind when you know and your day\nPlaying\nMixture you break out all our great daily party playlists whether you're at home or the the the um the new I our radio forty ... collection now\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nThe use of Maryland for terrifying interactions one location designed to get\nMe to home technical thing that by is here to help turn him into free and home confirmation once you find the perfect tacking can deliver it and make sure it's working to really see how that there were times we report all your attack on the time that's fine let's talk about\nThis audio is for your review for ...

people don't like to talk about it they don't even want to talk about this subject but it's got to be done because you\nCan just see the way I see what's happening is with the fires are getting hotter

... ... is going to make nine eleven\nOf the like Charles play if if if a lot of one or more cities go up in and of of a lot of catastrophic foreign people can't get out\nIn time and so there is there

then and and I'm\nAn Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona they they've got building prescribe far above buffers or around Flagstaff Flagstaff is getting pretty well protected but a lot of the cities are wide

for a long time\nOr even the ... hour out after health a catastrophic fire thought it burns you know maybe ... thirty forty years you have to look at you know more often on the Internet or whatever but when it burns burns everything at the end his path and if you're building a mug shot for al\n... you know you're you're really asking for but all this has got to do it just public ignorance of nature and far being part of nature and how to manage fire properly we've got to go back to what the nineties fire managers were doing and rebuild these ecosystems life our ecosystems\nYou go back to what the way they were the old growth forest these old growth forest didn't happen through you know developing wrote for sports to a certain degree but a lot a lot of it was actually managed and created by the native ... managers who burned more and more frequently but he had a cooler and cooler fires more\nThe more often you burn the cooler your hours are going to phase alas often you burn hotter fires going to be in general now you get up into you know you've got like our ecosystems in the eastern United States and western are taken up in Canada\nFor around Toronto I don't know what kind of trees you have up there or whatever but when you get up in front of the north end they'll borrow forests than whatever\nYou'd get in a catastrophic fire types of trees\nBut what you have there is what you have is a farmer who say is that catastrophic fires would burn out one area and then another they overlap in the news and the game and the L and move from\nFrom one succession every stage two males are depending on what their food sources you know you don't have a a fire will burn stuff will sprout up they'll be able to eat it as it gets too hot for them to eat so they need to go to another catastrophic\nBurned but what happens if you suppress all leave\nEven these catastrophic fires you destroy them up the farmers like that's what they did in Yellowstone is is that ... percent of young son was log lodge pole upon which is a catastrophic fires that burned you know ... ... you know through the tops of trees and whatever\nAnd they just aren't all on at one time until they wiped out the farmers like but now they're letting fire burned back in Yellowstone\nVinyl any again and whatever and recreating a bottom it was so far it's probably a factor in in the evolution of probably eighty percent of the forest you know probably not the tropics but most everywhere else temperate zones even even all the way up into the Arctic\nPyro terrorism the threat of our recession induced forest fires as a future terrorists weapon of mass destruction and uh had calmer is sounding the the alarms\nUh ... homeland security although we're not hearing too much about this as a

with nature rather than ... nature as a resource they exploited dominated because they come back and bite us and during that right now while fires and it's doing it more subtle ways in eastern United States\nIt's got to get back in touch with nature we've got to re educate yourself the button important to our nature we've got to get rid of the Smokey the bear propaganda that then spent billions of dollars on a propaganda campaign to get people to put out forest fires let Greenville build up the way it right way\nI Want to come back to a point you made earlier which I found very intriguing you mentioned something like on average one hundred firefighters every year our ...\nFirst with arson yeah that that that's not just ... ... firefighters that all our body right\nWhy is that what's going on there you have any serious to why\nThey discuss it on like a paid yeah some of the farmers are just bored they want some excitement ... wants to extend the fire season a little bit like we're all along\nIs a typical you know human motivations than most of the firefighters are really good folks and very capable or whatever but just like anything else you got a few bad apples and that's in bad apples and cause a lot of trouble\nAnd especially when they're skilled at putting out fires denying fires and back or whatever to protect citizens from whatever they develop all the skills that easily become a ... they would come and just ...\nThe ignition there's not a problem with the problem is a few once you get the fuel accumulation down\nThere and you don't have to worry about emissions and ignition than a scribe ours own isn't going to do anything it's not going to climb up in the house with the trees and create a catastrophic wow for our ... on the ground as easy to put out or just go on some 'cause there's nothing to burn\nBut climate change is a problem you know ... ... when it hits a prescribed fires on a go out or fizzle\nBecause you burn the debris out under die out who shows

else\nDown in coal fans and that sort of thing but it but even at first I guess people do in ... there was a subscriber fires down here in my area where it burns and the tea under the fire line that comes on the other side two weeks later start a catastrophic fire on the other side of the fire line\nThe fires will burn all summer long you can open up the swamp but that's important for fires to burn in Oakland okay swamp because it burns out all the tea and whatever and claims to open up you walk up and and you have a lot of open water and everything else has been turned into a kick ball gets burned out so\nIt's very healthy for the wildlife and whatever even up to ... fires very healthy in a wetland because it burns out all the gray and simulations of peace whatever so far it goes I

alive\nAmazed and how did you get an ad that I Know your father was a fire ecologist how did you learn about all of this and that that is if your knowledge is remarkable I grew up\nIn a bar environment as soon as I could walk out without their riding on the tractor drawn to jog attract or you know sitting in my dad's lap Blount fire lanes\nAnd getting out and lighting fires when I could barely walk and so I just felt the ills from men trying and this is what many peoples doing these people's\nTaught their children and the children taught there silver in whatever ... knowledge of how they use far as a tool\nPanda down from generation to generation and so that's what happened to me and you just can't get that back a day and that you can't get that from classes and whatever you got
