notice\nOr any other thoughts on this like well what do you think about it\nI think it's pretty hilarious that this outrage a you know a machine that revved up to eleven or the\nRight guy you know there's some irony running\nOut of control and there's more evidence against her and there is actually against Brett Kavanaugh and yet she practiced on but I think it's pretty funny\nAnd I had a restaurant as well so I I don't know why you're thinking that there is some kind of double standard\nYeah maybe he'll get actually pull this off it would be pretty interesting uh\nShe may be running for state Senate but maybe she'll just be appointed governor or something like that right\nNow I'm not really sure how that works [laughter]\nOh my gosh yeah this uh this ... ... they are for the\nCall so Chris you found something out here\nOh just reading a this was a from the ... just saying democratic New York state Senate candidate accused of hitting ex wife and\nUm yeah it's it's just the the typical stuff but it is interesting that you know here's somebody on the left comparing herself to how\nThe left has treated people on the right and uh so ... what's the deal with her supposedly becoming a Republican\nI that's the part I Can't find any news ... apparently yeah she's trying to change or a party affiliation because nobody I'm On the left is really supporting her anymore since a right and\nRepublican and Democrat basically just me and I'm not on that team right there's no real philosophical basis for anything unless I'm not them is a philosophy\nSo it's basically about the same as Dodgers in Red Sox [laughter] yes yes exactly\nAnd there's more geography tied in to Dodger Red Sox then you know Republican Democrat but yeah basically\nUh yeah I I think even the New York Yankees fans are pulling for the red Sox just because of my head held on raising the Dodgers but the Dodgers used to be a New York Brooklyn yeah\nSo you know like we we can't pull for somebody from the other leagues civil pool for the rival that we have in the same league sort of thing yeah that's that's kind of like how Bernie Sanders wound up throwing his full support behind the Hillary after Bernie lost the nomination [laughter] because you know can't let that\nOther than I'm just having a very hard time imagining any Yankees fans supporting the red Sox [laughter]\nYeah if you're one of these please call in right now [noise] eight\nFifty five four fifty free although if they're watching the game I think there's a game tonight so they're probably busy watching the game or to call but you can call us tomorrow you can call it you know any of the week\nWhat's more important to you liberty or baseball fans sadly a lot of people are just gonna say baseball\nBut you know no one's called in so I'm not sure these people exist I think they do I think so too but you want to hear about iPhone and Android users\nYeah tell me about I thought of that are are they also in the same uh you know Republican Democrat cap of I hate I followed because it's not what I use\nFrom the New York post yes they are completely different people iPhone users are\nGenerally happier make a are more extroverted more adventurous and make more money than Android users according to new research\nStudy of one thousand iPhone users and one thousand Android users found that whether you prefer an iPhone or Android may say a lot about your personality and even your spending habits the survey by slick deals\nPitted the cell phone giants against each other and found iPhone users will sell out a hundred and Seventeen dollars on average every month on clothes nearly double what an Android user will spend about sixty two dollars hold on what\nI'm Still trying to wrap my head around people spending money every month on clothing\nDon slick deals are but that's all right people do the same goes for makeup and beauty products with the iPhone crowds spending eighty three dollars every month on average on such products doubling what Android users spend about forty dollars\nAmazingly iPhone users were also found to be in vain or\nTaking twelve don't say it don't say take toward taking twelve selfies on average every day which is five more than Android users take selfies every day furthermore iPhone users are more than twice as likely to report that they have been\nA day like being the center of attention\nI fell right either that or they may well we know Trump has an iPhone now yes we do do way\nSomebody suggested actually the Chinese suggested that he switched to a who I ... yeah that's what our it's pronounced iPhone users also clearly value an optimal tech experience spending a whopping one hundred and one dollars every month on tech related purchases\nAndroid users will spend half of that about fifty one dollar ... users are smarter and don't waste their money Android users are self admittedly the more frugal of the groups ding ding ding for Michael\nWith Android users being twenty five percent more likely to strongly agree that they think they are a frugal person and being Nineteen percent more likely to say they look for deals and discounts quote often\nSlick deals CEO Josh Meyer said quote this survey indicates an Android users are generally more frugal than their iPhone counterparts and on the hunt for savings when shopping in while phone users tend to spend more particularly on items related to their image such as clothing and cosmetics\nThe results show that iPhone users worthy happier bunch too as they were twenty seven percent more likely to say they were very happy with their life\nThere were also more inclined to have a partner that they were in love with and enjoy experiencing new things or this is my commentary they said all those things because that's what they like to hear about them so that's what\nThey want people to believe that is what they post on there instead of filtered Graham\nChat about me because you have to look absolutely perfect on Instagram and your life must be perfectly happy and\nKeep us all keep that in mind with this one iPhone users were also found to be happier with their current jobs than Android users with only twenty percent of Android users saying they were very happy with their job compared to thirty three percent of iPhone users\nNot only do I ...\nI feel like I guess the rest of the service at a high\nThere are ... and it's not a majority of people that are happy with their job oh yeah yeah so that\nStatistically insignificant letter one in five or one in three or the but basically what I'm hearing is iPhone users spend more money than they are more vain and they want to have to think that their life is perfect\nIPhone users consider themselves to be more personable and sociable then Android users so who's going to win the world series iPhone or Android that's a good question I Would watch that\nIn mind I guess\nWe're out of time for tonight will be back tomorrow

apparently is going to happen today\nThat something comes out of this\nThat something comes out of this meanwhile blind camp\nAnd as I said we're going to be talking with Greg palace about this and about a twenty five minutes\nA blind camp\nHas come out and said well this was actually in a private campaign events they didn't come out and say he simply said to a group of Republican donors and this was a leaked on Tuesday by Rolling Stone day before yesterday\nHe said that uh he was you know well here's the quote\nA he had he said he was talking about how Abrams is quote put him behind\nPutting a lot of resources behind the get out the vote effort and she said and he said this is something that concerns us especially if everybody uses an exercise is their right to vote\nBrand cab vote suppression\nChief in Georgia the secretary of state who is also running for governor against Stacey Abrams who if she wins will be the first African American governor in the United states history and I believe certainly in Georgia history and\nWhat's he doing his suppressing votes in black areas\nIn in African American communities and in ... in Ohio and and we're seeing in fact a federal court in just stopped going at counting the most diverse county in Georgia from from purging for throwing away actual ballots people that actually voted\nFrom throwing them away because some you know presumably Republican election officials said well you know that signature doesn't quite match you know in the first thing could sure they've got their middle initial and the second signature they spelled out their middle name it\nDoesn't match we need to throw this away or go in that county has twelve percent of the population in Georgia and yet you know as of about what I think it was last Thursday or friday at first reported this on this program they accounted for forty percent of all the ballots that had been thrown away the early voting mail in ballots\nThe Washington Post Christopher Ingram they they did this a really really in depth analysis of a new report that was published by political scientist at northern Illinois University in Jacksonville University and China's hon university ... seriously\nAnd they were looking at the thirty three different kinds of laws election laws that we have in the United states in our fifty different states because you know the constitution and and tradition ... have given\nThe individual states the rights to decide who votes them how they vote and under what circumstances they can vote when they can vote when they can't vote with the exception to that you know first Tuesday in November thing that's for the president\nAnd he's thirty three different kinds of laws range from on the one and where I live here in Portland, Oregon\nVoters are registered automatically\nThe said males out ballots to voters weeks before the election I got mine last Thursday I voter friday I voted on Saturday mail them back\nAnd a ... you don't even have to show up you know it's all vote by mail so there's no electronic machines or anything so so Oregon is the most compliant or the the most easy to vote stayed\nAnd then the hardest to vote state is Mississippi\nWhich doesn't allow early voting doesn't allow absentee voting unless you can provide a doctor's slip\nAnd requires a ... a very very strict and narrow definition of photo ID at the polls and what they found this is you know just quoting from this report\nThe five most restrictive states had turnouts in twenty sixteen that were on average nearly nine percentage points lower\nThan the turnout in the five states that in which it was the easiest to vote\nSo it it accounts for a nine point swing\nIn voter participation\nThat that's really substantial ends and then they they also said there are a you know some variables having to a large day small stays things like that and if you just\nLook at it you know in the as a mathematical construct like you know what would these kind of laws and do\nThat suppress voting versus what would these kind of laws do that encourage voting what they found out a again I quote the overall the model predicts than eleven point turnout difference between the least restrictive and most restrictive states in twenty sixteen\nSo you wonder why a minority of Americans voted for Republicans for the house of representatives but they control the house representatives\nAnd that and that was like ... you know slightly less than half of Americans voted for Republicans for the house represented in the ... in the in the mid forty percent\nThe percentage of Americans who voted for Republicans for the Senate\nWas in the neighborhood a twenty percent\nAnd yet Republicans control the ...\n... the number of Americans who voted for for a Republican for for the White House for the presidency\nWas three million fewer than the number of Democrats some more Democrats voted for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump more

by now she'd be the first\nUh African American female governor of the United states if they count all the ballots at least from what the polling you're showing but so Kemp got on the phone and is scaring his donors and to get more money because it\nYou know Stacey Abrams is is basically beating the crap out of us on the absentee ballots people ask rap balance in advance\nNow he has some trips up his leads to make sure those ballots don't get to those voters don't get counted et cetera but in the meantime he is you know he's basically telling his donors man if they have these ballots we

democracy\nDavid in Portland, Oregon Mossad x-ray FM Hey David what's up\nHigh on a first time calling I just wanted to point out the to me the Democrats don't want to actually fix the exit poll system because\nThere were suspect that as opposed to the Democratic party primary twenty six teams against Bernie and Hillary again with California using provision area ballad not count a millions of Bernie's votes\nBut the Republican exit polls were completely fine so this conglomerate of MSNBC CNN et cetera stop doing their exit polls halfway through the primary altogether because I couldn't really explain\nWhy Hillary's and Bernie's were off but why the Republican any shortcuts with sixteen candidates was completely uh within the\nI have ... reporting David and I can't ah attest to its veracity 'cause I don't know the people who did the research but I I've seen some considerable reporting suggesting essentially what you're saying that that there was a purge of voters democratic voters in some very progressive areas in California and during idle joined leading up to ... is\nA way of getting what they did in California where they just changed people's voting locations so then the people would go to the voting location they were used to going to for four years and they taught the pollsters to just hand out Parisian ... ballots instead\nOf a Nobel it's ... it may be and in fact I'm here and now that they're you know there are a lot of California voters are discovering that they've been removed from the voting rolls and maybe it goes back to that maybe a dozen\nBut I'm telling you David this is not I mean that that may have been done in some areas in California by some Democrats um that this is not\nA systemic policy at the Democratic party\nIt absolutely is not end

top of your hip hooray by way of headlines news\nNews but can I comment on the on the question about a pack in Israel\n[noise] yeah it just for people who don't know what we're talking about because we lose about half our audience during throwing that in our break that you were listening to the conversation the I I this this entire hour I set it up with a story of crystal lock in Germany in Nineteen thirty eight\nAnd you know I'm not saying that the bombs are the exact hurled across all knock them maybe closer to Nineteen thirty four in the early violence against Jewish doors\nAnd I and I also read the op ed\nI'm a you know about how the attacks on George Soros are not just because he's a Democrat in fact they're mostly because he's Jewish and the whole you know Jewish thing and then during the break I add an African American caller who said you know but you've got wealthy Jews who support\nDonald Trump you know the whole Shelly Adelson thing and the diamond industry Bloody Bloody blah and I said I don't want to get into the you know\nRight and anti Semitism hair or you know there are issues but you know the fact of the matter is that Trump's principal thing is not anti Semitism that's frosty on the cake is principal thing is hatred of people with melanin in their skin\nRight and thanks for saying that by I forgot about that breaks and things so I Would have just went into that cold I just wanted to throw out just a couple of things are on that if I could turn I'm Seventy seven percent of of Israeli Jews will support the President Trump's\nUm ideas for U.S Israeli relations and Palestinians um uh so I mean with us Israel relations are three four percent of American Jews will support President Trump on that same issue is very lopsided\nSo it's ... it's a very serious by it's a very substantial minority of yeah okay that's very as I wanted to point\nThat out and also with a pack that was something with Tom DeLay of Texas who worked very hard to combine some people to try to get money out of a the American Israeli political action committee and I was there when I saw it happen in to the Republican Party\nAbsolutely it was a concentrated for by Tom DeLay to do it he focused on it he made it a daily chores to do that and you were there and you saw I was there I was in the room I heard it all wrecked that Cuba so what's going on in the world\nWell of course the situation with the the horrible situation with the uh the bombs that have been set they seem to be at this point in time at least a you know they are not sophisticated but they seem to be from\nAt least the same person or the same group or because they are dangerous but not sophisticated than people that you know I've talked to people that are sort of bomb experts\nOn this show is nothing coming from the government but they seem to believe that they will be able to track down uh whoever person or again groups\nThat were involved in this it's become a horrific situation of course yeah and the president I made a you know a conciliatory statement but then he went to was concert last night and went right back\nTo the national media a battery\nAnd rushing to hate the media yesterday to debt or the other thing is that the have you talked about the president's a cellphone yet today [noise] no I have not okay for this one is I mean this is amazing\nThe Lenny ... just to put this in context ... what the Republicans spent years harassing Hillary Clinton over and trying to prosecute her foreign millions of dollars trying to prosecutor for was using a private email server in her home\nOr to conduct the government business when she was ... state which turns out she didn't do but she didn't use it for you know private stuff but ah and the whole thing was you know that server isn't secure it doesn't have government level security it could be hacked and therefore we should lock her up\nIt never was active turns out but we should lock her up because it could have been hacked now to Mr Trump\nWhy I I was going to make that conclusion to make that parallel because of all that was sad but there is also a part of this that is ... but it's sad\nUm and it was a defense in the story and I'll get that President Obama when he became president he loved his blackberry we all knew that he wanted to keep it they said you can't and he didn't he turned over his blackberry well President Trump we find out did not turn over us two phones ones that quote government phone and the other is his personal phone didn't turn it over he has used it\nUh they are saying uh categorically point blank the Chinese have listened in and not for secrets but they have listened in\nTo try to understand him have psychiatrists psychologists look at it to try to see how they can manipulate him how they can ... and ... which is very fascinating\nRight there and they're probably teaching president she had a ... toward trumped the way Sean Hannity does every night when they have their conversation about\nWhy that maybe the here's how to get him to be your best friend\nHigher Sean Hannity to do it so that part of this is actually in the story that is amazing calm is when the story says there wasn't concerned about the president doing it because he doesn't read security briefings anyway\nThat's in the story no arrests on his own down an uninformed that he couldn't spill American secrets because we don't give any to him but we are kind of bummed out that that the Chinese are figuring out how he relates to people on a one to one basis so that they can they can does suck up to a more effectively\n... basically yes mine is better than I go to and that's in the story is actually an amazing story so he still continue to keep a cell phone and how he does that why nobody is able to take that from ... is you know\nHe pointed out saying that story was wrong but he didn't offer any\nEvidence that amazes me mom name talk media news is north side swipe and it's still it's still in thousand Kendall wall so it's it's amazing thanks so much for dropping by talking to me as\nA woman back we'll continue this conversation is a little bit more not just a little bit

this was you know this is what do you get twenty page study here I'm not going to go into an enormous detail on it but basically what they do is they go to these people and they'd say\nOh you know it's Ninety percent sold out you'd better get an apartment or a condo while you still can when in fact they hadn't sold any and it's at All right and then ends in or they would say yeah we own fifty percent of it so don't worry it's solid and we got all the finance the way they would you like to buy it\nWhen in fact they didn't have the finance and they were finance and with the ... money from people who are buying units based on these false promises\nAnd then in the case of of you know soho in Panama City and and by California and several others\nThe Trump projects went bankrupt they went belly up and the trumps kept the money\nThe trumps ... again from this article that Trump's often made money even when projects failed and when they tanked the Trump simply ignore their prior claims are closed involvement denied any responsibility and walked away\nAnd here's here's where this happened in in the Dominican Republic\nDonald Trump claimed that he had three hundred and sixty five million dollars in sales for this project\nBut according to a two thousand nine project audit\nTrump reporter he had two hundred Ninety million in sales\nThe project was never build\nIn two thousand six he announced that the hotel condo that he was going to build was already sold out this April two thousand six\nIn fact by July of two thousand six according to bank records that came out of a lawsuit only sixty two percent of the units had been sold and as a result they went into foreclosure they declared bankruptcy in Trump's name was removed\nIn Las Vegas he told the Associated Press in two thousand five but his condos were sold out\nThat was two thousand five six years later and two thousand eleven\nOnly a quarter of the units have been sold\nDonald Trump in his family had been line

been sold as a result\nThey went bankrupt in each one of these cases the trumps walked away with a lot of money\n... dollars I'm told the wall Street Journal in two thousand seven the building is sold out\nThe developers failed to sell even the minimum Seventy percent of units which was what was necessary to pay for the construction and so again and went bust it was never built\nIn Toronto at a two thousand nine interview of aka refer to the property as a virtually sold out\nThe reality twenty four point eight percent of the units have been sold according to a twenty sixteen bankruptcy filing by the developers again the result Trump walks away with the cash the thing goes bankrupt the Trump famous removed\nTrump claimed that he was a developer a partner and equity owners these are examples of
