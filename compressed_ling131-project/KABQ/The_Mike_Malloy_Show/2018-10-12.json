{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "Talking about you know crazy horrible ideas about freedom or we might or so or guns or something we do that a little bit there are people packing heat around here where I Know and love him to New Hampshire I Love it here known you haven't seen it known associates a freedom lovers here I'm always back you know so some are open carrying\nOr their own yes you can carry but in general will do will do like kind of more a specific events on the topic than and that kind of thing I think it'll be fun to do a great it's a great place and it's not far from Boston convenient yeah I'm calling this a success is beautiful and what you really couldn't even beat the weather too I mean I don't doubt on the right\nOr just this week she don't love the fall thing it's important for us who live there but for people coming from California or Florida and you know this fall or colors\nAnd ... and I've been I've lived here twelve years and I did come from Florida and that's not old on me it's still nice it's nice to drive out here from Keane the two hour drive was like wow yeah it is only the only beautiful\nAnd I'll I'll say it's a nice to it's nice to showcase porch about which is a youthful town and\nIt's one that even those of us in the state I mean we don't get over here that you often writes the only town I'm Jealous of because they've surpassed keen encrypted accepting businesses out of the pilots about Steven Derek I'm going to have ... double our efforts and our headquarters is here now are trying as he removed everything up the\nPortsmouth we pick ... without of everywhere in the world a you know I've lived all over the world I've lived in Dubai of I mean we could have gone anywhere bright ... literally this little cute little town\nIs where we pick out everywhere in the world because it it has the right for at least for us the right combination of everything else to Boston close to the airport ... got a huge liberty community huge cryptic community a lot of people you can beta tests with products and roll out a lot of ... a lot of talent and there's no taxes and and it's super cool I mean there's places like\nEighty five percent of the benefit of New York city the hassles I mean you got him away and food and you can do what you want there's a lot of arts and culture but it's a tiny little tourist down that doesn't have a lot of the issues that big cities have\nSo we love talking about New Hampshire and we could I'm sure ... entire another segment it let's talk about raven ... yeah because that's what's going on here big time today lots of people wearing the raven quaint sure\nThere's a zillion coins out there go ahead and give the elevator pitch for listeners that are maybe remember we're not doing a crypto currency show so our listeners may have a basic concept of a bitcoin is just because we talked about it a lot of military even going to bring to the table that's different\nSo what's what's cool about it well there's two things one is the purpose of it which is to make it easy for people to issue tokens mission token the big deal a theory and has served well for that bitcoin can kind of surf or that other change can but tokens were cool if it's a big deal there is a whole mess of things you can do can issue a game token our security token or\nWhatever ... and and the development in the process doesn't really care what you use a token for you could use it for a joke or\nFun or it could be a billion dollar company that's up to you but but the protocol allows you to issue a token which means that you just say\nA person a couple of buttons and I say I have a a coin or freedom coin or a\nApple or whatever you want to call it and you can say I issued ten of 'em are a million over ... billion of them and here's the here's the you know I can ... or more in the future and you find these things so that's a neat use case for crypto if anybody on their own crypto rating going to be very easy simple secure safe way to do that\nVery inexpensively and the naming of your call and if you wanted to create a token um it's basically first come first served yeah when I was kind of neat yeah very chaotic thing you may have\nSort of be equivalent to a little bit of domain squatting if you can get a name like raven coin slash game that's kinda cool and then you can issue so that that you could have game slash doors hammer or whatever underneath that\nTell me well okay so obviously tokens like you said have been around with a theory on this was that this is the number two crypto by market cap right now in the world um what is raven ... bring that up because it's there and sort of this programming platform right where it can it can run code essentially centralized what's been going how's it different I mean so tokens a token but what's different about it with raven\nGoing the way that a theory him does it is through smart contracts the re raven coin as it is copying a\nMethod from bitcoin you can issue as it is on bitcoin using something called master coin which merge do you know we're morphed into account or party and is now known as many layers and so raven going take that capability and make the native to the ... sit in front of a protocol\nThat of a second layer thing right there is some advantages California's great there's some advantages a couple of different advantages with raven quaint one is that because it's baked into the protocol or part of the protocol the political understand that these assets exists there more and can do things like\nRecognize that they can be put in a wallet and things like that whereas with thick when everything built on that has to be a second layer and then it just a few you know kind of party fairly old is if you updates\nOn the way that it the way that it works and and and I should say ... but but it it's still a pretty simple and straightforward a coin and and the other thing I should mention really quickly is the way that it issued as a quite a bit different for for those people who are new to crypto currency\nThis isn't I'm One of these ... twenty tokens or something like that that raised money there was no idea\nThis was a shooting in a very much the spirit of the good open source projects like the ... and you put together and you put it out yeah it was just published for free and the work that the developers did they did for free they give it away and then they just they want it just came out right like twenty a team\nIt was a it's a year old yeah one yeah and I buy it but when you're ... it was released the same day as bitcoin\nAh October thirty first so it's one year anniversary is coming up in a couple of weeks and that will be the when the main that is it worth the goal is to last may not on the one year anniversary\nHave mining began in January so mining has been a ten month started on January for a little technical term here in Maine that that's I'm just I mean things are available you can trade for them on ... yeah so what happened is the political was this your first and\nBecause we knew we knew it was going to be a ... and it was known before commit going right so you figure well might as well get that working people mining it get to this is different algorithms that going to get the algorithm work and get that stuff going and then uh\nAt those capabilities we knew it takes several months to do the programming needed to make it really works smoothly untested and everything\nSo the cat network was launched on January fourth and on January fourth it was pretty much bitcoin but with a a shorter you know one minute block time that a couple other pretty by any minor feature a lot of not a big different different algorithm\nAnd uh so so some people look at it they well what what does this isn't just exactly like bitcoin\nHum and but but the that was the plan to have the network working you know rather than wait all this time it because if you because the other thing you need the network working when you pick when you of assets being picked you wouldn't want to have the network launched for the first time today because then you'd have to there'd be no mining and\nAnd it wouldn't be fair for people to get out that you have to have it working first so people can get there after that what you have a fair shot if you want to get\n... you know your name as a raven asset or your company name as a river that you can actually do that a Bruce ...\nThank you for coming on every talk live and of course a thanks for having us both of these events and involved in the future thank you very much and also thanks for having a panel yesterday that was a lot of fun talking about the activism here

N. dot net a document welcome back to the program\nSo the BCC in response to a to a query this wasn't their normal five your report this was in response to an inquiry from the uh from some of these island nations that are are looking at the possibility of extinction and essentially you know vanishing\nAre under the waters I ask them you know is this is the sudden you know goal of keeping temperatures below uh what were the two degrees was the original to Celsius\nEven lower target here right of what rights fired up\nRight so they said you know what the consequences be if we if we lower the goal and this whole new bunch of research in the last couple of years came out and it's got a head explode and tell us what to summarize it for us but\nSure well there are a lot of reasons to believe that uh two degrees Celsius warming of the planet as a whole lot worse than one and a half degrees Celsius\nWhich is a whole lot worse than the one degree Celsius we've already warmed and the uh the issue here really has to do for example with how close are we are to the collapse of substantial parts of the um the the major ice sheets the west Antarctic ice sheet the Greenland ice sheet um if those\nIce sheets continue to lose ice as they have been doing\nThat and it may be in deep too late for many of these low lying island nations the amount of sea level rise that will see\nOver the next several decades will literally submerged some of these islands so they have reason to be worried about\nAny additional warming and whereas two degrees Celsius warming is the target that has largely been adopted I'm uh in in these discussions are for defining dangerous interference with the climate pretty low lying island nations you know one and a half degrees Celsius is catastrophic\nFor many of the regions that are suffering a unprecedented drought and heat waves and wild fires we've already warmed a dangerous ... so it's really a question of how far down that's dangerous highway are we willing to go\nYeah [laughter] and and uh [noise] and how far are we willing to go apparently\nWell in the absence of any you know a mitigation in it you know if we pursue business as usual burning of fossil fuels\nAnd warm the planet by four to five Celsius that's seven and nine Fahrenheit by the end of the century\nThen we will see a truly devastating climate change it ... that this summer the devastating summer of twenty Eighteen with wildfires and floods and this super storms we've seen this fall most recently my namesake Michael\nDevastating burn the the strongest storm ever to a landfall a U.S coastlines this late in the season\nUm you know that's that we will that will be par for the course and we'll see see far more devastating um extreme weather events hurricanes massive sea level rise and flooding\nUm that the world that we certainly don't want to live and we don't want our children and grandchildren to live in um if we\nYou know curtail are burning of fossil fuels dramatically in the years ahead we can still avoid warming the planet more than two degrees Celsius and we certainly don't want a warm it any more than that uh the Paris Agreement I'm basically get the half way from that four to five Celsius seven and nine Fahrenheit warming\nAre down to the two degrees Celsius warming that pretty much everybody agrees we want to keep warming below the Paris Agreement or commitments get us about halfway there that means we still have work to do\nWell this this this report is essentially calling for a massive reduction within the next ten to twelve years I'm a ... it can you give us the the the specifics that they're calling for in terms of productions and\nYou know as having established that it'll be a disaster if we don't do this I mean we've got several Republicans who have come out and said uh literally have made fun of it I mean you know the the three members to Republican members of Congress and the last twenty four hours of one of them made the comment ah you know it would take all the money in the world to do this which is a B. S.\nUm you know another made a similar comment um [noise]\nWhat what specifically are they saying we have to do and we have to start doing right now\nYeah of course than it is a disingenuous talking point to say it will cut it cost us dearly to act because the reality as it would cost us dearly tend not to\nGet on it already is I mean look at hurricane market\nAbsolutely and and the devastating extreme weather events a wild fires and drought floods that we've seen summer I'm already the the cost of inaction is so much greater than the cost of actually taking action and so that is a disingenuous talking point and and it's predictable the forces of denial or out in force trying to distract the\nPublic and policymakers in the in the wake of this devastating new PC say report and

Tony what's on your mind\nHi Tom how you doing I'm well I was trying to catch the beginning of your rent which I hate missing it because I Love the show and I always catch the beginning of your rent I'm not really sure what the definition them soup tuition\n... it it's basically it's how juries work is you know sitting juries are work by ... it's you take a large pool of of citizens the\nLargest possible pool and you randomly select people from it and you get a representative slice of the larger population\nOkay let me ask you that this may be a little off topic but I'm I think you kinda fits in\nLet's say\nYou had a budget felons or inmates were guys who like me who don't have representation but pay taxes mhm and they wanted to get a carton and they volunteered themselves to the city local municipal governments\n... as a way to\nGet a park and get their voting rights back\nWould you say that that would be about the same as a public official ...\nI somebody just working volunteering don't give us some reduced rate sure we're basically paying back because remember it's X Y Z versus the people for\nShow we're paying the people back by representing the people and it Edie Edie ... do I get up and somebody staffer\nYou're ... you're in Alabama you're in Huntsville, Alabama Alabama is one of a few states it's a minority of states it's bits in principle of the old south\nWhere if you committed a felony and you have served your time you've veer off parole or probation you're now you know back in society as a full member of society and most of the states the United states you are right to vote is restored\nIn Alabama in Florida in a few other southern states that right has gone for the rest of your life\nThat is wrong in my opinion so you know how I rather than try to figure out a way for ex ex felons to work their way back to having voting rights and being fully you know four members of society we need to change those laws\nAnd so I Would say you know rather than than you know arguing should we should we allow felons to X. fell on the you know use voluntary service as a way of earning their citizenship I Would say they already earned their citizenship the back by serving their time\nAbsolutely and working for absolutely free in the prison system weed out everything from the administrative work too frightened them the kitchen is running out of the capital's runner which me not at all of these major paperwork and you don't reaping all the filing except for his signature and it was the only thing I didn't have the power to do\nBut when you have that kind of experience\nThey take it all from you when you get out because you can't get a job but the whole point is we have no representation at all\nAnd we're tens of thousands of people\nYou're right you're right and then about\nYeah you're absolutely right and and and the further south to go on them in America the higher those those numbers get\nTony thanks for the call I you know this is something we all we all need to commit ourselves to and ah you know to to ending fell into disenfranchisement I haven't in Grand Rapids Michigan mostly on a Ninety five point three of them one of our Pacifica affiliates there hey I've and what's up\nHigh I'm I was just wondering what you thought of a whether the profit motive of capitalism which survive global warming or not\nWell as the profit motive of capitalism is that is causing ... who are unfortunate but that's\nWhat I was thinking and do we need to start talking about alternatives as to capitalism right now because it doesn't seem to be working\nYeah I think that that that conversation as one we've been having for a long long time and the uh well certainly we've been having an a big way since the Eighteen sixties when Carl Marx published dust copy tall or ...\nAh [laughter] and then Marx Engels you know the communist manifesto a few years later\nThat does that and that conversation kind of went sideways with the Soviet Union and and a mile\nOr who took the idea of communism this this really neat idea of everybody kind of you know it was Jews idea right I mean you know his his Mary band every night they had the common person Judas was the one who is in charge of the common first that's communism\nAnd and uh and turn it into a national thing but it didn't work and I I think that the communism works really really well in small communities where everybody knows each other\nBecause it does require a certain kind of honor system peace to it but when it's possible for people to be anonymous communism starts to break down\nThe um the question of capitalism is can capitalism be used to to undo or to to undo the damage of capitalism I mean that was the whole idea\nOf cap and trade and cap and trade actually successfully work just stop sulfur dioxide emissions\nAnd it was George Herbert Walker Bush got that legislation passed a cap and trade of sulfur dioxide and take you know we couldn't do that because of cap and trade in fact several European nations have already done this with carbon dioxide I'm a carbon tax is much more straightforward way to do it\nBut I don't I don't see capitalism going away any days soon as much as I Would like to\n[noise] you're listening to um [noise]\nThink about the amount of time you spend every day in your office chair for most of us it's over two

our kickoff amount to hire and executive director we want to have a staff on the outside to work with the progressive caucus members and progressive groups around the country to really connect all those great ideas and all the energy and the progressive movement\nWith progressive and Congress where we can actually actualize the change so we're going to have a couple of policy people a couple of outreach people working with the national progressive groups communications staff and executive director development director\nFulltime fellows going in some of the key members offices because if we take the majority we have Thirteen members of our clock is poised to be committee chairs and thirty poised to be subcommittee chairs which means we're in a position to govern in many ways\nA lot of hand uh we're also trying to diversify the staff we got a whole bunch of goals but the good news is this has become a reality or this is kind of taking the old democratic steady group that existed\nPre Newt Gingrich he got rid of it I'm giving it a a redo for twenty Eighteen twenty Nineteen and we're going to be ready to hit the ground running in January with is that we can actually actualize\nProgressive policy change so we're really proud to announce it from ... from Seattle and I have been leading the effort and uh we're we're very excited about the possibility that it's going to have\nThat spectacular is there any call for action to uh you know average citizens motors uh you know are are you reach out to the public for ... or is this just a hay heads up\nI I think it's a heads up because at this point we literally are hiring the executive director we wanted to show how serious we were by having pre funding for a year in the bank before we even put the position out\nSo we're hiring up right now hopefully being in place by January we will do grassroots fundraising down the road at this point it's been from foundations a unions and some individuals who've written some phrase fairly decent size checks\nAre but we're going to be opening it up a probably in the next several months as we get the staff hired but uh we're just very excited to let people know that the progressives are ready to hit the ground running in January or so it should be a good session\nThat his spectacular so let's pick up some phone calls here I Am a lay in Bullhead city Arizona you're on the air with Congress and mark Pocan Emily\nHigh a I had an interesting take on this a article that came out in the u._s._a. today [noise] and to me\nThey put it out the same time that the phone and started to catch all these people going to vote or his owning\nA ticket to get them to just vote ... straight Republican that makes sense congressman yeah\nYeah I mean I so we have rolling voting dates and a few states but you're right that there was a a mass that kind of hit right now\nI think this is a a bigger strategy for them that they're they're desperate when you look at the campaigns they're running through Paul Ryan superPAC almost none of them are on the issues they're not talking really about healthcare they're not talking about good paying jobs are infrastructure they're not talking about\nThe culture of corruption in Washington they talk about personal attacks and going after people's families and the rest they may have had when they were Eighteen or Twenty years old and I think you know this is something where they're trying to get into the policy arena\nTo put something to scare people but unfortunately people already scared that they're going to lose their health care and that's why Seventy percent of the people supported Medicare for all concept so I think they're way behind this is kind of\nTrying to to give them some ability to talk about health care\nIn a very obviously manipulated way since fifty two percent of Republicans also supported Medicare for all and that Reuters poll they know they're in trouble a and they're trying to put out deceit and lies but I don't think they're going to succeed and I think we just have to be\nWilling to stand up and explain this and in show that the American people really support this issue but uh there's no

...\nYou're talking the Democratic caucus not the ...\nRight yeah no democratic caucus as a whole correct so and then we have with our dressing as\nYeah system majority leader a whip position and then we have a caucus chair and assistant cock his chair I'm Barbara Lee ran two years ago for caucus chair lost by a\nCouple of votes as it was four votes and she's running for that again I as caucus chair right now we also have some other progressive caucus members who are very active running a including David ... from Rhode Island running for assistant majority leader and Katherine Clark from Massachusetts is running for assistant\nCaucus chair so a ... definitely running for one of the leadership spots as are some other progressive or we're excited to get more progressive into

would be feasible workable plan to get out from Asia and all the other big money out of their government and she sent the entire government could they do that or is yeah there are some other way\nNo there isn't there is a way to do it uh it you know number one I like what the last caller said to congressman poke in what congressman folk instead backed him which is that here in Oregon when Jeff Merkley was being attacked by the Koch brothers front groups he can't he ran ads with you know\nIt just calling them out he made the Koch brothers a campaign issue I think that the Democrats should absolutely be doing this nationwide right now in every single race and I don't know why they're afraid to do it on they need to get out there and they need to turn the coke and make the Koch brothers radioactive but not just the Koch brothers ate all send them home you know the whole crowd\nA number one number two how do we get money out of politics money was inserted into politics in Nineteen Seventy six and a big way remember back in Nineteen oh seven during the Teddy Roosevelt administration they passed the Tillman act which said that it's a felony for a corporation to give money to any candidate for federal office\nUm fast forward in Nineteen Seventy six that get struck down by a decision called ... versus ... now and and then ah another one two years later a first national bank versus ... there was actually authored by Lewis Powell that decision\nAnd down in both cases the first Buckley having to do with billionaires\nA first national bank having to do with corporations\nIn both cases what the Supreme Court ruled was that money is a protected by the first amendment as if it were free speech because corporations don't have a mouth and cause billionaires are just individual people they can't talk so loud that millions of people can hear them so their money can work as their speech I take that as a total nonsense a total BS\nUm argument but it is a law the land out because the Supreme Court said so\nSo what we need to do is change the composition of the Supreme Court if\n... if a if the Supreme Court and not handed the the uh the presidency of George W. Bush in two thousand we would right now I have a seven to two liberal advantage on the Supreme Court and said we've got a five to four conservative advantage so what we need to do if we get control and this is your ears scenario Terry and by the way thank you for calling on the what we need to do is\nIs passed either a simple majority of Congress can pass legislation that changes the number of members of the Supreme Court\nSo once we got the ... the White House the Senate and the house I realize it's going to be a while though it might be twenty twenty twenty it might be another two years might be even six years who knows but one we've got those three things passed that law take the Supreme Court from nine to eleven or nine to Thirteen\nHave that Democratic president put for new two or four new justices on the court and have in the meantime started Janine up a case that was like the Buckley case that the Supreme Court can use to reverse Buckley in reverse Citizens United in her first first national bank versus bloody and reverse McCutcheon and just reverse the whole damn thing\nAnd that will get us back to the way we were from Seventeen eighty nine when the constitution was ratified until Nineteen Seventy six when when five justices on the Supreme Court blew everything up and turned us from a democracy into an oligarchy\nRoy in Greensboro North Carolina a right what's on your mind\nTo much JFK hero\nTake what's up\nOf severe the climate crisis oh by the way of adjusting Rosario remarks are right um they are just white trash they should owner or a bunch of crybaby so\nBut I'm I'm really concerned about this climate crisis and I don't think the western wildfires are being recognized as a huge factor in this year's weather disruptions\nHere Piedmont North Carolina every day\nTen to Fifteen degrees above average misery heat index even higher it's like a hundred degrees every day and to October\nThis is this is why hurricane Michael went so far so fast it's because of the Gulf waters are averaging eighty three degrees right now Fahrenheit and basically in October this October fifth\nIf this time of year or they're Seventy Seventy one Seventy three degrees so there are ten degrees warmer than normal that's when ... hurricane Michael I shouldn't surprise anybody forget my interruption right keep on going know\nQuite a story on our uh Chesapeake Bay I went there this summer in August\nThey're losing a lot of the salinity the crabs oysters are somewhat disappearing because of all the rain we've had in the rain you all have an ad out west there um and I think it's because of these fires are putting heat\nArticulates carbon into the atmosphere\nAnd I have a good idea to fight it I Would really be interested in your opinion\nYou know are gargantuan military for\nLast year all the funding went\nTo fighting wildfires and there was no prevention this past winter Trump should have seen that Congress should have seen uh I'd say we just a rotating\nAre gargantuan military one company or inspired by the time for prevention this year\nClearing the dead on their brush may be\nClear and the trees planting new trees that are more\nSuitable or something or you know something really\nFranklin Roosevelt confront of the same problem really we had the dust bowl was going on and literally the top so the mid West was being blown into the east coast out to the Atlantic\nAnd and uh what he did is he created this thing called the civilian conservation corps the C C C and he hired a couple of literally a couple of million American out of work men and and been built camps all over the all over the country for them to work from ... and live in\nAnd they planted millions of trees a month\nAnd as they re forested and a lot of it was just along roadsides hedge rose things like that property borders\nUm but what I did was it broke up the wins and and I and stabilized the soil and help to capture moisture in a way that stopped the dust bowl FDR ended the dust bowl and this is one of the stories of the FDR administration that almost nobody knows\nFDR ended the dust bowl by those with the C C C with a giant and government program that was really just designed to put people back to work but it ended the dust bowl so yeah it could be done and it doesn't need to be the military can be done the same way that the Roosevelt did\nThat said though one of the big and and and I'm Glad you said replacing the trees with species that are more appropriate because one of the big problems that they have in California and pretty much everywhere else right now is that trees can't move but the climate is moving you know the the the heat is moving north\nThat's why you need a trade up to the next year I'm telling you you won't believe the

up and he's proud of it\nWell he's not calling table garbage collectors he's calling them garbage\nYeah I Know that we shouldn't call people trash or garbage we can say is wrong I think he's

usually when you have a mutual respect with somebody and there's an old saying you don't make nice with cancer and unfortunately\nA lot of people in our government the Republican Party and the Trump people they don't respect anything but tough enough for some reason and we should take him a higher road and it's and it's really not hurting us in my humble opinion\nYeah somebody just yesterday came

a lot of matters when there's a mutual respect and you're just having a simple disagreement I Do think it's important to you know keep in class\nAnd but I I'm like you Tom I'm way beyond that now you know um I I feel like I'm constantly being attacked my psyche thing attached to my hope for my future is being attacked\nIt it's a little disingenuous to ask me to keep taking the high ground to 'em because there's you know there's an old saying in a spiritual things that I Belong to such it's a ... a thousand times harder to live according to the law loves\nYou been to live according to the law of hatred and it is and I I Do pledge myself to live that way but sometimes you've got to fight back [laughter] yeah\nThe Sean just only the person who is said when they go low we kick them is Eric

Lisa thank you thank you for everything that you just shared with us it's great uh Victoria in Chico, California Victoria what's on your mind baser watches a fake Facebook Live what's up\n[noise] Hi Tom this is actually my first time tuning into you one of my friends were kind enough to share your feet um well I was hoping to comment on a conversation that began earlier regarding money in politics I Am an intern with the organization move to amend\nGod Bless you [laughter] I\nSaid I support those Roman for years\nNow so [laughter] I really really appreciate that and I am I going to be able to get a quick little explanation of what that is just in relation to the concept of money in politics and I'm\nSo for for any of your viewers who are interested in this group or move to amend it's a non partisan coalition without over four hundred and fifty and hundreds of organizations leading the charge to amend the U.S constitution and will be abolishing corporate constitutional rights\nAnd therefore getting big money out of politics because that's kind of a step back from why is there money in politics right because the definitions that we currently except in our constitution\nAre being applied to corporations and people a light right and that's where we are being left out where that the billionaire can can use their money to defeat our speech they're practically their their money is more influential\nThan public opinion polling their money is more influential than what our individual voices say they believe their money is not more and more influential than our boat get out there and vote next month November sick\nUm [laughter] so I just wanted to make sure that um people knew there is a huge ... collective organization working really hard amend the constitution I think your approach to restructure the Supreme Court so that we could start eroding those precedents uh\nFrom from that process is a great idea as well but I think that the move to a man's ... strategic plan to amend the constitution would actually\nA rewrite\nThe the the constitutional applications therefore those precedents will be null and void at that point",
