I Would say that ... in the United states\nUm the concept of fascism in the United states has I Would say for the most part we've always been a fascist country per se in the sense of the extermination of Native Americans and the slave meant of African Americans\nFor those racial group shouldn't categories there was always a hard ... date with no civil rights at all in fact I think there was a Noam Chomsky said if if the U.S constitution was adopt today\nThe entire world would basically say would be overturned and not seeing someone slavery in fact it was the ...\nI mean the founders were very anti democratic\nUh that's why they find the Supreme Court found that it's a a gerrymandering hey I'm\nA ... exactly and they and they knew what they were doing when they shut this all up don't act like they were you know\nIt was all there is all about protecting the wealthy white men by and large\nExactly the oligarchy is\nBut you know and I ... I I'm I'm I'm kinda haunted by I\nThink it was Nineteen forty and I forget what year it was but uh you know Henry Wallace this was during World War two I ... I think it was forty one but it might have been forty three or ... whatever year was\nUm every Wallace wrote this op ed for the New York times and and they asked him you know are there fascist in America who do we have to worry about and it was while we're fighting Germany and his reply was that you know the American Nazis\nAre not the people we have to worry about their their you know and he said the FBI has them under close watch the people that we have to worry about\nAre the are the are those who you know basically the corporate just the ones who who claim patriotism wrap themselves in the flag and then just you know want to want to want to be an appeal away all the wealth in the country\nAnd I I I Need to find that op ed ... re read at one of these days on the air because it's such a good one but Jared your point is well taken thanks a lot for the call or Louis in Salisbury North Carolina Ellis in our uh Pacific affiliate there hey Louis what's up\n[noise] yeah how you doing Tom ... you know I was just listening to the caller days with the second amendment right hype [laughter]\nOh man you know it seems to mean a lot of people are like they got that uh the KKK to ... and how they displayed there are right when they went in just a place to St you wear\nYeah and and as you know assassinated a nine parishioners\nYeah we have a homegrown terrorist organization that is you know the American version of ISIS and it's called the Klan and and then the third and then and now there's all these ancillary groups that you know they don't call themselves the Klan but they you know they're still marching down the street in Charlottesville saying he will not replace me you know where they're taking wondering\nNow what happened to World War two when America white America and black but white America and uh with their allies\nAnd defeated Hitler and all of a sudden now all that live a life that we lost defeating Hitler Daytona America going to allow neo Nazis\nAnd you know you're not says really don't really care about the call them they just care about the complex scanned at the white or you a Jew\nSo that means they're all white people\nNo one day at black got we're about to klansmen but all white people have said we're about ... because they don't care to Columbia scant if you're white America lighting like all the shoes if you look at your school shootings all white kids got me a swat\nStickers all on the magazine ... looking like oh I don't know something out of a\nKGB whatever the case may be but at the white people need to get together and find out why did she is going on it's because they allow their children to be transformed into a knot these and and and they and they use in swat\nHave we ever heard anything about the Las Vegas guy shooting was you have you with Ninety because my wife and he had an opportunity to shoot up a concept of black but he he chose to shoot up a concert or a country of white people\nI don't know about that but I Do know a it was reported in the media you know as a reporter to the news is a fairly non controversy LA's so I you know is pretty straightforward stuff that he was a big consumer of right wing conspiracy stuff and then he ... books in his house and all that kind of stuff maybe\nBalcony and does all inclusive and I mean all inclusive all transfers are gratuities no tipping and free why did I mention we're going to hang out and discuss how to change the world you and me reserve your sweet today by contacting king luxury travel telling us the Tom Hartmann grew eight hundred eight five six eleven\nFifty five [noise]\nWhere they are war and in Seattle a moron what's on your mind\nYeah Tom uh really appreciate your show I watched it a lot of watch moxie now I'm I'm I'm left with guy vote for Democrats\nA hero I mean yes um I just\nWanted to be another issue that's kind of easy to me um when I was Twenty years old I was brutally beaten by two guys and one of its excessively sued them later in Nineteen Seventy four I got a gun permit\n\nTo protect myself because they threatened me and\nWas why we have that's why we have a concealed weapon a permits and you know it's I have no objection to uh the state issue in a license to carry concealed weapon to people who have passed some sort of in a reasonable and relatively rigorous background check I got a problem with that war\nOkay well and and then later\nI don't think anybody has a problem with that I you know the the ... the problem that we have is that we're a washing guns we have half\nThe world's civilian guns in this country where four percent of the world's population and we have an ice and we have the highest rate of gun violence in the world and it has nothing to do with concealed carry permits it has to do with you know ... is the fact that in most states are well actually every in every state now I Believe\nYou can walk into a gun show and buy a gun with no you know if if the if it's considered a quote private transaction a you know there's no background check there is no waiting period there is no there is no nothing and and we allow weapons of war to be carried on the streets of America\nAnd you know no other civilized country does that\nWhich is great which is crazy and I support getting rid of assault weapons and background checks\nYeah just a rational gun control stuff I mean we had this for ten years and and George W. Bush and the Republicans in two thousand five when the when the assault weapons ban expired and then had actually measurably reduced gun violence in the United states they set out what the hell we don't need to renew that\nAnd then all of a sudden we're not all of a sudden but you know and now we're seeing more and more of these particular school shootings and mass murders that are being done with the you know with these kinds of weapons so\nYeah war on thank you for the call I you know I get it I get it you know some people need to carry concealed weapons that's not the issue here Don and shoreline Washington ... ...\nYeah you know I ... I don't know historical research in my lifetime ... leader fascism originated in the Roman Republic of the Roman empire sure\nThat's the you know that's why most ... use the ... as the logo the the the the bundle of sticks with a rope are routed an ax sticking out of the top of it because you know that was the that was the Roman that was the symbol of Roman power\nYeah so I guess you could sit in a way that Republicans are fascists in fascism ...\nWell it's it's increasingly looking that way and and that's a you know that's that's a big concern Don thank you uh you know well said to Tomas in Rockford, Illinois to us what's up\nIt was a to me what I see the way things are going is they're they're they're going to turn the Republicans are going to turn and those guys going to turn out in this country and to a third world country\nAnd and uh to me that the division that's going not you know I Do Republicans voted Republican people out on the ... there the problem the problem is the Republican politicians\nThat law at a certain level to us we all ... you know depending on the metric here using were already a third world country we have you know Seventeen percent of us live in poverty\nI'm more than fifty percent of us can't sustain a thousand dollar expense I in fact more than ... percent of us can't sustain a thousand dollar eh expense we've got a a a infant mortality rate and a maternal mortality rate you know women dying in childbirth and pregnancy and and the children dying in their first two years of life\nThose those to death rates are right up there with a third world countries we are at the very very bottom of the thirty four we see the country's so you know we're right on the edge of the transition from being a fully developed country to being a third world country\nI I just she she things getting worse and it's you know it is the Republicans and these are the guards that are just making things worse that's about all I got\nYeah well I think is that a well and I and you know this this this multi trillion dollar transfer of wealth since Nineteen eighty and ... the you know to replace a has brought us this bill and Portland hey bill what's up\nHigh um the ah fascism is tied in with business and\nUm when the Trump Administration you know they've been barring anybody involved with the cannabis industry coming in from Canada on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry alcohol industry in the tobacco industry that's an example of the ... a fascist dictatorship and action but also\nNot allowing a also ... only bad things are being a Republican announcements regarding the cannabis industry and cannabis you know in general [noise] um so and and also like\nI don't see that as fascism bill I you know I I see that as bad policy and and you know punitive and or retribution or however you pronounce that word if it is even a word\nUm you know and and it's a reflection of justice Jeff Sessions or you know firm belief that to the pot is somehow associated with with the\n...

I was uh browsing through the news the other day and I encountered an article by a I'm a P Tucker on counter posh that just blew my mind and it was a about how a partisan while the headline partisan pollsters fail black progressive candidates\nAnd uh I I said to Sean we got I I wanted to talk to this guy want to learn how to share this with all of the pain Tucker is on the line with us is the is the D.C based to journalists\nAnd ah you know with a counter punch who is the author of those his website ... dashed Tucker dot com and you can tweet him at pizza Tucker Pico just the smell like a thousand people on the program thanks so much for having me Tom so ... you know tell us what era summarize your article plays\nWell we've seen oh in this Trump era that polls are not just failing but they're failing black progressive candidates um and it's not just that those failing randomly there specifically failing to buy under counting their support in pretty dramatic ways\nFor example I on a Presley a a progressive city councilwoman in Boston she\nChallenging incumbent congressman and Democratic primary she was predicted to lose by Thirteen points she won by Eighteen uh thirty one point swing Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nIn New York She's also challenged and incoming congressman or she was predicted to lose by thirty six point she won by Fifteen I fifty one point swing state ... ... and there's three candidates for governor\nI'm three black candidates for governor of this country by the way is elected to black governors in its history and we have three democratic nominees for governor\nIn Georgia a Stacey Abrams or the last ... had a winning by twenty but she won by over fifty\nOr maybe the most shocking one um was Andrew Gillum in Florida or there were nine polls taken in the lead up to the Democratic primary eight of those polls had Gillum he's a progressive African American mayor of Tallahassee a eight of those poll had him coming in for\nA one of those polls have him coming and tied it third\n... Florida is the third largest state in the country Gillum didn't finish fourth didn't finish third you won the nomination or those highest\nWalked away with it for you walked away with the highest poll had him at sixteen percent uh most pull the twelve percent and he finished at thirty four percent\nYeah yeah so so why is this paid I mean the the the the the kind of common sense simple explanations seems to be that ah minorities my minority communities have historically not been a as engaged in the voting process or as have white suburban communities for example\nAnd uh now they're starting to get more engaged in that process or they're they're not just starting ... through their Obama presidency one I\nI'm getting far more engaged but they're not being polled or is it that were I mean is it that or is it the the the the polling is skewed toward basically why Democrats way Republican idea what's going on why is this\nWell I I think what's what happens is that and I've been learning this as I go along because if there's something going on here\nYeah and I only eat any good clean research on this stuff this is the kind of stuff that you would think fewer Harvard and be all over\nIt would be helpful on so a lot of the polling there's different types but it seems to be that all of the most of it is based on a fundamental yes which is who's going to be a likely voter\nAnd one of the strongest indicators is what happened last election\nAnd you're going to look at the ... the last um you know a a non presidential elections to go back to twenty four team right\nWell in twenty fourteen you had historic lows over fifty years it was the lowest turnout something like World War two and so if you're going to use that as a base of treat Trump election\nAnd then twenty sixteen of course President Trump is elected and with all his venom towards women towards minorities\nTo pretend that somehow that's a solid base of pre Trump election with the ...\nA little bit I I kind of you to look at like ... been Winkle and the sense that the pollsters\nTook a twenty fourteen election and then went up in the mountains that went to sleep like rip van Waco and came on down not knowing that a revolution is taking place ... and I think there's a lot more energy than the polls and picking up among young voters among non white voters\nAnd so that's my guess is the what's happening but it is an interesting Tom ... these polls are just failing it's not random they are consistently under counting the vote the support for progressive candidates of color and this turns out to be far more problematic than it's just it's not just a mistake because there are real consequences\nThat either but they're not under accounting or missing progressive candidates who are white\nIs that route I look more carefully at that I I it's not it certainly hasn't been is a ... a ... a mistake a stark stark a disparity yeah yeah\nVery interesting well I eat as you continue your research into this would you would you keep us up to date\nYeah and if I could make one more point Tom places um\nThis is problematic in of itself but it has the danger\nBecoming a self fulfilling prophecy because when you tell voters um that your candidate who use support has no shot at winning then\nAs by the way the pollsters were speaking about Andrew Gillum and Florida for example\nIf you start to

a half a Fifteen at a meeting with the the uh\nA king who apparently is in full blown dementia and a thirty minute meeting with a NBS uh Mohammed bin Salman the prince who was basically running the country\nOr what what do we know about this and has any of this meaningful and ah you know what's the latest shtick that to Saudi Arabia is try to I understand turkey came out and said yeah they found a DNA and blood evidence that ah that Mr ... showed I was saying 'cause showed me I guess that's a good show gee\nAh was murdered in in the in the embassy or in the consulate or what's the what's the latest on this\nWell let me because you you mentioned the last but Turkish a sort of a line about what occurred last night during this nine hour period in which there were Turkish crime scene investigators on the scene at the embassy depends on who you ask and I will say that while there have been\nSome media reports confirming exactly what you just send a you know sort of more conclusive evidence of\nOf blood or other sorts of you know remains of Mr ... that the Turkish president Russia Baird on himself has been a lot more muted saying look it's inconclusive\nWe do have some suspicions that major portions of walls if not entire rooms were repainted and he sort of hinted that that might have been an effort to conceal some sort of toxic substance\nOr otherwise they brought this ... crew and you know describe the style with bleach before they before they painted it\nI mean I I Do think at every turn the Saudis are sending a pretty clear a signal that they really don't care about appearances here ah you know if if you are going to and we haven't you know these media reports from CNN and NBC which were swirling around last night\nThat the Saudi Government has sort of figured out the party line and that they were gonna chalk this whole thing up to a botched interrogation which uh was evidently supposed to subdue this guy but not kill 'em\nAnd then put them on a plane back to Saudi Arabia um\nThey haven't officially stuck with that narrative and I you know I Wonder who the sources where I'm at a community it is telling I think how thoroughly pick through that you know kind of line of reasoning was but I'm not really sure at this point out\nKnow two weeks after this is Saudi Arabia can possibly I even have a a a law here that uh they can stay with a straight face a this is very difficult to demonstrate that you were concerned about I don't know some rogue actor or something operating within your embassy if\nYou know it was looted law came out and said if if this is true that is going to be severe consequences I'm a ... spokespeople a response to that said we will stick a dagger\nInto the heart of the American economy if you try to punish us have day back us down as a ...\n[laughter] well I mean he said pretty clearly that we are not you know ... ... in the same breath in what she's saying uh we are going about severe consequences if this guy was killed by the Saudis he's also made it perfectly clear arms deals are not even on the table so it's kind of unclear if\nThere's even a middle ground that he has in mind or he just hopes that at some point some treasury official can say okay here's like two or three kind of ... things we do and you can go to your you know can go on to say that\nWe're seeing a treasury by the way Steve ...

with\nYou Dave in a federal way Washington Dave what's up\nNot too much Tom hey I wanted to make a comment about um you know how the ... the academic topic of fascism alright ... the um you know what I'm saying I don't mean it in a negative way\nThe um uh you know the message about neo liberalism is getting out I had a debate with the guy at work on Neal liberalism and I had to tell him finally that hey look\nIn my opinion Neal conservatism and Neal liberalism is like choosing between him locking arsenic you pick your poison right I mean I I Know\nWell now conservatism has its focus on on war and and imperialism and Neal liberalism has its focus on economics and and uh uh you know the the the the power of the very wealthy but there have yet it but there's a whole lot of conflation between the two\nThere is and you know we all go through periods where we're sympathetic to each I think you know and the thing is is I just want to um you shut me up from my point really well\nI think we are in a new conservative a cycle really in the world but for chicken while in the western world it specifically in America and my issue with that is is neoconservatives and can flip\nIf the if the environment it's correct or if the environment is just right it can flip industry to academic fascism\nNow what kills my argument is we have elections but this this this whole election paying it is really minor um you know it is a minor aspect All right we cannot before we don't even know if these elections are legitimate number one\nNumber two is All right like if you look at recently this s four hundred anti aircraft system the Russians are building they're selling that to um turkey turkey is a NATO country it is just a better weapon system for the price\nNow I read two articles one Russia is doing this to try to um you know find out classified information about NATO air defense to Russia is doing this to to shoot down to figure out how to shoot down the F thirty five\nWell if if the neo conservatives figured this out Boeing and Lockheed and all them figure this out that the F thirty five ... ... you know that the ... of government it's why one when you have to for twice the price don't make enough thirty six\nJak hypothetically and this is all you know the cycle of money Neal conservatism and the evolution and the fascism\nAnd I would say that most of this began I mean you know we can track a lot of this back to the Vietnam War in fact we can track probably somewhat back to the Korean War but in a big way of began after nine eleven\nAnd of course that was the neoconservatives you know the big dream I mean they're they're they're hallelujah moment that they talked about in Nineteen Ninety eight and the project for new American Century signed by Jeb Bush among others on debt that basically said that that implored Bill Clinton and to attack Saddam Hussein and take down the government of Iraq\nAnd so you know when George W when he became president uh you know everybody was talking about he was an illegitimate president but hey we had this great peace dividend remember the peace dividend ... at the end of the century\nAnd you know because of the fall of the Soviet Union and we didn't need to have all these nuclear weapons at all this stuff and the nine eleven happens and then suddenly off to the races you know okay uh and and George Bush had a choice he\nCould've said okay you got Seventeen hijackers Fifteen of 'em are Saudis or we're going to collaborate with Saudi Arabia and we're going to and we're going to collaborate with Afghanistan where this apparently was plotted\nAnd uh and and by the way we had a decent relationship with Afghanistan at that point in time just six months earlier George Bush and given forty million dollars to Afghanistan to distribute to their poppy farmers and they hadn't burned or something like Seventy percent of the poppy fields\nIn Afghanistan enthusiastically in exchange for more money than they would have gotten if they've grown up and sold it\nAnd so you know when when Mullah Omar said oh my God this terrible thing that happened to you guys we will arrest bin Laden and the five thousand
