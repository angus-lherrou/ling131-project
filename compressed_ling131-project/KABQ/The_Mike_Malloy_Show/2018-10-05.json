you\nLove you for the call and since he mentioned you do have a pod cast I have a few yeah um do you actually have a podcast net\nBy do pass little toss productions banks labor costs dot com and we've got seven podcast right now the extra but my main podcast is the lava flow in lava stems from libertarian and uncle capitalist momentary as an actress\nAnd a half an hour per week so basically talking about current events but not the current events that you hear on the News I'm not going to talk about Kevin All right I'm going to talk about encroachment by our government and where they are really hurting us left and right in and hurting the little people I'm not talking about these big deals with everybody else on right\nAnd I've been a long time listeners supporter of your show and you actually had to make a change recently\nUh where you used to start the show with today is you would give the day that you were recording rent and this many people have been killed by police and the website that you were getting statistics Robin we mentioned that on free talk\nLive now but the website has shutdown killed by police dot net has shut down all the website is still there it is but ah not putting his army engine aggregating information so what were you doing why shouldn't the host as an aggregator is well limited on nearly as accurate as right by police guy\nUm and it's you know quite a bit lower of a number so I'm using that for Malmo hoping that we can get the killed by police guy to do it again I mean basically he did it for five years almost for free I mean he got Franco nations but\nI'm I'm hoping that you know he'll eventually pick that backup yeah and you know I'm surprised that he never went to patriotic now you know with that and you know it's one of those things of maybe\nPatriotic would say you know we don't like this because reasons and not allow the guy who raised through there\nA couple of years I used to my problem we've sent home gosh hundred or two hundred bucks by ... and you know hey I Want to support people when they're doing good work and this I did great work yeah um so yeah in a way if anybody wants to go to killed by police dot net given mobile to pay money maybe he'll start backing up hopefully\nHe will and you know maybe if you want to help aggregate the information right if he could crowdsource this a little bit more instead of just one guy I'm guessing it was\nJust one guy doing all the work that's what it sounded like a killed by police dot net and also pack sliver toss productions dot com packs liver toss dot com let's go back to the phones we've got Joe calling from Iowa Joe you're on free talk life would go have returned thought\nHow you doing guys doing well you're on the radio what's on your mind\nAll right well I wanted to ask where you're having this discussion about the way to govern like that and I I have a libertarian friend of mine that I talked to quite frequently and he couldn't ask for this question so I thought maybe you guys got\nIs there currently and practice a libertarian government somewhere in the world or has it been tried previous\nThere is no such thing as a libertarian government those two things or a or a governor there is no I mean there's two things right typically\nHave yeah the the problem we have will be the word govern 'em by deal libertarianism is about self government so far less\nThan an artist I there's no central type of government that nobody is regulated\nRight for a gallon and here's where we get into kind of interesting discussions I think is when you talk about voluntary communities and whether they could choose whether I as a libertarian\nCould choose to live in a I'm In a society that has its own rulers or its own rules and things like that would have been afforded me\nA much a free or world than the world I live in and maybe they do supply some services you know maybe I'm okay with that well I'm sure you would have but but the issue the differences government requires force\nAnd that's where you're talking about you know there's no such thing in my opinion as a voluntary government I think you would have to have a different name for it and some sort of in a corporation or something like that right but I don't think that you can legitimately call it the government and less forces there but it vibe voluntarily and joined him I said yes I'll pay your taxes\nI think it's a good deal but that's not government anymore because they're not using force it'd be a little bit governing body but that's not government one of I joined and they say now that you're in a must\nTo necessarily not [laughter] there\nAre right samples throughout history yes a stateless societies nine thousand years from Ireland for example right yeah Ireland for a really long time a lot of what is now the Arabian Peninsula for a really long time was stateless and what would probably now be described as Polly centric\nTo where you would have died Jews Muslims Christians in pagan living in the same town next to one another\nBut they all operated under different governmental structures yeah\nBut as far as currently existing are probably the closest thing would be limited land\nWell but it doesn't mean it is [laughter] Iran internationally recognized that every time anybody's tried to go to the piece of land they'd been arrested by the uh Croatian Government for violating something even though Croatia acknowledges we don't actually own this piece of land\nOn prop ... and that's it so go ahead go ahead what ...\nWhat if the U.S really be a I mean at this time what wouldn't it really the pie that can stand up to govern recognize that there is a ... there is a you know a majority\nAre between the the the two major parties right and the majority of people identify what those parties and vote with those parties isn't that kind of ... that by that\nIs that's the case then Joe them I was ... what do you think the government's not withdraw my when I say that I refuse to pay taxes I refuse to follow your in laws do you think that that's going to go over well with our government I'm Still waiting for ... for the car and\nThere has to be a majority of people that that will agree to a certain\nSet of rules for everybody because otherwise that exactly what you have to be at our everybody doesn't\nI'm okay with that on day ... the problem Joe and thank you for the call the problem that you brought up with when it majority rule is used in infringe on the rights of the minority and I wish we had more time to continue this

been ... the underwriting this program for two years\nI use super bass I like sweets I talk about it in the ads and guess what it sells product\nSo why would ads for Brett Kavanaugh not sway opinion in the direction of Brett Kavanaugh\nAdvertising works\nIf it didn't work it would have gone away in the Nineteen forties I mean it works\nAnd so guess what ...\nA month ago well actually last month a

that has defined the twenty Eighteen campaign up to this point has disappeared\nNow why would that be well three hundred million dollars and the Koch brothers millions and millions of dollars from their buddies\nThey note in July there was a ten point gap between the number of Democrats or Republicans saying that of amber elections were very important in other words ten percent more Democrats

it for Brett Kavanaugh much of that just plain old dishonest\nAnd this is this is where it gets really extraordinary that Trump tamp tax cut unlocks millions for Republican election bullets this is from an article back in August Eighteenth and the New York times by Jim tankers Lee and Michael ...\nThe the tax cuts are helping the Republican Party by unlocking tens of millions of dollars in campaign donations from the wealthy wealthy conservatives in corporate interests the benefited hands simply from it the congressional leadership fund a superPAC closely aligned with Speaker Paul

our people call the ... her biggest her biggest ah thing was if a if you want to go on the air or be honest about what you want to talk about I you know ... it's incredible\nHow many times people who want to put out a conservative message why to our call screener about what they're all I'd like to say I love Medicare well that sounds like a boring a call I'm probably not going to prioritize that but if you were saying oh I'm a conservative and I love and I and I hate Medicare and I think it should be blown up\nAnd what's happened debate I Would love to talk to you about that but these conservatives think that unlike the running the show like Rush Limbaugh does where you every call has got to be a suck up and you got to lie to get in you know if you're going to try and uh you know Bush whack the host no this host welcomes it as I said if you ...\nThe green you go to the top of the line but the other thing that Lewis said uh and and I and I know sure as experience is that people say oh yeah I'm going to go on and just remember Tom I'm going to kick us but we're going to debate so and so and a great I'll put you on the line you know an in line and then you know with three minutes later they hang up now I you know I'm not sure I get you know there will be a coward [noise]\nThan here in Chicago a standard what's up\nI'm ... I'm thank you for taking my call\nMy pleasure oh and I have sand or if I may just finished my little rat here I yeah I just ... and please be nice to the person answering the phone as you know the Bush era Louis don't you know they're not ... you're not on the air you don't have to go through the whole thing you know give them five words to put on the on the call screen software so I can see what you're calling about north we go sander back to you you wanted to talk about Cavanaugh\nI'm ... I'm In the ... to um the ab I'm\nJust fine should they be able to do it to ... in that situation first of all we think he's lied under oath and I'm sure they fly to hand it to the NBA they fly he write to them\nAnd I'm making it sound any example fit shirt on a trip for an impartial he's completely the opposite\nI'm sure to their destination teeth I charged should not be\nI think that the only way the a BA could do something like that and I'm not a lawyer so I don't really know how this all works but you know from what I've read in the inferences that I'm drawn from that is that somebody would have to file a complaint\nWith the NBA about him which you know no doubt is happening um there are two complaints that have been filed with the DC circuit to ethics complaints that have been filed with the DC circuit and ironically Merrick Garland is that is the head of the DC circuit he's the judge will be overseeing these ethics complaints against Brett Kavanaugh how's that for irony\nBut I think that you know but but in in terms of ah the disc barman Bill Clinton was disbarred for lying about sex\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh has lie to you know apparently about sex and everybody is certainly lied about what he knew about torture is certainly lied about what he knew about the you know the black sites and all the other you know in the various stopped being done by the Trump Administration has certainly lied about his role in the in the uh and the two thousand\nAh Gore Bush Gore does Casey is lied about\nHis ah you know an ... and just actually there's a great piece of the Washington Post a couple of days ago called all the lies and Brett Kavanaugh and it just goes through and breaks them down and they're not\nThey're not subject to dispute I mean these things are clear wise so I'm with you I Would love to see the NBA do something I don't know that they're necessarily the best venue and I think it's going to be real interesting when mare and garlic and so all of those\nFill up in ... in Oregon they fill up what's on your mind that if\nI read in the\nEighties uh September Supreme Court to waive immediate dark money disclosure is put on by ... but then by dark money watch ... or ...\nAnd it said on Wednesday the next day and night because you're Nineteen they would have to anybody else does over two hundred dollars chest you say ... where's the money came from\nThat is that the law right now\nWhat it was a the Supreme Court all all the people in the stream court overreacted Roberts on it\nIs I don't know if I can tell you though that the one giant loophole fill up um and you may know something about something that I don't know about but the one giant loophole is that an unlimited amount of money can be given to a political action committee and a political action committee can spend an unlimited amount of money\nIn order to build up one candidate or destroy another so long as they don't coordinate the ads with the campaign of the candidate that's the only restriction and New Zealand cause campaign come out yeah I got it fell thank you for the call because campaigns come out and say you know well this is what we think are this is what

that end up being in common dreams or more often in alternate dot org and I was kind of a surprise you haven't\nUm posted an article about that because it's it's so vitally important I mean as you mentioned Monday of last week we can lose everything they can basically you know people say oh there that the Republicans the billionaires want to take us back to the fifties no they want to take us

closer look at the opinion page this week thing\nAnd you can get a vaccines without\nThem aerosol without a without the preservative if you just ask for the single dose vaccine which typically at the pale in an extra ten bucks for but if you're just saying I Want the single dose no\n... no preservative vaccine then you don't get mercury injected into your body but there's another compound in vaccines which is called the adjunct pay DJ UVA and tea and what it does is it it\nStimulates the body's immune system to respond now back in the nineteenth century and before that\nUh the way that they treated syphilis was with mercury\nAnd they would give people Marjorie if they had syphilis and the reason that worked over the short term was that these heavy metals cause the body's immune system to go holy crap points to throw him an addict\nAnd and and it just cranks the immune system to the point where any infection in in its way gets wiped out at least temporarily another syphilis are always come back 'cause it's very persistent and then people would have both syphilis and mercury poisoning and they'd be going insane\nOr getting nervous ticks are always all these other things\nSo that didn't work all that well so it was so anyhow what the address and dozens of does the same thing that makes the immune system crazy and now they use a salt of of of aluminum it's called alum\nAnd they add this to vaccines and and there's ... there's concern that that's one of the reasons why we're having this explosion of allergies in the United states that literally did not exist when I was a kid I didn't you know I went through you know to eleven years of public school system and didn't have a single friend who had a severe allergy\nI mean literally not want I didn't you know inhalers all this stuff I did in this back in the fifties and sixties I didn't know anybody\nAnd then we just radically increase the number of vaccines were giving kids which means we're hitting their bodies over and over and over again with this woman I'm which causes the immune system to go holy crap what am I supposed to fight\nAnd if they happen to be being held by a doctor who's got latex gloves or if the vaccine the ... the vaccine itself is is produced with the peanut oil which is the main at you know thing that is used to to develop vaccines and I guess what\nAllergies latex allergy to all these kind of things\nIn Israel where the where the vaccines are made with the uh\nWhat's the seed with sesame oil\nThere's an explosion right now in sesame allergies but they have no peanut allergy\nHere in the United states we have this explosion and peanut allergies no sesame allergies there's a reason for this and you know I'm telling you all this because\nAh the vaccine for people over sixty five\nWho get the flu vaccine this year\nIs four times as strong as the regular vaccine\nTo a hundred and twenty five micrograms of of\nYou know kill flu virus but it has no edge of a new\nBecause people are sixty five are fragile\nSo they give them twenty four times as much virus no preservative know address that\nSo I was actually enthusiastic about getting my flu shot yesterday [noise] anyhow I'm back to the you know in the larger picture science here's what the uh the Trump Administration is up to right now the they're they're floating new regulations for the EPA\nActually let me back up a little bit there's a guy who runs against Peter DeFazio here in Oregon for for the southern part of the the south western part of Oregon uh every every two years of the art Robinson runs against Peter I'm guessing is again this year I think he was the head of the Republican Party here in Oregon for a while might be now\nAn art Robbins and used to be a high school chemistry teacher science teacher and his\nAh concept is that if we're all exposed to a little bit of radiation all the time eventually we can develop an immunity it's sort of the vaccine theory of radiation and uh you know it's it's kind of a good thing for us it stimulates our immune system to repair itself\nTo be under is under assault\nAnd with regard to viruses and bacteria there's actually some you know there's there's science that kind of looks like that but now with regard to radiation radiation\nYou know destroys DNA and there's no way that the body can say oh well you know we need antibiotics for the seat don't produce antibiotics to prevent the destruction DNA in fact there's nothing that will prevent the destruction of DNA\nBut aren't Robbins and actually suggested that with a way to solve the problem of nuclear waste\nWas to put it it was to mix it with fiberglass and put it into the insulation and everybody's homes all of us are getting a little bit of radiation all the time and the nuclear waste problem is solved because now that nuclear waste the spread all over the country in all of our homes\nBrilliant idea right well and we're caliber east appears to have the same idea is a toxicologist at UMass Amherst\nAnd the Trump Administration has decided to have him be the lead scientist on all this stuff\nAnd so they are now rolling back or they're proposing to roll back radiation exposure guidelines and they are deleting\nAll the reference to radiation damage on their website they they did have guidelines of said quote there is some cancer risk from any exposure to radiation which by the way it's true there is no safe minimum a lot of radiation period dental X rays chest X rays there is no hundred percent safe amount of X ray radiation\nEvery bit has a has a slight risk\nThat would be such a slight risk but it's outweighed by the benefit of the X rays I've certainly had X rays knowing this\nBecause I figured hey the benefit is you know greater than the risk but but anyhow they used to say that there's always some now they have replaced those with\nRadiation uh exposures up to the equivalent of twenty five chest X rays usually result and no harmful health effects\nSo Dana Milbank as a written this piece over the Washington Post saying that uh you know sort of exercising every day I'll sleep with a running microwave next to my night stand

calls this the NBA team on no big deal\nThat radiation no big deal poisoning your food no big deal you don't eat organic foods at pesticides no big deal\nHe says there's really no problem to feed it frees federal fuel efficiency standards is what the Trump Administration is saying\nThat they don't that they can roll back the fuel efficiency standards that are bottle put into place even though it's going to increase the amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere why because the administration reasons the plan of separate years already set to rise by seven degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century so little bit of more\nWarming won't matter seven degrees Fahrenheit is going to make this planet inhospitable for civilization\nPossibly for humankind but certainly for

Denise in Chicago listen and I said in east what's up\n[noise] hey topic I guess what I like are you on Bill Maher and you withdraw in well thank you and all that you know I ... ... ... what's that\nI said so it was bill he deserves a lot of credit for Fifteen Years now very popular he does a great job as his producer his team they are all great they're they're really really add\nUp all day I get HBO just for that reason that I'm so I can get some more callers and I I decided to get\nFor ... and see if I was getting into crazy land when thinking that you know Trump is\nClearly hijack the deejay with the FBI investigation and limiting the scope and it really didn't even know what the truth ... investigation included to me that's a clear if each of power and it's fine\nAgainst me at American every other American uh especially with me and you know he did not allow should due process even though I think you eat and call it early it's a state any Nader may get caught on on Twitter Sunday where he said that he gave due process which is which is another lie he really\nGets so it is another sign you know as a geo TV may come to catch and a ... for their political reasons but you know it seems like we flew the bought it the the red line again\nYou know again she has this president becoming a dictatorship as well as a nominee or you don't have enough being planned and we all get out in the new chip that him but what was that as a champion I it's really scaring me\nAnd I have seen this is why yeah I I guess what you're saying and nice and I agree with you and I'm guessing that this is why the Obama administration did not\nSay to James call me know you may not have a news release about Hillary Clinton's emails no you may not open an investigation about her emails on Anthony wiener a computer or even though they were just you know copies and it was no there was no they're they're literally\nBut and and frankly I think maybe the Obama administration you could have made a case that they should have said that the FBI don't do this for six weeks out from an election but the FBI I did it and and and now and I and I think the reason that they allowed that to happen is because one of the first thing was\nThat a dictator does an air to want it to charity or a a a ... uh what's his name or bought in Hungary a poet and you know with the first thing that a strongman leader in a country does when they are in the process of eroding democratic norms\nAnd and installing you know basically an oligarchy is they seized control of the police are and and like police first the court's second\nRight and then they get the police on their side and deter it tastes case it gets a place on his side by saying hey you can kill people know battling ten thousand people\nNow been killed in the Philippines since ... said that um mostly ... users and and so if you go ahead\nI was just going to mention um you know art at the German individual I Know you don't like that and then they go there but Hitler did the same thing yeah he very much so um anyway I interrupted you Haji\nNo no it's good it's good to that is what a conversation as people that are up each other [noise]\nUm yeah I agree with you and in fact I Want to talk about that in the next hour and get into this you know how the how the administration is now in declaring war on on gay people as well as you know people of color yeah Denise thank you for the call and thanks for thanks for listening to us there in Chicago I appreciate it Stephen in Phoenix, Arizona Steven what's up\nI'm a I got to talk to some time about we're Christian to like over there in LA and a farmer's market their third in Fairfax is close to build studio and we we enjoy going there all the time [noise]\nUm but what I've got to say today is up you know the ... the the coming up\nI I might have a blonde can't let me put you on hold for a second here Bob Ney is holding\nTo come on that we're we're past break army\nI took the breaker early oh so we're back okay so Bob Ney we've talked media news is on the line with let's say Bob\nI don't want to bump anybody from Columbus ohio\nOn hold on line I'll pick him up and the next hour a day yeah Bob and I should\nSay the our our news report brought ... by ... dot com and uh you know and the lovingly do Eleanor enters the border near the on the side swipe so Bob what what's the latest what's going on\nWell of course as you know they are going to have the procedural vote than that probably means that the vote will be occurring in on Saturday unless something pops up and they have trouble than he could keep a mechanical keep 'em over Saturday or Sunday\nUh you know in a big deals been made about the rules for viewing and you know look up things are going to a most likely leak out anonymously of course as we know\nAh I think that uh if if it be known including Republicans Tom or they would like to have had this report made public which it could have been made public\nAnd then the public could take a look at it and make a decision on but I as we know that's probably never ever going to happen\nBut it's also you know it's kinda weird that they would not make it public if it is so exculpatory I'm On the other hand if it's incriminating that makes sense why they would cover it up a you know when the when the FBI investigated clay Hillary Clinton's emails me the FBI held a press conference and released all under a you know were thrilled to farms all of their interrogations witnesses\nWell that's right which there are some ...\n... ... right there still some wild cards in here though because\nAh as you know senator Collins was pretty upset about a President Trump and mocking of Dr Ford ... a plus a talk of the hill which I don't know who's talking publicly about this but you know the talk of the hill is his demeanor\nAnd also the fact that a yes\nSome of the people that they have spoken to may have not had a direct bearing on whether they verified you know he was or wasn't at a party but obviously friends have spoke out saying they are friends of his but also now I'm not trying to be judgmental here I'd be the last person to be judgmental on this issue but\nAh people have spoken out that you know his version of what he did a little bit of drinking is not reality of what he did so therefore on the hill some people are questioning if he's not telling the truth about that what about his current situation where does he stand you\nSpeak in your book side swipe too about your struggle with alcohol and how ... how would basically took you down I'm a is so having had that life experience\nWhat how does that inform your a perception your understanding of what's going on a in Kavanaugh's life given what we know so far ...\nI've talked about is you know Helen has a re in rehab center herself she's very well educated in recovery et cetera I've talked to some friends in recovery or in the last few days and frankly I think and if I were sitting there in Congress again and being in recovery as I Am\nI'm the antennas go up and again I'll Try to take inventory of be judgmental but his description of his of his drinking was eh you know I never blacked out I never did this I never did that\nAnd if you see what his friends have said who support him by the way it who say he wasn't there but they say his version is not one two or three this many friends his version is completely different so\nYou know the the radar goes up here if he is in denial and is not truthful about you know what he was like back then which people can change you know then what's the current situation if he quote still has a beer\nYou know what's the reality right and you know his temperament and demeanor makes a you know people again not being judgmental makes me question it makes a lot of my friends question that don't they don't have a dog in the sun\nBut they are very familiar with recovery services\nAnd so I think that you know there might be something out there\nYeah yeah okay what else is going on in the robot sure\nWell a lot of talk or ... Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court and I found it very interesting because a couple of surveys have come out and it says this is exciting the base you know of the Republican Party\nBut I I did want to note on that it may be exciting the base of the Republican Party or right and it might be like comparable to dropping a political grenade in the middle of everything\nDon't you think this this is largely the result of the millions and millions of dollars that they are right wing coke funded a Judicial Crisis network is spending on advertisements all over the country on a particular on cable news saying all witnesses say he wasn't there he's being smeared a good man is being destroyed a et cetera\nWell sure it is and you know ... ... and what's ironic as you know they wanted Amy Barrett anyway they didn't want him but you know he's now in the middle of this but I Want to point out something about that there might be a an excitement of the base although the base may not be eighty or Ninety percent excited but they\nThey there might be an excitement of the base but there is still a factor that has to this isn't the caution\nI Would say if I was advising them which I'm not\nA this doesn't mean that the geo piece problems are solved at all they have a major problem with independent voters ... so if the Democratic base turns out to vote which is what you know has to happen\nAnd even with the excitement of the Republican base over this specific issue because they weren't very excited before this as you know uh because of the lack of action by the Republicans after two years but the independent voters are still in a fundamental shift away from the Republican so they are up for grabs in the midterms and I think that\nYou know these polls and things that are out there although this week was a good week for the Democrat side Tom because the Democratic side um some seats from the cook report which is pretty reliable are shifting towards the Democratic side you know some seats\nFollow you know these these polls I I suspect Bob I mean the ... brothers or drop drop and three hundred million dollars that we know of in this election and most of it is probably going to come in October\nAnd I'm expecting to see some real radical swings we've already seen them in in North Dakota with Heidi Heitkamp we've seen them with Claire McCaskill in Missouri both of them were at one point way ahead now they're underwater as a result of these you know millions and millions of dollars in life by right wing billionaires yeah out of state money and there has to\nBe a voter turnout voter turnout half is is going to be critical\nOn the progressive side but I mean there's an enormous amount of money being put into\nA voter turnout middle service\nI'm I I don't I'm not certain that we're going to be a move away by you know I think we really need to get people to vote I think it's fifty fifty right now yeah I agree on the other side swipe talked media news thank you mom\nTalking moving back we're going to talk about the international\nMinistry more on gay people and we're going to try some wine\n\nYou're listening to um [noise]\nHis online banks for closing on

California net neutrality built because it prevents them from screwing their customers more than they already do\nIt's no surprise that they're suing but it does make it even more blatant and clear
