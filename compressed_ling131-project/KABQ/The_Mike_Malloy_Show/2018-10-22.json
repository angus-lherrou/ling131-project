[noise]\n\n\nThat debate I'm only a princess the fiance John Herschel she has been given twenty four hour police protection that decision made by the end than both given us off on Sunday meanwhile Arab News reports for sure she was never the enemy of the state correspondents I'm currently require\nJulian Assange you remember who he is he is holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London things seem to have broken down between him and the Ecuadorian government they have put all kinds of restrictions on him they told him to stop being political they're cutting off his Internet he has sued them you file a lawsuit saying they're violating as human rights\nWell I don't know if that law says go very far I'm not an international law specialist but my understanding is their asylum a granting is kind of it they're continuing grace and there's really no court is going to tell them otherwise\nBut Julian Assange is afraid\nThat he's going to get grab by the United states and they're going to do bad things to him\nAnd Sweden doesn't want him anymore ... your costs we said we want 'em in connection with some rape allegations and those very serious charges\nAnd he said no it's a roost if you're not going to hand me over to Sweden for rape investigations you're going to have me over to Sweden and me over the United states so they can send me to Guantanamo Bay and torture me so they're younger I just want to let you know Julian Assange\nMay be exploding onto the scene very soon 'cause it sure looks like if he's suing them he's kinda desperate now\nAnd it looks like there is a split between Julian Assange\nAnd the Ecuadorian government and he may be on the street one day\nAnd heaven knows what's gonna happen if he's on the street or\nMany of the national outlets were doing this story a kind of as the big story of the day I see it frankly I just do this is how I see the Republicans are Jeannie up\nThis illegal aliens story once again Jennings up all the illegals my goodness because this is what\nWorks for their racist knuckle dragging base where quickly\nReaching a point which appears to be in moments of crisis a record numbers of migrants I'm a sucker for secretary of vinegar in I spoke about the importance of stopping the flow before reaches the U.S border\nAnd that is the so called secretary of state Mike Pompeo trying to keep his job by you know kissing Benedict Donald rear end\nBy say oh my God look at the hordes owners a cameraman from\nPresident Trump is lashing out at the caravan alleging on Twitter the onslaught includes many criminals he threatened to deploy the military to the U.S border that is day Brian we think CBS News for that\nSince the president's suspended his controversial family separation policy in June illegal border crossings have sky rocketed\nAccording to unpublished border patrol data there were more than sixteen thousand family members arrested in September and eighty percent increase over July\nThat his day Brian again we think CBS News where that is\nThe Mexican foreign ministry now says it plans to ask the United nations refugee agency for helping coordinating with Central American governments because thousands of migrants might now be seeking refugee status in Mexico southern border especially if the American border is closed off\nThere you go to this day Brian and we think CBS News for that and so as a teachable moment this is one more consequences of letting Benedict Donald into the White House and the first hour we did a civics class here's the living civics class he's in charge of the executive branch government this three branches the executive is one of them presidents in charge of that\nAnd that means you went all the departments which means you can't\nSay I'm closing the border you can pick fights with foreign countries like he's doing with Mexico and China you can do all kinds of things when you're running the executive branch and we let him in there and so now we have this caravan now\nMy personal view of the matter and this is my this is my own personal theory and so I\nDon't have facts to back this up\nI Believe this isn't Alex Jones false flag operation with the Koch brothers funding this so called antifa and it's being staged in order to gin up Republican racism for the last election coming up blame you'll says eyes they blame yourself\nIsn't it interesting that a caravan is coming this way and that gives the Republicans all this up to the play their racist part\nI'm just like I told you in fact the bag it up I\nDon't have facts to back this since they play that game and they can say anything they want this is I'm an Sievers obviously there's there's no ... this is a false flag operation created by the Republicans so they can gin up all their racist supporters and I think it should be pretty obvious by now\nTowards the think it's pretty obvious by now hey George or back this part to\nYeah he's exit racist absolutely I heard that here what about the ... meeting chip stuff\nWell it's just something I read about and heard about over the years it's supposed to be very high tech and picked up by satellites but uh\nI I think there are two types of chips you were talking about here because I Know the one and you're right about rescuing cats and dogs shipping pets is very popular now they don't transmit what happens is if you find a straight pay you take them to a vet or shelter and they you know generally all most taboo list\nWon this light and basically you wave it over the dog and if there's a chip you can read it with this white and so that's how it works it doesn't transmit you have to find it and then it gives you the information you just read it off the light\nOr through the through the light so that's one type ship it sounds like you're saying is another type ... which actively transmit\nWell um I don't have specific facts to back us up is just what I read and heard over\nThe ... don't okay I got yours is gonna look we got a that was great we got it all out there it's everybody can go do their research and will all learn together when they sent me the results so norm at Norman Goldman dot com oh shut up I George I'm Glad you're back on the line whoa okay we were in the\nMiddle of I was just finishing up about our great speaker Mike medic and then the state the thing that's important to remember about him is that\nFor twenty six consecutive years when the Republicans held the governor's office he was either speaker or the minority democratic leader of the house or through that whole time\nHe was able to negotiate and make deals and reach compromises with Governor Ryan governor Thompson and a\nBlanket on the third one anyway uh there has never been a Republican governor like round earth that we have now he brought one tool to office a wrecking ball and he's done everything it can to destroy the things in this state you know three years without a budget that's never happened before\nAnd a very damaging to the state line and it's\nIt's also wrong to characterize his power is so immense that he runs the Empire State legislature the state Senate in Illinois as a bully presided over by the state Senate president John ... who was a season than effective power\nTo shake zone wrangle it takes two to tango so the solar wants to do something he American says no then the state you know I own a house early no\nColor to him very much runs his own shop um and ... and it's been the target at the same kind of a lavish we funded a attack ad campaign that bill and Hillary Clinton and I've been getting for Thirty years so there's a lot of misconceptions about him\nOh just reminds me of a story and I just I got to tell your story FDR Franklin Delano Roosevelt sometime around World War two one of his age was complaining that the United states government mini FDR was supporting us some Central American I don't remember the name some\nTerrible dictator who was horrible to his people and the United states government supporting him and he said\nAt the ... the aides said the FDR he's a rat\nAnd FDR said I Know all that but he's our rats so it's okay [noise] and now is that they are saying look the ends justify the means and and I will not saying\nAt the ends justify the means I'm just saying that the ... maybe you could have a discussion with decay about this because he knows a heck of a lot more of a state of Illinois politics than I Do\nBut we had an enemy and you combine times thirty yeah um I ...\nThe other governors name my blank Jim Edgar if they actually campaigning from time to time and speaking out against round or because he's such a danger to our state so\nCompared to compare Madigan Enron or I mean it's it's like comparing of all I don't know somebody who does little shoplifting to somebody who robs banks\nAnd got I got to tell you that the key to this is we all need to stop demanding that politicians be perfect\nWe already to stop demanding the politicians be everything we dream of you know look this is a sausage making process this is a matter of making compromises amongst many conflicting interests\nAnd the result is often something that is not the optimum why is this public policy but it's the thing that gets all the competing factions to say OK and just bumped for so long and George on that note I really got to leave it there because of the time is killing me\nHowever if you're on hold I have time for you next to a justice is served the norm mangled nature of\nThe idea is to win for when\nI never did have you again I think that Donald Trump or bigotry has said bullying is blockbuster I'm not quite aware well on the American people\nFaster than we all get along and we and we get along\nWith trying to work you know\n[noise]

E. I. T. Z. W. A. L. D. you can find Alex ... great reporting at NBC News dot com MSNBC dot com and I see him on TV on MSNBC which means you can do and Alex another crazy we we'd given up trying to rank them things would come back on the norm in Goldman show\nAhead no I'm going to have you back they thrive in math\nWell Alex ah we have rain weeks in Europe this week we have to talk about violence we have to start with the ... to show the case\nAnd I have trouble believing that this was actually happening\nThat appears the highest reaches of the Saudi Government intentionally plotting to assassinate murder brutally one of their own citizens inside their own consulate on foreign soil in Turkey and\nA ... job even went in there he didn't come out at least not alive there's all kinds of evidence and there are lies in different admissions Nikki backtracking\nWell Alex obviously it seems to me that from my perspective we have corruption everywhere the Saudis own Trump and so we use in their pocket\nAnd Alex and you're in Washington and how is this how is this playing in Washington [noise]\nWell this has gotten a tremendous amount of attention and it's really dominated the news and conversation here all week and people are are not ready to tell to let it go I think part of that is because it's a involves the press so you have\nThe press corps which already feels very much a threatened by this administration and the larger\nThan a climate that a trumpet have credit\nAnd then you also have the foreign policy community which new cars show he well he was a an exile\nOr or self self exile but but I just didn't and they are very animated by this and they have a long standing before the tremendous rushing to and thinking that he is too soft and too cozy with these dictators James bike or Saudi Arabia and Russia\nSo I've been actually surprised at how much support has been riding around us and and how unwilling the ministry has been to just kind of do the most basic expectations of of any US President and you know saying this is a is a U.S resident as a journalist to let's get to the bottom of this Trump is to shown no real interest in that no\nEven ... even the lip service to to getting to the to the bottom line is basically just given the entire benefit of the doubt to the Saudis here who have denied it\nAnd it's a fascinating a kind of moment that a\n... you know he he says the Saudis deny it they strongly tonight so therefore\nI have to believe them when a lot of men couldn't says he doesn't enact elections Trump says he says you can either to try that I Believe that\nWhen Brett Kavanaugh says I didn't must anyone or ... or harass anyone in in high school he says he denied it I Believe that when Roy Moore says he didn't do that with teenage girls Donald Trump says I Believe it and yet when rock about says I was I was born in this country Trump doesn't believe it when\nYou know Hillary Clinton says she she didn't use classified information or email he doesn't believe it and and so on and on and so it is just an incredible moment about you know who Trump sees as his people and and he will\nBasically believe even the most obvious lie he will believe it or ticket at face value\nHook line and sinker meanwhile for somebody who doesn't like for whatever reason who often are you know there's certain demographic characteristics that those people often are there's not that you can do to get him to believe that the cold hard fact\nAlan's it's really amazing that an American president is so beholden to foreign interests that are we are seeing this spectacle now and uh Bob Corker the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair retiring senator Republican from Tennessee is nowhere to be ...\nHe's complicit all the Republicans are quiet this is really amazing Lindsey Graham on a week ago said there'll be hell to pay and now he's out there are apologizing it's really shameful and Alex following up on that hung on the heels of that we have Trump last night in Montana\nEncouraging violence and celebrating violence or a sitting Republican congressman the guy named Jim forte beat up a a reporter and Donald Trump\nSaid it was good and encourage it and everybody was cheering Alex To me this is a distraction he's trying to set people uh it's pure tactic but everybody's going forward so Alex it does that a bad example I mean having a guy who claims to be president saying was beat up reporters and\nAnd use violence to advance our political Jenna not not an American thing I mean definitely not an American\nIt's not as it's not a ... a democratic thing I mean it's a it's a\n... of the the basic premise\nOf democracy is that we work our conflicts out through the political process in so that we don't have violence as the entire purpose of this that we don't have a a a a dictator or any kind of autocrat who uses violence to get their way and that we don't have you know a mob rule or\nA street battles between various factions we have a system where peacefully people can make their voices heard and conflicts are worked out so this is ... it's really dangerous stuff\nAnd I think going after yeah reporter you know the the they put it into the first amendment for some reason the very first one and it's a the the this is something that you know at Brigitte Trump is not cross before even though he has said everything else enemies of the people to about ... about\nReporters he has never actually explicitly condemning the violence against our border and that's I I've been to a lot of Trump rallies when they scream at us they yell at us and it's a little scary a knock knock on the line and this you know who knows somebody I don't think he's telling people to do this but somebody who\nIs maybe a little bit off a little bit you know prone to violence for whatever reason that they have their own issues somebody could take that and see the president had saved and see that as a go ahead a green light to to go ahead and do this and um [noise] yeah yeah it's it's not good as you said that to say the least\nDog into our friend Alex sites wall we'd been recapping weeks with Alex science wall virtually since the
