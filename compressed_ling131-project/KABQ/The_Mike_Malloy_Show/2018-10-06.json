{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "Line controversy started by Republican Texas agriculture commissioner said\nMiller and Miller correct claiming falsely that the girl on the poster was supposed to be Kavanaugh's daughter which even if it was and it's not a but even if it was so what it's again free speech even offensive speech needs protection right\nDale Carpenter who is a law professor and First Amendment expert at Southern Methodist university told the Dallas News there is no basis I can see for removing the side it's not up saying that no court would find it to be\nYou can say it's offensive or distasteful but that's protected under the constitution he added that Stanford has the right to have the offensive side and Miller has the right to lie to people on Facebook about what the side actually means [laughter]\nMiller's the politician different too so the woman who actually created the sign\nA Marion Stanford she said according to Newsweek the girl and the painting didn't depict Kevin daughter it was a Washington Post cartoon from earlier or late twenties Seventeen\nFurther she told the publication she had been receiving threatening phone calls since Mr Miller suggested the girl was the daughter of the Supreme Court nominee and then she says quote police told me to remove the sign or they would take it and arrest me so I let them take the ...\nOkay so varied Emily ... yeah the same as misleading halt\nPlease Mr police officer man take the side out of my yard\nIt would've been better if you are you know let herself got a ... so to speak you know get arrested a well I mean it would have been something that would have immediately created a court case yeah to me if she allowed herself to get arrested but\nThe average person just you know I Know you're not going to do it but people don't stand up no they don't and we lose our rights we lose our freedoms we lose our democracy\nUm and not the not the not necessarily a fan of our democracy I I don't know there's only ... yeah um but it only lose your freedom yeah I mean\nI I share your frustration yeah that's why I'm Glad I'm here in New Hampshire where the movement of people that are some of them actually willing to stand up for themselves and others there's no I I think\nI think the metaphor of to wolves and the sheep voting on dinner is a little misleading it's more like you know a a herd of sheep and a smaller heard of wolves deciding what's for dinner and the sheep thinking well\nI'm going to be safe because I'm In the middle of the pack of sheep and so the wolves definitely are outnumbered by the sheep but the sheep aren't the predators\nAnd other news ... dot com reporting vets and I'm sure you've already heard of this story Oh yes\nCalifornia one of the tech capitals of the world a is now going to be illegal\nTo sell the router\nHas a default password on it\nAnd so if you buy a router or it typically is like you know admin Adnan is the user name and ... there's something that I Know\nThere's there's a different variety of different things that are going on nowadays with routers um sometimes they do come free configured with with a unique password and so it's not as bad as it used to be\nBut this was bumped on well but that's how it was yeah right that's what we do every router I've ever purchased it's like admitting admission and then you go in and you change the past why is it all on recently a lot of ... stop\nOkay true and and ... and that is a default password on that\nA lot of bike locks or locks that you would use on a locker come especially the ones where it's like a four digit code ... ... they were they default of like all zeroes\nSome do some don't\nYeah so in this case a story from ... dot com here points out that this new California law\nWould make it illegal to manufacture or sell Internet connected devices that aren't equipped with a unique password or a feature that forces the consumer to set a personal password when the device is first used it will take effect on January first of twenty twenty\nThe range of devices the law covers this incredibly broad it's a a clue includes any device that connects to the Internet directly or indirectly and has an IP address or Bluetooth address that that sounds like a pretty uh that sounds like cell phones every cell phone [laughter]\nWould a would be included under that yeah yeah\nNow the tactic that California is trying to employ could eventually lessen the severity of some of the most destructive cyberattacks on secured routers and Internet of things devices are routinely access and control by hackers who send millions of compromise devices to paying certain servers into overwhelm them this is called the distributed denial of service attack\nThere's no doubt that having a weak passwords on your system at a bad already flaw I agree with that concern however using the government to solve this problem not it's not the right way to do it and you know it's absolutely not the right way to do it\nUm so I mean one of the one of the reasons uh but you you don't want to have a law like this is because there is going\nIt'd be a cost involved in setting a unique passwords with each each device that you know is being shipped threat because normally you're just flashed the same\nCode to every single divine right right right right now interestingly enough I'm there's and there's also a printing cost because now you have to associate a specific graduate this specific you know using your ideas on foot down and I'm ... right so there's usually additional costs now in quantity you might say oh it's only going to add to it but\nThere's a lot of different regulations out there and then all adds up so yeah it and sometimes it just it's easier to just stay in the directions changed the\nPatio [laughter] what what happens let's say it is only a penny per page of whatever what happens\nIf in the uh assembly lines something gets\nOut of order and now everything's water on my head off\nYet Mm that sounds like a nightmare but you don't find out because then what do you do recall\nAre ... are you having somebody has to everything as they are putting out a lot to make sure that the password which was on the ... cost dramatic and you're doing what increases employment costs and why are you trying to keep people from having jobs this route or test\nOr if you're not doing also add that in some cases it like the opinion piece but in other cases if you're looking at a small rather manufacture it might be dollars you know if somebody is mainly go in and then consider each individual router I Know for us it would be dollars a route or are you going to start selling a California now although you're going to jump through this these you know\nI'm not going to say good ... where did you make your life and on out there and I'm not even sure they'd be applicable to us because we're shipping from out of state anyway\nUm but I don't know either all apply that they might but again if\nThey if they would judgment against us it doesn't necessarily it's enforceable and there's all sorts of other things that you know but anyway we might be quite easily do start telling users soup you know set a password I Believe an average then yeah but I don't know if they unless they have to have it it's just directions are required or if it's\nThis says it has to have a unique password in order to be there all the ... the when the ... boots so it's it is more secure than your typical rather at a time back tomorrow

handle maybe walking back in the program\nTom I'm so glad to be back on the program with yeah Hi\nHi it's great to have you with us so uh you know the last time you were out we were talking about ballot images that some of these electronic voting machines actually capture an image of the vote which could be used for an auto just like a paper trail\nAnd apparently one of the groups that is promoting this a ... is being sued odd you know all the u._s._a. or has been traveling with a lawsuit from one of the voting machine companies what's going on and it got what's\nCalled the threat ladder seems to be a deliberate just a bullying society about what they threatened is not to take out at usa to court if they don't take off their Web site the manual that shows election official how these\nBallot images can be saved it's just a choice on the menu many election officials John breaking found as he went across the United states trying to get people to save their ballot images\nThey didn't know it existed they're like well we didn't read the manual and we don't know a lot of county election officials that had not been digitally trained or technically trained so this was part of a citizen education here's the manual here's what we're talking about and yet the masses going no it's our copyright\nBut you can't do anything it's not that cold you can't do anything with Emanuel unless you have the machine right there only the election offer them the machine and he has and that isn't telling their\nTheir counties that these ballot images exist so it seems like a threat oh my God you're trying to make that trans parent you can't use citizens shut up go away no\nWe're going to count the vote and it's down and said to count the votes so I guess the F ... inside\nYeah so we have we have two two issues here one is the millions of people who are being ill legitimately incorrectly inaccurately or perhaps accurate because they were targeted because they were young old or or a or a minority racial minority\nUh who are being thrown off the voting rolls all across the United States Senate effort that has been championed by Donald Trump and Kris Kobach and then at the same time we've got it even if you do end up voting if they if you ... if your name Adam and emerged from the voting laws you may well be voting machine that could be doing anything to your vote\nAnything to your vote and that's the trouble with on transparent digital counting on and fracking counting as we know we've done forever and magic and talked about how some detectable but on the ballot images are a means of audit and interestingly calm because the help America vote act\nHad language about well it has to be audible in case you know for a challenge so ballot if they just were sorted included and talked about the vendors as well we have a picture of every ballot we scam so you could look at those and now they're hiding them\n... also I Want to caution people the Republicans are trying to go oh ballot images great now that you want those let's make those the only audit mechanism let's never go to paper ballots and that's not cool because you could duplicate messed with ballot images digitally and if you never connected them to their papers stores\nBy some sort of percentage less connected seeing all these ballot images are really from their stores that would be a percentage audit for ... uh do both you can't just do it by device\nVeteran legislator then went ... and then the ... and then in the third issue is uh to you know how vulnerable are our election systems and this would include are voting registration rolls\nTo hacking and we know that or at least according to the FBI that the Russians have hacked into the into the voting systems and the a registration rolls of a you know ... states now and yet uh enter and according to Trump the Chinese and done the same thing\nAnd yet there's some evidence that other countries as well have a Iran's specifically you\nPenetrated and North Korea penetrated our voting systems\nUm yeah so what's being done about all these things made me get\nA well to federal legislation failed because really our elected officials are scared to tell election off this what to do our elected officials so\nHere's my solution or and what I'm trying to message we each of us voters we have to protect our own though so here's what I'm telling people to do go to your secretary of state sector registration in your registration check\nIf you're not if it's not right if anything's wrong or if you're not there called the number there or go down\nTo your office and makes you register don't depend on somebody canvassing you got to go down to the office and want to do it online soon because later they're going to go oh you weren't on the roads cause you registered to lately were backlog number two\nIf your registration shows that your vote by mail voter make sure that you get that vote by mail\nBallot and either vote it and send it in early so it's been election night return because anything coming into near to the election I Will be processed and will be an election night returns\nYou need to both about or\nYou prefer to go to the polls you got to bring that ballot in and surrender on voting\nOr they won't give you a ballot because they'll assume you used it and you're voting twice\nDaniel do traditional don't get in the provisional batch it's banned in every state right and you need to be in the regular ballot that she got a check your registration no your vote by mail status take care of either getting the damn ballot\nNo I didn't get it and I want to oh no they'll leave camp ... traditional you gotta make sure that you tell the office I haven't got my ballot and they want it\nYou often need screen shot of your registration and maybe print it out and take it to the polls because they might tell you well you're not here and you can say yeah well I was here this is not my fault

hour\nVerity an address in Illinois have already thanks for calling what's on your mind\nIf I wanted to talk about the math and science being waged by the left and my guess as to why they're doing it\nBecause we know that the right drink like clients climate scientists threatened that drug pipeline that drug being money and evolution threatens the authoritarian control through religion but why dismiss and disparage they encounter federal physical evidence that\nThen you're trying to get the new physiological and genetic determinants of human personality behavior and my guess is that\nAnd I approached social protect 'cause I'm a ... minority ... often abused because of it because they cannot change being black Semitic female gay et cetera but not the true cause of the days\nThe obese is caused by human base that occur in every human group exception just is counting found in every group so is parasitic incorrect PCs critics in humans who had actually and deliberately harm other people\nFor personal and private game now the crux of the argument is that racism is not caused by race it is caused by predators using race at a rational my station for their protection\nAnd the ironic thing is race is not linked to any specific characteristic behavior but predatory behavior does have specific physiological impossibly genetic determinant another with creditors are in effect projecting the biologically to kind of behavior onto his\nRace or gender does not determine and anti social behavior and my conclusion is\nDon't be afraid of physical truth if you are indeed a partner and protect and not have gotten into the truth of the biological basically their behavior can only help you\nOK dirty you you make a compelling argument of I Believe um and probably one that deserves more than four minutes on the radio [laughter] and\nAnd so you know we'll have to circle back to it at some point in the future but thank you thank you for raising that I'm Mark in San Diego California a mark what's up\nA child I got a you know wondering why would it cost quite get in these situations where an officer candidate Kavanaugh's they shut down our throw it against their will people are often are\nBecause the Koch brothers want him\nWell it's I think it's more a structural than that I think it's because the United states government\nIs the way it is not all of a majority of the people that start with the U.S shut it sure or yeah true senators from California represented almost forty million people\nAnd yet not on it with less than a million people get through senators Iowa this ordinary people gets two senators that's why you have Chuck Grassley and Mitch McConnell\nAlways happy that the way against people these guys keep getting reelected and at the end they achieve seniority and you've got a Congress which is supposed to be more representative yeah at ... jury matter so much that it does not and then you've got a guy sitting in the White House who lost three million votes\nSo that the United states government on it that's why we get candidates and policies shut down our throats obscenely that much of the country a lot\nYeah and most of the things that you've described originate in the debate over slavery they they are parts of the compromise and there were a series of them to Connecticut Compromise is probably the most famous one um that\nThat basically wanted to keep now in the textbooks you know great particularly the ones that you read in the northern schools and so it was always about Delaware Rhode Island the small states but in fact the population in Georgia was about the same as as one of those states I I forget which one at the time of the of the\nHow the writing of the constitution the white population in Georgia but the you know the black population Georgia was substantial and and so really the two senators per state\nAnd we you know was was based on on giving the slave states extra power as well as the small states up north and that you know that needs to be stripped out of the constitution or we need to come to a better understanding of that number one\nAnd then number two the electoral college was you know there for the exact same reason to give the small states slave states you know a large say so you know yeah spot on mark thanks for the call Tony in Huntsville, Alabama a Tony what's up\nHey Tom how're you doing today good a good a less than manned a I call the talk about Joe Manchin is that his name ... I don't\nAgree with the caller before me\nJoe Manchin is not a Democrat if you're a Democrat you believe and the Democrats you believe that they're going to elect you if you're going to stand by you that they're going to fight for you get out and knock on doors for you and then you get up there and use use state would stand with the Republicans\nOn the biggest issue of our time\nTo to to to overturn everything that the game they're Democrats and the progressive have fought for because you're afraid that they won't stand with you in a Republican state would then you shouldn't have your seat you can either use and with those people or you don't\nWell and that was my point is is the electorate knows that and and I just I I think the age\nOr on frankly on both sides you know the Republican side if you're not a full blown racist anti Semite white supremacy person the Republican Party doesn't why any more than on the manic side if you're not actually a progressive and concerned about bringing America back to the values the Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson males than you know you can't be a Democrat\nAnd perhaps that's a good thing Tony thank you for the call\n[noise]

democratic Senator Joe Manchin has decided to vote yes\nBeing able to a fault those bombs without offering more and more interest rates\nWhich will have the devastating effects that you described so I think people should keep that in their mind that it's not only the tax cuts that the that is crazy administration rammed through but it wasn't an appropriate thing to do but it's the combination of that with their disastrous foreign policy maneuvers\nThat may be a one two punch a that'll knock out the American economy and we will be talking about\nThat for a long time but I mean I suppose let's suppose one last one ... let's suppose that that doesn't\nThat somehow the federal government of the United states will be able to borrow their shipments amount of money that it has to because it has its own taxes\nMostly on corporations and the rich what's me what these people need to understand is that the only way the government can pull this off especially of Russia China and so on the fact\nIs by borrowing from corporations in the rich inside the United states so here's the irony and if you understand this understand so called high finance\nThe government cuts taxes on corporations in the rich and then turns around\nAnd instead of taxing them borrows the same money from them having to pay the interest every year for a bunch of years and then returning the money to them that's my corporations in the rich like this time to maneuver\nBecause they save on taxes and basically substitute a profitable interest bearing loans to the government for the money they used to have to the government and paying taxes is just to pay them dish ... to them\nAnd and all the rest of us pay the interest\nAbsolutely and and have to come up with the money to pay them back you know as those bombs mature that they have in their hands that's why they go for this kind of\nNow the ... the other point that the to the Stockman made was that if interest rates were just to go up a point to point and a half\nThat the interest on a national data twenty Twenty one twenty two trillion would exceed what we're spending on the Pentagon right now which I think is six hundred and change a billion dollars\nAnd that when that happens I mean that'll be a a psychological threshold of nothing else\nI'm ... and by the way that's more than we spend on all our domestic programs are are discretionary disgust domestic programs combined by ... by an order of magnitude\nAnd uh that that when that happens or there will be such a hue and cry about the sustainability of the debt in the United states I mean the Peterson on steroids although he passed away\nUm that that the people will demand that the Republicans prevail in destroying and Social Security Medicare Medicaid food stamps the long term unemployment insurance all these other circles social programs I\nWould say that they maintain a democracy the society functioning society but that ah people will demand that these programs be replaced or done away with because people don't want to be settled over this enormous that now that's been the Republican talking points since Nineteen sixty\nBut you know they're still they're still doing that dance and and I think what he's doing his prevailing Paul Ryan's strategy after the election so what do you think\nYeah no I think that's correct I think that's the logical thing for them to to have to do\nNow that the pretense that they care about the deficit is exploded by their role in decision [noise]\nI think that's what we can expect I think one more dimension that perhaps stocked with didn't talk about is that because of the crash of capitalism back in two thousand and eight of the decision that the Federal Reserve to drop interest rates virtually zero ten years sense\nEvery corporation that wanted some free money to borrow try something if I were to borrow money\nEvery third world government that needed the money to survive has borrowed at these low interest rates\nAnd they now have to pay the rising in the interest rates as the Federal Reserve jacks up the interest rates that puts ... like Argentina turkey Indonesia and the whole bunch of others in an impossible situation they tend not carry an service the debt that they have accumulated\nAnd the result is those countries are plunging into the kind of mess you could see already turkey and other countries and that too will play its role in disrupting global arrangements and so forth to pretend that this was all under control of Mr Trump and his environment\nIs so silly that it's kind of hard to take seriously but they're trying to lead to act as though they're in charge of all of this and let the economy is healthy\nWe have a debt written economy that is less sustainable and more fragile
