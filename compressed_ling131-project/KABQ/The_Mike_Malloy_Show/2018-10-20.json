I don't have that they think there's no way in and\nThen I've been I've been in plenty of libertarian meetings and I can easily tell you how many women there are those are those that were around her city I was\nJust like for now they've got like teachers that crowd scenes when they when they're not sitting you're able to individually counts every individual when it's actually a fifty fifty I received in the way more women will I didn't say\nEarlier him for the reference I didn't say that there was an equal amount of wind now as there is to men either where anybody so that\nYeah and also like did they also do another thing where if they record meetings in which women and men participate in equal amounts of time in terms of minutes been talking and it's fifty fifty men versus the conversation is being dominated by winning ... so there is a well documented\nCognitive biases common among men that a lot to psychological experiments on it were men think that women are participating more and present more than we actually are I Love those yeah some of the we need more where\nLove to see some of the cross tabs\nOn him and sort of the demographics of are we talking about conservative Christian men right when they hear a woman speak it oh she is dominating the Congress\nShould she needs to just sit down and shut up and be saying a good question what's the view\nThat was probably the probably the most psychology research is a vast amount of the sample samples are\nYou know college undergraduates needed extra credit or quick twenty bucks college boy he actually being in the methodology sections of low cycle psychology razors where\nDo they get their research subject they put an ad up on campus though right a lot of what we think it's human nature to what you know upper middle class American college students can eat a box how they\nWhite college boys are going to go and party you know and spend all their twenty dollars a liquor that\nNight yeah and I'm trying to imagine this we need a bunch of college boys to come in and see a bunch of women and tell us what you think yeah yeah\nIt seems still interesting nonetheless them I'm not denying the the result but I I I Do agree you know at least partially that young girls do need to see\nFemale role models you have a politician is not a role model ... politician and he shouldn't be a role model but a lot of people see it as they do and it's wrong which is why I always corrects whenever the media is like\nThese are leaders politicians are leaders no they're not they're going to the earth\nTo AT T almost all of them are dishonest and they are trying to rule over the lives of other people and so you know most people should be embarrassed to be seen with politician gang colors are serving in\nMy mind when you're running for E N\nO I won't take the ... oh I Can't I Can't actually take the office if I actually win so go ahead and call me out to\nOh\nYou know I'm not ...\nYeah no I I don't think it's uh I I've done my time I I've I've gone and you actually were on his on a been a select man I I still do some service type of stuff for my town but just running for public office but not not my cup\nOf tea look you can get some there are exceptions right Ron Paul's and exception array Darryl Perry's an exception if you actually have a principled libertarian for like Darrell who's running for office\nAnd then they want to get in there and they want to dismantle the ... I'm much more excited about reading the New York marathon raising money for the Innocence Project people ask me how's your campaign going and I look at them I say I don't do anything I'll you know show up if somebody invites me to come somewhere but I'm not going to go out and\nActually put any effort into this because I Can't imagine why anyone would spend money on the political process and how they just throw money down the whole way\nAnd you just wait until I get my past that up and start doing uncoordinated expenses on behalf of candidates I might elect something just to annoy you\nYeah well you know like I said I'm not going to take the office because I Can't swear an oath to the state\nI'm Sorry swearing an oath means something to me and I I'm not going to swear allegiance to the United states government and I would have a tough time short swearing allegiance to the state government to I don't know I'm anti state\nSo if they were to elect me the only way I could actually take the office is if they let me swear an oath to liberty that everything I Do would be in favor of liberty and not the states I mean how could I possibly swear an oath of how can any libertarian to it I mean I understand people have to kind of you know compromise themselves in order to take political office but for me\nI'm not willing to and I'm not going to like cross my fingers and do it that way\nI look forward to court case then because that would be an interesting precedent for you to that one way or the other\nI don't think you could I don't think you could win that case the state has its oath and it likely is on modify all I mean I don't think that there's going to be an I I think they will allow you to change the word swear to offer\nYeah but even that I'm not going to ferment oath of allegiance to the United states it would be distasteful to do it to just the state government but even then while I literally had\nTo it that you would uphold the ... yeah protected defend the constitution and if you want to abolish one of those documents that and you're not really protecting and defending that document\nAnyone Quakers get elected because I knew or a girl and I are at what happened the Lakers get elected\nUh I don't think they run for office but ah right here you go I I Do solemnly swear this is the text I'm not actually swearing\nOr that I Will be her faith and true allegiance to the state of Ericka and the state of New Hampshire now they added a United States it wasn't in the original right oath of office or an will support the constitution there are so help\nOkay God All right yeah I I Am I Am wrong I did not think it's that allegiance to the state it\nDoes now you know yeah I only wear that does no okay I guess there with me then she's going to have you\nOn the rise elected and seeing what happened\nIt would be I agree with you I'll take it to court yeah it would be very interesting very interesting I I don't know if we can find an attorney who would like take it to court for us but that will be fun I think you have one who is a co host\nWe do have an you'd have to do courtroom right she doesn't do courtroom you talking about Laurel Scott or new Sunday night now I think he's talking about Melanie who is also not an attorney but she has\nRead Laurel is an attorney Laurel actually is an attorney and bar accepted or whatever and and just I think you'll find someone yeah we're out of time tonight well it's easier said than done a lot of these attorneys don't want to take on the state by the way the oh you wouldn't have to cross that bridge when we come to which we probably won't because we're libertarian candidates in Keene New Hampshire\nBut thanks for the call tonight Jackie we'll talk to you later see tomorrow for talk

before the our\n... near where the Carla in Greenville North Carolina and Carl what's on your mind that it\n... this is spot on to me um as a very young child my grandfather who was born in the eighties nineties\nSat me down and told me that he was nine hundred percent Cherokee Indian but his parents were some afraid of that that they put on his birth certificate because he was born at home that he was white because they have a better life be why\nEntire life he was treated as a white person he said I'm not ... and ... the Cherokee I'm scared to death to be Cherokee because of ... of white people what they have a young kid and that just stuck with me for ever but it has given me a\nMore empathy is giving them a boyfriend and I ... to see the fear and my grandfather than I'd ever seen or an understanding as to when I look at it and I I\nDoubt her mother said one bit because it you have people don't know their history and and you say that all the time you were a great historian if people understood history better they might understand today that yeah\nYeah and then and and Elizabeth Warren was ... she was in a situation where it was kind of damned if you do and damned if you don't on the one hand exactly know what I mean to Trump and the Republicans were trying to claim\nSomething that absolutely was not true and that is that they were saying that she got some sort of benefit out of out of saying that she had sort of an American ancestry and she got no benefit anywhere in her career from at a under any circumstances in any way shape or form period end of discussion\nBut then you know in order to to re bought the the the whole Pocahontas thing obviously she's going to be running for president you know she did this genetic test and that it would that she stepped into this incredible conflict to conflict as maybe the wrong word but a debate is probably the more appropriate word\nThat's happening in Native American communities right now because the whole you know it ... it since since Native American communities have been acknowledged as ... as a separate nations and some of them have gotten very wealthy or as a result of the you know legalized gambling and things\nOn their their each try you know in order to say okay you're a member of the tribe or you are not\nUm it it that it's been a very very difficult and challenging thing for the tribes over the years to to to to know who should be and you know rightly should be shouldn't be part of the tribe\nAnd and of course there's no genetic marker for any particular tribe there's just so genetic marker for a yeah you were you know some some of your ancestors were among those people who came across the land bridge from from Russia you know twelve or twenty two thousand years ago\nAnd that's that's pretty much it and so but but now you've got this you know people who have been denied tribal membership who are trying to say oh well here I can do a genetic test and show that I've got you know a certain percentage of\nOf ... and you know native ancestry and then uh you know other people of the ... there are probably some people who are members of tribes who are\nWho have less native ancestry than there are people who've been rejected by tribes and vice versa that's just it you know it's been all over the map for years and years and years because it's been more like you know\nI you know I I not being native America yeah I Know several people who are um but it's you know it's just it's just a huge issue in the Native American community and they've and they've all just been going you know genetic tests are not the way we're going to do this we never have we're not going to\nAnd so then when Elizabeth Warren gets this genetic test she was not applying for tribal membership she's not pretending that she's a member of a tribe she's not even identified a particular while you she says the story that her mother told her\nBut um [noise] you know it's like I I Am confident\nAs flash hopeful that this will blow over the the Native American blowback against her using a genetic test um but I doubt it and I think the the Republicans are going to continue to use as against her I I I don't\nKnow how to respond to it\nSo anyhow will see a ... thanks a lot for the call\nOh that was that was Carl is somehow I think your caller for that call somehow I I ended up with cliff cliff I'm Sorry I just hung up on you a call us back Marta in big bear California a Marta what's on your mind\nWell I'm worried that Trump is going to win reelection and I'm thinking that Democrats have learned little cannot thing since ah twenty sixteen I'm tapping learn alas fans Michael Moore\nCorrectly predicted that Trump would win next twenty sixteen election um and I think we should listen to\nWhat he's telling us the letter on common sense should tell us a chance that we have um that the Democratic party basically they trained the working class and in terms of good paying manufacturing jobs\nAnd so many\nPeople just heard what Trump was saying about jobs than about economic crowd and about manufacturing and we the Democrats\nBasically have embraced Wall Street we we we talk about the stock market is being that driver of economics house and a Trump\nIs Marta that would have been true that would have been true during the Clinton Administration and and part of that was true during the Obama administration but the Democratic party has very much changed their tune\nOr the largest caucus in the Democratic party right now is the progressive caucus the if you're going to be a member of the progressive caucus and you do not take pac money corporate pac money\nThey they are the funding themselves with small donations they've said ah that Wall Street can take a leap\nYeah there was a day when Jamie diamond and Bill Clinton were best buds a and probably still are but that that Bill Clinton part of the Democratic party is fading really really rapidly and I think the Democrats have learned a lot of lessons smarter respectfully\nAre actually listening to KPFK um and and and I think that we're going to see the result of those lessons in the election although you know the thing that scares me is you know like I said yesterday Greg palace said\nYou know fourteen million people have been removed from the voting rolls in the last year by Republicans and they're going to use that that voter suppression these all these voter suppression efforts they've got that you've got the the mail in ballots being rejected\nBecause you have a limit on minority area and they say a signature does want right to me well throw that away forty percent of the state of Georgia\nYou know born to balance the you know kicked out rejected absentee ballots are happening in our county which is twelve percent of the state's population\nReally I mean you know yeah bring while he's got a large African American community there so of course I mean this is these are the things that concern me not the Democratic party's message you were doing a damn good job messaging\nYou're listening to talk\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to

during a roundtable event in Arizona President Trump was asked how his administration will address the situation\nOr the ... study this is a study that they did actually in September and Bloomberg just finally got a hold of a copy of it they found that by two to one sixty one percent of thirty percent of Americans say that the tax law benefited large corporations ran rich Americans over middle class families\nAnd that they're on the safe as Americans worry the tax law will lead to cuts in Social Security and Medicare concluding that most voters believe that the GOP wants to cut back on these programs in order to provide tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy\nYeah so they're figuring it out that I think is a good thing so and then our chat room or Nigel just sent me an a great

or ... thank you very much for that so uh and\nTo continue the conversation brat and Logan ville Georgia a bread what's on your mind that it\n[noise]\n... you're on the air we're live well\nOK Brad you've got to turn down or turn off your TV you got to listen to your phone Vic in Tustin Michigan or brands on line too by the way she or if you want to check in with a victory in Tustin Michigan you're on the air\nI had a town I'm I'm a Caucasian male I live in blue collar worker of it I I listen to you a lot and I think the question it\nNeeds to be asked if there is total is yet I'm Still ... ... or ...\nWith ... with all these main thing shit\nWhite ... ... ... what would happen and what do you think it would be like I got re shifts that will truly first edited and minority why\nWe're in the case of a black center\nRight this is how how how do you\nThink ah you know hypothetical but oh you oh you do you think would be\nThis has been ... here here question is basically the sales pitch that racist whites have been making for hundreds of years is\nYou know you've got a white people have to keep black people down and Hispanics and Asians and and you know fill in the blank or men have to keep women down because if they ever get power they're going to seek revenge and they're going to extract their pound of flesh from us\nAnd I'm not buying it I Am just out by it I and and ah although there\nAre some people would be very justified being upset\nA but I I you know I said\nThis earlier and I'll say it again I think it's a really really important point we know\nAs people get richer and richer in terms of money\nThey get less and less empathetic right there's all kinds of good social sciences and psychological studies on this to the point that when somebody like Trump is born rich\nAnd maintained their riches throughout their lives they lose the ability to even experience empathy to imagine what it must be like to be an immigrant child turn from their parents I mean literally can't do that he can't imagine how somebody else feels\nUm I Would submit to you that whiteness is a form of wealth the same way and that society is organized around that\nThat this the that our our culture our so called civilization has that has been one of the organizing principle of it for four hundred years on this continent\nAs a consequence of that\nYou've got white people who are like either a don't care be don't know or see are just at you know not only in different but hostile\nTo people of color or any any other kind of otherness\nYou know you can say you know male illness is a form of wealth you could say straighten this is a you know as a as opposed to to el ... is a form of wealth that all of these that's why that's why we call these things privilege they're strict ... male privilege there's white privilege\nThough the the the the way to think of it is not\nOf color or a you know the gender minorities or a women are given power that\nPeople like me white men are going to lose power the way to think of it is that we're all going to have power together\nRight we're going to bring up everybody's wealth\nAnd it doesn't it doesn't require somebody to be you know crushed or put down or you know what a victim position we don't\nTo organize our society that way yes it's been organized by waiting for four hundred years\nBut I Would I Would argue that the process but Lyndon Johnson began the process that tried to start after reconstruction but wasn't born in within six or eight years\nProcess is not one of of tearing down the ... the position of white people
