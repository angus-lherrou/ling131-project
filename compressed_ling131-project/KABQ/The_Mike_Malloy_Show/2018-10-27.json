still yeah though that still okay now what is the only way for me to keep power is to manipulate the rules\nTo redraw the lines to allow for ... unlimited secret money to win Congress to win the presidency without a majority what what if I knew that no no and again as long as the other side is a little bit of it too you'd definitely get to be still one of the side okay\nNow here's a big one\nBut what if I get help from somebody who\nLike chamber commerce NRA\nNo no no like like a big advocate well the n._r._a. and we've had unprecedented frequency of horrific gun violence sure you can still no no I I don't mean them\nYou mean the people who want to erode the middle class and get it may have more gaping wealth disparities you're worried that about ... that's that's a tradition in this country no no I don't mean them well who do you still want to decide what if that's our biggest\nInternational ... what if I get out from that and it may be in cahoots with the murders dictator no it turns out you still get to be one of the sites\nI'm Sorry they're tainted notion there will never be a political system there in every media doesn't allow\nTheir institutions every voter is it going to allow such an absurd hypothetical\nAll the negative vote tomorrow and dot com\nFrom Los Angeles California what's up Donald\nBe the president that states no okay go ahead\nNo as a matter of fact the apartment building I live in hardly anybody here will call me by my first name because\nThat Syria's people call me by my nickname ah well I've got like about thirty different ... people ... what's your what's your what's your middle\nName a well my my stage name is Dr ... the a K that's the most common on\nOur ah [laughter] All right Dr ahead\nAny rate okay so\nHere's the thing you mentioned a little while ago democracy versus not democracy I'd like to introduce something a little more extreme than that demographers democracy versus the opposite of democracy because not isn't the opposite and involved\nIn the absence senator what's that yeah you're right it's not as just the absence that's fair\nExactly and in voting will have the same thing going on when people have a negative votes in tension in other words one day one to vote against a specific candidate they're basically given the choice or catch the positive vote or casting on non vote yeah\nAnd we should be allowing them casting negative vote if they have a negative voting tension there have been people who are writing in things like against Hillary Clinton or not\nDonald Trump Nate how would a negative ... helped me helped me a duck how would a negative vote work I see on my ballot and I just click know what happens in\nUm well it's not exactly know what the you know you didn't have for example instead of just having Donald Trump the belly you would have for Donald Trump on the ballot and against Donald Trump on the ballot and again you would choose one just like you do now so if you choose against a candidate\nImmune system we have no you would give up your option to choose to vote for a candidate you'd only get one or the other unless we change the system\nBut no that's a dollar it's helpful or I should say doc the uh I'll turn voting systems although right now where I Want to harness attention is on the next nine days including what is happening to the six uh the uh what is
