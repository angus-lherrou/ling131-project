{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "Some awesome and it's exciting and they're coming along about hip hop or rock and roll anything that you think of like snakes come along and idiots they'll come on look\nAgain here we are I've been buying crypto every month this year that was the one promise I made the myself in the beginning of January because looking back at twenty Seventeen I was like are you know what you should have done dark last average\nAnd bought every month for doing that this year no matter what I've done that every month this year and every time it's gone down a hard hard to do it right but that's good that's the dedication that it takes so it's just like a we're here for the long run you're still hear your rock I I'm going to say I'm ... I have the same job that you have to say my bag\nUm you know the the people that are in this for the right reasons\nWill just stay with the right reasons or Nathan and I were talking about this Nathan who are in our putting together the integrity show which would talk about their art look at look at the crypt those base there are escape pods that are being built faster than they can regulate ... and ... so no matter what it's just like boom you hide it you know I Love the the mean about fifty cent rapper where it's like\nA you know he he's being taken to court and they're saying oh it was all this money and then all of a sudden he's like a ... you had like a ... and then all of a sudden they changed it to him and ...\nWhat about you [laughter] uh\nI don't know there's there's just a lot [noise]\nThere's a lot of like people that will come along and try to jump the new for whatever and we\nWe were having this conversation last night yet but it is it's the government plays whack a mole you know as soon as you start to figure out\nA way to get around what they do then they'll take another swing but crypto it's been interesting because it's so far outside our traditional systems it's so far outside of banking it's so far outside of government\nIsn't it like traditional just strip rebellion it's just done digitally now where you know the rents are moving into one town so everybody just kind of like ducks and moves into another town and like hides out in the village here for a little while just avoids the time but events\nWe'd like to go and they find them so instead of like ... like it's just the same principle of people just say enough already it is time to put you so far ahead of them I mean they just can't get up there that can do up the what's different to me about this is it's not just being rebellion with your free speech is rebellious with money\nAnd that is generally I mean I hate to say the makes the world go round but to some degree it certainly does All right because they've always had control of it and they're losing that very quickly\nAnd see these conferences we went to a ... I ... I Will say like this I've been to a different conferences and not to take anything away from all or summer non or whatever it\nBe a big critic but uh when you have an event where you charge three thousand dollars at the door like come right what's going to happen from there are other unless you're like actually gone for like like some certified training that's a different thing but like I have like a conference and it's like hey here's our new I see our our new whatever it's like [noise]\nSo Nathan and I are Nathan's ... more way more conferences and I'd been a cause that's just part of what he does is here to guide to but um he's seen so many gaps in all these conferences and said let's put together our own Joe and we call it a ... it's now called the integrity show\nOn called ... Scott something else but um it was just kind of something like that they were lining together but um it was the ... the show and the reason we call it that was one because it was just a one time event\nBut the other part of it too is like lowering the bar\nAnd not having these high expectations of like we're the new blocked chain global universe so we have no don't Saturn there's none of that it's just like All right this is what it is when the door it's free we even provide coffee Danish is with Peter we buy sandwiches and launched it for people to 'cause it's a long day\nAnd we have security guys come do talks we have this segment where it's like thank you for your service right so we're we'll have a for instance somebody that's been through something like man if if uh the day raw celebrate gets out\nWe got her hand we would feature him on like that type of segment where he was talking about the fall that he had to take for you know kind of what went on a matter of fact we had his ah his mom when I got in on one of our shows a and it's not it it's not a show where you can go to on a website and watch it like like anything like that it's worth touring\nI had a concert teacher toward T shirt I have no business haven't [laughter] like I had like on the back of our T shirt it says where we've been we've been to Baltimore Denver Vegas um we're going to San Diego next we'll let you start as a first woman in April\nOh recently yeah okay yeah\nSo you've been all these different uh places so I I guess I kind of miss understood what this was I thought you were putting a show on at other conferences where you're actually doing kind of like your own conference it's uh what did they call it it was like ... like some freaks I'd show uh-huh like\nThings that happened to sort of ... in the same area as an existing for instance a great example is a DEF CON\n... also hacker karma yes yeah which is in Vegas will because I wasn't values yeah whew thousands of tend to ... yes so like you just get lost in the crowd of ... you meet somebody cool people and the people that are doing like\nAnyway um but so you didn't on whether that yet Nathan was already going out there for his company to be part of DEF CON and do what they run the ... village a\nAnd then I so anyway that they were already part of that so while we were while he was out there he's like there's so many people in the cup this makes it already out here that are going to be at DEF CON right what's coordinate and we did a side show actually that was one of the more fun ones because we we rented this mansion really and we had it at the mansion we had it like in the living it was very intimate ... they had and make a little over fifty people there\nUm so what do you do do you go to the the actual a conference and fly or how do you get people to show up at ...\nHow do they know that you're things happening we promoted damn we invite them and that's pretty much it like we have like a website up your speakers and then they tell their people so that kind of things like\nThey're trying to think like I said I'm Sorry for them it seemed like I don't really know but I don't really know handle those of that but yes I don't want to play like so\nNascent has a lot of connections if you look if you go to integrity dot show or integrity show dot com either way I'll take you to our website it says we made it as small as possible so that you don't have to click through too much it's not a bunch of stuff it just has a list of our speakers there and\nMe still somebody that kind of comes in like look I'm the type of guy I don't I don't follow sports but if I showed up to an eagles game I cheer or or whatever um but I couldn't name any of the players sure I feel like that kind of in the ... space too because I don't know how big of a deal certain so and so's name it's like oh he's going to be there and like who\nWho's at and I don't mean to sound like a jerk but it's just like I don't know that way and then I\nYou know I kind of get excited but it's just that I don't know um you get to see like all these uh\nUh I'm Sorry I lost my train of thought oh you know you put on these shows put on the other people's Nathan has connections with all these different people and before you know what he's like yo he's like so he goes he says we've got fluffy pony for Vegas and I go to ... grams narrow yeah hard but I just said what did you just said to me\nAnd he's like fluffy pony I was like as an adult it was like yeah it's like he wants me to call it gets people to call them and it's like yeah we met him he's ... really cool they came out\nLike a it gave is a little ... at the at our at our integrity showed just happened to be ... you know I was out there and we hung out within the next night at a ... like some bar playing like dark and stuff\nIt was always a different crew of people in the show basic ... corps but there's other people you bring yeah and then um\nSwear to say this but like and I'm the headline and comic but there's times where like I won't I won't be the headline so we were going to go to a shout out to a military shell\nUm she's a junior

fun it's a it's a fundraiser and we're going to have a we're gonna have a great time I'm really looking forward to it\nSo uh what what's the latest on the on the vast ballot purge that the Republican Party is doing across the country on everybody's been looking at Georgia in part in large part because of your reporting you know half a million or more uh people purged off the vote by Brian Kemp who is now running for governor he's the secretary of state but Indiana\nYeah well first of all I Want to say thank you because it was on the heartland program that we announced that we uh through a lawsuit I was able to put up the names of all half million people purge by Brian Kemp secretary of state who not coincidentally is also running for governor [noise]\nUm I should say yesterday alone several thousand people went to our site over a hundred thousand people went to our website or tens of thousands re registered finding themselves purged we got thank you notes from Nineteen hundred people yesterday were all leaving their vote and uh calls are being made so it was thousands\nFrom this effort well the and it got a huge splash nationwide or again thanks for kicking this off the N. double ACP so\nThe government Jesse Jackson flew down I mean it was big but you know I got a call from the attorneys this morning fifty three thousand names were held up and not added that people were re registered registered held up not added to the\nVoter rolls a new fight they're just saying ah you know our day you're talking about just which Georgia the one that's not an America I guess because you know in America you're supposed to be able to vote\nRight so so Brian Kemp he's still secretary's day even though he's running for governor he's keeping fifty three thousand people in Georgia who just registered to vote from voting in this election because what they they don't have ...\nThey say they have to confirm their addresses et cetera see that's why I tell people register online they will confirm you immediately those who didn't listen to what Tom and what to paper registration forms\nOr it's going to be a battle now but we did registered tens of thousands literally yesterday because of this campaign but with the national coverage of that Georgia effort or what has not come out in the news yet um is is just another uh four hundred\nThousand four hundred sixty nine thousand voters purged in Indiana [noise] they just gave it that list we just put it up on Greg palace dot com unfortunately there are re registration deadline passed\nLast night some people got the news at the last minute but here's the deal\nAre are um computer experts went through the list and said wait a minute we have twenty eight thousand people here that the state mark\nAs having been removed by a our friend Kris Kobach interstate cross check\nThe problem is that it Indiana unlike Georgia in Indiana\nThey have a federal court order\nThe N. double ACP league of women voters got a federal court order that Indiana could not use the cross checklist to remove voters\nAnd they were twenty eight thousand and that's supposedly these are people moved out of state so we actually checked a with the post office special contract with the post office\nAnd with a two hundred private databases we can confirm that at least twenty thousand of those people who are removed in violation of a federal court order at least twenty thousand and we have each of their names um\nRemoved in violation of law and that they are still living at their registration dresses in Indiana they've been given no noticed that their purged please people I'm\nA show up at the polls bring ID and we're just gonna have to fight this one out there will be speaking to the lord as soon as I get off the phone\nBut they will be given from provisional ballots that won't be countered\n[noise] uh it's the only thing you can do is fill out a provisional ballot do it but ah we're going to have to fight to get them counted 'cause they are there\nDefinitely will not be counted unless we can get another court order saying this violation of a court order um will not stand\nThe oil companies\nShould we be putting people in jail\nShould we be hitting them with huge fines I mean people are ... are dying right now people have been dying for decades now but it's really becoming obvious\nThat the behavior of the fossil fuel companies is leading to the death of human beings the damage to democracies around the world\nUm and and you know to the potential destruction of of worldwide civilization what we'd do Steve in Evanston, Illinois state what he was like\nWell you know I wanted to comment on the the oil companies are identical where they do is to nationalize them and that way we could do you live in Iran and um you know how they do business as well we can also promote a more environmentally friendly ways of getting energy um what do you think\nI think that uh it's something worth considering and you know Norway did it to Venezuela did it or that didn't work out so well uh you know but Russia is already nationalize but the you know ... they're functionally national companies\nI think though that a middle ground is to do what uh Alaska did which is to say you know that a lot of your profit out of the ground it really belongs to us and so when you pump that oil you know you can lay claim to the to the to the rigs into the drilling operation and to the\nLand around and all that kind of stuff but when you pump that are well you've got to pay a tax to us on every single barrel and then that tax goes into the Alaska permanent fund that produces a a track of anywhere from a thousand to the year that Sarah Palin was running for vice president he was over four thousand dollars per Alaskan citizen per year you know man woman child everybody\nUm and ah you know distribute some of that money back so it functions as a as a very small but very effective carbon tax in Alaska so that that's kind of a mental drought although I think that we should establish at much higher but yeah yeah good ideas and do\nThose promote you know people getting on that sugar on getting that little check I I think we're looking to the value that fossil fuel is losing your\nUh you know bring up the value of a you know environmentally friendly so it was\nDown in ... and the way it is that is where the carbon tax and Exxon Mobil is supporting that by the forty dollars a carbon tax is not going to move the needle very much it's going to start the process of preparing for the big companies and and it's going to make renewables much much more attractive Steve thanks for the call a maverick in Edmonds, Washington a maverick what's up\nMore than ... ... a couple of things real quick is it wrong to refer to that orange chocolate I as a pointed rather than elected uh also why does that the our sound like he's British\nAnd my other thing I wanted to share with the I think we need a doomsday clock for climate change to bring recognition to the urgency of this problem\nOh that's a good idea of the the uh you've got the doomsday clock for the for the nuclear folks you know for a nuclear war and then you've got the debt clock in in New York City that uh that in fact the guy who funded it for years and years has died but\nUh it's it it lives on a yeah I think that's a great idea maverick thanks a lot for the suggestion Jim in Hamilton, Ohio Jim what's up\nTom I'm before to showcase the Carolinas a Duke Energy came up with a proposal to use the ... ... pounds to generate electric I just wonder how that would ... pollution and stuff\nYou what you mean the way spawns from the pig farms\nYes huh\nWhat to to just uh you know a muse bacteria or Saturday and you're adding products that you\nDon't get what you could drop off of it you know and and generate electricity\nYeah they probably could actually in fact each one of these uh pick operations can be turned into a little mini power plant I'm a ... there\nWas a ranch out there out west that are ... with a ...\nYeah I I remember that started I was a couple of years ago uh yeah and it's possible and that's the kind of thing that people might be start thinking about if we had at three or four hundred dollar a barrel or actually a ton tax on carbon or you know from fossil fuel sources\nOr people to start looking at alternatives and that would be one of my I Would prefer to see all these big operations in North Carolina in fact the biggest one is owned by the Chinese government and a lot of that pork as being shipped back to China and we get the pollution and we get the poison and\nAnd you know we get the stinky a you know the air you know miles and miles being destroyed yeah I'd say it's a great idea thanks a lot Jim Scott in Missoula, Montana ice Scott what's up\nYeah he's ... I think that we should approach to this from from a business perspective since that's something that that the oil industry would understand and\nWe should have a somebody like M. I. T. work up a Manhattan Project for correcting what we've done to the environment and what we're going to do to it and give the oil industry the option of either financing that Manhattan Project or painted a fine that's twice as much yeah and\nYou know if we're we're looking right now at destruction just in the United states you look at the wildfires in California you look at the the hurricanes and and storm\nDamage and and tornadoes for that matter across the the mid west\nI mean we've for example a couple of years ago we saw our first mile wide tornado I think it was an Oklahoma first one of the history of the United states never before and we've seen a mile wide tornado these are these extreme weather I mean we've always had extreme weather events but the extreme\nYou know ... times do her magnitude is the consequence of climate change so right now you could argue that the fossil fuel industry the Koch brothers all their bodies and the and the fossil fuel barons Murray energy and all these other guys that that they really should be on the hook for hundreds of billions of dollars of preparations that\nIn fact arguably the insurance companies can be the ones suing now and I'm you know Frank frankly I'm surprised that they haven't started it but yeah yeah it's I you know we have to make it in and just incredibly uncomfortable and expensive for these guys and we've got to do it right away Jake up in Baltimore, Maryland hey Jacob what's up\nHey Tom thanks for taking my call 'em\nIn terms of what we should do with the fossil fuel industry I mean I tend to agree with you that we need to do whatever is going to move faster I\nThink personally that if we let them go back in the long run it's going to be a multi decade challenged the not actually holding them accountable to end up having some long term negative consequences but\nI Want to re emphasize I really want anti for talking about the issue because this is a ... different issue than every other political one that we have the possible exception of nuclear war\nEven that we can hear in every single other progressive issue out there for a minimum wage to equal pay protection to minority right across the board and we don't do this one does what all the spirit victory that will end up evaporating in front of it\nI agree and I think this conversation that we're having right now is the wife should be the main conversation that the corporate media savvy\nAbsolutely I mean I didn't\nYear and this this this\nDecade or the second most important day shift street what are you going to be spending your time on earth and the most part he's asking the comment\nVery well says Jacob thanks a lot for the call and thanks to wash us or a we'll be back with ...

A. L. E. S. T. Greg palace dot com and ah you know you plug your name in and see if you've been purged from the voting role there in Indiana or in Georgia for that matter\nIt's amazing it's just amazing what's going on\nAnd on the main topic of our ... of the hour that we just finished I Want to get back to it also is a acts on love and now we've got the BCC coming out and saying if we don't cut fossil fuel usage massively we're talking like a forty percent reduction in fossil fuel usage and within twelve years\nAnd take call from being about eighty percent of all electricity produced in the world down to about one percent of all they're interested in but if we don't do that next twelve years we're screwed\nWe're going to see civilization threatening the weather now I Would submit to you that we have been seen civilization threatening weather for two decades now that when the when the\nWhen the desert moved south in Syria and Libya in Egypt\nOr you know across the art of Africa across Northern Africa as the as the climate change expanded these deserts\nThe farmers who used to farm on the edge of the desert land who's farms were turned into desert\nMoved into the big cities and created these\nA migrant crisis crises and then of course we took down coffee in Libya which you know in retrospect was a pretty stupid thing to do\nAnd and uh and millions of these people I mean literally millions of these people are flooded it from from all over Northern Africa flooding into Libya because you can get a boat and Libya and get across the Mediterranean to the southern parts of Europe to Greece and Italy\nAnd and then you know the refugees go from there up into all the way up to Germany and Sweden where they are coming in and numbers that are too fast and too large to be reasonably assimilated which is producing all these right wing backlash which is tearing apart the democracies of Europe\nHungary has already fallen Poland has already fallen a you know bud Spain is on the edge I mean there's just a Italy's on the edge\nThere's a bunch of countries that are just you know ... this is how toxic climate changes to democracy itself\nAnd we're seeing you know the destruction of climate change here in the United states trillions of dollars worth of damage being done by storms that have been amped up by climate change from mile wide\nNATO's across Oklahoma to this cat for hurricane that as we speak right now is hitting the panhandle of Florida is going to kill people it's going to destroy property is going to wipe out people's possessions\nEverything that they've saved for all their lives all their pictures all their letters all their everything it's gonna wipe out people's lives in a way that is just about unimaginable\nThe same thing that just happened in California where the wild fires\nAnd we're not hearing these people's stories the media doesn't want to talk to these people about you know oh what happened to your home because of what Exxon Mobil is been up to because of the climate change denialism that the Koch brothers and other right wing fossil fuel billionaires have been promoting for years and years and years\nAnd so the question I'm asking and I put this out in the last hour I've I've still got a whole board full of callers we will pick you up after the after the break down but\nThe question I'm asking is Exxon Mobil is saying now we will support a forty dollar carbon tax in exchange for a limitation liability\nAnd they're looking at what happened to the asbestos industry that got nailed for for line from the ... they ... the the first us industry in Nineteen thirty five is the first serious science was published on this\nThe the substance to kill my father\nWorked in a tool and die shop and was less exposed to asbestos throughout his life the the industry\nThat killed my dad knew in Nineteen thirty five but his focus was poisonous and it wasn't until the Nineteen nineties that they got nailed for it and they had a number of these companies are going bankrupt they're out of business they're gone\nSimilarly the tobacco industry they knew back probably in the thirties also there but it became obvious in

it it's not just temperature it's the day Lincoln animal society will dry up because no food\nYeah you're absolutely right and then this is really scary part and and and I think that we also need to serve rapidly making the transition\nFrom growing food for animals which is the majority of our agricultural output in the United states as most of what we use are productive land for his food for animals and and start producing food for humans you know vegetables and fruits across the Midwest and things like that\nMichael a well said let's try David again until ... are you out of your cube

go\nOh yeah we are the same age all and so I [laughter] I cringe a little bit when I say that but hey I'm an old go to okay what's up [laughter] okay\nSo now we have hurricane Michael which as you know we ... the Florida Panhandle has now it's very interesting category five\nStorms are a hundred and fifty seven miles per hour this is a hundred fifty miles per hour so it's only seven mile per hour less than what a category five would be and just by the way Hurricane Katrina which I participated in afterwards in two thousand five was actually a a\nR A category five so it was really really bad\nUm and they're saying it's too late for people to get out but anyway it is what it is and it's going to cause an enormous problem honestly in terms of electricity et cetera now or no I'm Mr Bloomberg former mayor\nOf New York city who was a Republican was an independent he's registered as a Democrat and he's also given twenty million ... million dollars to the Democratic party now I think he's running for president because he has not been very complimentary to Donald Trump I agree and I think that he is clearly running for president but\nYeah he's good I mean there's a billionaire in the White House right now Bloomberg is looking at that go on who first billion or I could be the second\nAh right yeah I I don't think he has a chance but I think that either I think he has a big challenge and\nHe has a chance right you know I always say senator looks in the mirror and that you can ... from the United states\nI exactly I I think that probably what he should be doing or thinking about doing his primary Mario Cuomo next time around but you know what do I know I don't live in New York so [noise]\nNow that was a recent study that says that millennials are not going to primary care doctors are going to the urgent care places because they don't want to wait around some air seemed very quickly urgent care places and so they're not going to primary doctor's\nAlso the president by the way I had his people speak to the Saudis they urge them to be transparent about this killing in Turkey a ... I'm On I ... for your information\nThe American advisory board of reporters Without Borders and we have said that there are over his team bloggers and journalists who have not been heard from we have no idea what happened to them who are Saudi Arabia [noise]\nWow so this might not be the only ... alleged killing right now but if if it ... it might not be the only only journalist who has been killed by the Saudis\nNow of course it's interesting it's turkey which is not exactly terrific towards journalists right [laughter] you know\nAir to walk and has his own problems but I think he's just pay out about the sovereignty issue I mean this was not an embassy this was a consulate consulates are not ... this is not Saudi land and turkey has the right to go in and and do whatever they want their I don't know about the ambassador's a residence do you know if the if that's considered\nA you know I don't know the law I mean I really don't know the Turkish law or the international law in there um and I cover the United nations should know but I doubt\nUm okay uh Israel said that they are going to continue their operations in Syria they don't care that Russia has missiles that were very concerned about it and they're going to continue on\nTheir operation also Senator Rand Paul remember him and he is now saying that he's worried that there's going to be an assassination that he's very concerned about violent or that or even if a thousand people express their opinions one of those thousands of people could possibly go after somebody\nWait a minute and he was already been violence I mean you know the right wing or as killed Heather Heyer higher already a you know how many how many more people is Rand fall afraid that the right where it's going to kill\nWell I guess they're coming after his family I don't know\nUh you know I Know these these poor pathetic Republicans snowflakes you know they they looking at Maxine water and they go like black people and and then Fox goes hyperbolic on all this and\nHow you know what's really interesting\nIs that may in California they take away children from black families who are using cocaine are as some other ... but they don't do it with white family really yeah I'm just investigating\nThat as we saw me send me a link on that story I I Will\nBut there's no link yet but wait 'til I ride a pack okay I'm now a also what's very interesting is that Canada is now going\nTo probably legalize marijuana they said basically that they want the taxes and so they're going to legalize it people are smoking it anyhow so why not get the tax\nYeah I I thought they'd already legalize it just hadn't taken effect yet it was supposed to take effect well they're happy alive\nAnd yeah I think they have and it happens in November December but the fact is is that they want to collect taxes which is why there during that sure now I Know Donald Trump wrote an op ed in USA Today\nAnd I know I I'm Mark this all up I was going to do a major rant about the third our though they're saying is criminal one day you know what Trump is set in USA Today and there are other promoting it on Twitter I re tweeted the u._s._a. today thing and said you know why is this company they are allowing Donald Trump to publish lies in the newspaper\n[noise] well I think that because there are certain people that are able to connect with the news media and get it in and\nYeah the Trump in this in this article he said that the Democrats want to destroy Medicare and Medicaid and going to defend ugly\nAlso said he said\nThe truth is the Democratic party yeah can you imagine yeah\nAnd he called it the ah the party of open border I mean just when I was a lie after lie after lie I as I said I Will be ranting about this in the next I Want to hear you ran out Allen's always great talking with you thanks so much about him thank you ... and it was talked media news\nAuthor of a lot of what you\nWill be back with more of the news that area [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] you're listening to Tom\nHi I'm Randy and this is Dave where the founders of bombers makers of the most comfortable socks and the history of feet so comfortable we've sold them donated over eight million pairs\nYes donated why\nWe learned that socks and the number one most requested clothing I'd have been homeless shelters so we started bomb us with the mission of donating a pair of socks for every player we sell to donate and saw a lot of socks we became obsessed with comfort we reinvented the sock from the ground up using the best materials available like the softest in most comfortable cotton getting rid\nOf what wasn't working like that annoying do seem you could probably feel if you wiggle your toes right now and\nInventing a few new comfort innovations

Medicare\nDemocrats are already harm seniors by slashing Medicare by more than a hundred billion dollars over ten years to pay for Obamacare this is another lie I mean there's been so thoroughly they blocked\nYeah there was a transfer of ... it was actually seven hundred billion dollars in the Obamacare you know moving Medicare funds from one category to another but not a penny of that came out of the pocket of anybody what it did was it extended the lifespan of the Medicare program is strengthen Medicare\nIt was an accounting change but the Republicans like the lie constantly and here's Trump wine\nLikewise Democrats would gutting Medicare with their plan government takeover American health care not true\nIt would create a Medicare for all plant just like Canada has just like Denmark has just like England ... well actually England is is a socialized medicine you know the ... the hospital's the doctors worked for the government\nNobody is even proposing that the United states\nIt would give us a plan more like France or Germany or Denmark or Holland or\nNorway or swimming or you know pick your country right Greece Spain\nHe continues the Democrats' plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice seniors would no longer be able to depend on the ... benefits they were promised to complain why\nIt's just a plain old ball face like why the hell is USA Today publishing this stuff\nBy eliminating Medicare is a program for seniors which nobody is proposing\nBy eliminating Medicare is a program for seniors an outline the ability of Americans to enroll in private employer based plans another line nobody is proposing outlining the Democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of healthcare you think you don't have rationing health care right now\nWhat was the last time you try to get your you know be just go to the pharmacy and you know for example\nAh my wife takes one medication for you know arm or for a thyroid for she said ... for ever since our third child was born it's a common thing with women who ... you know the birth of children had sucks all the I I Know the thyroid apparently and she's been taking this this form of this kind of natural form of fire and medication\nNo the insurance company says you must take ... cheaper\nDoesn't work as well for her I mean someone that it works great for some people that worked great for others and does\nAnd she says no this is what my doctor prescribed an insurance company says not where I got paid for it\nSo we're paying a hundred and forty bucks a month out of pocket\nI mean that's nuts right you think you don't have rationing right now\nDoctors not backed Donald Trump doctors and hospitals would be put on a business no they wouldn't be they would have unpredictable does this come on it's another live from Trump seniors would want to lose access to their favorite doctors another why\nThere would be long waiting in line for appointments and procedures you don't have long waiting lines right now\nHave you tried to see a specialist recently or for that matter a general practitioner in a hurry\nPreviously covering care would effectively be denied another lie these are just literally lives in practice Donald Trump writes in today's USA Today\nUSA Today publishes and tweets out two or three point six million people in practice the Democratic party's so called Medicare for all plan would really be Medicare for not under the Democrats' plans today is Medicare would be forced to die\nSo today's Medicare would become part of a plan that covers all Americans and by the way we'd like to get rid of that you know that whole at twenty percent hold that you have to have you know private insurance to fill let's get rid of that to\nThe Democrats' plan what to do also mainland of choice for seniors over their own healthcare decisions instead Democrats give total power and control over seniors healthcare decisions to the bureaucrats in Washington DC yeah I Would much rather have the bureaucrats in Washington DC who answered the politicians dialect\nMaking the decisions about what gets paid for what doesn't then\nStephen J Hemsley who runs United healthcare it was taken over a billion dollars in compensation from that company by saying to me when I had you not and healthcare insurance no we're not going to cover that drug we're not going to cover that procedure\nHe continues the first thing the Democratic plan will do is end the choice and choice for seniors is eliminate Medicare Advantage plans for about twenty million seniors as well as limited other private health plans for seniors currently is to supplement their Medicare coverage right\nBecause you don't need it anymore we're going to have comprehensive Medicare the covers everything for everybody you know like like in other countries where it actually coverage dental and eye care as well\nNext the Democrats would eliminate every Americans private employer based health plan thank God\nIt's right there and they're proposed legislation Democrats outlaw private health plans that offer the same benefits as the government plan okay that's fine with me\nAre Americans might think there's such an extreme anti senior anti choice anti consumer proposal for government run health care and find little support among Democrats unfortunately there would be wrong or a hundred and twenty three Democrats lousy representatives sixty four percent of House Democrats as well as Fifteen Democrats in the ... have already co sponsored this legislation thank God\nThe truth is that the centrist Donald Donald Trump writes the centrist Democratic Party is dead the new Democrats are radical socialist model America's economy after Venezuela\nBS\nIf Democrats win control of Congress is November we will come dangerous like closer to socialism in America\nUsed to be the Ronald Reagan railed about how Medicare was socialism\nHow far we've come right dumber and health care is just the beginning Democrats are also pushing massive government control over education oh my God we all public schools free healthcare and probably and free college to\nPrivate sector businesses\nOh we want to regulate polluters\nAnd other major sectors of the U.S economy how about banking\nEvery single citizen or will be harmed by such a radical shift in American culture and life virtually every where it's been tried socialism as broad suffering misery and the gay\nParade like a horrible country in Norway terrible\nBooks in Denmark call and make a minimum wage is Seventeen dollars an hour how am I going to be said the Democrats coming together and health care is all the more men in New Jersey near that our economy was paired with some Democrats absolutely commitment to
