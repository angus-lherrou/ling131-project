everybody should have possibility to bad constitutional cars Hillary finally they aren't making about ... you have a favorite way traffic\nI think you're right and and the and the and the important thing to note is that I mean most of the when he started calling himself a fascist right away or there was a certain period of time with Adolf Hitler before he started calling himself a fascist I don't know how long that was I get it's been three years since I read ... book\nAnd but you know Donald Trump has now as embraced the white nationalist phrase the the the the we are a nation defined by our genetics and and uh that's a major turning point\nOh you're in California right now I don't know why so Chicago hello that\nI don't know either a it's a pleasure to talk to you to him and the reason I uh I'm calling I wanted to follow up on that horrible avenues show by the Republicans okay ah one thing about Soros I don't even think he feels safe in Hungary any longer\nHow he can do to Hungary or mine would have him arrested but cirrhosis pressure was in that ad\nI I hear that yeah but I I suggest there might be a connection between or Bannon Sebastian Gorka he's Trump Nazis\nYeah who's also Hungarian wouldn't surprise me in the latest\nOkay but the point I wanted to make through OK I paused the ad that you just played and to see who sponsors it and it's sponsored by a future America forty five I Believe okay you and I like to show who's responsible for this garbage\nAnd this is twenty sixteen dated for an open secret so I don't know how the go through and find out they\nPull it from ... see records and uh and and uh iris records\nThat are five okay okay so this is pretty reliable data open secrets access was that yes okay\nAnd the reason I wanted to see who sponsors is twenty sixteen I imagine it's pretty much the same door neighbors who put it in that horrible\n... ad well anyway it's um the dark money comes from the adult since the tune of like Fifteen

think it was just ... but she's in Trump's cabinet\nPost thing at what my comment what about shaming these people my home state is Michigan and\nThis guy had been the chair of the Washington Tony Republican Party are supposedly not crazy but he uh he is a head of a real estate agent in Ann Arbor what about shaming these people I'm shocked that he's on a list of is\nA future forty five organization\nThat funded that it yeah what do you think about going to the locally in shaming these people to know that\nThey I think you know in order to shame ... somebody Terry they have to be capable of feeling shame and I think a lot of these people aren't they are so these billionaires are so insulated\nThey live in such bottles there so surrounded by yes men and women are this is the story of Donald Trump is well they literally ended up having no shame they think that they can run the right the rules by the way Louis just came and told me that it's been reported that Eric Holder also has received a bomb\nOr where something might be a bomb in the mail I mean this is this is apparently a big day for the for the killers on the right ... thank you for the call Dana and I point North Carolina Dana what's up\nHi Tom and I just got to say that decades before ... attacked our election process we were influenced by a foreign power for Twenty years or the Australian Rupert Murdoch\nHas been doing everything he can to be the the author or end the dedicated relentless driver of our descent into fascism I mean ... they are the original fake news and always have been\nAnd this is Kevin rod wrote this piece for the Sydney morning Harold or a few weeks ago called the cancer at the core of Australian democracy Rupert Murdoch\nPerfect and given Russia's foreign prime minister\nYou so he should know yeah yeah and it's still casting terrorism I mean they need their the author of that and the dry river there's all the examples you gave shown and they they literally trained Donald Trump for eight years during the Obama administration\nTo not believe his birth to to hate ... everything you do to the point the Trump is now reversing every thing that Obama did where did he learn that from Fox News Fox propaganda is what's running this country now Trump listens to you know Fox and friends he tweets out any lie\nThat Hannity promotes Hannity is as much running the country is Trump is\nAnd then and then Republicans run around and try to make the law is true you know somebody on Fox's Jay there should be a ten percent tax come from working people that would go over well Trump announces it or at a at a rally in with a tweet\nAnd so then a Republican congressman says okay I got to write a resolution no resolution has no legal force whatsoever it's not a lot simply a statement I'm going to write a resolution saying that we want to have a ten percent tax cut for the average working person\nThe dust making Trump not a liar anymore I mean it's bizarre what's going on and you're right so much of this starts right there with Fox so called news\nYeah and ... Trump doesn't read anything or learn anything or even listen to the information from his intelligence he listens to Fox News he that that's that's his entire school from which he learns\nYeah and this is the damn scary thing and I want to get one more call in here before the end of the hour or an ... thank you for the call Anita in San Antonio and they know what's up\nHigh ... well I think it's a problem when we demonize people I Want to turn them into some sort of evil character and I just I'm very concerned about why somebody would send a bomb to Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nOr Andrew Cuomo because those people that are typically demonized on the right they don't even know who Getty washing themselves are probably\nThe only love your bombers from Florida\nWell possibly been Debbie Washington shows I mean I just don't\nActually she was the head on the way I mean you know typically the people who hey Debbie Wasserman Schultz are the people who are part of the burning campaign if that was your point Anita um but you know I I\nI don't think we should demonize a tournament to even ... you don't agree with that that's one thing but she was trying to do some sort of character she was telling your shirt and he was trying to destroy Bernie Sanders yeah I think we just I just want to keep that in mind because we need to be careful the phones\n... language that was used to describe Debbie Wasserman show I heard anything I once I did not and I hung up close yeah they're going to destroy your lives they're going to ... they're going to you know take over your head no money that\nThey were ... some people were told that she was stealing the election from Bernie she was you know she'll have the evil\nIn some way she was she was going to provoke a terrorist attack I mean that's political dirty ...\nYeah okay we're going to resolve this like I I keep saying we don't want a new the Hillary wars let's not try to re insight that kind of crap on your\nMind\nAnd that was Mark Foley [noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to um\nA single molecule help you manage your weight doctor Jay you hurry on the FDA accepted breakthrough called reduce zone think back to all of your failed diets if you're like most was hungry and cravings that the real you it's not your fault it's almost impossible to lose weight when you're always hungry increasing the wrong foods university\nResearchers have found a molecule that helps manage appetite boosting metabolism so you eat less and burn calories faster ... zone is the only FDA accepted product would that university discovered macho ...

New Mexico I was just in beer a cruise ship for a vacation and I saw\nLike a young fourteen year old men dressed enclosed like he was from what the Mona he was dead in the side of the road\nAnd unlike the good Samaritan didn't stop to give him water he was already did I could see\nBut I told the guards at the entrance of the part that I was hiking and so what's going to happen a lot better than Democrats planning to do when a when the uh the refugees at the border thank you\nYeah Hi Daniel thinks I'm for the question and you know I understand too um at least from listening to the radio this morning I always ah when I'm driving and I listen to both Fox I Am and MSNBC radio 'cause it's on a and just to see what they're talking about for the day and are you on Fox they're talking about a new caravan from El Salvador right they love the caravan conversation\nI'm for us I mean you know we have to do comprehensive immigration reform short of that we've got to address the issue is issues as they come up by the time that caravan hits that don't forget some people are going to stay in Mexico along the way and won't make it to the border for other reasons\nBut by the time it hits it can be about the time that we're doing a the funding or for the homeland security or and they will I think very likely especially if we take the majority tried to use it to find funding for the wall\nSo we're gonna have to address that we're going to need people to be there to help us on the calls and when that time comes but I'm expecting a very robust lame duck period this being one of the main issues in addition to the wall we've been able to hold back funding with Republicans held up to this point 'cause even most of them privately tell you they know it's ridiculous\nBut I'm a fearful that when this gets here there's going to be a real push so I think in the short term that that we've got to deal with the long term we absolutely have to get the comprehensive immigration reform that also provides for a pathway to citizenship for aspiring Americans Thirteen million people here I Need us to address that in a comprehensive way\nHarold in Milwaukee, Wisconsin you're on the air with Congress ...\nI'm On the air you are Harold you're okay I just wanted to talk about the single payer or\nInsurance I just got a month ago I got back from from a trip to Germany and unfortunately I

sense gotten a lot that we need in America get an ethically and I'm kind of a background cats at a nation that we want to sell arms to\nAn extraordinary to I guess ... what can they can touch Congress\n... interesting point um you know and this is exactly what we're dealing with ah with Saudi Arabia right now right I'm not just the fact that uh they very likely from the very top were complicit with\nOr not complicit with I ordered the killing of someone who's been a critic uh in the Turkish embassy but uh you know my concern in Ro Khanna and others\nAre concerns have been around the involvement in Yemen and you know every time we're more worried about the arms sales to a country like that or even know uh they're creating the second worst probably humanitarian crisis on the planet outside of Syria\nIn Yemen and we've been involved in some of that so\nUh you're right there should be standard so when you're selling weapons it's not just about the the profit or that you're trying to make for the defense contractors which Donald Trump seems to carry about\nUh this is really looking at who you're selling to and this is our leverage right now with Saudi Arabia I guess the Donald Trump won't use that leverage but hopefully we can find people in Congress in both parties to have that conversation because I've seen more members of Congress vocal on this I have seen the president\nCalling from Newcastle, Wyoming Sunday you're on the air with congressman poke at\nPerformed with all the people being placed with the natural disasters I'll eat hurricanes if anything blowing gang to ensure that those people are not going to be purged on technicalities haven't developed a rolls or that they would get conditional ballots downtown\nUh you know a Sunday that's a great question I don't know the answer to that um you know right now especially in Florida where where we got a lot of people who are displaced I Hope that they're doing something to that front I have not seen much on that so I'm Sorry I Can't give you a good answer\nRob in Phoenix, Arizona here on their cars and poking at\nCongress ... hey I spoke to you last week or\nPrior about the Social Security income tax deduction in this like point what I was trying to point out is is right now it's a [noise] excuse me a hundred and thirty two dollars I think it's like a hundred and Ninety eight I Believe yeah hunter was going up to what I think one thirty two but regardless of like going up to three per se\nSix point three percent the Dutch into one thirty to my point was like if you double the cat you would have the tax we need to go from six point tree down to two or three ... if you don't want to get it would go down to one percent so basically what you could do if you push the limit or\nYou could lower the tax down to like one percent the government would still be making the same amount of money to ... Silvia a Social Security requirements\nAnd that would immediately give everyone who makes a hundred and thirty two thousand or a tax break up or you know five percent right off the bat I'm it also since corporations are people you know where she got tax on to their uh income taxes well congressman\nRob so that the differences were right now we have someone longevity problems with the Social Security because of the population so we're actually trying to bring in revenue to it so I think part of the conversation has been about lifting the cap\nAgain rightfully so it's a regressive tax when people who make I think this year one Twain was last year when trying I Need this year it might be one thirty two I don't pay another dime into the system\nBut we we if we lifted the kept completely you of over Seventy five years of future I into the Social Security fund that is probably the the most ... you know dressing\nA problem we have right now not so much that we're trying to lower that tax for people that you want to make sure the fund is available for people and a lot of us would like to talk about you know I'm expanding it and providing\nMaybe an increase tied to the consumer price index which addresses with seniors pay twenty five percent their income on medications and healthcare or rather than the CPI which is you know often focused on things like gasoline and stuff that\nNot all seniors are spending money on so um I don't know for you so much to try to cut the rate of the tax as much as keep the program alive which is the most pressing concern\nYeah congressmen and we have a minute and a half before the end of the hour\nI'm not quite enough to get to another caller in here although there are people with questions about Social Security and health care I I Know that you've touched on one of those topics but anyhow what what do you think we should be looking at in this next week and how do you think that we should be best reacting to these are acts of terrorism that we're experiencing right now as a nation\n[noise] yeah I mean I think you know we're left the two weeks from the election um it's going to get wild and wooly in the next two weeks be ready for it\nUh but the best way to deal with that while the willingness as to you know put some time in a supporting candidates of either party that you support a knock on doors or make phone calls use your social media talk to your neighbors and friends because of the election is really going to matter we saw what happened two years ago elections have consequences\nWe need people to be active and um you know we can do it in a respectful way we don't have to think a down to the level that they have to sync too we can be aggressive on the issues are and still make our point and I think appeal to a broader a number of people that we need to for the election you know\nAnd and are pushing back on the lives out a way to push back on the ...\nThe good news is the fact that right yeah we have those when the president says he's going to cut taxes or by ten percent between now and the election you just say to people Congress has even in session like that there's not even not even possible like that is just an outright lie there is zero percent truth in it um\nI think those kinds of things are fair to point out factor of ... thanks so much for being with us again this week of

you know when when Donald Trump tried to uh try to have forces on disclosure agreement I guess a Stormy Daniels\nAnd then her lawyer made the argument the you know this should be all public because you know technically what he did was adultery which is against the law and basically I'm not even sure that the the scotch would the judge ruling but I remember the debate about it\nThat are in where in California I guess is where it took place um the adultery is actually not against the law there anymore so therefore he could have an NBA with Stormy Daniels because there wasn't against the loss could be that the types of harassment\nOr that are being around the verge of being exposed by the telegraph are are not specifically prohibited by British law though it's just you know immoral and
