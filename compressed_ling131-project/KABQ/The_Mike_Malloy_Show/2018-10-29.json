encouraged out of work and I type their name I click on that donors tab\nAnd then I put their name and the search bar and a bunch of names come up I I searched through and I found that um uh the the people over against an AR ... much apolitical I cannot find anyone that it made any type of donation\nUm that the guy who ran Taylor a long time ago need one donation to a Republican in two thousand and four and the guy who owns Martin is pretty right wing he makes a he he um\nDonate a lot of money to a lot of different Republican candidates and I I was a little bombed\nHere that because uh Martin take good guitar for a a solo guitar is however gifts and makes a nice guitar too and so I I I was actually thinking about\nBuying more you feel better because you use your dollars\nTo make a
