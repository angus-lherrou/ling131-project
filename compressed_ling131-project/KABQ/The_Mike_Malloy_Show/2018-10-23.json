{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "Uh nighttime competitor of ours who a\nCouple of years ago moved to show from nights the afternoons his name's Michael Savage you might have heard of this I was in a real kind of anti immigrant pro government pro government a big government border patrol just this kind of guy\nUm he he moved to show the afternoon so he's not even really a direct competitor of us anymore but this week the news is coming out that he's cutting his radio show back\nTo do more pod casting which is basically saying he's ending his radio show is not over yet he's just cutting back the amount of time per day that he's going to actually do a live radio shows\nThey just keep dropping off a and we're still there which makes it easier to market free talk life so that so actually the ... program becomes more effective overtime so your five dollars a month today is actually more valuable\nThen it was a five or ten years ago because if we're on a hundred and Ninety radio stations today but we were only on a hundred you know X amount of years ago well we're more legit ... stations look at us and they say oh yeah you guys I remember you you've you've ... you've been calling me for years\nUh I've seen your advertising so we're not just you know the new kids on the block anymore we're literally the ones who've been there the longest now do you can help us become more effective at reaching out to the radio stations because there are still hundreds that we could join we we're by no means a penetrated into you know even half of the markets\nIn the United states yet so joined the program over an amped up talk life dot com and let's go to Ben he's in Massachusetts\nThen I'm not sure where you are where are you calling from Massachusetts tonight\nNo ban may\nHave been in Maine oh I Apologize bad okay ours\nRight now it's right next door to a hamster\nYeah yeah they did the board output in in a as the er the abbreviation so I mean you forgive them they're they're from uh Minnesota and they probably don't know the difference between Maine and a Massachusetts\nMinnesota's am I right blown up now [laughter] you did that on purpose right yeah okay [laughter]\nSorry about that so are you in Portland listening to W. L. O. B. where you at tonight\nWell yes uh well I I live in may I'm I actually I'm up in my camp and other western mountains are right next to the hamster and\nSo I have to uh you know my own a data listening or you know ... you're listening to you on a few or\nOh I'm not familiar with that particular affiliate are where they uh were they based out of\nOh I think you think are you thinking of W. A. L. O. B. that's the station ...\nIn ... I'm Sorry I'm Sorry that those are my to go to stations gotcha here forever so\nCool yeah it's a great station a W L O be on the FM band actually these days um anyway go ahead with your thoughts tonight where you calling about\nOh well just the the uh the caravan\nOf coming up through Mexico and everybody's trying to stop them and they're not stopping them but I just I Know you guys are all about the ... which I appreciate all about the liberty but we do have to have you\nKnow some sort of government borders\nI we got some sort of control and you know why can't you just control your own properties borders\nBut that's not the word is ...\nThat's not where we started\nWhy didn't start out that way I was the lord is this is this is all you know what I mean there weren't in any kind of real immigration controls until about World War one ... the passport didn't exist until what World War two I don't think yes those World War one\nWhen they started I mean the whole Ellis Island thing was just medical or in any case I don't know if\nI was ... was that was I was was a a place where you go to make sure you weren't going to get everybody everybody else with all the diseases we didn't have\nIt where you could go voluntarily\nOr you're going to end up somewhere else somebody or if I'm going to show up in Tampa you know in the port in Tampa or in San Francisco than Ellis Island thousands of miles away\nI Know but you know what made our country\nGreat was the fact we're a country of laws in order\nYou don't believe that do you ever do country but the evidence no not now in him because the evidence is that there aren't laws in order there's just the illusion of that the government doesn't follow its own law let's do the\nBest the best illusion in this world\nOkay so that's like saying you have the best form of cancer I'll give you that the United states is one of the more free countries on the planet it's not the most free you can go up and look up various different indexes on line I Believe the Heritage Foundation is one of them\nFree the world dot org is another are there a couple of few of them that rank the countries in the on the planet based on just economic and um indoor personal freedoms and the United states is seen the top twenty towards the bottom of the top twenty but it's you know not the worst country in the world\nI I travel the world there's no place else I'd rather be\nWell that's fine I mean everybody has their their preferences I Love New Hampshire because it's\nOf the fifty states the freest of the states in my opinion and there's a lot of great things that happened here so if we were to look at New Hampshire as its own country which it once was a you know if if we were looking at his own country I think it would rank right up there among the top countries in the world as far as you know Hong Kong\nWhich isn't really a country but it's still wins the them the most free economically I think New Hampshire will be much higher than the rest of the United states because it's being dragged down by ... by states like California\nAnd New York which is some of the most you know governmental but look to go back to what you said earlier ban it wasn't the government that made this country great you know think that oh no you know\nYou you are correct It's not the country I mean that's not the government it's the people I mean we are the people and a vision and we took on greatest superpower created our own country and by the way I think every license plate true say live free or die\n... I don't know if it were a weird thing and put on a license plate well they're already now ironic thing\nOr\nIt's a great saying I agree but I get her point she's saying is you know it's I simply ironic because the state's license plate is evidence that you are not free because you had to ask the government permission in order to actually get into the car and drive it from point a to point B\nSo I mean in in my opinion the reason why the United states this particular land mass is as successful as it's been is because of its initial lack of laws because the initial lack of a government controls and regulations and rules and governments are controlled money and things like that\nThat's why we're better off not because of government bureaucrats\nYo yo how we can go you know what they

edited today by arena fool Har for for all her\nAnd it's titled Trump's mid term mistake and she says it most Americans don't believe the Trump tax cut his head any real effect on their personal finances even among white working class men and the Trump base the percentage that would agree with that statement you know the Trump has help the economy is less than half\nA she says I think it's the ... the end of trickle down as a mythology\nSince two thousand eight there's been a growing awareness amongst the voting public that the economy can be be getting better but not better for them\nAnd then she adds the student debt crisis in spiraling health cart care costs the far outpaced income growth are what's resonating most profound William Penn and Democrats are focusing on those things I mean pretty aggressively\nSo back to my my thesis here in the article that I that I wrote basically which is that the only the only two things that Republicans are running on this this time right now\nFear and principally that fear is you know obviously fear of crime they've always around that but also the fear of the other explicit and overt racism or sexism massage in a a and now even you know a fear of trans people and voter suppression\nIt's basically fear and voter suppression\nI you know they they\nUsed to talk about hey better schools hospitals airports roads and bridges member Trump talking about all this stuff during the campaign and twenty sixteen now that's all gone\nOr they were going to replace the Affordable CARE Act with something better and cheaper and covers everybody and no no there is suing right now to end the Affordable CARE Act Republicans are suing\nTo allow health insurance companies to once again throw you ever have refused to pay for your ... of it has anything to do with a preexisting condition they literally are at a law suit that's going to the Supreme Court the Republicans right now\nSigned on by by you know Republicans all over the country\nThey no longer talk about more and better jobs\nI mean they're they're bragging about the fact that uh you know ten years into the Obama recovery things are doing well but you know basically it's all about race\nReligion stands for race right and Muslim is more around Arab GOP speak immigration stands in for race ... immigration means round people from South of the border\nRepublicans across the country or even recruiting white supremacists and neo Nazis gangs to threaten and assault Democrats and their supporters\nGoing after Nancy Pelosi over the weekend beating up a bunch of people at a Republican event last friday and while Trump is praising the criminal assault of reporters in the wake of the show ... murder\nAnd that's getting bizarre by the way to a whole nother issue will get into a little later on the program\nSo that's their message\nBasically has to be afraid to be afraid right this is this is Nick Sony and this is Roger Stone and this is Paul Manafort and keep in mind stone and Manafort owned a political consulting company called stone Manafort and somebody else or Manafort stone and somebody else\nAnd you know they they worked on Nixon's campaign and they worked on Reagan's campaign and they worked on Trump's campaign so of course right\nBut now the now the ... basically this is all they can run on\nThe Republican secretaries of state across the nation is isn't thirty two states are aggressively suppressing the vote\nRight or you know what they found out is this very simple thing you know people don't like what you have the cell phone let them vote\nImmediately I mean immediately like literally the day after\nThe five Republican appointees on the Supreme Court and gun in the voting rights act in twenty Thirteen immediately\nFourteen Republican controlled states within the first week or to\nMove to pass laws that they had in waiting just in anticipation of the Supreme Court decision that would suppress the vote in those states is now up to over thirty\nIn North Carolina for example a hundred and fifty eight polling places right after this decision and twenty thirty a hundred and fifty eight polling places were permanently closed in the forty counties that had the most African Americans in that state\nWhich led to a sixteen percent decline in African American early voting in their twenties sixteen election\nAnd MIT study found nationwide Hispanic voters weighed a hundred and fifty percent longer in line than do white people blacks two hundred percent longer in line\nIn Indiana when Governor Pence got his rigorous new voter id law cause it caused an eleven point five percent drop in African American voting in Indiana\nStudents are ... for the right to vote retired people who no longer drive for care passionately about Social Security are being turned away from the polls by the tens of thousands because they no longer have active driver's licenses\nLike why is this while the problem for the Republican Party has really deep roots back in the Eighteen seventies when they were the party of Lincoln we're going to bring priests slaves into the mainstream of America those are called the radical Republicans you know ... Stevens and his and his compatriots\nWell by the Eighteen Seventy five basically they were toast\nAnd the Republican Party had just thrown in completely by the Eighteen eighties as the industrial revolution was taken all over with a rail barons the oil barons the coal barons the steel\nBarons the construction barons\nThat Trump is an air too\nAnd the Democratic party\nMeanwhile I mean even back in the Eighteen eighties they threw in with working people\nThe peak of this of course was the new deal and thirty three and the great society and sixty seven\nUm but legislatively protecting unionization passing legislatively passing Social Security passing Medicare passing Medicaid putting it all on the minimum wage\nPutting into law unemployment insurance creating federal and state agencies that would protect workers that would protect safety that would protect children that would protect the environment these were all things the Democrats did and so the Republicans basically are nothing but the party of rich people CEOs and\nCorporations but there aren't enough rich people and corporations to get Republicans elected\nSo what do they do well first of all obviously they lie to us and we'll get into that and more detail on our second are only talking about the ... America\nBut you know consider in Nineteen Seventy four\nIn Nineteen Seventy not that long ago right Nineteen Seventy four the Republican Party controlled seven states\nToday that control thirty three seven states in Nineteen Seventy four\nWith limited direct competition and ... um Rhapsody opens next month one looks to climb up to at least one hundred sixty five million or so by the end of its Ron\n... zone is the only FDA accepted product would that university discovered molecule that I Believe is a game changer for managing weight\nWith reduce zone I finally have an answer for patients who want to lose weight and keep it off\nWhen diet and exercise aren't enough at non prescription reduce zone used promo coat Tom and receive up this sixty five percent off plus free shipping go to try reduce zone dot com that's try our id you zone dot com try and reduce zone dot com\nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives are important members of our country's diverse culture a world where today's American Indians and Alaska Native children grow up to enjoy the highest levels of physical emotional and spiritual life he's one you can help create if you were a physician\nPhysician assistant nurse practitioner nurse\nDentist pharmacists optometrist or other health care provider in search of a personally and professionally fulfilling career join us at the Indian Health service you will provide care today that will change to point two million tomorrow's learn more about Indian Health service scholarships\nLoan repayment and careers and I address dumped go forward slash career opt ...

Bush never would have been president if it wasn't for voter purges in Ohio Wisconsin a Pennsylvania and Michigan Donald Trump would never be president we would have seven liberal justice is on the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd we would have had president Al Gore and then president Hillary Clinton\nSo vote voter purges have brought us some real hell by the way final round then I'm gonna pick up their phone calls here are Nikki Haley\nThis is getting real interesting\nNikki Haley drafted her resignation letter on the morning of October third she was our ambassador to the United nations and it was one of the few people in the Trump Administration who was actually in regular contact with our intelligence agencies\nRight I mean Trump doesn't take that stuff seriously he gets his quote intelligence from Fox News in fact he doesn't even take the day of the presidential daily briefings any lotteries the first president not to do this you know since ... the the whole thing was created I Believe during the Eisenhower administration they actually was probably during the war during the FDR administration\nBut Nikki Haley does or did\nSo on October second show he was murdered\nIn Turkey constantly in the Saudi conflict in Turkey\nThe next morning\nNikki Haley presumably knows about it and writes for resignation letter she sees the handwriting on the wall in my humble opinion\nAnd submits that letter\nTo to Donald Trump it was a full week later before it was the chance of October before there was any reporting on us\nAnd by that time Nikki Haley was out\nYou think there's a um\nAn if this than that\nThere's a a a post ninja a over a democratic underground posted this along with a a link to I Believe it's a link to a a\nRelevant to this so anyhow spot on our our played here today a lot on the agenda I'll add a lot of news that we're going to get too as we continue\nBut ah\nLet's pick up your phone calls here Bradley outgrow village Illinois hey Brad was [noise]\nHere's here's my here's my thoughts and that is this the\nThe right to vote it's not a privilege it's All right and it's freedom of speech and I I just see the Republicans as the poverty of my my freedom is for freedom is for me and not for you if\nI I'll pull politically it blows you or despite shoot yeah and uh\nI'll take my comment you you could uh\nYou can go to the next call but I I Do think that Democrats the to argue that the Republicans are not [noise] there were about defining the constitution only for themselves and not for any one else\nOh absolutely originalism is a disease that has only practice a psychological disease that is only practice by Republican judges it's literally end up at a Republicans like this is in in Seventeen Ninety five Thomas wrote a paper called dissertation on first principles of government bread thanks for the call\nDissertation on first principles of government and he wrote and I quote the rights of voting for representatives is the primary right by which all other rights are protected to take away this right to vote\nI was a foundation in the future\nBut right now that bond is free and we need a place that could make it home\nThe diabetes prevention to safety around wondering\nBecause we were there was a while there's enough\nAvailable in all find bookstores now [noise]\nAutomatic ... here where the uh nine nine minutes before the our neck in New York Phil Illinois and Nick what's up\nAnytime good afternoon or good aren't you yeah all of the above [noise] um [noise] you know so I was thinking about it I was trying to come up with them or you\nKnow some bumper stickers for all the parents and well one of them I thought of over the weekend was well what's your pre existing condition\nOr something like that you know because everybody's got one yeah and a Republican you know I was thinking about\nA year ago or one of the patrol come on and they grow up and then that was the both in our ... our ... challenger and challenging with well what what you know and what I Do it out and then they are not in their mouth and drop call or something like\nThat that was pretty good yeah um I wasn't good but um but I\nActually really called about um\nSomething about you know which I think what's most frustrating to me it's a lot of others is all this energy and time spent\nHaving to add all these people and all the energy if you think about all the energy and time spent that they put towards all this voter suppression and or you know like let's say you know like the ... drugs oil company how much ah\nHow much money and effort they put towards uh the false science for the last Fifteen Years of this dial\nYeah it was all about the money I already macro industry deserves before that and the asbestos industry did it before the tobacco industry did\nIt only been arguing about whether or not it was human cause you're not okay no one whether or not it was the point the point is that there is something going on and now when you have to figure out what are we going\nWell and it is human cause that's why you've got four hundred and twenty dollars for a million of CEO to in the atmosphere and methane is exploding right now it's over two thousand parts per million\nParts per billion and and they are going\nTo ... you can point to the floating plastic island and ... and you could say well was that natural I mean that's obviously human cars on the hill goes back even further to like what like Greg and kicking down with solar panels off the White House like what the heck was that all about where would we be had that well\nThat that is the oil industry yeah well ... where we would be\nIs we would have a you know we would have a a a a government that actually is looking out for all of a sudden you know it's it's very simple and straightforward\nBy your points are well Maine neck and and the effort I mean you know I remember it was like ten Fifteen Years ago it was early on in this program that the Republican started rolling out this thing that we need to secure the vote\nThere are people who are not citizens who are trying to vote and when and how do I need them to to to fill in the blank what was it get on an airplane why couldn't you shouldn't have to have id to vote and I thought these are such stupid\nGirl a you know just inane argument why are they making these arguments will now we know now we know it's the only way they can win elections Laura in champagne Illinois hey Laura what's up\n[noise] [noise] Hi Tom I'm I think we should distinguish between voters depression and election fraud election tried you know being that\nWhen you finally get to the pausing actually vote and she touched your votes or they tell you that your signature doesn't match or even after the election they threw out thousands of paper ballot so\nThe votes can't be counted for um\nThe way that I think that the only way maybe you could\nCome up with another way to to fight back against that and that is to find out who I'm In charge at the election senior county and make sure you voted Democrat in that position mhm\nYeah so there's a lot of Republicans how to\nWrite a ... state right in various states ... you're right no no I said I said first I and also make sure that you have a Democrat as secretary of state because the secretary of state in every state is the chief elections official for the state\nOh yes yes and or\nSo and the right and they're the ones who are conducting the voter purges by and large they may have the county uh uh the judges are elected officials I mean the the title varies from state to state\nUm they may have the county people doing their work and in some cases you get roped county officials but you know and spot on you want to make sure if they're if they're partisan elections or even if they are elections has appointed as opposed to being appointed that that you have Democrats in those places and that again varies from state to state but and\nThey didn't have any energy solutions so that's probably because we've had to fight back against\nThe the the straightforward solution is we need to have a constitutional amendment that says than voting is a right\nWe have to enshrine voting as a right we can do it the short term solution is to have is pass a law saying that voting as a write the long term solution is to write it into our constitution or thanks for the call I Need to I Need to go I Want to get another caller in here before we hit the end of the hour Stella in Tucson, Arizona watch us on Facebook Live based all what's up\nRight Tom thank you for taking my call sure what's up [noise] um yeah I just well actually traveling now I had this idea I I was listening to him one night and like all minorities should just I'm registered as Republicans\nStill get kicked off the voting rules because they're doing it based on common names and while there's\nYou know if there's a there's some common names for white people there's a credible diversity among white people in their names because there's all these different language groups that white people came from basically among Hispanics and African Americans and Asians there are a couple of dozen ...\nAmos that constitute a really large chunk of all those people and so when you're just ... against common names you wipe out people of color but not white people and that and regardless I mean they're not doing it based on their voter registration Stella unfortunate out\nI mean it is a cute idea in a shower and all I think we're putting it out as a joke but what I think you were ill\nBut yeah I was thinking about it because I used to do that myself I I used I was a registered independent\nAnd I can act which one of the voting Republican vote out yeah and that's you know that's a lot of open primary states them sometimes pernicious late you know when I Lived in Michigan the Republican Party encouraged their members to vote in the presidential primary\nFor George Wallace and the Democratic primary\nIn Michigan was embarrassed to be in the only state the son George Wallace to the to the Democratic thing and I think it was

what you do speaking of books Bob is also the author of side swipe and a Bob congressman welcome back\nOh thank you talk so what's at the top of the news today\nWell it top news is full naked this and that is coming from the president of turkey and that's what he's going to be calling what he's going to speak about the press conference he's giving the issues in the details of ... death and he said it's going to be fooled naked in this with\nA gruesome details to it so I'm sure even more than we've heard is going to come out\nAnd this was going to be in his speech to as the Turkish version of parliament tomorrow and uh tomorrow will be like probably what two three four o'clock in the morning our time so we should know all this by tomorrow morning news cycle\nOh yes you're right we should and uh and and it's important you know people ask me today well what do we think the accuracy of it is well let's just say it this way everything they have said has been accurate so far anyway you know the Turkish government\nAnd you know some people say well maybe they're spinning things no they aren't that they've been accurate there's a reason to believe this is not going to be accurate the Saudis have made some absolutely bizarre absurd statement a fist fight\nYou know started and also they found\nFifteen in essence Fifteen\nProfessional assassins and you're gonna have a fifth of the fist fight with them really right\nAnd and they cut all his fingers off and then they said you know ... is so gruesome it it's it's unbelievable yeah and um they had a man who look like him that they put into we know the snow into his clothes\nAnd had him walk out and taped it as if he was leaving they were going to use that and then that got that was found out by the Turkish authorities ... body double\nRight now meanwhile uh Jared Kushner has been communicating with NBS Mohammed bin Solomon and he's telling him the trans parrot\nI Can't say that the president is backtracking but obviously they're starting to make statements\nThat you know are talking about some lives and deception but still defending the crown prince and some issues are coming out and some stories about Norm Coleman the former senator who's doing lobbying for Saudi Arabia and so a lot of of numbers and money that the Saudis has spent\nAs coming out now Norm Coleman is attached to a pack\nThat is a supporter by Speaker Ryan\nSo of course she you know some of the of the money what do you\nThink of this conspiracy theory that's been floated that you know the murder happened on October second by the night of October second uh you know ... it would have happened in ... a very very early in the morning our time on October second\nI'm so by the end of that day our intelligence agencies knew what was going on you know both from direct knowledge and probably by a Turkish intelligence and the very next morning Nikki Haley sat down and wrote her a letter of resignation\nUm ... do you think that it's possible that gene I mean she pays attention to the intelligence a Trump doesn't get his intelligence briefings anymore and the CIA has no interest in them inside\nBut Nikki Haley actually reads the intelligence briefings\nDo you think that she went to our this possible that she went to the Trump Administration whether it was Donald himself or whether it was\nIn a bowl or somebody like that and said hey this is going on and this is going to blow up at our faces and this is really grow any I don't want to have anything to do with this and we need to get ahead of this and they said oh no no we're going to be just fine we're going to we're going to protect the Saudis they'll they'll cover this up don't worry and at that point being the very very smart politician that she is Nikki Haley said okay I'm I'm getting the hell out of here\nWell you know Tom there's no doubt that Nikki Haley as sites on the White House down the road and there's no doubt that people would like to see her on the Republican side you know to run obviously\nFor president I think that is very possible what you just said combined with the fact of John Bolton and I also believe uh some of the theory that she knows that John Bolton was attempting to begin a war with Iran\nAnd if you look at the president's statements well we need Saudi Arabia to fight Iran no we don't we don't Saudi Arabia can't even find its way out of the paperback they can bomb\nYou know kids in other countries but they can't um fight so we don't need them to do it I think that's part of it she may have had access to information also and just became tired of the whole scenario because you have to look at something look at what the president said\nWhen he mentioned this might be broke he used the word rogue for Saudi Arabia and the word Roque and you know she had access to this is the information that might have been the straw is set her over the edge\nTo get out and I think Bolden is a big key factor in this a key factor with it the deal going on right now with Russia\nAnd the agreement so I think anywhere you go you're going to see naturally you know his his fingerprints yeah and with the Saudis they're close there is a business relationship Jerry ... been on the phone costly I Am predicting that some of the people that have now been rushed it\nWill confess that the crown prince and the and the royal family had nothing to do with this which is I think a complete lie nothing to do with it then those people will be beheaded why would they can fish 'cause there's threats to kill their own family this thing it's Saudi Arabia the royal family it's going way deeper\nBusiness connections you know pushing her entire nine yards but they use the word wrote before the Saudis used it I thought was kind of a coordination\nYeah and why there were there wasn't of course our family bailed out by air uh money I'm I'm not sure it was Saturday I thought it was from a ... but it's\nBasically the same thing as I Do a refused to him and then you have all the show he got in trouble that the President Bush's you're involved in the business I mean there's a lot of\nThings that's right that's that's right you
