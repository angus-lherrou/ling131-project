right you know of businesses and pollution or whatever it may be in the last a cases Ninety two percent of them were decided on behalf of the Republican financial interest as opposed to the workers that people are you ... you\nActually stating that the Supreme Court no longer bases their decisions on the constitution that's absolutely what I'm saying\nOkay I happened to disagree with that well I I Would direct you to Heller for example if I if I may offer a I'm a hypothetical sure I Would\nSay a commercial Harris when she was twenty twenty election and the Senate is a old is taken by the Democrats the house is still held by Republicans and at that time judge Clarence Thomas retires now does that mean that it based on what\nYour principal is is that guy sheet that seat should go to a conservative because it was of a conservative\nWhat I'm saying things Marty the first is that what we call conservatives are not conservatives they're right wing reactionary radicals and and there has to the best of my knowledge never been a left wing reactionary radical on the Supreme Court never\nThe the people that the the ... the people on the court that have been nominated by democratic presidents have have typically been\nA people in the middle essentially and the people that are being appointed now via the federalist society are hardcore right wing reactionary who's only interest is the is the interests of the very very wealthy in the very very powerful in this society and the rationale for that is right we believe\nThat as Thomas Hobbs said in man's natural state\nLife is short nasty and British you know without the intervening force of church or state is what Thomas opposite and all of that and this is the core of the other a conservative worldview that you need to have an authoritarian state so I Know what I'm saying is that the Supreme Court\nHas been so heavily politicized now and you know but I Would say frankly since since the since Eighteen Seventy something you know a day or Abraham Lincoln took the size of the court up to ten so that he can start winning decisions Andrew Johnson who followed him\nWhen a general Sherman gave fifty thousand African Americans forty acres and mule Andrew Johnson then president of the United states retracted that a case went to the Supreme Court around it and Johnson reduce the size of the Supreme Court to seven\nI you know we've been playing games with the Supreme Court literally since ...\nFranklin Roosevelt and al ... right to go to twelve\nTried to pack the court yeah absolutely would've been Thirteen actually but but here's the thing I'm suggesting that ... that that that is that the cause of Marbury versus Madison Eighteen oh three because the court has taken onto itself\nThe power to strike down laws passed by Congress and signed by the president and even come up with a brand new doctorates you know things that didn't exist that law at all for example the concept of the three

you know I have no problem with people being rich I'm I ...\nIt ... it's the nature of our society there there have always been ever since they are cultural revolution there have always been people\nWho had more than others and it you know but but I Do have a problem\nWith people who are using their wealth to influence politics for the sole purpose of preserving and enhancing their own wealth when doing so works to the detriment of the rest of society\nI have a big problem with that with the Koch brothers running into a very profitable very polluting company and then buying politicians who will then fight pollution regulations I have a problem with that\nAnd and and and I think Gary also we have to acknowledge them very good science that's been done and it's very easy to find with a simple duct duct or Google Search\nOr the very good science to spend on the shows that people who people of privilege people who grow up with wealth people who've never wanted people who've never had to to to you know wait a week to be able to go to McDonald's for that great night out um you know people who've never lived on the edge\nOr that and that they very often are less empathetic than people who have lived on me\nAnd and I don't know what to do about that um but it but it's a reality\nThat doesn't mean that all rich people are not empathetic or that they're all bad and in fact you know this sounds patronizing but some of my best friends are really rich but you know that it does mean that that we've got a problem with rich people in this country that's my point

was incredible she she's though the woman who wrote the new deal essentially she was the first female lead labor secretary with that fear\nYeah she was the the people legislator basically um and there is a great book on line it's an old one it's written in Nineteen Seventy six by George Martin and you can still get a hold of it it gives you more of the politics that were behind all the decisions that were made at the time and\nWhen Roosevelt brought out the bill\nOn what they call now court packing um the mistake was that they if they came up with it in secret in fact she thinks that it was really\nA written by attorney general coming at the time and um and they sent it right to the Congress will let it go smacked everybody and she felt at the time that Owens Rob is on Robert was becoming more liberal\nAnd that there were two or three conservative justices that we're about to retire and she simply felt that it was the wrong move it the wrong time but once\nI had gotten out there it was worth about ego that he kept pushing for it\nUm but eventually it did die in committee and uh the justices did start to become more liberal and he\nGot an Roberts was the first guy changed his vote as I recall\nRight right yeah so that's ... that's where Francis was she felt it was\nToo much of a risk politically to do it the way he did it but people need to understand the bill was also kind of strange in that it said that for every justice that did not retire at age Seventy six months after that President Roosevelt would be able to\nAppoint a Supreme Court justice up to six of them so that's pretty extreme awful\nRight and all the justices over Seventy all of their votes consolidated into one vote as I recall\nThere were ...\nI don't remember that I'm particularly but I remember that uh uh it was on configuration of where he could get up to six justices\nYeah so do you think that if the Democrats take the house and Senate and the and and if there's a complete sweep and twenty twenty two and a half year or two years from now or do you think that it would be wise for the Democrats to try to increase the size of the Supreme Court ...

citizen dot org slash trade a and a Lorrie welcome back in the program thank you very much\nIt's always great talking with you so a Trump was on TV this morning saying that he's got a new deal that replaces NAFTA and uh it's the best thing since sliced bread the deal was a terrible deal and we're not and we're not going to call this NAFTA anymore Bloody Bloody bought\nIt seems to me though that well actually before I say what it seems to me what what what's your take on this\n[noise] so the new deal has found improvements long advocated for\nSome term we have long opposed including some recycled from the Trans Pacific partnership and the bottom line is that a lot more work extra wired\nTo stop NAFTA's ongoing job outsourcing downward pressure on wages environmental damage and the jury is kind of out if the final package is going to guess there there are two big questions number one is the tax\nIt got released last night what's actually going to end up in front of Congress next year and that would happen next year and depending on the thing I watched you know and then number two what is going to be in the fall package what's going to be in the implementing legislation Trent unions that working right now to try and get in implementing a\nLanguage that could make some some improve labor standard actually enforceable which right now they're not sufficiently mhm\nWhat about what about pharmaceuticals I read the uh this uh this bill ... and maybe this is what was borrowed from uh the TPA that are ... to ... uh the TPP today\nUm that uh it it extends the the patents for these are the pharmaceuticals in ways that will um you know permanently keep our prices high and also raise prices for pharmaceuticals and Canada and maybe Mexico\nYep that's one of the things we have long opposed and it's really outrageous big time big pharma giveaways and here we are in a free trade agreement and right in the heart of it are the protection of monopolies\nFor pharmaceutical firms to avoid competition and have the ability to charge crazy high prices on the cutting edge\nUm called biologic drug large molecule drug um medicines and you know it's it's things like ... and then it's medicines I used to treat cancer\nAnd the\nThe bottom line is prevention is like that which could lock in the U.S from making important reforms in the future and would definitely raise prices in Mexico and Canada that style\nThat it it seems to me ... ... what's going on here Laurie and and reality check this for me please\nUm is that Donald Trump on the campaign trail identifies a real problem NAFTA has caused over a million jobs to be lost in the United states but the government acknowledges him and most people you know or the uh the opinion that is certainly probably you know six eight ten million jobs are lost as a result in after whatever it may be a huge\nA number one so he says I Want to do something about this then so everybody goes yeah great you know what's it like this guy and I think that that's you know that really helped him in Michigan Pennsylvania Ohio ... Wisconsin\nAnd then he takes those terrible deal and two weeks it a little bit gets rid of some of the really ups obscene Lee objectionable stuff but then an adult ads and a bunch of goodies for his buddies\nUm uh you know who are supporting his campaign and giving them money and at the end of the day is pretty much a wash it's really not going to bring jobs back it's really not going to solve the the big problems that we are confronting\nUm but he gets to declare victory and for the rooms and watch Fox News they're all going to think he actually did what he campaigned on is that are being too cynical or is that an accurate analysis\nThat may be where we are\nWhen the thing comes to Congress next year I think it's worth reserving judgment for one really important about two really important reason is the one that's the outstanding issue so there are some serious changes in the agreement\nI think it's an exact description of Trump and when he's up to but it's also the case that his top trade guys and the U.S trade representative is a guy named Robert Lighthizer\nAnd he's a serious guy for and he has opposes NAFTA an investor state tribunals and job outsourcing\nSuper smart and he's the guys in running the show on this ... so he actually has made some real changes that that are worth harvesting that are important that could make a difference so the investors state dispute settlements system those outrageous corporate\nCourt lights and tribunals are\nWhacked way way way back that corporate lobbies hysterics about this the investor incentives that basically subsidized job outsourcing the protections that meant less risky and cheaper moves got whacked that that is real stuff a transformational stuff actually show however\nApropos of your point about some of the corporate bodies they left a little opening a loop hole into which the oil and gas companies can try and why angle their way back into a state\nSo it's like hey you know Ninety percent solution on a very big problem so that they wrote some decent labor standards including this fairly dramatic antics\nThat for the first time would require that workers in Mexico get secret ballot elections on their union contracts right now there's like a there's like a whole rackets were these companies basically get paid by the boss to register a union they are themselves you know written down as a union but it's a business\nAll aboard joined me all the way for a once in a lifetime luxury Alaskan cruise on the region seven seem Mariner July Fourth twenty nine team called keen luxury travel at eight

them here with the Tom Hartmann group [noise]\n[noise] so let's check in with our media news and find out what's going on in the world has report\nBrought to you by goats for the old ... dot com and Ellen ... gloves and what you do on the line and this is Bob Ney the other side swipe congressman welcome back\nWell thank you Tom Cruise sounds fantastic\nYeah I'm looking forward to it Louis and I haven't been on a cruise low on time and this is a this is a really a kind of super fancy one uh which I you know in our in our in goaded share a luxury that we've never experience that's fine so anyhow what's up in the world today Bob\nWell it's kind of a President Trump and Kavanaugh FBI day I'll call it ... but if we can start a first of all a ... of course we know what happened with Senator Flake and he made the decision to\nSupport an FBI look into this entire thing\nAnd I had a lot of criticism that at some point in time it seems that rationally you know seem to of course go along with it he didn't have much of a choice anyway and then the Sunday shows started everybody would have kind of kept quiet for the camp by I don't think would have had as much controversy\nBut then there were comments about uh you know the president didn't want it to be a fishing expedition et cetera\nSo now the president has shed as of today was today that he wants the FBI investigation or the allegations against cabin ought to be quote comprehensive but then he walked the mentally defer to the Senate Republicans to dictate the scope\nSo there was a national media report about the president providing the bureau with witnesses they can't interview the White House is disputing that\nBut I don't know no one knows yet what the Senate Republicans ... at this point in time you know are saying about it\nI think Trump ally in through his teeth because he does that so often in so well\nDirections of what to do with it\nYeah I you know I think he's trying to characterize this as as something other than a than a handcuffed uh the investigation the FBI is told you can talk to these poor people if they offer you other witnesses or other people that you should talk to you may not talk to them\nYou can't take this any further than this you can't look into the question of how many times he committed perjury before the United States Senate in the past\nYou can't you can't look into the charges from a ... neck\nA Julius y neck or that in a gang rape was going on you may not and but you know I mean it's just it's a it's\nIt's wall paper you know it's er it's er it's essentially a cover up\nYou know we all know that the FBI uh brings back sometimes it's called non determination you know stats are facts but I think that um I Would assume that the Democratic side\nWe'll be able to or the FBI\nYou know what what was your scope and what it wasn't I Would assume they're going to have to answer that if in fact it's been narrowed\nBut the interference from the White House that may actually cause I'm some votes to go against Kavanaugh Republican me yes it may who vide especially for college or extreme heat\nFor callers and maybe I'm Rogalski yep it may provide heat if they and frankly flake himself\nWho asked for this I mean if you ask for something and then it is you find that is directly narrowed by the White House the White House can ask for something for example in the case of Anita Hill you know it was asked for they did a three day look at everything but the White House as I understand in that case didn't say here's what you look at\nThey told them to look at you know the are the allegations against Clarence Thomas\nYeah I Wonder where ... is an animal anyhow ... I'm Sorry\nAbout anyway yeah I wanted to say it but you know you can always say well it's inconclusive kept the ice is a stain on that on the topic of you know releasing information ... represented Maxine Waters has denied\nAnd she died this weekend of the eight or office posted personal confidential information about three members of the um [noise] read the Judiciary Committee who are Republicans and that was backed up by uh\nThe IT section by the way of the U.S house because they they can determine I can address this you know et cetera so I didn't want to mention that 'cause I got a little bit of a\nOf controversy toward period of time we are looking at NAFTA it's to be determined yet what exactly it means I mean I think it's positive that there was a deal cut frankly uh I didn't think candidate was going to come into it whatsoever but it it at nine o'clock or nine thirty right before the uh [noise]\nYou know the deadly I've been told Tom I don't know if you picked up anything that this was orchestrated by Jared Kushner\nHave you pick that up the trade deal yes\nNo I my understanding is Robert Lighthizer has been running the show\nRight but I I was told no I don't know my friends on Capitol Hill to cushion or had a huge a back and forth was I don't know doing some type of talking with somebody in Canada too\nOh yeah he might be the guy who brought Canada into it I I just I have no idea I haven't I haven't heard\nThat I don't have it confirmed by Showtime but I Do want to mention that that was possible so we've got to see the details of it and where you know in fact uh it all ways down Iran has launched missiles into eastern Syria and that's a basic retaliation or they are saying uh against militants over there who have stirred\nA lot of um different you know obviously movements against it in ... in the southwestern or region\nOf the laws in support of Assad essentially\nRight right and that's the uh the militant area which is also against the Saudi and against Iran and of course Iran is pointing out you know the implications the involvement of Saudi Arabia and it shows again that remains to be a little bit of a powder keg\nYeah I was just going to say Saudi Arabia can't be happy that Iran is helping Assad\nAll right and and there's proxy wars and then you have John Bolton and the White House who was constantly saying bomb bomb bomb and is a great influences you know his position with the White House in shape\nAnd then a there's a new democratic strategy this is fascinating ah I like grassroots politics\nAnd if you look what President Obama has been saying about uh you can bring your hands you can yell you can be angry and that's good but you need to do certain things well the national democratic training committee and ATC is launching the first ever online training platform it's called vote builder it's targeted by the waste almost specifically\nFor the most part two legislative races where you know the Democratic

vacations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh corresponded to medically explains the\nWhole and I wouldn't call it ... taking by the upper class yeah but it was that wasn't true in Chile\nOf course under I. N. de ... its its economic crisis so in because of Henry Kissinger and the CIA a ... and the IMF and you know they orchestrated a crisis in Chile they needed a crisis there was fuel shortages and everything else\nOf Weimar is is or I covered the war in Yugoslavia which was also caused by an economic meltdown what it is is in essence the the established political elites are unable to respond in a rational and effective way to increasing distress within the society and then are finally discredited by\nA usually an economic crisis or in our case you had the destruction of the popular movements including labor unions and I would argue the press that once protected\nAmerican working men and women are in essence the and both Republicans and Democrats especially under Clinton are culpable so the system seizes up its seized by a cabal in this case corporate\nSo all of the institutions rewrite the Louis ... a good book on this divide there's essentially two tiered legal system one for the rich one for the oligarchy one from corporations and then one for us um I mean they look at this point of orchestrated virtually attacks boycott under Eisenhower uh the highest\nTax rates for the wealthiest individuals and corporations was Ninety One percent\nI'm In out of control military we used to challenge weapon systems now Trump just gave them a ten percent increase and the running the wars in the middle east so essentially what happens is the system doesn't respond to the rights and grievances of the underclass and that\nProvides fertile territory for a demagogue like Trump or in the case of Yugoslavia ... Radovan heritage or go back to Weimar because in in Nineteen twenty eight\nThe Nazi Party in Weimar was pulling in the single digits then you had the Nineteen twenty nine crash how did ... and the Social Democrats respond well to impose draconian forms of austerity are demanded by the international banking system that had bail the government out including abolishing\nInsurance and what I fear as we stand on the cost of another economic dislocation it's coming even the New York times a couple of weeks ago ran an editorial on this or is that\nA everything is in place for some very frightening re configurations of American society we already have a president in office who insights violence\nWho is a openly carry out attacks against\nOther ethnic and racial groups I mean the whole idea that eleven million undocumented workers all of whom probably aren't below the minimum wage or somehow responsible for the economic freefall of the United states is patently absurd\nBut when they have a lock on the media system so I mean I mean you discuss it but but you know when or even on MSNBC are ever going to hear a serious discussion of corporate capitalism and how it works you know that's been banished from the airwaves yeah\nYeah and so and so we have now\nThe Republican Party planning to impose austerity on us\nA this you know and when we have these tax cuts permanent when this is insane but it goes beyond that I mean there there are serious conversations going on inside the Republican Party right now about can we use this debt or or wherever they\nYou know this was injured when it's the latest out in Seventy six with is to Santa Claus theory when you know when Republicans are in power run up the debt right I'm a crash coming to power just scream about the death and Reagan to write and exactly and in fact Reagan was the first president to actually enact when his case to Santa Claus to replant\nMe triple the national debt and the debt is reaching the point now where within ten years our interest payments on the national\nDebt and New York times nine hundred bill yeah are going to exceed our military or the right and well not just the military education oh all the military budget already has some similar and all that stuff and so what it is\nProviding these guys is and their guinea about yeah of course perfect cues\nTo to impose austerity are literally just say you know we really can't afford\nFederal long term unemployment insurance I mean they've already cut about a one year and we can no longer afford Social Security we can no longer afford to Medicare Medicaid we can't afford that that's for poor people\nAnd and and and then they're going to get a court if they get Kevin on the court is going to go back to the locker era and say you know Medicare and Social Security or actually unconstitutional they should be voluntary programs and the minute they become voluntary programs they're dead this is a massive re configuration of America that we're right on the edges robot he's talking about the strikes that the Republicans that I Know who are\n... ... is there any I Know I I Can't come up with a better word this is about to happen we've been working since Nineteen thirty\nFive when John Ralston Saul calls are slow motion coot coup d'etat Don slow motion and we are now coming to the day no more of that and the and it let's be clear the Democratic party has been culpable in this\nOh I agree you know this is the deal and that is not just a Republican yeah in the late eighties yeah this this ball though and you are right we are ads for the Democratic ... away from that and that's why the police\nIn your town or carrying long barreled weapons and wearing Kevlar vest and driving armored personnel carriers\nRight because they're they're anticipating social unrest which will happen if we have austerity so Chris Hedges what do we do about this\nWe have to ... you know and the ... the problem is is not an overnight we have to rebuild those popular movements that\nCreated a rational response where the breakdown of capitalism under Roosevelt in the Nineteen thirties so to start with unions of course unions we have to rebuild I mean we people like you and me who've been pushed to the margins of\nThe media landscape of ... because the subjects that we tackle or taboo a of in the corporate landscape including of course Comcast which owns MSNBC or NPR PBS is wholly owned subsidiary now the Koch brothers um so we have to rebuild\nInstitutions to pit power against power but they
