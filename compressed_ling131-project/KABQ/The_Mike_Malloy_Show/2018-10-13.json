a lot of stuff in films and candidate because they avoid some level of uh I don't know if it's union or whatever it is there's a lot of cost savings for film\nThat and then there's a lot of places are a lot of states where they're offering a different tax incentives to encourage\nFell short enough that's mayor here in this uh this story Sarah what are your thoughts here I mean do you think this is a going to change things for Albuquerque make things better\nWell I mean you got me that I really listen I get\nYour because people are going to get jobs and so therefore they don't you feel like they wouldn't have to steal things\nThat I guess that's probably\nTrue\nI think that's absolutely true um however I don't know if Netflix is going to be hiring the copper wire seats\nRight and a thousand ... it says creating a thousand jobs annually\nThat doesn't necessarily mean that every year there's going to be another thousand people so that at the end of ten years it's ten thousand people it could be that they're hiring people for one year contracts\nAnd they keep hiring the same thousand people and there's a good chance that people are going to meet at a lot of the the are also temporary jobs sure you get a job working on this particular show\nAnd then that shows died and then somebody else comes leave and go somewhere else and then they hire somebody for another show there are things for the call tonight appreciate it it's\nA we have been talking about Netflix not tonight but on just over time and uh how they're providing real competition to Hollywood and that's why Hollywood doesn't like them they're doing things differently than Hollywood has done things they're releasing television shows all in one batch\nRight so instead of like what HBO or Showtime or ABC or Fox where traditionally they would release one show per week or one show per day depending on the kind of show it is a Netflix just produces a whole bachelor shows and releases the entire season all at once\nYeah it's it's interesting certain aspects of a Netflix and how they've got about like trying to eliminate a certain ... ah like they used to be you had to\nBuy the rights within a giving territory for a a movie to to show it sure and that's looks has kinda gone and said we don't want to do that we want to be able to you know or I'll give people worldwide access to really they don't have restrictions or for certain\nPrograms they have they been working towards eliminating a good for them yeah territorial our rights and and ... like only going or moving towards\nMore and obviously they can do this with their inhouse contents sure and but they can't do that in many cases with her external content and so they actually licensing the number of movies that have been the ... and I don't know I I get the impression that's partially because they're\nThey're trying to move away from well bless you know some of the other companies are trying to um start their own services so I heard now I don't know if they've done it yet but I've heard that Disney had Disney yet and um and\nSo therefore Disney will then cancel all their agreements with the Netflix is of the world who lose or whatever and they'll say if you want to see the black cauldron or whatever you know a lot and uh you'll have to go to the Disney streaming right pay whatever Disney's rates are so that way Disney can make all the money off of that rather than whatever\n... as I understand that there is a little bit of the Disney content that will still be on whatever the other streaming platform is really just because of existing\nNow because of existing agreements because one of those run out because the ABC old Disney and so yeah they can't move everything because our existing\nOkay yeah you gotta literally agreement on right now but ... over the next five years or however long right in the ... are going to go away so if you want to comment You're welcome to here we are going to the phones to

Netflix\nCurrently has a facility in LA on a okay on an existing studio lot so bitter their hands to just be\nI don't know if they're renting yeah uh I haven't been able to find that detail or but apparently this you know new acquisition is going to open up\nA and New Mexico obviously where Breaking Bad was filmed where medical saw was filmed\nSo little to take place in in that you know ...\n... there are things that take place in New York City that are filmed on a lot in\n... and ... or ... or what but a New Mexico as I understand it as one of those states that has offered the various tax breaks and incentives to get a movie studios and TV studios to film in their state\nOh fairly ... Los Angeles has a lottery based incentive program to gets production\nBased in LA next week Netflix is chief content officer ... said that Netflix would not be like other studios and chased tax incentive to New York Atlanta in other cities around the globe whereas math and the rest of Hollywood revolves around getting twenty five thirty five percent back on below the line production costs\nA surrenders indicated that keeping talent and filmmakers close to their families and homes will say Netflix core value\nFor three years Netflix spent top dollar to attract top talent and I.

I'm hoping there is one that the Democrats and progressives are going to put out and I'd like to get a copy and put it in our local paper at least is there any information about\nThat and I'm guessing by the way in a while your local papers probably owned by getting at the company that owns USA Today they own smaller papers\nOver there they are as sit sit here and the and USA Today yeah okay congressman well\nThe best response to Donald Trump's op ed is Donald Trump's own words I mean someone should simply print from his book the America we deserve which he published in two thousand his defense\nOf a single payer system his admission back then that candidate had a superior healthcare system his argument in that book that while he is usually a free market person he believes that single payer healthcare is cheaper and has better benefits so what USA Today really ought to do in these papers ought to do\nIs take that excerpt from his book and print it and print that side by side with the a bed of course Bernie Sanders has done a full response but Trump is basically contradicting something he believed Fifteen Years ago\nThat's amazing cars I had no idea I'd written a book that Sunday\nHe hated its in America we deserve and he actually says I think Canada has a better healthcare system than we do ah I usually a free market person but when it comes to health care I think a single payer system is better and I really think the Democrats need to be putting this out more that ah this this was Donald Trump's own view back in two thousand\nAh is incredible Joe in Cupertino, California you're on the earth cars from kind of\nTheir morning Tom good morning congressman I'm more interested in trying to follow up are made contact with your office and I got a really nice letter in regards to you or your support of\nWhat's going on with the Kavanaugh scene but you know yesterday I saw congressman or senator Harris' interviewing\nA Christopher Wray and I was dismayed I could see that with a loaded it Merrick Garland ... himself from hearing the referral and his admission that the scope and limitations set by the White House over the Kavanaugh confirmations here he's really concerns me now\nI'm Thomas talked about activities court was more a courtroom Supreme Court people but I don't believe we should go to seed this nomination do our disappointment to the Supreme Court which was sitting out in front of us I I Believe\nI'm Dr Ford and I'd like to know as at Yale graduate what do you think about the fact that they weren't seeing class or not being Christopher Wray in a cabin on how he can\nNot refuse himself in the parents what appears to be a conflict of interest and I I just wanted to actually you can take or who you can persuade ... do you do run this to ground because I think the Supreme Court deserves to be fully staffed with confidence people not just whoever's picked and I'll Wait for your answer after\nAmen congressman did you graduate from the lead illogical\nYeah I Try I Try not to mention that I Am [laughter] I don't know [laughter] it's a\n... and he would have went to Georgetown Prep for or or Yale ... is a highly against the clock\nRang in their hands right now [laughter]\nBut uh I I appreciate the caller's comment said let me make two concrete uh points first Jerry Adler who hopefully we'll be chairing the Judiciary Committee has said that we are going to continue to investigate the manner\nOr and or the house Judiciary Committee will have tremendous ah power over this Nancy Pelosi has said that the FBI report\nA ought to be declassified and a ought to be made public that we're going to subpoena a that we're going to a piano or the FBI we're going to try to do our own investigation or to get to the bottom of this\nThe second thing in terms of the court expansion I was just talking to Bruce Ackerman the other day who teaches at Yale and he pointed out that one of the things we ought to do as a modernized the Supreme Court just from a perspective of\nA what we need we need for the twenty first century the Supreme Court currently only hearing eighty cases that's down from a hundred and eighty four cases during the Reagan Administration the reason that they're not able to hear these cases as they have so many Cirque petitions and nine justices simply isn't sufficient\nThe court started with six justices and Lincoln and Jefferson\nAdded justices so we want to look in a reform that would be a for expanding the court maybe you can have a super majority required for confirmation to modernize the court in the twenty first century and then I think we'll avoid a constitutional crisis\nBut if we don't modernize the court and you have majority Harry and policies struck down by counter mature and tearing cork that's going to be far worse\nYou know and these are things that can be a pastor Congress and the simple majority vote\nOr they they are but you know one other thing that this is Bruce act with idea but he and he spent his whole life studying the constitution you could actually term limited justices or and then have them sort of on a court of appeals because the constitution says they\nNeed to be in the judiciary for life not that they need to be on the Supreme Court for life so you could see it system of ten twelve years on the Supreme Court and then you go down to the court of appeals\nOh that's interesting because at the founding of the republic they all rode the circuit in fact they did that until Eighteen Ninety One\nUm that's why they kept expanding the number of justice is because the number of circuits went all the way up to ... which is why there were ten ten a justice is during the Lincoln administration and then of course they cut it down to six when I entered Johnson came in because the radical Republicans were seriously PO the jobs and it was a democratic cetera et cetera but all that drama but wow I Am that's uh\nSo go to W.

we're done we support all your attack on the time that's fine let's talk about what's possible\nFor the Iowa and New Jersey in El Paso Texas you're on the air with congressman caught\nTom and Congressman Tom I Want to make this this is so important and when you go vote I Want everybody to go in vogue go vote early and when you go into the polling place and they tell you at your name is not on the list\nAsked request make it known hey I Want to vote on a provisional ballot\nVote on that provisional ballot she'll it in an envelope and you fill it in another antelope in on that how tight envelope you put your name and address and all the required information and your boat hash it count because you are a registered voter you were just taken off the voter lists that gets you re registered\nAs soon as he does that does not get eerie register for him forgive the eruption but it does not um if you cast supervision for example when when ... when John Kerry conceded the because of the Ohio vote he lost by about a hundred and twenty thousand votes as I recall there were over a hundred and sixty thousand provisional ballots that had not even been opened\nProvisional ballots are only counted if after the election in ... it varies from state to state but in most states you have to go physically to\nThe office of whoever you know the the the county registrars or this the secretary of state depending on the state\nYou have to go physically to the office with your passport your birth certificate all the other stuff that you need to re register and and prove that you are who you say you are and then it sometimes in some states here ... will be counted but this will be a long after election day so yes a provisional ballots but it is not it is not what you're describing says\nWell I worked the election Tom in what state you're in Texas in\nThe state of Texas and they gave you provisional ballots and they get ... because if somebody's in the car and they cannot get out to the polls\nTo vote right Suzie reply to say please check I mean there may ... heads as possible attacks us all the Texas is the only state in the union that does that\nUm but to the best of my knowledge there is no state we're filling out a provisional ballot is the same thing as registering to vote or making sure that you're registered\n... and I believe that even in Texas the provisional ballots are not crowded Suzie I just you know if if if I'm wrong I Will correct myself by the end of the show but I'm virtually ... percent certain that I'm writing\nYears I've done this for Twenty years Tom I'm telling people to vote provisional ballot I'll in Texas okay I got there at the office of the state okay a provisional ballot\nYeah and the placebo about any of congressman your thoughts on this what do you know about this\n... well I think through these uh animating principle that everyone needs to vote early is right but I Would encourage people to be voting provision all I think they need to be registered and voting is time you're right that provisional ballots aren't counted until after the election day many times candidates have already conceded or the media is already called the election\nI Do think we need lawyers and advocacy to try to make sure to those provisional ballots are counted ah but um my understanding is that it's very hard to get those provisional ballots counted and often they don't get counted so uh that's something that we need to uh to fight for it but to the point that we need people going in voting early and we need people\nAre aware that uh the the tactics that folks are going to go to disenfranchise them I think is the important take away\nTo Linda in Deerfield Beach Florida you're on the air with cars from Kara\nHi I'm thank you uh congressmen and time for taking my call I wanted to hit you real quick fun fact\nUh the federal judge rules against extending voter registration down here in Florida judge Robert ... no you're not going to it hit the where the hurricane hit the pan handle her I said no I wasn't that nice\nHotel and the rest of city isn't it we can't let that happen that we can't let people vote there some water and the interruption town right\nCollege I'm Gillum Gillum happens to be from Tallahassee so I mean these folks know exactly what they're doing and who they're trying to disenfranchise\nAbsolutely the young voters but um my other question was and I don't know if you know anything about this because a congressman ... can\nI said that they're putting a committee or together for the Teamsters pension I'm One of those many four hundred thousand not pension ears and uh they're talking about now cutting Medicare they're now talking about Social Security\nI Am almost sixty congressman I Can't make this money that was I was supposed to get fourteen hundred a month and now I'm not even going to get Social Security on top of it how long they want me to work I mean I'm just ... have you heard anything on our pension plan to a teamster pension plan\nI appreciate raising it I have and Marco can enrich your Neal who is going to be hopefully the chair of the ways and Means Committee and Tim Ryan a all have been working on this there is a house\nA bill in ... to protect and shore up a pension plans it's just a wrong for people like you to work their whole lives and then a C. or their pension not to be there for them\nAnd so this is going to be a priority for House Democrats and it's a priority frankly that progressive than more moderate Democrat Sherrod say consensus view so I'm quite optimistic once we get back the house that we should be able to get something done\n... harbor Washington You're on the air with congressman Scott\nHi thanks for taking my call um [noise] my question is if we knew about voter suppression\nAnd the purging back in two thousand how come it was a emphasize are brought to light prior to the two thousand six gee elections and what can be done now and can't we like to the states for these kinds of activities\nBut I didn't\nVotes in any restriction on the boat is the subject a prosecution by law or are\nWe at and get rid of the electoral college so that one man one woman\nOne vote house so we have a real democracy yeah uh in our country right now we don't have that with the joy of college and as much as you talk about voting and we'd get rid of that electoral college well we don't have a tree\nDemocracy in America [noise]\nGarnishment add if it wasn't for the electoral college we would have a seven to two progressive majority on the court right now because both Bush and Trump lost in the electoral college\nI I agree with the caller I agree with you Tom that the electoral college is outdated anti democratic or I read somewhere that the Senate majority is now going to be representing about Eighteen percent of the population so we do have these structures there\nAre are not reflective of the popular will the only thing we can do in the onslaught of money in these anti democratic uh structures is to mobilize and to\nGet out and vote a into organized in a way they can over time uh the concerted power on the other side it's a\nA fight or for the soul of our democracy\nLincoln in El Cerrito California you're on the air with Congress and kind of\nLincoln hello there hey you're on the air I didn't hear a minute this is Lincoln pain yeah you're on the air\nEither um I'd like to talk about shifting the burden of taxation from corporate America through the wealthy\nMoney income profits are not actually well until they're ... the individual I think that the Democrats could steal a serious march on Republicans well actually calling food ... of corporate income jak none of those doctors but corporate income tax\nAnd beginning your return Jean progressive tax structure on the wealthy but we had before ...\nCongressman I I Would like to to add to what you are inside and that is that uh that that a\nSales pitch for no corporate taxes which has been coming from the libertarians and the Koch brothers for a long long time ignores the fact that corporations use our comments which is what taxes pay for\nCorporations use you know they've got it at an educated workforce by virtue of our public schools um they get to work by a public roads are they use the same infrastructure electricity to telephones everything all all these ... rights away though that we collectively own\nAnd that are in fact you can make the argument ... depending on the industry and that might be a way to adjust taxes corporate income taxes or even just taxes in general\nUm they actually probably in many cases particularly the polluting industry has a has a much greater impact on the commons than individual voters two and a half or even an individual billionaires do so I think I can make an argument that we should raise corporate taxes back like you know back to where they were back you know during the Eisenhower administration\nOne third of the total income to the federal government was from corporate taxes now it's down to a lot of ... percent\nAre your thoughts I agree with your time and the that the corporate uh there's no argument for the corporate tax cuts that the Republicans are passed\nA they also are by the way or the top corporations are consuming the most energy ... contributing to climate change most of these corporations the effective tax rate is ten a present in some cases is zero percent where they're paying a no corporate tax because of all of the deductions\nI and I traveled around the country to places like Huntington West Virginia painful Kentucky Jefferson, Iowa places that\nVoted for Donald Trump I Am never heard\nA local mayor or or local community say to me you know one or because of these corporate tax cuts suddenly we're getting jobs\nIn our communities what they talk about is the need for high speed Internet a community college education apprenticeship programs the money would be far better spent a on those programs rather than these massive handouts to corporations which by the way aren't even located often in the United states in terms of the employee base it's\nA really a tax cut that's helping people uh many outside the United states\n[noise] Alan in Oakland, California we had about two minutes till the end of the hour here Alan you're on the with congressman kinda please make of\nProtecting my calls settlements far media constantly terrorists the myth that our elections are free and fair most Americans are not well enough for him to to realize the fall sort of that ... the Republicans only win by massive disenfranchisement gerrymandering\nBut most pernicious of a changing the vote counts electronically to totally on verifiable electronics are voting systems with secret tabulation software I suggest every\nDemocratic office holder immediately challenged the fact that we now have fake elections\nEvery time they take the floor in Congress or at any press interview or a town hall\nThe demand must be for can't talented paper ballots with full transparency now with everyone being allowed to vote the American people need to be educated that we have elections theater novel elections and the Democrats have been silent on this for the last Eighteen years of stuff to Florida\n\nBut I I agree with the caller that we need paper ballots or paper verification I also think we need a ballots to be posted on a website publicly so that you can trace to make sure that your ballot or was actually received in counted and there is a public accounting of that uh they was necessary to\nMake sure that people believe in our process and so that there is no tampering in any election and the tampering is often most possible in local elections I mean obviously it would take a huge conspiracy given the localized nature of our elections to\nA rig voting machines in every county in every jurisdiction that's not the case when you're talking about local elections where fraud and hacking is even easier\nYeah congressman or a little less than a minute here about a half a minute thoughts on the next week or the upcoming week\nWell we're uh in recess so most of the focus has been of course on the ... elections and making sure that uh we're mobilizing our base in ... giving it everything we have\nTo win back the house I did have an Internet bill of rights that I put forward I mean after the uh news about the Facebook scandal uh in Equifax and now Google's breaches or we need some legislation that's going

from hurricane Michael correspondent Martin savages more on search and rescue efforts in hard hit Mexico Beach Florida\nUnfortunately in Mexico beach today the first victim was discovered the name has been released its mail it was a person who was discovered in what they say is the debris field several hundred yards away from his home and unfortunately authorities believe it won't be the last such discovery\nI'm In the context of story would it be the today increasingly and those are I Would say since the Reagan presidency we've said that the American dream is Steve Jobs with somebody who you know we have done something and it becomes a billionaire\nOr or Bill Gates or you know fill in the black\nWhereas a historically and certainly this was my understanding the American dream back when my dad used to talk about it you were a tool and die shop his whole life but he could he could put his he you know he raised for kids ... you could get through college he\nWas a small crew of six of us in a three bedroom one bathroom house but it was you know seem cool laws that was the American dream you took the other two week vacation every year he bought a new car every two years\nUm and and he was a single brought in Britain winter I mean that's the American dream right that you're talking about\nYeah absolutely and and I think that that's it right that that the the sense that the country was there to protect the rights of everyone and to aspire to equality of opportunity but also that you know the so certainly that notion that if you work hard you could provide for your family and all of those ideas that are under threat\nUm but you know they've always been threatened by inequality and when when you know too much ... what else is in the hands of too few people that opportunity constrict where everybody else but now people too many people in my view would say that the solution is the American dream of\nIndividual free market opportunity but that's just you know that's just exacerbating the problem whereas a hundred years ago they were arguing that\nThe American remember reminding us that the American dream was not about wealth the American dream was about democracy equality and justice and that those things would be threatened by two by two I'm much you know individual accumulation of of wealth and power so so that some of the earliest examples I found\nSaid that a multimillionaire would be the death of the American dream because that was the worst possible thing for the country for that much wealth to be in the hands of so few\nWhile and then America First the genesis of the ...\nYeah so America First I'm I'm like the American dream it hasn't kind of flipped its meaning I'm like that but it it is an older and darker phrase than I think most people realize when Trump resuscitated it and it began to be you know used again and commented on a lot of people noted rightly that it was associated with Charles Lindbergh\nAnd the America First movement of Nineteen forty in Nineteen forty one to keep America\nOut of the second World War but it actually is it is a good twenty to Thirty years older than that\nAnd it was incredibly ubiquitous in the political conversation in America from Nineteen Fifteen going forward it was the campaign slogan of Wilson and his Republican opponent a Nineteen sixteen Wilson used it to urge America to stay out of the first World War\nUm but very quickly I got taken up in the name of isolationism protectionism Harding ran on at America First platform in Nineteen twenty to keep America from signing the treaty of Versailles and joining the league of nations\nHe tried to pass a permanent protection as terrorists in the name of America First and throughout the Nineteen twenties again in the name of America First there was sweeping anti immigration laws that were passed that were um ruthlessly ethnic in their\nUh uh I'm In their thinking and indeed you genesis um and that they were they were that those were the immigration laws that established quotas um of different ethnic communities that was known as the national origins act so only certain certain number of people from a given an ethnic origin we're going to be allowed into the country and not law\nHeld from Nineteen twenty four to Nineteen sixty five that was in the name of America First so it was as it is now a way of talking about isolationism and protectionism but at the same time it became associated with\nThe rising power of the Ku Klux Klan um which of course was I'm very dominant in the Nineteen twenties and they would carry America First banners date they took out advertisement saying that they were the America First party\nAnd they um you know that you tried to copyright the the slogan at one point I mean that was how much they kind of associated themselves with it the thing and I think you know people know that if you you know people on on social media and in journalism have commented on the fact that\nThe KKK is associated with America First I think much less well known is that at the same time in the early Nineteen twenties when Mussolini was taking power in Italy of course that was when the word fascism entered the English language was when Mussolini was using it\nAnd what I found was that in this conversation around the country that was happening in the early Nineteen twenties people were trying to understand what this new organization the KKK was all about\nAnd they were also trying to understand what Mussolini fascism was all about you know maybe separately right but that was another thing to try to explain to your readers and for people to try to understand\nAnd and when people were trying to define these two things they defined them in terms of each other\nSo what they said over and over again was if you want to understand what the KKK stands for it's basically um ... Mussolini is doing but in America or if you want to know Mussolini is doing it's basically America First but in Italy it's Italy First um and they constantly treated them as synonymous and reciprocal\nIn other words it was very very clear to them that the KKK with a fascist organization and that America First was being used as a fascist slogan from as early as the Nineteen twenties and and it's just kind of everywhere in the political conversation in the twenties and it increasingly became associated with white ethno nationalist\nFascist movements I'm with an American fascism homegrown American fascism and you know I don't know about you but when I was growing up I wasn't learning about American fascist movements I wasn't learning about the history of American Nazi movements I wasn't really learning about the the the true horrors of the Ku Klux Klan\nAnd what they perpetrated you know we learned about burning crosses we I didn't learn in school about spectacle lynching and about the fact that the KKK burned people alive I'm up through at least Nineteen thirty four and and and that was associated with ideas like America First\nWell neither did I. S. or we just have a minute and a half from forward I had a heartbreak here um what do we do with the snow we're talking with sir a Church World I Will because we hold America\nWell I Hope we use it took to fight back I Hope we use it to recognize the danger that I really do think that we're facing I I I think that we use it to fight back against arguments that what we're looking at is in fascism just because it's a twenty Eighteen version of it um and because it's a very American version of it\nUm and I think we use it particularly to to to push back against arguments on by the alt right that you know that there that this isn't fascism that it's not not seeing them um you know I I Am of the school that says if it walks like a duck and you know I'm an ... quacks like a duck than it than it is\nAnd and you know I think we have to recognize the danger that were in in order to uh in order to\nFight if you're explicitly defining the Trump Administration is fascists\n[noise] um I think that they are promoting fascist policies unquestionably [noise] um and what that\nYou know where that takes us is is going to be you know question that we don't know the answer to it on the history will show but there are certainly that some of the the policies that they are supporting particularly the the white nationalist policies that they are supporting our fascist\nAnd the authoritarian on policies that they're trying to implement some of those just our fascist policies they are recognize a plea\nBowden donated over eight million pairs yes donated why\nWe learned that sucks the number one most requested clothing I've been homeless shelters so we started bomb us but the mission of donating a pair of socks for every pair we sell to donate and saw a lot of socks we became obsessed with comfort we reinvented\nThe sock from the ground up using the best materials available like this often most comfortable cotton getting rid of what wasn't working like that annoying co seem you can probably feel if you wiggle your toes right now\nAnd inventing a few new comfort innovations along the way like our support that feels like a hug around your mid foot\nAt work people tried them love them told their friends about helping selling donate over eight million pairs\nChina now at ... dot com ...
