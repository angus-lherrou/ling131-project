want to stop him do our show they want to but they are creating a dictatorship\nSpot market like your analysis than I Do agree with you that an alternative approach would have been much more effective\nHis approach was I think an one that alienates a lot of people I don't see how Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska could have heard his tone and the conduct of his language and and found some did his oh yeah that's the kind of a vote or [laughter] I Know that\nI don't think you come to you know that kind of approach isn't isn't gun Jeff Flake of Arizona who have been given moment which I was it was our\nOnly one hour window homes you can say about what judge Joe\nI Want to do with George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and the boys would about our nation today most thank you very much I Do appreciate the call I appreciate the contribution and I'm Glad you called and and as a way I'm Glad you called ...\nI Know I'm I'm I'd call you too often I guess you know by ... you know\nIn a cage county yeah he tells me as early as you know [laughter]\nSay Hi to bomb or Mao is you see him next please [laughter] okay\nI Will okay ah the guy who called you name it J. worked for him I don't know what nationality or whatever but I Know he's a jerk\nOkay do you mean the guy the guy called me up and come in and I do [laughter]\nOkay as we hear about the war with the ... the judge will the Jewish jokes that it means that he was a huge Jewish joke and Jews has long\nDark I don't know what about anything else about him but I Know he's a charge on them\nBut it is man these isn't it isn't he just like on American I mean I\nYou know we I mean where is the way out of this and I'm not\nAn American and he is the point as we here's the point\nI could have changed my name is a hill H. I. L. L. and I could have passed right and there were a light skinned black people through the ages who have quote unquote past\nRiots and there was this guy Griffin who does experiment right around the time I was born in fifty nine and he wrote a book called the black ... black like me black white meat Griffin and they made a movie with James ... and he he\nHad an unlimited ads whacking for about ... in Louisiana's he trusts sometimes use white and sometimes you watch any chronicled ...\nSo you're right I could have changed my name but this is America\nIrish people are proud of their heritage Italian\nHeritage center everybody's mounted their heritage\nSo I wanted to use the guy I'm not going to give him give him time especially you know something as horrible as that\nAnd I called them and not see 'cause obviously that's not the best with the Nazis do but the point is that the point is is that everybody is allowed to be a\nProud of their heritage and that's why it didn't change my name is proud of my heritage is anyone is allowed to Hungarians can be proud of bears right Muslim people proud of their heritage everybody gets an intimate for all of us and being an American means you understand that\nAnd you accepted but there's so many things aside from our own individual heritage that binds us together as\nAmericans in this melting right so the ... that's that's why he's not an American and that's why he was gone on as we I'm Glad to be up to this way we're able to just finally slammed the door on that point please get\nOkay no no I'm going to make a couple of comments about the hearing today\nYes norm yes\nOK I'm OK I'm OK if they if anybody has any doubt about whether or not to vote for this guy I've got to work to to point this guy credibility\nCredibility they wanted to see if that does for was credible she was okay and the other one is maybe the opposite of credibility because this man would not agree to an FBI investigation\nIf he's if he's not guilty I mean if he is innocent that how he's going to prove it he doesn't want to put it\nIt's all ... ... it's a giant cover up\nAnd so to me I was watching a pet a logical or else I'm\nLike a thing you know with these these uh so so called senators course supposed to be our leaders is just being\nAs a pet pets that allergy there\nThey don't they don't want to do they don't know the truth or they don't want it for you know so um but they know to me there is no reason anybody should doubt told to do what the vote did not have this guy on the Supreme Court doesn't guy along data unfit and he's unfit\nDonald Trump is on said why in the White House I mean we've got another one I don't I'm Ben Carson has to be heard secretary Rick Perry is unfit images that day I mean we've got a lot of evidence that most of them to be education I guess we got a lot to witness around\nRight that that's because they've been put out bad on fit the one who got it for the unfit want unfit a little\nOf walks together has such a genius and Rudy your radio down there so\nThat that is to me there is no question if you got any kind of a you know the thing is a day for this country you will not put that man on the Supreme\nCourt as we use now with the isn't this what they said the Hillary if you know ... ... email ... dons the\nAs we thank you for the call and I'm just happy that we are seeing things so we're Leon starkly now\nBecause the entirety virtually the entire there are the people on the far fringes but leaving that aside there only small numbers the vast majority of Americans are seeing the Republicans now in their last full desperate raw\nNeed you grab for power they're seeing the Republicans\nEvidence ruefully covering up evidence right not to be me mark judge doing everything they can to not investigate after they spent endless amount of money in years going after being guys even Hillary's emails so\nI Believe that America really is changing we will find out the night of November the six months it looks to me like a lot of people are evolving\nAre people there are people who are saying you know I never would've thought I'd vote for Democrats but I'm voting for Democrats this time line once you start going for a Democrat in your perspective changes things change\nAm I pronouncing is it is it winds stir wind stir waster ad now that that's not on your driver's license is already the this on does not on your driver's license is it ...\nYou know you can call yourself no man I can go myself Wayne Slater\nDude I can go if I call myself Norman gold man than I I accept whatever anybody close are we going to do here calling still higher gas I call them I guess it's only wants to be called so wind sir what's on your mind\nWell I watched and I'd rather listen because that was in my car listening to both the doctor and I asked him to the judge\nAnd uh I think that people who have already made up their minds it's not going to change their minds because frankly evidence doesn't change their minds but if you listen to it objectively if you watched it objectively there is no way that you came away\nLeading the judge because I think she described a monster and I think he came on right afterwards and acted\nLike a monster so I don't think anybody who watch or listen to it objectively come to any other conclusion\nAbsolutely and that is not only is that a very a great point I bought mine stir let me let me let's take it to a sub category demographically which is women\nThere are less as our callers have been chronicling here today there are lots and lots and lots of women who have been voting Republican especially voted for Benedict Donald enroll scratching our heads why my question is after what we saw today\nWith with the the really\nWrong contrast between Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh how many more women are going to be migrating away saying I'm Sorry the Republican Party but\nI just can't get they they hate me I'm a woman and they hate me and they've got nothing for me I've got to go over to the Democratic side because it's a matter of my personal safety now so it on don't we see this is Justin ... I mean there's this may be more of kind\nSpacecraft those names but Nick after the Russian word for satellite\nThe U.S government and military and scientific community was caught off guard by the Soviet technological achievements and they're United efforts to catch up with the Soviets heralded the beginning of the space race this week in Nineteen sixty five ... arrives at Kennedy international

you back on a journey to this week in sports history started way back in Nineteen oh three for the first World Series begins play\nBoss in American beat the Pittsburgh Pirates\nFive games the three and a best of nine series\nThis week in Nineteen thirty two it was Babe Ruth legendary call three points to center field before ... into the Wrigley Field bleachers in the fifth inning game three of

remains one of the most\nMemorable moments in sports history referred to as the shot heard round the world this week in Nineteen eighty Larry Holmes retains has WB the heavyweight title defeating Mohammed Ali and this week in two thousand one in the Atlanta Braves defeat the Florida Marlins twenty to three\nTo clinch the national league east title and become the first team in professional sports which\nTend to secular division title stature I heart radio weekend sports\nTime capsule [noise]\nAll this going on today we have\nSkipped our interview with Jamie cord normally this time we'd be doing an interview with Jamie corn runner friend from consumer watchdog however Jamie and I met and\nConferred is the lawyers were saying earlier today he's not a lawyer actually but we did we we we talked about in given what's going on a no so we have skipped the interview with Jamie which means I've got this half hour for you at one triple eight three two one six thousand and one and\nThe Republicans you may recall this earlier this week the Republicans in the Senate\nScheduled a vote in the Senate Judiciary committee for tomorrow right that had the testimony today if the two witnesses norther investigation they're going to have the hearing the vote tomorrow that was scheduled earlier in the weekend by golly they're going forward with it a lemon Republicans\nAnd Democrats we already know are the ten Democrats are voting they're voting no\nNow the hand of eleven Republicans are definitely voting yes Jeff Flake remains Mm I suspect to vote yes now if they they're they're going to vote that's the latest breaking news is the Republicans they were voting that's\nIn the Senate Judiciary committee that's only one senator is there's a hundred in the full body and therefore just because they get them through the Senate Judiciary committee tomorrow doesn't mean it's over because then next week will be the big vote the final vote hundred senators does he get on the Supreme Court\nThat's going to be the big vote it'd be nice to defeat him in committee Jeff Flake cannot be relied upon he's always won eight eighty three two one six thousand and one and by the way he's proven he's a weasel hey Julie I Know you you're not a weasel things were gone then or may Goldman and Joe\nReally Julie Julie Julie\nI generally give me a bus back one eight eight eight three two one six zero zero one Pete and Chicago beat\nBy an arm and I'm really a listener I thanks for a brief shit I'm\nWhat I'd like to do is focus um um Kavanaugh's testimony in response\nTo senator coverage her when she was asking about blackout drinking\nHe did not answer the question he threw her back on or you know I'm always surprised because she's a former prosecutor and she didn't stay with her question but he never answered that and I think that's very telling um are your thoughts I\nWell not only do I agree with you but I agree with you even more because there's been a migration of very subtle migration\nBrett Kavanaugh ... even as recently as a few days ago was saying no I didn't drink I'm On a few beers now with this essentially saying well maybe I had a little too many but it was on the weekend he's been subtly trying to expand the admission of the drinking so that\nIs we don't have the stark contrast if a guy saying I never took a drop and then everybody saying he was a lot it was a blackout drunk so he's been trying to navigate\nThis by kind of edging that's my view of the matter he's been trying to edge into this yes I drank drank too much sometimes but I never did any of this and that's kind of where he is is kind of story has come to rest\nBut I I agree with you that\nThere's a lot to be minded is a lot of evidence there are a lot of old witnesses to be found as ... as to how much breaking years doing that and I was treated women when you were willing to\nWrap it shows his a base of math in contrast to the commander\nOf Dr Blasey Ford and unfortunately it should set them up for perjury but the follow up question what they were forced to answer the question yes or no and um because I\nReally should have set them up for a future perjury I have to tell you the politicians are really good at not answering questions I mean they're really good at dodging questions there I mean\nIt's as it happens all the time I see it all the time on the talking heads and so ah but you know it it's just\nThe question is more political than it is anything else and here's why I say that\nOn the merits Brett Kavanaugh has no business being on the Supreme Court convict on the merits ... up in fact on the merits Brett Kavanaugh has no basis being on the DC circuit right now he's been proven to be a liar\nAbout the ... the stolen\nMemos back when he was working for George W. Bush right he he said he never got them you never saw them to know anything about it it's been proven he got them he forwarded them from his own email it's been proven he lived there he's been proven liar or a liar about is drinking and the extent of his drinking\nAnd so on the merits she doesn't belong on any court\nDemands a federal judge you can't be a perjury is denied these things under oath he obviously it it it it is not qualified for the Supreme Court or any court but like I said it's political this is a political process\nBill Cosby's in jail\nThis guy is trying to get on the Supreme Court this guy shot thanks for being with us in Illinois just\nA norm I hey how're you doing a\nVery well what's up what's so I ... you know\nYeah I have spoken before us or in a you know he was a ... given all was anything but can try he was absolutely Oh absolutely was more recalcitrant than than\nThe ... in fact the value Adam and who just called before you and I forgot his name already and I apologize he used the word evasive and that's\nThe word I before the show even started when I was writing down different words and why would assess the the the two witnesses one of the words I wrote down was evasive for Kavanaugh so I'm Glad I'm\nNot the only one who seeing ... said absolutely I\nI I Am wondering if they're dining crocodile tonight after his crocodile tears today [noise] list [noise]\nIs that is that at going to work is that act after work Chuck\nIt in in my opinion he made a fool of themselves the only thing she was crying about is he got caught he's remorseful in the sense that he got caught not for the actual actions\nHow about this he thought that his his path to the Supreme Court was greased\nHe thought he was in there he thought it was all done he was already thinking about how is going to be one will be a Supreme Court judge now a giant complication is past\nIs catching up to him and now he's mad because now there's a chance a realistic chance maybe a ten percent twenty percent chance that he won't be on there and now he's mad 'cause he was already baked in his expectations in his mind it already been met he was there he was on the Supreme Court and now this isn't going to get snatched away from it how's that for a cause to be angry", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Malloy Show", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "01"}
