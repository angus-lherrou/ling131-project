{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "We have them reserved yeah so we have thought a which is is interesting because I always hear these stories you can travel by ... really cheap and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd so we asked on us thirty day pass right which gives you twelve ... twelve is that yes had twelve lags um that you can use\nFor the trip so our first lag will be to Chicago and then our second lag will be from Minneapolis to Seattle right\nAnd we're gonna have several stops along the way but we'll sort of update you on those as we go and the purpose of this ah this was going to be aired on free talk live on all the stations\nIs basically to let you know that you can follow this by checking out the pod cast in basically says he can't guarantee me the final segment of every day and doing an after show gives me more flexibility I don't have to\nCut it up or anything like that Riley Blake who does our editing thank goodness for him does have to be quite as much work so we can get this in more quickly that way my intention is that we recorded in the morning and then hopefully we can get it on by the evening\nRight we've been told that the ... on the train yeah so it depends on where we are if we're on the train like when we go from\nMinnesota to Portland or to Seattle it's two nights on the train right so and it's gone through the Rockies and we have no idea how the why situation is going to work\nSo I Know it's not going to be good because I was in Montana at one point and I hit the this was in Nineteen Ninety eight I think and I had to seek button on the radio FM dial just anything yeah it just looked on the FM dial right so if there's if you can't get a radio station you sure can't get why\nSo maybe we can get some a wife I go and they can't\nBut if so I'm gonna try to keep this I'll keep you updated if you don't\nFor whatever reason listen to the podcast so you may be listening a whole different variety of ways\nAnd that's cool we

take some cool picks for you\nAnd you can follow that\nNow you don't have to be my Facebook friends to follow it\nI have a rule on Facebook I don't accept friend request from anybody who doesn't have five friends in common with that you haven't met her I\nKnow that you know that has the ... doesn't I've got\nThree thousand friends on Facebook there's all these accounts for just one of spam you and

us what people are going to want to do\nSo for the three of us it was about Seventeen hundred dollars for the thirty day pass\nAnd that includes some nights so they'll cut into some of the cost and hotels I mean\nI guess Joe vacations aren't cheap I guess so yeah I guess that well um but that does not include food\nAnd um so we will you know we'll still have food although we are looking to um get a sleeper cabin for the the night that we are the two nights\nThat we're going from Minneapolis to Seattle could out of the big splurge for and that would be this big splurge and that's like an extra four hundred dollars right so so really you know you're over to Europe or two thousand dollars just to get to Seattle\nI I think people probably imagine when they're planning the train trip I can because those seats on trains are big comfy so much you can sleep on there and I think that mostly that's what I Want to\nFirst night we will be will be on the train overnight to Chicago and that's the plan is to just sleep and our seats so what have you done\nPrepping pack 'em down much yet that\nYou know I'm putting the suitcases out I've gotten the cold weather gear out I've gotten um

Bill Clinton was not a sexual predator ... list yes\nAnd like a lot of other presidents before him have acted in on presidential ways but that was his private life and it should have never never come to to the surface Monica Lewinsky has always said that it was a consensual adult relationship\nNow with the me too movement and everything she's got the perfect out to say well no I was very young and vulnerable\nI agree and I know who they're you know wanting to Broderick is probably the most credible but there are two women who gives Clinton of rape but that has never been proven or demonstrators and if you know may well be the case\nBut even has promiscuity is problematic for the for the Democrats right now and uh but you know I I agree with your point I ran and I think this is why he's still you know he's still respected and he's still inside the Democratic party\nBut increasingly Democrats are are uncomfortable with Bill Clinton around and I understand why don't you\nWhy didn't I guess time will tell because John John Fitzgerald Kennedy was way worse than Bill Clinton ever was sure\nSure and Enron Roosevelt had a masters Dwight Eisenhower at a minister is Lyndon Johnson Adam ...

honor the victims of the limo crash that killed twenty people over the weekend meanwhile the investigation continues\nAnd and these guys have been going on about this for a long long time\nAnd now they're sales pitches or in this cat are says this\nClarence Thomas was one of the first to say this\nScalia said this\nAlito said this John Roberts said this\nThat they are quote original it's\nWhat does that mean oh we interpret the original meaning of the constitutional who wrote the constitution about half the people in that room or wealthy white slave holders\nAnd all of the people in that room agreed that while I was going\nTo say that women shouldn't vote I is there actually was a debate about that and they table the debate\nAnd they chose not to put anything about women in the constitution in fact the first time that were men men or men was inserted into the constitution was the fourteenth amendment\nAnd Cady Stanton ... case out and said if if that word man is if that were male is inserted into the uh\nIn the fourteenth amendment of the constitution will take a hundred years to get it out and I literally was a hundred years from the time the fourteenth amendment was ratified until the equal in till the uh the the first equal rights legislation was passed by the U.S Congress\nBut basically I mean do you get this these guys are saying we're originalist we want to interpret the constitution the way a wealthy white slave owner would\nThis is Clarence Thomas's sales pitch to\nThis is a and and and this is why they're going after the visa program the lottery program because hey it brings in people from Africa this is why they want to change our immigration laws\nBecause hey we want more white people from Europe truck themself we want more Norwegians\nThis is one voter suppression is all about with the interstate cross check suppressing the votes of Hispanics African Americans and Asians\nAs Citizens United was all about it for the call for a for a constitutional convention is all about\nAnd in the meantime we've got this bizarre situation where the president of the United states is lying to us buying through his teeth this is video on Nate a first he starts out lying I mean literally making this up Democrats don't want to open borders we want a country\nAnd that where you know the United states is sovereign in fact the Democrats it's been the libertarians for years who have argued for open borders this is an old libertarian thing that comes from the objective is from ...\nThey say capital money can move across borders goods can move across borders people should be able to move across the border so that labor can go wherever labor is needed for the benefit of industry this is libertarian all the way\nWhich is the Republicans\nSo this this is Ron Paul shtick right it was like if we didn't have welfare programs I be totally in favor of open borders look it up you can find all kinds of YouTube's Ron Paul saying it and Rand Paul for for that matter his own son saying the same thing\nBut Donald Trump says no no it's the Democrats who are thinking like the Syria's\nSenate has signed up\nFor the borders and it said ... it's called\nWith voters bill what's going on and it's written by yes\nDianne Feinstein [noise]\nThis is Donald Trump last night and it's a complete lie I mean literally there's absolutely no truth to it whatsoever\nNow this is like the fifteenth or twenty of time that he's a he's gone out there and pitched the Democrats wide open borders is one of his constant refrain is it is a lie\nIs an absolute Autor\nBlatant why\nWhy some aid in appointing this\nCan you imagine a Brock Obama had come out and said that the Republicans are are you know in favor of\nI don't know something you know equally equally bizarre\n[laughter] you know it's just it's breathtaking video to hear this is Donald Trump talking about on Democrats are going to bring a tidal wave of drugs and crime in other words\nYou know this is ... piggybacking on his lie about open borders in other words they're going to let round people into this country from Mexico which again Democrats have always been saying you know let's have rational immigration policies we don't want to know from Puerto what are you crazy here's Trump lying about this\nBut if the Democrats bill ever becomes law a tidal\nWave of drugs and crime would pour into our nation is like you never ever before [noise]\nAnd then and then he says and not only that the Democrats want to get free health health care to all these people that once the Democrats open the border are going to pour in another lie an absolute lie in fact the law says if you're not a citizen you can't get government assistance you can't get this help but anyhow here's Donald Trump why him through his teeth again Democrats\nGive welfare and free health care to illegal aliens\nFor it and here he is saying that the social safety net or Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security which his Republican Party is working to destroy and he's lying about\nA saying that uh oh that's just for a wealth of courses for Americans here in the eye and this is why you know one of the things about Social Security is is being kept afloat by all these people in the United states who are not citizens paying into it but then they can't get the benefit from it so it's like a you know it's a multi billion dollar here freebie for Social Security but Trump Trump wise about that too areas\nRepublicans believe that the public benefits must be protected for the truly needy Americans [noise]\nSays it's just a complete why this is Donald Trump wine through his teeth I mean I should\nShouldn't supplies us but Donald Trump ... about how we live through his teeth in his own book or

Bush he didn't work as well you know I I mean you could say worked as a lawyer and that he was getting legal advice\nBut he he was not you know try and cases in courts of law and things like that and he went from being a right wing hatchet man right to the DC circuit\nAnd then he's going from the D.C ... directly in the DC circuit of the Supreme Court she you know I have a guy in the Supreme Court has never argued a case before the Supreme Court in fact to the best of my knowledge I maybe early on in his career like in the first year at a law school or something but the rest of my knowledge she's never or certainly argue to consequential case before any court at all\nAnd you know he's just been a right when we were right wing hit men\nAnd so the thing that he has to fears impeachment\nUh in the impeachment provision of the constitution applies to all federal officers that includes federal judges that includes members of the U.S Supreme Court and in fact one member of the U.S Supreme Court district chase back in Eighteen oh six or something or was impeached in the house representatives they did not convict him in the center so that's\nThe thing that he has to fear and it would take sixty six votes in the Senate to make that sticks so I don't think he has a lot of fear around that Terry thanks a lot for the call 'em may in Avondale Virginia a may what's up\n[noise] Hi I'm I wanted to mention that I Believe this when you were talking about the\nIntolerable consistent lives that are coming out of the president [noise] um I Believe the method is called fire hosting and ah it's also used by putting when suddenly um about probably it's usually\nThe strong man all around the world [laughter] apparently so uh it's a manner of obliterate\nIng the foundation of the truth so that um they're truth can be super imposed over top of that and of course you see in the massive confusion no one knows what to believe\nAnd uh it's a very very sad thing because especially you know

hello Hi yes thank you\nI Am a well it's always nice talking with Bob what's going on in the world today\nWell I won't get into cab off yes questions I Know you've probably been talking about it but I'll give you a few other pieces of news okay to pontificate if you want me to have an ... so I'm I just wanted to go to a couple of stories a strange story week uh first of all the head of in a pool vanished after he took a flight to China\nAre we now find is being held for corruption in China and his name is may Holloway or hand he is also vice minister public security in China\nI think at one point in time there was denial that you know that they had him but now he is there or they don't relate to corruption to enter pool but they relate corruption you internally and um I just it just sort of denial weight because the Saudis the big controversy of course\nIn Turkey is the Saudis denying that they have supposedly hacked to death\n...\nWho is a Washington Post contributor right and of course he's a pretty quick quick critic of the Saudi Government\nRight now he's like he was murdered his his fiance was waiting outside the embassy foreign waited two days I came back\nShe said he didn't come back out and now here's a point to the Saudis let's media and to look around quote which is a harsh and you know if the Saudis said he exit right away after he got a fiancee visa that's pretty easy because everything is recorded in the embassies\nExits and interests but they produce that yeah it's pretty amazing to understand can we our politics for a minute Oh yes I just want to make sure I got those stories\nAt ... you know you were you ever been elected to Congress multiple times you know the Republican Party you used to be inside of it I'm a [noise] Brett Kavanaugh the law though the process\nThe hardcore right winger um you know Donald Trump last night Donald Trump said Democrats have proposed legislation to have open borders these wind through his teeth no Democrat would ever do that no Democrat supports that he's been line about Brett Kavanaugh saying you know the that uh this is entirely fabricated and it's been entirely debunked\nOr the neither those true to what extent will right wing hate radio on Fox News um both owned by billionaires I should point out um to what extent should they be able to deliver more victories to the Republican Party versus\nYou know the angry and upset a women and the allies of women across the United states who are looking at this as a last gasp of patriarchy\n[noise] ... yeah I don't think that box you know cares of course because look who they just hire desert communications director Hope Hicks\nOh really and the White House has bill shine who was supervising the Kevin ... who himself has been accused of sexual harassment\nIt's a switch you know you got shine and then all of a sudden Hope Hicks now goes to Fox and Hope Hicks was in the White House wow as we know you know and a\nVery very close to the president's daughter so I don't think Fox is really looking to in any fashion informed have itself has it you know a fair entity or any stretch imagination they will however\nDo what they just did which is to produce ...\nFor the Republicans especially the right will produce a lot of cover a lot of you know a of a new slanted towards that direction but I Will point out\nEven with that occurring a lot of money behind it which helps what does that help it helps Republicans that are a sure how they're going to vote ... because you see what I'm saying the bases ginned up to buy the use of money to the corporate media\nSo so the question in my mind it you know after Ninety two after Clarence Thomas Anita Hill ...\nThere were a lot of women who got elected Ninety two and um [noise] uh and Bill Clinton got elected Ninety two\n[noise] what what do you expect the elect the the political consequences of this will be in terms of truly elections\nWhat's the great question because here's what I think's going to happen\nI'm and I'm going to refer to President Obama for how it's carried out to happen but what I think's gonna happen it's first of all their protect people protect kicks yes or no question about you know all the money spent and it pumped out there and you got a lot of protection and people were watching boxing cetera they give you a protection and you're in your base even with senator mansion for example\nThe base would be calm down even Mitch McConnell still after him because of his boat\nNow now having said that the repercussions I think are going to be pretty easy there is a no matter how they comforted\nThe vote alright for Kevin on the roads are going to be very difficult because there is a definite gender gap any way you look at it including a Republican female voters not supporting Republicans Gerald there is a gender gap any way you look at number two\nThere is also an independent gap now who are up for grabs who may have not went for Hillary Clinton went for Donald Trump then you come to ... start up\nThe conservative base let me I think it was very important and this would worry me if I was sitting Republican\nHalf amount of having the conservative base fired up but they're happy so they may stay away the progressive base is far it up and they are unhappy so therefore if they produce people to get out and vote they have do you think this is a mirror image of the Tea Party the\nAll these Republican activists out in the streets yelling and screaming and produced a wave of elections for Republicans now you've got you know a bit of women and their allies out in the streets and you know hello and\nCelebrities and if they if they get the vote out yes they will creative ways yeah he is getting out and making sure the Republicans have suppressed that vote in the individual states George over four hundred thousand people are moved from the voting laws last year by by kept who's running for governor now against Stacey Abrams\nAny anyhow Bob Ney a media news thank you\nThank you always good talking with it we'll be right back [noise]\n[noise] [noise] you're listening to um [noise]\nHi I'm Randy and this is Dave word of the

instead they started and very but tell by the way it was a second woman prosecuted Mike Pence's Indiana forth\nInstead they started prosecuting when I was still birds saying that they had induced abortions illegal abortions late term abortions\nAnd in fact ... submitted to a blood test there were no border facing drugs in her system\nThere was no evidence that abortion there was no abortion doctor there was no nothing\nJust a dead a dead and a female stillborn child\nOr a fetus or whatever you call it at that stage\nAnd she was facing Thirty years in prison\nAnd Mike Pence's Indiana sentenced or to Twenty years in prison\nAnd that was overturned by a federal judge which is the status of all that right now who said hey there's no evidence that she actually committed an abortion\nBut you know expect this this is you know the whole period\nFor Pence thing you know remember this that we did it on this show back six eight years ago when Mike Pence was governor of of Indiana and and he was trying to get this law passed that said that essentially a if women were late on their periods\nAnd bought they might be pregnant or found that they were pregnant they had to essentially report themselves to the police department\nAnd if they lost that child if they had a miscarriage\nThey had to give a funeral by law five thousand dollar minimum cost funeral to that weather as little tiny bloodiest back or whether you know it's something much larger they had to have a funeral and if they fail to do that they went to prison\nSo the woman that Mike Pence called mother his wife Karen\nHas decided she's going to make her political statement\nBy supporting a fellow mark Harris\nWho is running for Congress\nWho says he's facing a Dan McCready by the way a this is in South Carolina\nAnd Dan McCready as a Democrat and a good Democrat he's a marine veteran a business owner\nAnd and a good Democrats\nSo if you're looking for a place to to you know somebody who
