{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "We're right now on a hundred and Ninety radio stations we could be on a lot more app am pie app that free talk live dot com let's go to the discord where we've got David calling in David your on free talk live ... thought\nYeah I heard had originally called done to comment about what gene was talking about then you guys the conspiracy between the political parties and the media but let me save that for another night because you started talking about um\nCivil asset forfeiture and first of all let me ask you do a ... I wanted to share something that that might be helpful but first of all you see the parallel the commonalities between civil asset\nForfeiture and uh people losing their children in a civil government process when no crimes have been committed\nThere certainly are certainly a parallel there absolutely\nRight what what um uh\nUh obviously I won't go through it All right now but if people look at the ... when they're\nNot that your fans of the United states or the constant founding documents but if you look at um the amendments for its roots hand there's a lot of helpful information in there a lot of helpful clauses for dealing with combating civil wrongful civil asset forfeiture\nI'm and I'm a one key thing is what I've noticed that uh the the legislatures or the government you know law school's legislatures lawyers judges the whole racketeering\nCrowd what they've been doing over time\nIs things that used to fall or under the under criminal jurisdiction what they've been doing is uh uh to increase their power to take stuff from you and control you they've been writing not war criminal laws but they've been writing laws under civil code\nThat are and that to take your things and control you and because it falls under civil law and not criminal law they pretend that they can escape the protection of the of the ... the the amendments I mentioned you know ... for three ten\nAnd you know for instance the article for amendment for says you know no unreasonable searchers Caesar's seizure and you know what it without a warrant they exactly and so I obviously they're violating a a amendment for\nAnd if you look at a minute five or what's helpful and there is a\nUh not be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law\nOr nor shell private property be taken for public use without just compensation so there is there are obviously violating violating that right and if you look at yeah and you look at amendment six uh in all criminal criminal prosecutions you see the founding fathers that they forgot\nTo be more concerned about their civil lives though and they they wrote in criminal here and there and that's the loophole that\nThese people are leaning on to to do this stuff that they that they're doing\nUm the you know I forgot what\nIt right so you're basically you're making the point David thank you for the call you're making the point that spirit or made is that has all the laundry should as either authorized the journey that we have or been down this time really to prevent it and he wrote that a hundred and forty eight years ago\nYeah and um I I don't know how people and I was one of these people like I could look at the constitution say this is this is why America is the greatest country on earth because we have all these freedoms and\nThese freedoms are protected by the constitution but at some point folks who just got a kind of wake up and go\nWell is it really protecting us when\nWell you can go you go through the whole list or you can go through all the entire bill\nOf rights the first ten amendments of the constitution\nAnd you can list examples of your government failing you re failing to follow their own rules keep in mind there are tens of thousands of laws that are pointed from government at you\nLike a gun if you step out of line they've got a million things they can nail you on you know what you have to protect yourself from government\nYou've got a four page document that you hope a judge is going to wind up saying Oh yes this applies and a lot of cases because I've tried it a unless you specifically file some kind of motion prior to your court hearing or a\nQuote fleeting reference to the constitution is not admissible in court as evidence right at the constitution applies yeah and and\nThat's the the insanity of this situation we find ourselves and we don't live in a constitutional republic or not to to claim that we live in a constitutional republic would imply that we follow the rules of said constitution you know the irony\nIs George Bush had it right the constitution is a piece of paper it is yes yeah [laughter]\nAnd that's all we've ever had to protect ourselves just a piece of paper\nRight it's it's whether it's whether\nThe government is actually following the words on that piece of paper which we know they're not they have it in for over a century ... we were told us that right well sometimes they'll go by the word ... yeah like that that's in there and you know kind of hard to violate ... know and\nThe government will certainly use it when it talks about their powers these powers of the few\nParalyzed general welfare will just construe that to me and and the thing I Want to and they ... yeah when you know he was the guy that wrote the thing when he was president he vetoed the legislation\nSaying yeah just because you claim that this is tangentially related to this thing does it mean that it actually is\nWhere we were we were talking earlier about um you know some of the federal law than Hamilton in the federalist papers Hamel hammered on the idea of the common clauses being used in ways that they shouldn't be [laughter]\nThis was he's he's under ... spoke on this over and over and over saying that no no one in their right mind is going to say that you know building a new rose or the government regulating how much we can grow on your land falls under the commerce clause that's never\nGoing to write you can't just build a road and say well see the Constitution's says post roads and this is a road the postal people will use the writer for we can do

they're mutually exclusive emails you know sort of facets I I think that there's something to be said for political theater a because it can be both an incredible commentary on society and on the current state of politics and also really emboldened in and get heart to people who are suffering\nOr so I think it's a mixture of both you know this sort of falls in line with a really\nA barrage history of witchcraft around chime in drought people's each round ages of humankind much witchcraft has always been practiced by the people on the outskirts get people on the fringes of people the

but the uber am a feminist organization in the sixties\nOr and which stood for the women's international a terrorist conspiracy [noise] I'm\nI'm so sorry I forget actually what it was it was a women's these international terrorists a conspiracy or tax or something like that\nBut they changed it several times depending on the events that they would do and you know when they're first political events ever was in the late sixties and they marched in full regalia on Wall street you have the stockbrokers or the Dow opens dismal either next day and that was said to be the spray try on [noise]\nAh so you know it's something it's it's there is the real religious practice involves but there's also the recognition that like you don't have to believe that and if you just want to share space\nAnd

more people reach out and asked you know what can I Do on my end um outlook for [noise] um when it comes to which is you know witchcraft as a practice\nIt's not a religion that sounded belief system it's what you do it's not what you think of what you believe\nSo you know practicing witchcraft can make you wiccan or you know a part of Haitian food or\nOf Chinese traditional religion anymore than it makes you you know a Roman Catholic or Jewish the reality of the situation is a there's as many ways to be a which is there are witches and as bad as many people as there on the planet so what seems to be a hallmark of being a which is somebody who looks at\nA mainstream sort of a veil a bowl easily accessible religion and says oh well I recognize that I'm a spiritual or religious person but none of these seem to fit me so I Need to just do a lot of exploration with a lot of skepticism in doubt and find some way to understand\nWhat a spiritual life will be for me um and then they sort

somebody leaders a few more days to investigate the disappearance of a Washington Post journalist before deciding what action to take a custom teeny has the latest Turkish\nKept harmless in what we do since they just cashed in on the little bit that was available for them as part of it so I like your idea I think it's long overdue but it would have to be done probably in with some gradually losing in some care\nBuilt in so it doesn't inadvertently hurt\nOr the people who they are no responsibility for the for the\nAwfulness of the whole process yeah\nWell and and to that to that in in regard to that I had a guy call in last week or maybe it was Monday This week\nAnd say that uh he was making a little over a hundred and twenty grand a year and he had seen about a thousand dollars extra in his paycheck as a result of the of the Republican tax cut and he's like you know but why should not be happy about this and I suggested to him that employ the employment market the labor market\nFor people who don't have control over their own income which is like the bottom Ninety nine percent of us\nUm that that labor market is based not on pre tax income but on post tax income in other words you know the employers out there who are hiring people a you know in particular job categories in particular labor markets know what someone's willing to work for\nAfter taxes so if he's making a hundred and ten and he's ... and he was actually taking home eighty his employer knows he's willing to work for eighty so he gets a massive tax cuts and suddenly he's making Ninety\nHis employers is going hey I can find somebody who will do this job for eighty you would do it for eighty before and so he lays the guy off or fires have been replaces you know basically the wage comes back down again\nSo that the take home pay is still the same on the other hand if he had a massive tax increase in suddenly he was only taken home sixty thousand dollars a year\nAnd we're starting to look around for another job or something like that his employer would have to raise his income in order to getting back to that you know same level which is why in Denmark the minimum wage is over ... I think it's twenty four dollars an hour now because the you know the average tax rate on working people's in the thirties\nThirty to forty percent and and it's also why it I I'd I'd looked at tax tables going back to Nineteen hundred\nAnd it sure looks to me like if you look at three and five your windows as taxes on working people go up wages go up as taxes on working people down wages go down\nWith regard to the very top though when taxes go down they get more money in taxes go up to get less money is that are at a reasonable an accurate analysis or am I just out here you know the blow in the hot air and in the wind\nNo no no you're bringing up something that is quite valid and it is unfortunately very poorly understood in the larger population but if I could speak for a moment to what your caller said\nThere is no way to nail down in any definitive way whether a wage increase that he may have gotten say over the last\nUh eight months since the tax cut of two thousand Seventeen took effect\nWas because of that tax cut as opposed to twenty five other possible reasons that lead that employer to raise his wage the employer might say something like a on share with you what I God as a tax cut\nBut both of Bloomberg service the Financial Times half a dozen agencies have now study what corporations did across the board\nWith the tax cut money\nAnd their conclusions were very few somewhere between three and five percent of American workers got any portion of that tax cut it was overwhelmingly used\nFor stock buybacks such when companies by back their shares in the market to raise dividends to shareholders and to raise a pay packages for top executives which corporations are free to do and which is what they in fact did all the talk\nAbout how we would end up helping workers' wages that's just the same old trickled down nonsense that if we give a tax cut the corporations that are rich somehow it's going to find its way into average people's pockets\nThat is very rarely true and the statistics are now in that it has not been the case or with the tax cut of December twenty Seventy\nYeah and then and he was asserting that his taxes were a thousand dollars lower those he had a thousand dollars a year more in his in his pocket but I've I've also seen numbers that uh is and this I just I just saw this couple of days ago that the the suggesting that while the average income the average wage in the United states is around forty four thousand right now\nThe median wage in the United states and there was half above half below\nIs only thirty three thousand two hundred dollars and the reason for that differences that the average includes all these people who are making literally millions and millions of dollars the at the very very top of that was a wage scale\nA and but that's not that many people it's just a hell of a lot of money and so the median is actually you know a reflection of what\nMost people in America are earning which is in the low thirties and or is that accurate\nAbsolutely I and and let me quote to you a wonderful piece of a statistical work done by the economic policy Institute in Washington DC they divided wages into high medium and low and they asked the question\nHow have these three parts of the wage distribution done between Nineteen eighty and now and what they show which is starkly\nIs that the lowly of wage people are actually worse off if you adjust for prices as all of these numbers do they are worse off now they can afford lash out of their weekly wage and then they could Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty roughly\nThe middle group is just slightly above maybe three or four percentages above now what they were back in Nineteen eighty thirty eight years ago\nOnly the high wage people saw an appreciable increase in the neighborhood of thirty to forty percent\nWhich means that over the last Thirty years the missile and the bottom which is more than fifty percent\nWent absolutely nowhere or shrank in terms of what they were getting for the labor effort they put out only those at the top\nAnd particularly because of the very top as you just noted were able to do better\nAnd that's a large explanation for the political divide we have for the rage in the population that watches this so called wealth effect or the recovery that seems forever to pass them by\nTheir right it has passed than by but the whole last Thirty years have passed them by they've gotten the wage increases the vast majority meanwhile their productivity what they do for their employer has gone up and therein lies the explanation for growing inequality the people who do the work\nAre stagnant and the people who get the fruits of that work\nAre gathering in accumulating wealth producing the kinds of divisions that are roiling our culture and our politics\nYeah and then we talked about average wages instead of median wages because we're just economic interests all of that guy disguises and there you go that's that's that's very well said\nSo we'll see how this all shakes out and so it's it's just a remarkable time and and uh but rolling back the

I think it's twenty six states maybe it's more than ...\nWhere Republicans are in charge of the voting process and according to Greg palace they've purged fourteen million people in the last twelve months\nIn each one of those states need to find one person one person who can who get who is sufficiently articulate intelligent and telegenic you know when we go on TV\nAnd and be very clear and passionate way say this is what happened to me you know I and and yes trying to get veterans as much as possible but I I don't think veterans are quite as iconic as they once were\nBut [noise] but uh yes this is you know I have been voting in the same place for and you know some states that will be an elderly person and some of that will be younger person or whatever it may be and do that state by state and then build a website That's got all fifty of those are all thirty those state\nYou know a little uh uh the the one one minute ads as YouTube clips on it and to promote the hell out of that because you're absolutely right Diane the number one strategy I mean historically Republicans have had strategy is like oh we're gonna\nWe're gonna have anti gay measures on the ballot right I mean that was the big thing back in two thousand or a Ninety eight or or you know a a were you know ... back in the Nineteen eighties you know we wanna we wanna bring prayer back into our schools I mean they'll find some things that they put on the ballot to try to mobilize their base\nThey can no longer find anything that mobilize their base outside of maybe eight or brown people which is you know which immigration is a ... too\nSo instead what they're doing is they're just simply trying to remove a young people old people and people of color young white people older ... you know why people rich retired people will actually of all races\nOn and and people of color from the voting rolls or the voter purges now or their main electoral strategy which is just obscene and yes it should be highlighted Diane thank you that was absolutely brilliant I Love it Patricia in College Station Texas ain't Patricia what's up\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm well two things I've learned to make a comment about Kevin all but first I had been living in this county since the mid eighties and I had moved here from overseas and um\n[noise] am eighty five years old and I just yeah and I've been registering people to vote for ten years or more and I just called on a whim last week to see if I were still on the voting rose in that county and in my state and I have been purged you're kidding\nAt a habit and found out why yet and I'm not sure exactly what to do the ... a voter registration ended to see a week ago\nWell ... yeah I don't know what to do either it's a tie it I Would start by calling the American civil liberties union and the ACLU and re okay yeah 'cause they're all over this they're doing lawsuits all over the country they're doing a collaborative with Greg palace\nI'm a I Would call the ACLU and say what to do there there are a other are voting projects they can probably direct you to want if there's one that's a little you know more direct to Texas are a little closer to you\nBut to that's remarkable is your eye you don't need to say your last name on the air but is it a common name in ah the Hispanic or African American or Asian communities\nIn Iran yeah no okay Michelle or in the revolutionary war who jumped ship or an okay hey Trent\nSo that's that's the end you know how you know or do you live in a liberal area is that the deal you live in a college town or something\nYeah to a tank in university uh okay so they probably\nOn the campus and I do have appealed box on the campus post office\nSo I don't know so you're probably part of a purge of of campus voters basically\nWell and I have been very active in a democratic socialist in the Democratic party yeah too and I think we almost turned in the primary for Bernie I think we almost turn our county blue and I've been so proud and up and\nYou know something that testing going around saying Texas is not as bad as you think that um [noise]\nThere are power he sent me that just don't want everybody to about ... but they cannot comment I'd like to make 'em\nDuring a his hearings he repeatedly said that he would when asked about a lie detector tests that he would do anything close to the committee wanted him to do right and um [noise] but I think that that's all we needed we didn't need another shake investigation we just needed him to take a lie detector test\nWith all the reason is about

I\nMean we've got the entire Griffin her family here and there are tied in with the Saudis\nWell you said it better than I could list of things\nOh there are eleven senators now no none of them are Republican but I Do want to know the two Republicans Senator Rubio and Senator Graham have come out\nRather aggressively about doing something about Saudi Arabia but ... senators have asked in a letter to the president\nOr they want to know information about the business relationship\nOf the Trump corporation with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and one of the reasons uh of course the president cited that we need to uh you know basically be calm about this because we need to have the Saudis help us with the Iranians how on earth the Saudis can help us with the Iranians is beyond\nMe Saturday I Want to go to war with Iran and sort of way they want us they would they want us to do it too of course to the to the last American soldier\nRight they don't have a military now this has changed dramatically\nIronically the death of ... a ... show unfortunate and show horrific how they killed him\nYou know it was not an accidental a situation going wrong from an interrogation they were cutting off finger after finger until they they cut off all his fingers it took seven minutes for him to die\nAnd that was not an interrogation gone wrong that was torturing premeditated murder\nAnd also the person who flew from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia was the personal head of a security for the crown prince so these this was well planned to the level of the crown trash\nOut Bob what do you think about this guy who died in the car crash share this this suspicious car crashes are thirty one year old Airforce with China in the Saudi air force who are I'm Sorry I lost his name here but uh he apparently was that was either associated with her was part of this Fifteen man had team\nOr do you think that ah maybe he was just killed off and now they're going to blame it on him\nOr you know that's possible look they are not going to come out in shape we you know plan this chick cetera now they will eventually dumped the crown prince if in fact there's enough pressure put on them that child do take care of this to basically depots him\nAnd then put somebody else in his place because it is a business Cancun they don't care about women's rights they don't care about\nIt he's going to fight I mean you know he he locked up all his peers in the in the hotel there and and torture and one of them to death and this and shook him down for apparently hundreds of billions of dollars I mean he's got to be he's got to have consolidated both his wealth in his power in ways that make it much more difficult to do that that it might have been before he did this\nWell that's true now all the businesses that you read that have put out by the way now or secretary of treasury after all everybody else pulled out after a lot of heat has now said he won't go over there but he waited ... that's the whole point of this\nYear I'm real files encouraged waiting\nWaiting and waiting on this and that the fact is a business connections makes us a whole different world and if you didn't have that business connection as president\nBombay thank you for talking with you coming up next a professor Juan Cole is going to be with us\nWe've got a lot to talk about a whole lot of areas of\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] you're listening to Tom Hardy [noise]\nSummer is behind this and I've got the perfect formula to help out and wind camera and use ultra premium one can purchase has direct from boutique wineries no middleman and bottles and keeping your sources secret so he can pass the savings directly to you often forty eight percent less than you pay for the same wine at retail\nShipped writing your door so I Want to Kansas new six bottles sampler packed\nThe luxury mix sampler regularly Ninety five dollars is now anyone or the elegant red sampler regularly a hundred and one dollars has now just eighty five bucks Louis and I tried lot five sixty seven the Napa cabernet fantastic definitely a deep full body rich red wine just spectacular for a limited time\nYou can get Fifteen Percent off one of the new radio mixed sampler packs plus free shipping going to see a wine dot com slash Tom T.

correspondent nic Robertson reports Turkish authorities began investigating within hours are being awarded above the journalists disappears\nA alliance with a hard line fundamentalist preacher mom it had been up to the lab\nAnd he and his followers have ever since been supporters of the monarchy [noise]\nSo uh you don't have a strong separation or any really any separation of religion and state in Saudi Arabia the\nUh the the the the monarchy is very closely tied to these will hobby clerics are who you know preach this a puritanical form of Islam which is very peculiar I mean it's on like\nThe way Islam is practiced in Indonesia or Egypt or you know there are one point five billion Muslims or twenty two million Saudis so it's a it's off in its own corner but inside Saudi Arabia the lobby a branch is extremely powerful\nA and there's always been a kind of a ... back and forth between the power of the kings and the power of the hobby clergy\nAnd what's happened is that this new crown prince Mohammed bin saw him on is moving more towards a kind of medieval European idea of absolute monarchy is not constrained even by the church\nAh and ah as a way to Henry the eighth [laughter]\nYes exactly I mean uh uh he he is a cracking down on the power of the hobby a establishment or they would bother people you know a boy and a girl went to a cafe together in public that's not allowed to have\nJay which they would come around and and they just run up and start whipping them are screaming at them and getting them off and he's put an end to that or he slowed down\nHe told those people to go home and uh so\nSo I think as I got a good thing how do how do we end up with a guy who was killing a that Americans are arrows American resident journalist\nWill see it's it's sort of like I'm\nA to make a historical analogy we've gone towards Thomas hobbies and live via son you know argued for absolute monarchy and uh for its power even over the religious religious sphere\nUh and then John Milton ... wrote to the ... about how the state shouldn't be interfering with people's freedom of conscience or censoring people and and ... from a puritan point of view he was writing\nSo I think what's going on here is if you put all your\nEggs all your power all your prerogative is in the hands of an absolute monarch\nWhere there's no check and balance a then that might be a form of you know forced a top down modernization and but it's not going to produce stability and certainly not going to produce any liberties\nYou know it's remarkable so so it seems that the essentially structurally it's going to be a long long time if ever before the Saudis start practice practice in a form of\nOf uh of Islam that that is a more tolerant or for that matter even have a a political structure in place that resembles anything other than an absolute medieval monarchy\n[noise] yeah is you know the Saudis had been I'm a kind of an oligarchy there were a seven branches of the ruling family that alternate needed in producing a king and they kind of consulted with each other\nAnd what ... did was to get rid of that oligarchy you make a coup against it and then to substitute a his and his father's power of solely for it for a and a while you know some of the things they want to do need to be done he recognizes that oil\nYou know it was over with soon because everybody will go to electric cars and renewables and it's bad for the earth\nAnd so he has this vision twenty thirty a to transform the Saudi economy\nWhich got Thomas Friedman just bottle in about a wonderfully was and yeah I'm here in Christian or hanging out with it\nSo if if our law and I I Believe that I'm right on this that the United states law and I'm not even sure if this was a a part of the nix the actor if this long pre scenes that uh because often these two things are conflated in up in the public dialogue or at the news dialogue [noise]\nUm but if our law requires\nThe United states government if it comes in the knowledge that an American person which includes people and green cards like show me a permanent resident legal permanent resident I say is that an American person is at under threat from a foreign government\nWe have what's called a duty to warn to to it is a government the government's obligation to alert that person\nAnd so if our government had information that MBBS was going after the show the\nAnd failed to warn him\nIs the Trump Administration liable I mean is there liability here was that duty to warn there is a probable that the administration knew what was happening in advance\nWell we learned even in the Obama era that they were listening in on on ... a a personal cell phone so\nI Would be very surprising if they were able to plan and pulled this murder often the just stumbled consulate of Saudi Arabia without our national security agency having overheard them planning it right um\nAnd there's you know some leaks to the press suggesting that this is true I don't have from evidence for it [noise]\nI think there is an obligation to warn and I'm In the law but I mean obviously there's a moral obligation this was a columnist for the Washington Post he wasn't an unknown quantity of a ... but um\nWe don't know did they say past this to Trump and that he'd sit on it or exactly what happened and frankly our government in Washington is is at the moment so erratic and and chaotic or that and people ... resigning all the time and [noise]\nAnd then the president himself seems to have a very short attention span on to be all over the place uh so\nWhat what was this duty to warn not fulfilled because of a a snafu or was it a ... was the was the U.S government All right with the plans we just don't know\nYeah and but you know presumably this will emerge what what is here are we just to have a minute here until we're going to hit a heartbreak on what is your uh\nUh assessment of where this is going to go where the teacher the ... what's the future us Saudi relations\nWell the Trump Administration will try to bury this thing and and go back to business as usual after a decent interval\nA ... if the if the Democrats take Congress or either house are both uh then you could see congressional politics around it you know back in the early eighties or the Democrats for bad the Reagan Administration to spend money on supporting the calling threats in uh in Nicaragua\nJust ignore them well he he if he was ...\nAnd got a A N and sold arms to Iran to create a black slush fund so he could continue but he couldn't US government funds\nAnd so Congress would be capable of placing sanctions on Saudi Arabia including the global Magnitsky Act which could be invoked you know at will by Congress or were they to feel that mom had been so I'm On a\nHad been involved in this murder uh so I think you know on the on the congressional side the relationship was split the Saudi Arabia could turn rocky uh the signals are the Trump is not going to let the stand in\nHis way down so a lot probably going to depend on whether or not Democrats take the house start investigating the stuff\nProfessor one called his website one
