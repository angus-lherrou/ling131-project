I've heard the white paper on this I don't read why papers generally but I actually looked at this one 'cause I was really curious about it I'm like I'm a fan of the liberty dollar I Love the original and I think it's so cool that they're combining that concept\nWith crypto currency so ... to ... I oh learn more there we continue we'll take more of your calls your Greg is still on the line in New York right you brought up a concerns about the environment you'd asked a question about is it appropriate to use aggressive force\nIn the theory that you're going to help people not get hurt by that environmental pollutants and that sort of thing in the future I'm trying to sum that up Jackie I Know you wanted to weigh in on this before we uh continues to please\nYes it ... you're bringing up a question that's really complicated from both an economic standpoint a regulatory standpoint ethical standpoint which is how do we discount the value of human lives and just starting with placing a value on human lives to begin with this controversial but it is something that we do and calculating\nThe costs versus benefits of various environmental regulations or other safety regulations it's calculated when people\nAre awarded um you know damages and run for that and normally when we calculate the future value is something we apply discount rate could in which we say OK something that's coming in the future is not worth as much as if we had it right now\nAnd says well people want to apply that same principle defeat your allies other people argue you can't do that because as we see with rising healthcare costs people are willing to pay more and more to extend their lives over time people are going to be richer in the future and should we\nBe considering um perhaps their lives will be relatively worth more than they are now and if we discount them were undervaluing\nRight well I Would first of all I wouldn't apply necessarily an additive calculus did this because in the future you could have an exponential let's say population explosion or you're going to multiply by trillions of lives or you know that's one thing but the other thing I wanted the main thing I Want\nUm you know at first they think that the terrorists have sort of one\nHammer for every now which is oh if you get harmed then you go to court and then you get damaged\nBut the thing is a more nuanced they sometimes you don't have a you're having been harmed yet right but it's a sure thing in political climate if we\nCreate a runaway greenhouse effect and everybody dies it doesn't matter at that point that the court or at work there so that's what I'm saying it's more of a global problem\nIt's also difficult when you know sort of the the knee jerk libertarian response as you know goes to them is the difference between point source and non point source solutions a point source pollution you can see where it's coming from like that factory over there is feeling out all this nasty gas and it's making me sick and I'm going to see them\nA lot of forms of pollution like water pollution are called non point source pollution and that it's in the environment but you don't know exactly where it's coming from\nMaybe it's a whole bunch of individuals using a particular fertilizer on their lawn and it's running off into this lake that you know farther down you know downstream from them and do you trace it back to every single\nHomeowner and figure out exactly how much of this chemical they use the difficult\nYeah so it's you know if I was yes because we know exactly\nWhat we could do things like for example mandate that there'll be electric cars on the road by a certain time carbon credits make sure that we just leave the Toronto uh for the call and we courtesy of seizing the whole knows ...\nFares the difference between being a utilitarian and a principled a person when it comes to being a libertarian that is all the fear about what might happen I don't care because it's never a justification to use aggressive violence again even mind these guys\nEven at the whole human rights\nTotal dire mongering it's total fear mongering I'm not worried about humanity dying off humanities pretty resilient we've managed to figure out how to get this far and\nThe idea that we need to have this old artifice of the state around to some help protect humanity when in point of fact the state is absolutely the greatest threat to humanity on the planet or you know seems so contradictory\nRight and no one of the things that if you go back and you look through history of\nMost genocide was always for the greater good and according to somebody somebody in charge right that's how I use the air quotes that you could see and people watching on the twist could see you know there's always who decides for the greater the people that they are hiding\nHow do you deal with the tragedy of young common if no one manages the atmosphere Owen Owen how do you deal with what\nYou look at the economic solution would be you know you're talking about a market extra malady and as much as possible you want to internalize the extra nowadays so one proposed solution for something like air pollution would be a cap and trade policy where you figure out how much of the pollutant the environment can sustain\nAnd then companies have to bid on the right to pollute that much so you turn the air you turn you know the ... the allow the Lucian engines the auction yes see this does require state but\nOtherwise we would either by it by the state is a steward of the environment is a good steward of the environment all the evidence points to the opposite I mean if you look at uh the state polluting you can find the military is a tremendous polluter you can find a state I've ever seen instead just a couple of years ago\nWhere the EPA wound up by cracking open it and it polluted river yeah I mean and they blamed the free market\nYeah there's so many different examples of this great thank you for the call tonight so I mean you're talking about asking a Fox the guard the hen house here\nSorry don't buy it aggressive force always creates unintended consequences every single time no matter what the good intentions might be other people who create the program

working to get young progress is active in to the polls we're seeing a just frightening lay low a voter participation numbers among people that are under under thirty five broadly and under twenty five in particular\nOr you know I mean in some places you know Fifteen Percent of the level of participation that you see among older generations some people think this is because you know when a during the Reagan Administration\nBeing your guidelines for public school curriculum or were altered by bill Bennett uh the you know the the Reagan's secretary of education a bill Bennett three sixty Sean\nA bill Bennett who famously had this just say back in the day\nUh I push the button there it helps not maybe not I guess it's not it's not gonna\nO'Hare here when I Do know that it's true that if you wanted to reduce crime you could if that were your sole purpose you could've board every black baby in this country and do the crime rate would go down that would be an impossible ridiculous and morally reprehensible thing to do with your crime rate would go down\nI mean this this this kind of a a idiot I you know another word comes to mind but I Can't say it on the radio um he's the guy who did away with civic says one of the standards and so you know since the eighties many of our public school is just simply no longer teach civics um is that why I mean what's going on here and what are you doing to do something about it\nYeah it's a good question and and it is you know rooted in\nA long glory on the other side to limit or participation ... of the people in this country so\nUm we're we're doing my future we're really excited about 'em is uh we've been raising money all year and a maid grants to route twenty seven students are all over the country and some of the most competitive congressional districts\nUh and we made a grant out to them or to a organize and mobilize their campus for the upcoming election and so they're focused on a two main things as part of our program the first and most importantly as you're mentioning voter registration\nAnd I'm really excited to report just this morning we got report back from all of our organizers across the country and over the last month we registered over five thousand voters that you know it was just a small part of the overall narrative I and and picture that's been painted\nA that this year in particular more young people are voting we need to get those numbers up to do more\nBut we're excited to be a part of that that's a big thing that folks are focused on a is a recruiting people to volunteer for the campaigns because as you said\nAnd they're not getting the education about the importance of their vote about the importance of community organizing the importance of getting out and talking to voters about what's important to them they're not getting that sort of civics lesson in school and so we're actually connecting them with\nUh some of the most progressive campaign some of the most competitive campaigns um and uh putting our students on the ground giving them the resources in training they need\nTo get out the vote get out the worried about are these candidates who are running on a progressive agenda that will really ever stores some sanity to our politics as a our former presidents that\nThat's great and people can find out more information about this at our blue future

Spencer an album and Indiana Spencer what's on your mind that\nHow you doing so good\nAt a I Want to call you thank you for taking my call I I just I'm an independent and I agree um you know some things on both sides of the night I have a question for you I\nI I Am seeing more on my paycheck and I want to know why that's a bad thing because actually there's better city you know in my family so I just [noise] well\nHow much do you make Spencer here around a hundred and twenty grand a year\nYeah okay so you're you're probably getting a tax cut of water on a thousand bucks a year\nYeah somewhere in there\nOkay so are you saying said well okay here's here's a couple of reasons why this is not a good thing number one you are starving\nOur government yours and mine of the money necessary to do everything from fill potholes Enron police and fire departments to have good schools um education all you know basically all the stuff that that keeps America America\nIs being cut back and being cut back radically with the singular exception of of our military number two in order to fund those tax cuts literally every penny of it was borrowed it's a six trillion dollar tax cut over a decade the first trillion and a half dollars and the first two years which we're seeing right now\nAll of that as being funded by buying treasuries is going to have to be paid back with interest the interest is going to be another trillion dollars and that hurts our country in fact that may provoke a crisis for our country\nOr we're at the point now where there were ... twenty trillion dollars in debt where if interest rates go up to points and they certainly have in the past and the seventies you know there there with the prime was all the way up to around eight or nine percent\nYou know right now it's in the neighborhood of two percent if interest rates go up another two points the interest on the national debt the annual payments of interests will be greater than everything that we pay to fund the Pentagon all of our wars and everything\nAnd that is a mind boggling and it's not good and it's not healthy\nAnd the number three because of that massive data and what I just described\nYou know the the ... when Democrats come into office the Republicans are going to be screaming okay it's time to end Social Security is trying to and long term unemployment benefits assigned and food stamps assigned to end any support for college when I went to college you know when I went to and as you briefly\nA back in the Nineteen sixties and Lansing community colleges well eighty percent of the cost of college in ...\nTrust me but I my recollection is a hundred and fifty dollars a term to go to MSU\nEighty percent of the cost of college in the Nineteen sixties was paid for by state and local governments and the university twenty percent was paid for by tuition\nAs a consequence of Reagan's policy changes particularly those who are championed by bill Bennett is racist secretary of education now eighty percent of the cost of education is paid for with tuition only twenty percent is paid for by\nGovernment so what we've had is this massive shift away from\nA society a society for all of us were anybody could you know I'm having you know my parents were not wealthy my dad worked in a tool and dye shopping he could not afford them moving through college I but I but I was able to work my way through college the extent that I did I I all them only got kicked out but you\nKnow having dropped out I suppose is a more technically correct but\nI'm the bottom line is I was able to do that because a ... in minimum wage jobs I worked as a as a as a waiter uh excuse me I I was a waiter for one day when the when the waitresses went on strike but as as a dishwasher and Bob's big boy ... drove nice land scene and across the street at the Exxon Mobil station I changed tires and pumped gas\nAnd you know for as I recall two dollars and thirty cents an hour or something like that would that minimum wage part time job uh there was a little more fulltime in the summer I could pay for college\nAnd and you know because that's how things were\nThe complete change in all of these things right you know and making it impossible to go to college making healthcare massively more expensive shifting everything out of not for profit in the for profit all of that was predicated or or big that whole that whole horrible you know chain of horrible\nThe Republican Party or in the last year the of the uh the Bush administration\nOr ... you know cutting long term unemployment benefits from three years out of one year and then cutting it again down to six months um all of that was because they're cutting taxes\nUm if you if you were to go as I did live in Germany for a year where a somebody with your level of income you know well over a hundred thousand dollars would be paying as much as forty percent of your income in taxes\nYou would have free healthcare you would have free college in fact your kids would get a stipend when they go to college you would have one of the best public education systems in the world you would have highway systems and road systems that are so well maintained that you can travel a hundred and thirty miles an hour on the freeway or you would have\nA you know I I could go on and on right um and and you would have a much higher minimum wage the fact of the matter is the the other the other argument that I Would make Spencer and I've made this before but you know it's worth repeating fact I've read it written op eds about this you can easily find them\nIs that tax cuts affect there's two different categories of people in the United states in terms of income there's people who have control over their income and there's people who don't have control over their income\nAnd if you got if you're a wage earner if you're getting a salary and you're working for somebody else you don't have control over your income broadly speaking I mean you can petition for a raise or whatever but you basically don't have control over your income\nTake one atom of nitrogen and bother with one atom of

the rich people make a profit on it and I would that profit they'll say hey here you go\nAnd we're seeing a piece of this right here in in Oregon this was an amazing story in Philadelphia they put a three sat attack a per ounce tax on soft drinks\nI was you know I I think I\nMentioned I was at this so vocal board meeting in Denver over the weekend\nAnd it's a deal to AOL dot org it's an organization that ... you know basically passes out money to progress in groups and I've been on the board for over a decade I think\nAnd and uh we're board members from all over the country and ah a couple of people were telling me about how in their towns and I and my recollection is Minneapolis was one of them in their towns the sugar tax on sodas\nActually measurably reduced obesity well here's a report this is from Harvard and this is a couple of years ago this is one Philadelphia was debating the tax and what they said was a ... tax on sugar sweetened beverages\nProposed in Philadelphia is Harvard University medical school could help thirty six thousand people a year avoid obesity prevent two thousand two hundred and eighty annual cases of diabetes avert seven hundred thirty debts over a decade and save almost two hundred million dollars in health spending\nIn addition to that the city of Philadelphia would generate additional four hundred million dollars over five years that they can use for everything from public health initiative to returning the roads so uh it number one number to Berkeley, California did this they put a tax on sugar sugary beverages\nAnd low income this this from um writers uh and I have a column by ruining Ronnie calling as voters consider ... taxes and for US cities a new study finds that low income Berkeley neighborhoods slash sugar sweetened beverage consumption by more than one step\nAfter the nation's first soda tax went into effect this isn't twenty fourteen a penny announced tax on Soto one third of what Philadelphia was talking about and other sugary drinks\nAnd after the attacks took place in March twenty Fifteen residents are too low income neighborhoods report and drinking Twenty one percent less of all sugar sweetened beverages\nTwenty six percent less soda than the year before the soda industry has spent millions of dollars defeating taxes on sugary drinks and dozens of use in cities but in Berkeley a pass was Seventy six percent of the boat they're doing is on the ballot in Boulder, Colorado was San Francisco Oakland to Albany all over the place\nAnd so what's happening here in Oregon\nWe've got propositions one oh three in one off for a you know what I'm not sure if it was both of them but I've won all three I think\nWe're pretty much for sure funded by and and these are we're seeing all these ads on TV with some like granola eating guy in a health\nFood store going you know we don't charge taxes on groceries in Oregon and we never should but the but they keep trying to put taxes on and then and they ... some of the Republican efforts to tax groceries over the years that were easily knocked down\nAnd says we need to put it in our constitution that there can be taxes on groceries well the ... the constitutional amendment that they want us all to sign off on and it sounds so good yeah let's help low income people it's banned taxes on groceries\nActually specify sugary soft drinks as a grocery\nIt names them in this thing that they want to put in our constitution to make it illegal for us ever\nTo put taxes on soft drinks that are causing obesity and diabetes and that's really what it's all about and and it's so deceptive and this is an example of how you know there's a direct democracy sounds like a great idea until\nThe Supreme Court comes along and says yeah but the beverage English industry can drop ... you know millions and millions of dollars into a ... small state like Oregon\nAnd just you know wipe out public opinion\nAnd all you know like you know I'm thirty eight and twenty six days that are four days or however long it is to the election you know how well it worked out but that's what's going on\nSo you've got that I'm\nIn the in the good news side well maybe this isn't good news I don't know I guess it depends on where the climate change goes to the Supreme Court and whether Brett Kavanaugh has anything to say about it bark Kevin uh this from the guardian trouble blue in brewing climate change to cause dramatic beer shortages\nAre with climate change set to cause dramatic price by spikes and this and supply shortages according to new

Warren\nDonald Trump has been calling her poker Pocahontas for a couple of years you know ... evoking or invoking a when it said in the way it's said by a by a white guy like Donald Trump basically a racial slur\nAnd uh because she had said she no she never benefited from this right a Trump than the Republicans have tried to suggest that Elizabeth Warren got into Harvard because of this or she got a job as a professor because of this or Bloody Bloody blah\nHer saying that her great great great grandmother was Native American has never endured any better if they never given any benefit to her whatsoever\nShe has never use this for our benefit she has you know set of the few times and she even started you know in in one of her you know part of her resume when she was a you know going to work um as a professor but it you know it had nothing to do with why she got\nYou know the got the job\nSo Trump's and making fun of her and said he'll give a million dollars to a charity she takes a DNA test and there is any native and she turns out she was an Indian\nWell you know obviously he's gonna Welsh on it saying well you you know here maybe one thirty second in India and that doesn't mean that you're in a ... you know I Am but but she took the test and sure enough or great great great great grandmother was a full blown Native American and you know she grew up in Oklahoma were by

previous caller that was mentioned that he got more money in his paycheck right well I just want to call is to know they should check their withholding because my husband and I had pension checks and we're getting more money but when we looked at actually what was going on they lowered I withholding\nBut she added to our paycheck\nBut at the end of the year we'd have to pay it all back when income tax time\nComes around a little bit you all know about that until next April after the election\nAbsolutely but I just wanted to let you mourn your listeners to check that out can be a problem where it is in New Jersey New Jersey teachers tension do\nYou know who I mean typically withholding tables are defined by the Internal Revenue service and everybody just basically follows though is is there is something different with regard to the to the to your pensions or the state of New Jersey or whatever\nI have no idea really knows I called them up and said hey what are you doing now I'm going to have to a more money and income tax time right I Want to put back the way it was so we filled out the forms and they put it all back and I'm getting the same amount of money and my paycheck now\nYeah very interesting yeah I'm guessing if it's a pension that you're earning a little enough that the tax cut is relatively meaningless to you anyway I mean you know anybody earning under sixty thousand
