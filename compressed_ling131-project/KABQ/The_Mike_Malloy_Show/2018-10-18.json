{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "No government this thing is not justified because it's aggressive force against peaceful people every time\nWhat would government what would what would what are you trying to fix what is wrong with the climate\nSo let's say there's no government and well let's start with a simple case someone is polluting lake\nJust you know dumping stuff in the lake\nEffect from it yeah who owns the lake knowing full well that's the tone right there tragedy of the comments correct so first first on the lake correct\nThis is so that when I when I was looking at houses in Florida years ago or to to rent a there was actually a neighborhood or whatever where there was some houses on a lake and each a property that was on that lake actually owned essentially a pie wet trip\nDrawing out at the center of ah the lake and they all of course you know had a committee or whatever that to kinda governed the lake and they had come up with rules that somebody was not allowed to be in the lake if they were not an owner of or have permission from\nThe ... and you also have hold on homeowners association do people actually set up around the neighborhood\nSo I I'm going to a sort of jump on Greg's side here for just a second thought to further conversation let's say that uh the lake is owned by five different people you know and I'm only dumping toxic floods in the part of the lakes that I\nWas like that you weren't polluted air pollution is a violation of non aggression prayers are saying I Want my heart is great out diffusion as\nLucian is a violation of the non aggression on you\nKnow this is the air the air\nUnless you argue that we have to divide the atmosphere or into plot and then we pursued\nIt was my point is simply this by the time that it takes me to sue you for damages and I have to have standing which is and I have to be shown that I'd been harmed by the time I've been harmed by the greenhouse gas attack warming it might be too late to do anything about it that's my question\nWell what's the proof that warming the earth is going to actually harm you and secondly a one time there was this ... wound up benefiting people right I mean we're in mind it being a little bit warmer out in New Hampshire during the wintertime it's actually it's yeah it's actually good for a little bit is fine but\nC. O. two levels if they rise the level that some places in China have\n... if you ask the oh to write and she's already on so it actually helps the forest so like what's the problem\nThe problem well several problems if you forget the temperature if the CEO to goes above nine nine hundred ... pm ... parts per million then ... cognitive impairment\nSets that I'm driving in a stuffy room for a day and you'll see what I'm Talking about if you open the window you get us most is with the air which doesn't have that concentration but if around the world the average concentration it'll be the opposite you'll have to sit in a room constantly pumping\nWe sit in closed houses all winter long here in New Hampshire nobody's cracking a window open to get fresh air and because it's cold out\nThere hey my solution move north there is lots and lots and lots of vacant land north of us there's plenty of room\nYeah but the average around the world will still have ... million so basically\nThis is the year that I was talking about earlier the fear mongering that justifies the continued existence of the state earlier in the state of course is just an idea that justifies violence by strangers against peaceful people but ultimately you know as I was saying earlier\nUm the you know the state's justified through fear like oh my God if the state doesn't exist\nThese people that are sick are never going to get help they're going to die and while I Am have your mind going here is that oh my God this is the earth is going to turn into a health scape uh if we don't have the government around to tell people what to do as though the government has ever been historically a good steward of the environment and they happen\nYeah look at the military looks military dumping the initiative munitions and toxic ... all the ... right\nThat's right go ahead Greg\nBut if we if we uh simplify everything is just something very simple to analyze if you're a dumping toxic chemicals into the air\nUnless you're saying that someone if even one person dies from I\nDon't you think that um\nThe non aggression principled should be defended and you should that's defense force to stop you from doing that is that\nIf you have people being poisoned by other people and yes you have an actual you know actionable case in that particular case I understand what you're saying is well you won't know until it's too late\nHowever yes I Would much rather have one person died from some sort of environmental calamity\nThen have the state murdering millions of people across the globe across hundreds of years I mean the the state is the number one killer\nOf human done the number one non natural killer of human beings and it has contributed directly and indirectly through the early demise and demise generally of human beings across this planet in all the various forms and the fact that you would want to keep it around to simply say one person just shows that you are now ...\nWhat about a billion what if there was a billion people on the other side\nTotal fear mongering that's not happening there are billions right before the population is growing things for the call\nThis is just the trolley me all over without a trolley one of ... they'll try maimed for people that aren't familiar is there's a trolley or a train or you have something heading down that track and for some weird magical reason you happen to be standing next to some lever\nVet happens to control a intersection on the tracks and you can either do nothing or you can pull it and if you do nothing then X number of people wind up getting killed but if you pull it then another number of people and so you know it's this ethical dilemma\nAnd you know there are all kinds of unknown variables like why am I standing next to this lever and why can't I you know knock people off of the train track\nGood question are the people who are tied to the tracks in PMDD there so that there's not necessarily the requirement that they're tied to the tracks maybe they're just walking down the tracks 'cause that's the case my mind is made up I'm just going to walk away but if the guy with the labor is and what I mean could guide value or the guy with the lever how did\nI wind up next to the lever how do I know that this lever\nControls the say here's what I Know about this stupid global

C. O.\nJust can't stand anybody to have anything if they're not a millionaire\nIt it seems that that's the case I I think that there's actually a a deeper philosophical argument that the conservatives are making to themselves I don't know just think this I mean you can read it and Russell ... book the conservative mind\nAnd in numerous other publications over the years they used to be much more upfront about this William F buckle used to talk about this right out loud which is that if you have a stable and secure middle class\nThe conservatives feel or worry that that will lead to social instability it'll do it'll lead to things this is what what Russell Kirk predicted in Nineteen fifty one\nWas as the middle class was starting to emerge as a result of FDR's policies that if the middle class got strong enough you would see women demanding equal place in the workplace\nYou would see young people refusing to uh to honor their elders\nAnd uh I I forget the list but there was you know there's a hell of a couple of things there that you know that he laid out basically and sure enough it happened I mean you know in the sixties they legalize birth control pills and sixty one and boom you have the the women's movement\nAnd uh they legalized abortion and Seventy three and and and throughout that the you know two decade Arab more or less you had young people refusing to go to Vietnam and all of all the Republican sat around and go after Ross Russell Kirk with a profit we've got to destroy this middle class and turn these people back into the working poor so they will just shut up and go to work\nAnd you know stop voting stop pass away not stop protesting stop demanding things and and we can get on the about the business of getting rich\nAnd that's what's going on in my opinion girl\nAnd and ... and and uh the current occupant of the White House is doing that in a different way with all of this craziness I I scream every night at MSNBC for\nTalking as if this is a normal man so she is not taking he will never be he is not going to change he's Seventy two years old hits carved in stone what he is made of and nothing that he is made of it's very nice I almost\nHad up that the other night alley got gal she who's substituting I think for\nLawrence O'Donnell yeah called something that Donald Trump said ally yeah on the air\nAlley though she is is is solid I mean you know he's he's a ... as a journalist he you know it used to work for al Jazeera and ah you know he's ... he's been around the block he's a ... a Canadian immigrants to the United states\nAnd he you know he gets he gets all kinds of ... and stuff and he will he will speak the truth\nI'm a you know on occasion and I you know I have a lot of respect for him as a journalist ah although I Would still like to see these so called liberal network actually be liberal and actually have liberals on instead of just anti Trump Republicans but yeah I'm with the girl I didn't move along but thank you for the call and thanks for listening to us they're insane\nPaul Jesse in Miami aid us a Jessie what's up\nPlay hard job so much hey I Want to do the basics used to use the book surely should you know that\nDon't mean not the\nYeah in fact what was your mom do matter you know actually his exact quote was Ronald Reagan taught us the deficit so matter in what he was saying was re and it was the first guy to do the to Santa Claus theory triple the national debt while he was an office and then as soon as he left the Republican started screaming that the Democrats needed a cut Social Security\n...\nOkay thanks for ... don't mean to these guys you know the whole system is a scam\nMany options to consider the loan them you're writing\nCall a civilian storey\nThirty\n[noise]\nBought about Joan in Nashville, Tennessee age on what's on your mind that I\nDo much calm so much I called her new show late to say that ah I've been taking every since I'm a Trump was elected\nAnd he started doing the things that he is doing that and ... she is the uh the sound of a case in of America without the thin veneer of a civility in\nA democracy and fairness um the way I see it is that um if you look at each country ... each each society and for prime ankle and that the very top of decrying all it's very small\nAnd there's a limited number of people who can it at the top\nAnd you can look at that configuration across countries and society\nAnd so basically what you have is the people at the top relate to each other\nAs opposed to relating to the people at the bottom of the pyramid and whatever country or try to you want to look at\nWell I'll say most double not all of them and what whites are experiencing now\nIs one black people live only experienced in this country and so what I say is welcome to our world and I'm not saying that to be pejorative in any way although I don't apologize for being angry because I deserve to be angry\nBut want to understand is that when the rest of society looks at whoever they had marginalized and they accept\nThe ill treatment of the marginalized\nThey don't seem to realize that eventually that same negative behavior is going to move in towards them\nYou're a rich do not care about the poor they never have if you look at European society before they came over here to the continent of what they're calling America\nPaul whites went on as badly as ed on down there and there weren't any black people for them to blame and this is what they go on for the game and they seem to be whining towards it seems as though anything that hurts black people\nThey are fine with even if it means they have to suffer to yell at as long as they get a half a crumb war\nThan black people they're satisfied if the rich white stay the whole loaf of bread I Can't understand that and you are historian and I think I've read somewhere that\nIn the beginning\nPoor white and black people into marriage live together\nYeah there was a fair amount about up in the earliest decided\nThat they would put a wedge between those two groups tell of whites that failed lot late with rich fight as to which I think the same way about poor white as tall white seal about black people there\nAnd they just can't seem to come together\nAnd the technique that rich white use is very successful and they continued to use it and they should because it's successful all you have to do is give one group\nI F crumble up any other group oh easily with in a group give some factions within that group a few more crimes than the rest of the group and you've you've wipe out whatever goal they\nDirected against the wealthy whites and adults I mean it's successful\nSo you know in my mind conquer Joan and and and you know this is what Lyndon Johnson pointed out when he said the Republican strategy is essentially if you can convince the poorest white person that he's better than the richest black person he'll let you pick his pocket\nAnd and and that is where they you know that has been the Republican strategy LBJ called it out sixty seven and it's been going on ever since\nAnd I was I was going on long before that and and you're on your point about the thin veneer of civilization I think is a really important one\nIt's like the thin layer of the American middle class these things are there by virtue of a whole lot of people creating structures that put them in place and hold them in place and the Republicans are systematically destroying those structures and it's like they're taking the girders beams out of the building\nAnd eventually it's just going to be the shell and it's going to collapse in on itself\nAnd you know whether you call a civilization or democracy or or you know the America or whatever and then that's one of the things that concerns me so much John thank you ... in Berlin analysis thank you so much John in ... Wisconsin hey John what's on your mind\nRight Tom uh my idea is I've been going door to door prior to this round here and Randy Bryce I'm thirty two it's a it's the whole thing of um fascism I used to call it corporate system\nBecause the we've had a lot of union people around here it and we understand that\nThe corporation they don't want to hear from the people the one thing I hate the worst is they have the people tell them how to run their business right and it almost seems like now Trump is using or the Republicans are using the exact same sample like example of a\nUnit ... and they want they don't want the people to have a voice yeah I\nGot it right up front about it right up front about it and then he got ... you know big corporations that are right up front about it too I mean even you know Amazon now is is a you know having their their managers and they took over a whole foods they're they're having their managers sit down and watch these videos about how evil unions are and how these screw things up yeah it's that's\nA basic idea right out front and you know it's alive because everybody else who worked in a union around here and the other one point I wanted to bring up too as we used to have a ...\nAnd we used to make military shoes you know we had lent that's been down here as a representative and what are you still get a lot of pork barrel it just seems like more than\nJust shipped overseas yeah\nWell that was you know the buy America Act has passed in the Nineteen thirties the some of the federal government has the source products from I'm Aaron ... American manufacturers but there's a provision in there for a waiver from the president and Reagan started passing out these waivers like they were candy to federal agency so that they can buy things from overseas\nAnd now it's just absolutely routine every president has done it ever since John thanks for the call\nYour listening Tom\n... and I've got the perfect formula to help out and wind camera use ultra premium one can't purchases direct from boutique wineries no middleman and bottles and keeping his sources secret so he can pass the savings directly to you often forty eight percent less than you pay for the same wine at retail\nChipped right to your door so I Want to count as news six bottles that were packed the luxury mix sampler regularly Ninety five dollars is now anyone or the elegant red sampler regularly a hundred and one dollars is now just eighty five bucks Louis and I try lot five sixty seven the Napa cabinet\nFantastic definitely a deep full body rich red wine just spectacular for a limited time you can get a Fifteen Percent off one of the new radio ... plus free shipping go to C.

with\nAnd you know we still have all options on the table and how to deal with things I think ...\nIs one of the more difficult um so I think you know what we're going to have to do is one remember elections have consequences in less than three weeks a is a very\nVery important election where we can flip the house of representatives maybe flip the Senate or maybe flip ten governorships in a whole bunch of state legislatures\nAs well as attorney generals and others across the country so we've got to be active around that if we take the majority in the house or we will be able to do hearings on his taxes on the Molly minutes cause on all sorts of things and finally get some answers\nWere Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell have been very quite happy bearing their head in the sand and not knowing what Donald Trump was actually up to so\nThere are lots of things were going to be able to do should the election go well on November six but right now I think the focus has to be on let's make sure we all do everything we can to get out the vote for that election and then we've got twenty twenty coming up a bare minimum to make sure that we can take back the White House\nBut uh we all have to be really present inactive and will definitely do our jobs in Congress but we need everyone being present knack for November sex\nJohn and polls bow Washington if I'm saying that right here on

touchy feely game and the every time they do or the Republicans thumbed their nose as they're doing an end run around the Democratic a strategy um\nTime to wake up I guess is what I'm wanting to say ah I'll get back to you thank you\nYeah Johns that you know I think this has been a popular refrain that quite honestly has been overplayed because in the past I Would say I've seen this all too often where I Wish Democrats would be far more aggressive but right now we're watching us an generic ballot up double digits\nWere doing something right or maybe it's that they're doing something so wrong the public wants to change but you know I've actually for the first time since I've been in Congress have been happy with the message that we're going out talking about we're talking about health care and the cost of prescription drugs are talking about good paying jobs and the need for infrastructure\nAnd we're talking about the culture of corruption in Washington it's understandable people can relate to it\nAnd we have a message and I don't think we're being too soft or in how we do it\nNow I'll admit a Speaker Ryan for example his super PAC is probably the sleazy is pack I've ever seen out there and how they run ads\nBut they're not also being effective and many of these districts so you know they're going to do that if they're fine with rolling around in the mud they can but\nThey're not being effective and we're up double digits again on generic ballots and we're up in many of these races so I think talking about health care talking about those tax cuts they did talking about the corruption Washington and that no one in Congress is standing up to the president really is resonating so you know I don't know if we need to say it\nPounding our a fist on the table a or seeing it in a soft confident voice but either way we're saying it and I think that's quite an improvement for maybe some past\nCycle so well I certainly agree your complaint John in the past has often been something I've also been concerned about right now I actually feel uh that were doing some very right things going into November six\nAllen Missoula, Montana you're on the air with congressman phobia\nGood morning gentleman um it's not something you'd like to hear leash beyond where I'm I'm retired Vietnam that I'm a\nI'm a previously we didn't have to pay for a under try or we didn't have to pay for our pharmaceuticals and a a sense a Trump is come into office and they've stolen that away from us now and what are we even have to\nPay copayments now from our ah prescriptions and stuff and that's just another way that the Republicans keep stealing and we paid some pretty hard do those benefits and that's something that should be brought out in public they are doing things that media and nobody else was even\nA where um they're they're stealing our benefits left and right\nYeah I was ... it was a Senate bill and I can't remember the number is on it took me three days on the phone to try and track at all now because I started getting this bill all of a sudden\nAnd so they are constantly what you're you guys are both they're constantly see when a benefit so we paid highly for\n... let me address it in two ways one um you're right uh we put a lot of money into defense\nUm most of it going to private contractors that also happen to help out mightily and campaigns\nAnd not enough into the people who actually have fought for the country and defended this country and you know here's a good example you're giving of of what's happening but you know second it it really opens it up to a bigger broader issue the Republicans in Congress are simply unwilling and afraid to stand up to the pharmaceutical companies and you know this is one of the major things were ...\nAnd by the Democrats across the country um yeah I think one of the most interesting statistics are was between two thousand six I'm Sorry tree doesn't ten and two thousand sixteen the last time we ... we we did this um statistic uh there was something like two hundred and five or two hundred and ten drugs approved by the FDA\nEvery single one of them I had research provide help assistance provided by at age might national it's to help which is our tax dollars so every time we hear from these pharmaceutical companies that the drugs are so expensive\nAnd and going faster than the cost of other medical expenses is because of research and development [noise] it's a complete lie and uh you know the Trump Administration Republicans in Congress knew very little\nIf we get the majority we are trying to Congress in March ... taking your calls for the hour we'll be back in just a moment with more on Mondays and mark this is the Tom our moon rover out okay on the website poke in the house the

of California you're on the air with congressman poke you\nBoth good I'm Glad I got on 'em that this morning I was listening to your predecessor here in LA Stephanie Miller and the one in conversations with\nAll the people who have been saying when I've been saying for months we will eat complement on them that you guys get Congress back we need to put some eyeing cloud laws and that would shake quite plainly that\nUh you have to be as clear and transparent and the LA skyline after a Santa Anna's clear gray hair and that's that that\nI don't want Trump to be able to obfuscate and I mean I Know who he was Nineteen sixty eight when he made it really difficult for ah LA unified to build a badly needed to school on the Ambassador Hotel site so I'm\nI've known each and no good for for effort that I Would like to see some measure saying okay you want to run for president or governor or senator or congressman or you know any other you want to be out in the I'm a cabinet\nOr you had better be able to reduce your ... your college transcripts or there should be a civil service exam for um\nAnybody who runs for a that China high office I Want to make sure we never get a jerk like Trump anywhere near the White House again not even it's this year and I'd like to know what a\nBig Democrats assuming you in a nice steak house back in ... not to send it what you guys can do to make sure that something like this happens and protect our votes yeah\nGreat question Sarah and you know um I I think one of the things I've I've mentioned John Sarbanes from Maryland is leading a taskforce on one of the vice chairs\nAlong with a lot of other folks actually trying to address that it's such a good government task worth stressing everything from elections reform to campaign finance reform to ethics reform and we want that to be\nUm HR one that means the very first bill that Democrats introduced in the house of representatives would be a bill to address all of that uh we want to start the hearings on a tax returns and on the monuments clause to get to the bottom of a all the the corruption really that's happening\nWith this current administration so there's a lot that we can do and we are very committed to it because I'm you know I think for many of us\nWe thought there monuments clause was pretty self explanatory took this president to make it a somehow confused and now we've got to get there and clear that up on the taxes to every president's always released him\nThis is the first one not to I guess we have to clear it up but Democrats are committed to do that and again many of us are advocating this to be the very first bill introduced in Congress next session\nCharlotte in Ramona, California here on the air with Congress and poke in\nHigh a permanent congressman I'm calling to ask you a question about um what is the I Am mostly on the progressive side but I'm confused what is the position that the progressive take on the issue of immigration\nSuch as what to do with the children that are coming up on a company from the south what to do about the middle east refugees\nWhat is your policy if if the progressive could get what they want I'd like to know what that would be\nSure I'm so Charlotte I think what we've been advocating for\nUm is really what we're was kind of done two sessions ago and well it wasn't perfect it was a about a hundred percent virus where we're at right now uh which was comprehensive immigration reform that means there's going to be some extra protections at the borders\nBut there's also going to be a pathway to citizenship for aspiring Americans we have to recognize we already have\nAh probably about Thirteen million people here who are here undocumented uh it's not realistic to think that someone who came here when they were two weeks old or two years old is going to be deported at age twenty or forty um to a country they may not speak the language and uh and they may not know anyone there\nSo we have to have something in place and it's not an automatic ah there's a process to do that\nA bill went through the Senate with a I think about Seventy votes um two sessions ago and didn't get taken up by the Republican leadership in the house representatives\nUh it was a bipartisan compromise didn't go as far as I Would have liked to go on in some areas but realistically\nThat is the protests we have to do right now family separation um DACA I mean all these are separate fights we're having that we shouldn't we should have a comprehensive immigration reform and I think that's a path that we would try to bring forward again should we be in the majority\nBill in Sun City Arizona here on the air with cars and poke in um\nHey take one out of nitrogen and bought it with one out of oxygen and call

Pokemon\nUm I'm calling because I Am currently in a Twitter war with someone who he was referring to as far as Mitch McConnell coming out yesterday and using the debt as a way to cut Social Security and Medicare they're in such a Bible that\nYou cannot\nGet down to even discuss that were fake news you're lying ... doesn't lie I'm what you point out the facts to them they don't want to even consider another viewpoint\nSo how are you going to get through to the seniors who consistently will ignore all the attacks on Social Security they're not lying about it anymore they're open about it ...\nYeah yeah it's sort of like how do you need programmed people out of the cult of Fox News thinking more [noise]\nYes uh sorry about that my phone just went off I'm sure he was talking here I'm so Laurie you bring up a great point and I think you know there are some that were not going to change right I mean the thirty five percent that are sticking with\nThe Trump hard and fast or there for maybe some other reasons than they actually admit\nBut I Do think most seniors especially you know I I've watched in the last five years first remove my mom to some senior housing now to assisted living I look at the people who are living there you get to know the neighbors\nAnd there's so many people that rely on Social Security without it or they wouldn't be able to uh to live and I think you can actually point out the fact that the Republican leadership has set this thing each time after they pass the tax cut bill that's going to benefit big corporations\nAnd the top one percent eighty three percent of money that was in that tax bill goes to the top one percent in ten years\nAnd then they're going after your Social Security to pay for it and your Medicare and I think we can get two people and their pocketbook issues especially seniors who just rely for their life and death on whether or not they have that money I think we can really have a conversation with those who don't have a different reason\nFor wind vote for Trump and and you know in some cases there's things like racism and others\nThat are just tougher to break through Robin\nPhoenix, Arizona you're on the air with congressman token\nYeah it's a pleasure to talk to a um wanted to talk about the D D triple C strategy here and I think what what's happening with our our party is we get kind of into the weeds on stuff that only affects the very few people\nAnd I think one thing that we should do is basically promote the idea that the Republicans are the ... by a thousand cuts on the middle class and we need to fight this like tax reform and we just use their philosophy since corporations are people there should only be one tax code income is income which you get rid of the uh you know Fifteen Percent cap\nOn a dividends and just treat all week I'm the same because corporations are people so therefore people are corporations we should get the same to ... or you should take the ... elections away from the corporations and move that way or the one thing about the taxes on Social Security does that's kept on you know I had a hundred and thirty two thousand Kay of income\nThat's a hundred percent six points where you want to give most of America a five percent a rave right away to cap off and make again Texas Social Security and all the income all the way up there don't cap it at one thirty two people will get a five percent or a tax cut right there [noise]\nYeah right ... such as the first issue um I agree there are many of us who in many I mean are quite a bit in the Democratic party who've advocate for changing that code and the passive income so called passive income\nVersus active income uh there shouldn't be that distinction and I think that's something that we're going to be talking about 'em to the second point I agree I mean it's really a regressive tax when you have a cap\nOn Social Security a certain point and we're talking about how long does the fun to have\nThe only difference I might say Rob is I don't think it's really going to be a cut for people I think if you lifted the cap or adjusted the cap for inflation significantly um you'll just extend the life of Social Security so that we don't have to have an increase I don't think you see an immediate cut\nBut that's actually the reason to do it we have to have Social Security around because everyone is paid into it they have to be able to get it when they retire\nAnd the best way to do that is to really look at that cap\nAnd it just seems kind of bizarre that you know a bit I and most of the people I Know our pain\nOr you know a a Social Security taxes on all of our income and you know billionaires are paying Social Security taxes on you know one percent of their income is like they're not paying their their their fair share of for to support Social Security which is a program that keeps his country vital\nYep and and there's a lot of um ideas of how we could exactly do this but I look at the cap is is one of the single easiest ways and I would also argue we should change the\nIndex for how we increase what people getting Social Security to a CPI dash eat witches are based on what senior spend their money on for twenty five percent of their income is on medicine and medical care\nUm we should recognize that and that way they would get a little bit more of a boost as well\nCongressman we have forty five seconds to the end of the hour what are your thoughts on the coming week\nYou know I'll tell you where are now less than three weeks to the election I think my thoughts for the next three weeks are going to be on the election as our I think most people um I just really ask people to be active with the candidates you support and the groups\nThat are supporting the candidate to support in the next three weeks it is so vital\nUm every but we get out of the majority of people agree with us on the issues if they get out to vote we will be very very successful and be able to turn\nThis country and many of our states around so please take that that age that you have right now over what's going on turn it into activism we can build us into a movement and not just have a moment um I I think that's the key for the next few weeks\nAnd share our values as we talk about our issues\nI tell you one of the big things we're doing now is we actually we do doors is supposed to talk to people they really do agree with us\nUnder some Hogan thanks so much for being with us the absolutely think he'll always great to have have you guys are
