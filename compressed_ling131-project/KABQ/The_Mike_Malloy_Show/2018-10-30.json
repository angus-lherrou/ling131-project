I Wonder if this is one of the situations to where maybe some of the opponents of medical cannabis\nVoted for some of these things to be on the ballot for the purpose of confusing voters don't believe well if we just overwhelm them you've got three choices here all of them basically do the same thing with minor differences and then voters just wind up getting confused in yeah I'm just I don't want all of them that\nHow did these get on the ballot in Missouri is it a like a ballot initiatives started by the voters were they gather signatures or is it something that was referred to the ballot by the legislature I'm not familiar with Missouri's\nNot their friend array of them so there's two that are amendments and one is a proposition\nI'm looking at the things that reason links to all of these it appears as though all of these wound up by getting put on by the voters\nOkay yeah so that also could just be the disorganization ... community because there's different groups and we all know how groups can split into other groups each trying to achieve the same goal in different ways\nRight not now the article actually does say if both constitutional amendments pass the one with the most votes will prevail a proposition C would make statutory change is that the legislature could reverse by a simple majority\nThat would take effective only F neither amendment passes so that's how it would be in Missouri again other states have different\nUh different rules on how that would happen\nAnd finally in Colorado where they already do have\nRecreational cannabis there's amendment act which would remove the removed from the state constitution the definition of industrial help\nThat was added by admits sixty four and twenty twelve ... legalize cannabis for recreational purposes or the\nVest actually sounds like it would be a good thing because in a lot of places health is considered a controlled substance because well it kind of looks like weed and you know we've mad\nI looked it up and it is three different groups to Missouri sponsoring three different things\nThat it's all for tonight but we'll be back tomorrow and always on line up free talk live dot com\nLet's talk ... let's talk about down home values made in the usa blue Jay was like you wore as a kid I remember\nWhere they might lose\nEvery\nYear and the way they\nVoted down and cry\nWhen in\nDoubt this guy\nNoodle version of comfort getting dime a dozen genes every stitch guaranteed in order to vendor motorcycle dream comes Kevlar reinforced seat of a U.S as a D. dot com that some girls that dot com or coal\nEight eight eight eight for eight Seventy seven thirty eight eight eight eight eight eight Seventy seven thirty a dime a dozen genes got others don't\nOften go fast purple over all the folks and I don't well register\nOnline at ...\nFor my family county board of elections like five or ... or ... or ... or by corporate who ... who are [noise] hope I ... off of our fallen\nOut free I aren't making Iran downloading now at the\n\nBottom investigation troops to the border I'm only a Francis unsuspected up sending fourteen pipe bombs to prominent Democrats around the country has been charged end is being held without bond with us would shut and has more on the investigation of say sort of some\nI'm a bill Bennett who gave us such wonderful little clips as a check this out this was literally Ronald Reagan's secretary education back in the day this was in the eighties\nA year ago\nOf a tough line anyway a ... you know you just said some pretty outrageous things but basically uh my understanding is that they took\nOut of the recommended you know national standard and say they weren't mandatory national standard but the recommended stands for education and not very ... you know some minority of our schools apparently teach civics um\nAnd again I'm not sure on that fact I Know that you know because people call in the program all the time saying well you know we never they didn't they don't teach physics Sarah my town in Mississippi and then somebody will call in from some you know wealthy town and California upstate New York and say oh we had a great physics class just you know last year or excuse me civics class um so uh what do we do\nWell you know what I mean the question I Would ask will ban and analysis answer your question remember when he wrote that book the death of outrage after a ... Bill Clinton scandals I mean we're is William and it these days\nWhile he wrote the book uh virtues to I I think it might have passed away I mean you know you have that huge gambling scandal\nWell maybe maybe I I mean I Do know\nAnd I want to speak ill of him but we are the people who who shared his view and were clamoring for virtue and\nCriticizing the death of outrage I mean why don't you hear any of those voices are with what Trump is done and making a mockery of of the president's the I mean there's been silenced but I look I I think having some basic civic education\nOr in teaching folks about the constitution the declaration of independence or the Gettysburg Address\nThe I have a dream speech at Dr King's letter from Birmingham jail his speech about militarism and the Vietnam War some basic things about\nA ... of American history or would be a ... the part of the answer in a in combat adding a propaganda that is totally inconsistent\nWith our founding I mean our founders a do not perfect over really a a full philosophers I mean they had this sense of the enlightenment ideal of knowledgeable citizens there was a very small group of citizens of white\nMale property owners but amongst those citizens they thought a you ought to have education and you ought to have reason and you have to have debate and you really ought to read\nA and so uh we're so far away from that are in terms of what constitutes political discourse than a a return to some of the basic principles that are founded this country and bring that into education\nAnd education every part of the the the country I think that is the only long term way or that you combat the ignorance and the hate\nYeah I [noise] and yet there's this um both sides is and that makes me crazy I don't see\nA ... a alley Jackson's MSNBC show guys on seven AM here on the west coast and and I watched the first ten minutes or so\nThis morning and she started out with John cases of as a Republican governor from Ohio who uh was doing his both sides on both sides have to turn back the writer\nI'm Sorry I'm not here in this kind of hateful rhetoric on our site number one and number two then she ended that segment with a clip from Ronald Reagan talking about how we can't have racism and I'm an in the United states is a terrible thing\nAs if you know that was like Reagan's position Reagan's first speech after he was ... was in Philadelphia, Mississippi where Schwerner Chaney and Goodman were murdered\nAnd and it was a speech on into an exclusively wide audience on states' rights here's the bill Bennett clip that I was looking for this is what Bill see again these guys they they they they've been catering to the races since the Nineteen eighties this is bill ... at the former secretary of education\nBut I Do know that it's true that if you wanted to reduce crime you could if that were your sole purpose you could aboard every black baby in this country and your crime rate would go down that would be an impossible ridiculous and morally reprehensible thing to do with your crime rate would go down\nTo that and and now you know and nobody got when he said that back in the eighties\nAmazing I mean it's a it's just so shocking when you when you think about historical figures and you wonder how they set certain things that uh this is an example of someone in contemporary times is spewing that kind of paid just shocking\nI think you can draw a straight line from from Reagan speech in Philadelphia and bill Bennett's comments like that and these were not I mean these kinds of comments came out of the Reagan Administration regularly they were just very rarely discussed\nOr the other thing that the blows my mind I'm Sorry to monopolize you hear I Will turn you over to our caller was talking about it but at the the other thing blows my mind is that there is really the the synagogue shooting in in Pittsburgh there's three pieces to it that are that are really pretty major\nUm you know I think in fact let me get the exact quote here\nUm the the first major piece of it is exactly what the what the shooter tweeted out\nAn hour before he went to before he committed the murder\nThere's a a a Jewish organization or called high ass HI a out you know and you know the the uh and I'm I'm looking for the wedding exactly that's an acronym form of that base as the international ... well it's it's a it's a Jewish group that helps refugees originally mostly they help Jewish refugees and now they're helping refugees from all over the world\nHears his tweet from just before he went to shoot these guys up these ... these these people in the Senate got higher gas likes to bring invaders in to our country who kill our people I Can't stand by and watch my people get slaughtered screw your optics I'm going in\nAnd and then uh on October twenty out he had a in response to I Am a national refugee ... event that was put on by highest\nUm he tweeted in response to them because they had just listed the address is a three hundred Jewish congregations in thirty three states that were\nThat were celebrating the work of high us he said his his response to them and I'm not sure this was a toy that might've been a Facebook because it simply says alongside a link in New York Times\nHe said you like to bring in hostile invaders dwell among us question mark we appreciate the list of friends who have provided period in other words the list of churches and this church was among or synagogue for the synagogue was on that list\nUm so you've got that you've got the fact that the that the shooter was using an air Fifteen which is why he was able to kill so many people and and take out for cops I mean he didn't kill him and he shot for cops\nAnd they were ... and then of course you've got the anti Semitism and it seems like everybody's focusing on the anti Semitism which is huge and important and it's a it's a crisis in America but there's ... I think that you know Reagan average ... are are going off on the on the on the caravan and he's back to it again this morning\nA it was probably the thing that actually triggered this guy or push this guy to do this particular act in this particular synagogue at this particular time your\nTime I ... I appreciate your raising the issue of high at because there was a beautiful piece by live a gal Lincoln today actually in the New York times and live is someone I Know he came to this country when he was nine in Nineteen Nineteen eighty or any talks about how high is a helped him and his mother\nAnd his family come to the United states from uh the Soviet Union\nA and one high it's meant and he talks about how high is now is actually not helping uh primarily uh Jews because uh the the focus is on refugees are more broadly and why that has a engendered\nSo much hate so you're you're absolutely right that the primary motivation of this\nA shooter seems to be a concern of immigrants coming into the United states and there was an article I read where are the right has in his novel the camp of Maine so I don't know if you've read it but it's been\nA French novel talking about people actually of all places in the coming in in voting loads a million Indians to invade Iran\nCome on it's like the Turner Diaries we got we got to have a break here will pick up your calls for ... this is the Tom our program if we hit Eighteen minutes past the hour the machine stops here either hacking congressman Ro Khanna he'll be taking your calls in just a moment [noise]\nFind them and Thirteen fifty on Twitter you can be teased Tom tom you find out more\n\nTrey association of America the R I S H agrees to some demands made by another organization parents music\nResource center as a result any album dean to contain offensive lyrics must be issues with the warning labels for the lyrics must be printed on the sleeve most record companies do with the labels which don't seem to hurt sales\nAlso this week in Nineteen eighty five the Miami Vice soundtrack album featuring the number one theme song tops the album start in America ushering in a new age of the soundtrack [noise]\n\nAnd this week in twenty twelve metal hammer magazine published a list of the top ten rocking heavy metal mustaches ever the list which included mustaches warned by the likes of Frank Zappa\nAll the members of black Sabbath except ...

problem because this negativity affecting white\nRaces list to be erased it can only be done about white black people cannot do it for whites only whites Ken\nAnd I'm not saying if whites\nWho find themselves says non races should confront the races and violent way\nBut they need to call them out each and every time they make statements like we see and half her that these racist make\nAnd even

spread out over jurisdictions um buyers have filed a lot of lawsuits um a lot of those have settled there's been a couple of cases um where Trump has one\nUm they were cases a year and my understanding is they were cases where a judge looked at the contract and found that um the actual sales contract had all the necessary disclosures 'em and did not make a finding in favor of of the buyers\nUm but uh you know there's a lot they've they've gone through the civil route ... in a lot of places um there were considerations of criminal charges and so some of the behavior may have be outside the statute of limitations at this point I'm you know they they really it's it's really an open question about whether anything happens from here\nI'm but certainly a lot of people were hurt in these um in these deals because so many of them went belly up um\nAnd when they were really up what happened right trust\nAnd well that that's what's interesting about it um and that's actually what drew me to the story was I I was taking a look at his real estate deals\nThe more recent ones and when I was really struck by how many of them um failed bankrupt you know foreclosed never built started weren't you know construction wasn't finished and it just raises a question to me about what you know why is he doing this over and over\nA and E. and also why are people partnering with him because he's got a number of different partners in these deals [noise] um\nAnd uh what what I found out with his licensing agreements and provide often I'm a pretty sizable upfront fee and then some of it is predicated on you know that the percentage of sales and things like that but we found clauses like one in Panama where I even for unsold units he would still get paid\nEven if it weren't so by a certain time\nUm he would get paid per unit even for the untold units so um there was a lot of money that he could get without the project having to perform I'm very successfully\nSo he he he he cuts to deal with local developer to build a build to build a Trump Building\nUm he charges them a whole bunch of money millions and millions of dollars for use of his name he promotes the deal people put money into it\nIt uh and and a piece of that money is instantly skimmed off the top and given the Trump is just licensing fee raises fee for that and then the thing goes belly up it declares bankruptcy there's no way to claw that money back from Donald Trump's habit of aka at walk away with the money\nAnd the investors are stuck with a you know with the bankruptcy getting pennies on the dollar and my ... is that ... is that my understanding what you're saying\nYeah I mean you know she ... yes mostly ah you know when when the project went bankrupt in Panama twenty Thirteen heated shaved his fees I'm twenty million dollars but from our estimate he's still received thirty to fifty five million dollars\nOn that project end what to me one of them are striking things about that project um to me with it there so it was financed where the corporate bond so people bought\nBonds or in order to you know it's basically sort of a way of lending their money to the project or two hundred and twenty million dollars in bonds were sold now eventually on that principle only a hundred and twenty million or I'm Sorry there was a hundred and twenty million that was not ultimately paid back what one investor told me\nUm [noise] so um you know but he again still made between thirty and fifty five million from what we can figure out that they were interest payments\nTo and they didn't know they had there were and we're gonna have to break during the second one the one thing that you know I mean it just blows my mind that the that the Republicans held years and years of congressional hearings and lots and lots of fiber ventilation\nThat Hillary Clinton was talking on an insecure server and our email your personal email from home which never was even hacked\nAnd and they have nothing to say about the fact that Donald Trump is using an an secure I found in the White House over the loud objections of everybody from the secret service Lee NSA um you know doing something far worse similarly\nUh you know I ... in the white water was a land deal the bill Clinton invested in back before he was governor of Arkansas where he and Hillary lost thirty five thousand dollars it it it it went down in flames just like so many of Trump's hotels\nAnd the Republicans pursued him on this for years I mean for six or seven years until they finally found Monica\nAnd and and Trump is doing far worse in case after case after case where the Democrats on this\n... you know I didn't I didn't examine that political element as on up the story at that point the ... you know

I'm shot a AK forty sevens I shot old Thompson machine guns and I'm sure they are Fifteen and I did it all on a licensed gun range when we lived down in Atlanta\nAnd uh you know I got no problem with people being able to walk into a gun range a new professional environment and in fact I took my altering my kids are shot these weapons\nI'm ... and uh you know I have no problem with that I you know looking back on it I'm I'm a little concerned now you know the one thing I've learned that I didn't know then is that there's an enormous amount of a lead dust that that gets blown into the air whenever a gun is fire and he ended up would lead us all over your hands\nAnd this causes severe and permanent neurological damage so you know I I I don't so much do it anymore but but I still\nDo today and we went in with my brother that's the\nThat's the problem with an indoor downright\nWhile 'til I is the problem with just shooting the gun because you know the IRS right there it and you're right in front of your face but but and and yeah there's a lot of lead man arrangement but my point is that\nYou know I'm not calling for guns to be banned I never have what I'm suggesting is that number one\nWeapons of war and and and frankly I think ... ... I include suddenly article a semi automatic weapons including pistols in that category\nNow we can have a debate about that but you know if you if he would look at the cop shows prior to the Nineteen eighties every cop in America was using a revolver they were they were not using semi automatic weapons they were they were they really normal resolvers\nAnd and and and I think that you know we went back to that and get all these semi automatic weapons off the streets obviously the cops need them right now 'cause like this because the bad guys had but if we could purge our society a semi automatic weapons\nUm number one and number two I think we should do the same thing with guns that we've done with cars and we started doing this with cars in the Nineteen teens\nBecause cars were killing people guns are designed to kill people so you know I mean it seems even more appropriate for gun as three simple things number one is you have a registration or a serial number of a number or in the case with a weapon it'd be a serial number that follows it from birth to death\nAnd always is attached to one person by virtue of a title that has to be registered every year with the state just like your car number one number two that everybody has to demonstrate their proficiency when I when I you know one through the Georgia police academy I learned how to shoot\nYou know the professional way I'd I'd you know learn how to shoot before on on gun ranges and in fact back before that and and and you know when I was a kid\nIn our class you know with twenty two pistols or twenty two rifles but but you know\nIf you can prove that you know and and if you and in every state has the mechanism for this\nUh you know it's it's ... it's what you have to go through to get a a in most states anyway you know to get a a concealed carry permit and number three insurance I think it's crazy that if a malicious or a drunk driver or just you know a a craze homicidal terrorists maniac\nHad killed all those kids in Newtown or in Parkland with a with a car Geico we'd be paying out a million bucks to each one of their families and because they were killed with guns there's there's been you know the there is nothing I mean you know families out there and go find me pages to pay for funerals and things\nThat that makes no sense to me and in fact that's a a Republican free market solution that was suggested back by ... by the Reagan people in the eighties\nYou know that there should be liability insurance for gun owners\nBecause then you're going to have the same thing you have with cars where you know if you've got a ... a couple of domestic I got a domestic violence conviction for example the insurance companies going to look at you and say you know as a gun on to this guy has higher risk than anybody else so instead of being fifty bucks a year the liability insurance is going to be five hundred dollars a year\nOr you know if you've got to a domestic violence convictions it's it's five thousand dollars a year just like if you tuned drunk driving convictions it's damn hard to find insurance and it's very very expensive these seemed to me like reasonable thing is William and the majority of Americans support these positions they had been polled why would you oppose them\nI oppose them because one there it's constitutionally protected right\nToo I mean\n... ... in there are\n... you know in the constitution it says that the you know one of the functions of Congress has to pay for roads right it's article one section eight you have a ... so you could argue that you have all those ever been adjudicated the Supreme Court the best of my knowledge but you could argue of a constitutional right to drive a car to on the public roads but once you're on the public roads\nYou know once you're outside your own home I mean you can you can own and driving a car all you want on your own property without a license without registration and without insurance but once you're in in the public world you've got to have those three things why not for gun owners\nAnd this is what I'm saying is like you said earlier guns or may kill yeah some of them dump or our eye\nWhen the founders made the constitution\nThe reading my book back in there is because we had just barely gotten out of a war with the tyrannical government I\nKnow that's not why that that was that was actually a Seventeen year old kid wrote an article for the n._r._a. magazine in Nineteen Seventy four that made that argument that the founders wrote the second amendment because of government ever became tyrannical ways that people should be able to overthrow in government\nI happened to collect and writings and James Madison from the convention and I've written extensively about this I just finished writing a book about the second amendment there will be out on June fourth of next year it's called the hidden history of Second Amendment\nThat was never even discussed it wasn't discussed at the constitutional convention in this in the summer Seventeen eighty seven it wasn't discussed at any of the ratifying conventions the\nOriginal Second Amendment was a way of maintaining a militia in each state in the union\nDuring a time when when the consensus of most of the founders wasn't they did not want there to be a standing army when there was not a war going on they were fine with the standing navy but there should not be a standing army and less we're having a war is so you have to be able to bring you have to be able to mobilize the militias really quickly\nAnd the proof of that you've been in in addition to literally page after page after page or discussion of this and Madison's notes from the constitutional convention the proof of that is that in order to make sure that that was the case article one section eight says that the army may not exist for more than two years without Congress reauthorized in it every two years forever\nAnd if Congress fails to reauthorize the existence of the American army air for everything except the navy if Congress fails to reauthorize that every two years it vanishes\nSo no they had nothing to do with being able to overthrow the country and had to do with a militia and they changed the word the free country in the second amendment to free state\nBecause Patrick Henry the largest slave holder in Virginia got up and gave a big speech about how the in Virginia the militia was called the slave patrol as it was in Georgia and he got up and he said if the if if we ever get a president who's a northerner and we ever had a crisis where the militia and ... in Virginia it gets it gets mobilize\nThey will destroy our slave patrol and they will in fact probably nationalize all of our slaves and put them in the army\nAnd and so they and so Madison a called him paranoid you can read it and Madison's notes and be he said to Patrick Henry he said OK I'll change that we're a country to free state so the state the state's militias will be protected this had nothing to do with overthrowing a tyrannical government\nSay I'll go and look into that or not I mean I'll go and look into it but I have a small my understanding of it\nBut I won't do any of the truth\nIs if you if you can if in fact if you can find even one sentence in context inappropriate contacts from any of the founders or ... or any time in the first Thirty years the history of this country about the second amendment venues to shoot back at the U.S government\nGave me a call back and I'll send you an autograph book okay\nAll

Schmidt a tweet in a PBS us over a democratic underground just posted this and the you know typically ... for that I I Would miss the\nUh this was a posted yesterday and I was traveling back from LA yesterday\nSteve Schmidt a tweeted the following it's a it's a four tweet a ramp\nISIS Gingrich looked into the camera and said that the election was about two things Kavanaugh and the care of him all day every day Fox News and the Trump propaganda industry spends forth an unrelenting river of conspiracy theories and ... and lunacy\nAnd like a precision guided munitions it finds its intended targets I keep my this is Steve Schmidt the Republican\nElection strategist who ran the John McCain for president campaign in two thousand eight\nWhen he was when he ran against ...\nIf finding as it finds its intended target among them or the female minded sick and racist\nIt's singular purpose is incitement and it is working on migration a migration of poor and desperate humans souls has been turned into an are an invading army uh panzer division about to crash through America's southern border\nThe intent is as malignant as it is purposeful there was only one goal that is to create a frenzy of craziness before an election where the American people will have their first opportunity to repudiate the vial and fill the regime led by Trump\nNow we see the terrible cost of Trump is all the lies conspiracy theory is coated racist and anti Semitic language intimidation of bought into ... intimation of violence in declarations that aren't are enemies in the state\nAnd and people have activated the evil people who attempted the largest assassination plot in American history and gunned down eleven Americans at a temple in Pittsburgh\nThey had been radicalized by the contagious poison of an American president and his fellow travelers the hour for pretending there is no causation between the rhetoric and the violence is over\nThe state had motives of these terrorists is a recitation of the message flowing like sewage from the White House Fox News judicial watch Mark LeVine Limbaugh and Gingrich is not accidental and it is not coincidental it is the deadly and inevitable consequence of Trump\nKim in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Ken what's up\nI was calling to talk to you about the cause\nAnd some of these issues nationally the racism and prejudice the anti Semitism that that we're always blaming the other in this country and to me that the answer is to point out that austerity\nIs austerity is the problem it is not your brown neighbor right it is not the African American down the road who has a job\nThat's not yet okay we have to stop working poor and powerless people and the problem because the problem is scared it mind that that we can squeeze\nThe systems so tightly that the only burden is borne by the very poorest they're very least able to carry that burden and that that can just continue and continue and a lot less education we have\nThe less money put into social safety net in love with this problem it's gonna be rearing its ugly hat yeah we can address it without addressing austerity I'd ... that's all it I I agree\nAnd and austerity is is you know this is ... what we call Neal liberalism right at the end the board of award for what you're what you're talking about and the idea that uh you know the government is the is bad and evil and we need his little government as possible and and private industry and private enterprise and the billionaires the run them are noble\nAnd delivered strictly thoughts yeah I I Know and yet we have people all over the world and violence stuff Kim\n... our government is huge where we're involved in everything every corner of the globe and you're an empire that ... that knows no bounds we literally do not feel bound to our government and it's not even I mean rational people by our government feels no down everything is under our control we're the only sovereignty\nAnd I swear it when I listen to the Trump talk when he says America First what he's saying is America's way or the highway that's what I hear in ... yeah\nYeah and and ... and Eric and what he's saying is Trump's way or the highway not even America's way because he does not represent the opinion of the majority of Americans\nAnd it's not even sure on I mean because as you just mentioned Neal liberal I'm near liberalism this is not the austerity policies are not the Republican policy these are the governmental policies at the last four decades and all the lip service has been paid by the Democrat Party to a progressive ideas\nThan an an ideology is yeah um you know I'm not going to call them democratic because you're not the name of the party so let's let's be respectful but you know but but you know yeah I get\nWhat you're saying and and and I and broadly speaking I agree with everything you're saying Kim so I'm not I'm going to move along thank you for the call Dennis in St Petersburg Florida does what's up\n[noise] hey ... or ... or earlier um [noise] I just wanted to give you a ... number one on pointing out the the real reason for the synagogue shooter\nOr which was trope a Trump competing to and including marching orders just like you did the bomber about immigration yeah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Malloy Show", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "30"}
