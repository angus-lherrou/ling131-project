Charlie uh once had an incentive for bitcoin to break\nBecause he is the number who yeah the number to alternative\nUm so if bitcoin started failing like mine was just ...\nIt's not number two these days like queens I think in the top ten still but I don't think it's yeah like pointed last in my book the wheel is like the special\nGosh what is it do it is good I mean the fees are enlisted highest court has the lowest block time that's yeah lower block so I'm at work when I go to a store and buy something with bitcoin\nThey don't sit around and say well wait let me make sure you're not going to double spend that I'm going to need Music Hall at all or may not our I think that's an issue I mean for real I get that on line that could be an issue but it retail which is one concern with\n... I'm not going to use light coins is just as high but he uses ... just a slow or as fast as anything else I mean you have like going in the background at a ... yeah you're going to say I don't want to address no one uses it\nNot surprisingly um but anyway there is that and also the fact that you find okay uh yeah so if you want to see two guys really go head to head I mean you gotta watch this debate and so I I wanted to let your listeners know because they're ... keyed into\nThe bitcoin cash versus bitcoin debate so handle some of them are for sure well yeah there\nIs this still will decay important I mean are they still arguing\nOnly are you kidding I understand what look\nJust use the thing you like get out their support the thing that you like if you like bitcoin BTC than spend that if you like a bitcoin cash right I Know it's just it's so not cool like some someone\nUh uh I was falling on Twitter these two girls made an album and they're like hey we'll take lightning and I'm like okay do I have to open a channel with you in order to buy your CD and\nThey didn't respond I guess that they didn't know\nThey don't know how it works and it's so stupid and complicated to open a channel with somebody you got to put some locks the money up your that's such a bad ... user experience though ... been trying this\nYeah well in LA man I'm is close I think is you'll find to a bitcoin maximalist in New Hampshire I Know a couple of ... there are other of a few of those out there and I'm not\nI'm not a full blown max because you do accept other crypto I have nothing wrong if it works for you then I'm happy and you're not using US dollars were good [laughter] um\nAre you holding it all in a in BTC bitcoin converting everything to bitcoin\nGenerally but there are certain things that I've held over time not I still have some stuff that I've held\nSo then you're not ...

things that's really hard to I got it right now really easy to use but opening a channel with the lightning network is opening a channel on the network and I think that's the part that gets lost about ...\nSomething I was confused about I thought you had to open a champion when everyone you wanted to do business with Chris says as long as you have one channel open on the lightning network you can make payments to anybody on the like yeah\nSo I have a I have a channel open a with the folks who do see light mean a which is a company in France\nAs they do the e clear wallet and I opened up a wall with them up or twenty bucks in it but I can pay anyone anyone on the lightning network it doesn't matter where they're at and I don't have to have to direct channels opened with them\nIt will not work just like\nWhen I go to a website I might be going through five hundred different routers to get to the Web site that's how the lightning network operates\nSo question or they technically money transmitters every step along the way when they're receiving money and then passing it along to somebody so anyone who's running a lightning notice them technically a money transmit or legal\nTerm of being how you'll never know what the contents of that money is most people will say now there are some people that believe that this is the big key weakness of the lightning network is everybody's now suddenly a lightning trance matter or a money ...\nWhich is stupid anyway it's not only am saying like oh yeah they're they're doing something bad but the\nBut there are a couple of videos up that

Virginia Hey Wayne what's on your mind that\nHey Tom I'm listening to your shows opening um you mentioned ... been in the ... district of Virginia ... a Republican candidate and he's running an ad here that claims that his opponent Leslie Coburn wants to\nIncrease taxes for the average Virginians about sixteen hundred dollars and that just has to be a lot\nYeah I'm a big body that would run on that kind of platform these days we stand a chance what gets me is so far the badge been out for at least a week and I haven't seen any response from Leslie Coburn and I think Democrats make a huge mistake\nWhen they let Republicans lie and get away with yeah\nGuess would be that she's supporting something like single payer health care which would raise taxes but it also would reduce your your you know health insurance premium so you end up ahead\nUm and and they're taking that number and and ... you know one of the problems is when you start trying to explain something with any complexity and there's one of the reasons why we don't have a single payer you know the the the if you try to explain some of the complexity you've already lost the argument\n[noise] have you had as it may I'm just yeah I work with a shovel a coach who vote Republican and um they they will accept what riggleman as saying in the ad as it is and you know\nYeah this is ... ...\nThere you go thanks a lot for the heads up on that way and appreciate it a mark in San Diego California a mark what's on your mind that\nHey I I just wanted to call and I'm Glad you got me on your quickly 'cause I Want to respond to that are anti Ted Cruz added which was fantastic I've been waiting for somebody to do that because each Republicans always get away with it taking on a map all the air the tough guy when in actuality it's exactly the opposite\nYou know I mean they always call liberals snowflakes and I guess that's it's a sign of weakness will show compassion for your fellow man but these guys when it comes time to serve in the military like all Trump all ... during the ... ah he hid behind by drafter ... everybody knows that but nobody brings often enough\nYeah every time they take this tough guy stance I think he should smack on the face just like that at the un against Ted Cruz\nSmack on the face right away and say what are you talking about you didn't serve in the military not one member of your family served in the military talk guy and you don't know when you're the one that's a truck that you hid behind on the farm is I think we should hit him with that every single time\nSo uh Donald Trump gave a speech to the police chiefs association yesterday I'd write was\nYeah it was yesterday uh either late morning early afternoon 'cause he flew back to the White House after that first Brett Kavanaugh thing\nI can only stomach like five minutes of it but\nTrump literally said to the chief of police\nThat the people who want after Kavanaugh\nOr evil [noise]\nWhile and then he said it again those people are evil\nWow well let me just say something\nI'm not a perfect human being and I'm not a strict moral is what I have some morals and I have some principles of that but I tried to believe in [noise]\nBut it's Bach Obama anyone else has said I can go into the street and shoot someone I wouldn't lose or vote had been caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women [noise]\nUm\nWell convicted\nAgain let me say it again convicted\nAnd had to pay to twenty five million dollars restoration restitution to the people they harmed he harmed with Trump University Trump University don't people don't know there's they don't like none of none of that puts up a red flag anywhere yeah yeah\nYeah I mean this is this what am I missing earlier a democratic messaging basically as what's going on here yeah and when I tell ya and part of that is that the Democrats don't have the giant media infrastructure that the Republicans have they don't have a thousand radio stations across the ... yeah you're right turn tenuous ... tenuous democratic programming like the Republicans have\nThey don't have a billionaire OWN Network entirely devoted twenty four so\nOh three sixty five to two Democratic messaging the way the Republicans have\nAnd you're right many of the newspapers across the country in fact the majority newspapers across the country are Republican or conservative and on top of that you got all these free newspapers you know there are passed out in the major cities and or cheap newspapers in some cases the Washington Post in New York and Washington beacon which is free and and uh I Believe it's called the biggest\nOr maybe it's the examiner and when do you see\nThey are literally I mean do you see you can't get onto a subway in the morning without somebody trying to hand you a free newspaper and sixteen pages are right wing you know just dripping venom you know right out of Fox News kind of stuff\nAnd the Democrats have no infrastructure like that this is something that was built as a result the palmetto in Nineteen Seventy one they built this through the seventies eighties and nineties and now they are using it and you know until the until some very large donors in the Republican side and yet with us and and figure out what the hell is going on\nOr until Congress acts and says\nNo we are going to restrict the use of money in politics billionaire money and corporate money in politics\nUm you know which is going to take either a constitutional amendment or a change in the Supreme Court to to reverse things like you know Citizens United and Buckley until that happens it's going to continue being this way\nAnd that's the scary thing but but that those changes that could happen could happen as a result of of changes on the Supreme Court I'm going to get into that and the next hour but anyhow yeah\nSo the ... you know you can finish your thought sorry\nWell I I I didn't want to uh I don't want to sound like a bunch of smaller groups with laughing I Want to say and and I I I I I just don't want to upset anyone but you know it wasn't it wasn't that we ... waiting in line for carnival ride it wasn't Kurt turn\nYou know people who won't admit the wrong I mean I Can't watch Stephanie Miller anymore it's just I Love her she's a good person but what a bad attitude you know when I saw her with that little power you got to start can use that phrase that you guys had on your show I mean I I was nice that you guys got together and\n... that was that was going to try and I you know thank you thank you thanks for the call I I'm not going to get into other talk show hosts and and frankly I'm not going to continue fighting the Bernie Hillary wars is there's no upside to it at all\nUm I you know I realize some people are are upset about it all but you know there's just like there's no upside to a Martha in winter haven for it all is an eight point five FM one of our Pacific affiliates down in Florida hey Martha what's on your mind today\nI come I Am as frustrated as can be but the lack of\nClear messaging from the Democratic party ... ... and ... and one of the issues that it just crazy with the guns are taking a beating the ... the over the head with it is that the say\nThe tax cut blew the deficit to historic proportions and this is the party that just two years ago was insisting that any new spending it President Obama wanted it had to be offset by spending much else where\nDid you catch part of the news this morning that they just the house just the I mean it was a couple of days ago the house voted it's going to the Senate now to raise the deficit by another five hundred and forty three billion dollars a half trillion dollars yet by by extending the tax cuts you\nYes isn't that convenient that our\nPrinciples for the G ... are so you know ... when there is a Democrat and the White House and then when a Republican gets and it just all goes away it's the same thing that happened with George Bush you know Ronald Reagan began this great tradition\nOf I'm running massive deficit they yet somehow managing three Republican hocus pocus\nTo hang that damage with the label if tax and spend it you know deficits benders and fiscally irresponsible and its childhood isn't a camera or your Lou ... what's happening here\nIn ... I'm Sorry and finish\nWell as the deficit that we're looking that now has the potential should literally on two hour shift shady if it blows up and we're on track towards the oath in a cheerful way\nYeah if interest rates go up to points the ... the interest on the national debt will be greater than what we're paying the Pentagon I right now it's it's mind boggling it's far more than we're spending our social programs combined\nAnd this is not something new and it's not something accidental this is a strategy that June ... laid out in I Believe Nineteen Seventy six in the wall Street Journal to Santa Claus theory that when Republicans come into office spend like drunken sailors run up the debt\nAnd then when Democrats come into office scream about the debt enforce the Democrats to shoot their own Santa Claus Social Security and Medicare and uh this is a calculated well thought out well coordinated strategy that began with the Reagan Administration Ronald\nReagan came into office the national debt was eight hundred billion dollars less than a trillion when he left it was pushing three trillion dollars was it was two point four trillion can can\nStart to point one really actually as well and and and they're continuing to do it our national debt houses over twenty million dollars and they just added like you know like we just sat there half a dozen other half a trillion dollars to the data they're intending to drop as it's either legislation right now and why because they're getting ready for the Democrats\n[noise] you're listening to Tom\n... if you start

after he spoke to a police chiefs group down in Florida and told them that the people who attacked Kavanaugh were according to one of our callers in the last hour quote evil yes tell the police that the women are evil\nThat will work out really well after he did that he flew back from Florida flew back to the to Washington DC a great expense to you and me\nThe taxpayers and a said on national television and I quote on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire cabinet family for the terrible pain and suffering you've been forced to endure\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of personal and political destruction based on lies and deception\nTo came right out and called Christine Blasey Ford a liar\nHe said that the process that the the Dr Ford participated in her doctor policy for quote violates every notion of fairness decency and due process use are under historic ... screwed they were proven innocent\nWell no he wasn't proven innocent\nThe FBI was prohibited from interviewing the corroborating witnesses who might have proved him guilty\nEarlier in the day Trump told reporters Kavanaugh's nomination quote was caught up in a hoax that was set up by the Democrats using the Democrats lawyers that was all made up it was fabricated it's a disgrace\nAnd Christine for ... for it still can I go home and this is making it even worse when the president United States cause you a liar a hoax stir\nHow Deborah ... and and Ford and sweating it must be feeling right now and perhaps

on your mind\nMark you are on the air\nMark is not there okay let's try Robin indicator Georgia have a Robin you're on the air\nHi Tom I'm today in Georgia last dating register to vote and I wanted to ask a question for as Georgia voters because our we have an electronic system is it wise or to vote by mail\nOr do we trust the voter machines will we go to the ballot box\nThat's a tough question um even if you vote by mail it's going to be scanned by a machine that's owned by the same company said on the voting machines\nThat check and and and and ... and I've heard that the ah a male and votes are tend to be countered later\nI'm at our okay a potentially more subject to a challenge so I Would probably show up and vote or if I if I Lived in Georgia and I did live in Georgia for Thirteen Years and and always voted person so\nOkay so um our our early voting I think it starts on the tape though if anybody out there um you know to avoid\nThe line then start the next day yeah yeah there you go back in Robin good talking with you I appreciate it you know and try it again mark in Charlottesville, Virginia\nHi Tom Kmart hum you started talking about those shows talking about Republican messaging and calling a opposition to their policies or a mob\nSeems to me that the Democrats could focus on a counter message and really attack that idea by focusing on people um you know the idea of just how do we expect the Republicans was current administration to see we the people I was a mob\nAnd just come right back at them um\nAnd and that can frame a lot of messages around that we the people have the right to affordable health care that does not exclude goes with existing conditions we the people do not want our children and grandchildren to be burdened with an exploding because of tax cuts to the rich we the people have the right to come and help the environment the looks could go on and on\nAnd just go right back at him and challenge that idea because as you were pointing out it's really I'm a ... to to what American democracy is really all about\nYeah yeah the the Democratic Party you know and and there's there's a lot more diversity in the Democratic party on and talking about racial or gender diversity I'm Talking about political opinion or willingness to take money from corporations kind of diversity there's a lot more of that in the Democratic party than there is in the Republican Party\nThe Republican Party has now pushed out all of the ethical politicians with they once had\nAnd uh and I don't know if you could call Jeff Flake or Bob Corker ethical but even the marginally ethnical are are leaving quickly\nOn the other hand of the Democratic party has this whole wide collection of people so it's much harder to come up with one coherent message that everybody repeats but I agree that the Democratic party has to do it and I think you provided some good ... thanks a lot for the call\nAlbert in marina del Rey you wanted to talk about a messaging to thanks to wash us on YouTube Albert\nHey thanks for taking my call Tom I'm actually listening on your ah ah apple I don't know if I'll call it but I Am listening on it and think you have been since you got switched from satellite radio to um [noise] uh the first hour but yeah my message about or my comment about messaging it I'm not sure that Democrats\nAre actually ready for what they're asking born here and let me explain people like Morocco Obama because of his ...\nIf you were to get someone let's just say an angry black woman foul angry black man style I don't think white America is ready for that and I would like to hear what other liberal by liberals have to say about that\nWell I can only speak for myself I'll read it I can only speak for myself but I think you're absolutely right and uh and the reason why is because there's probably\nSomewhere between twenty and forty percent of the white population that is\nExplicitly racist and aware of it or explosively let's say there's maybe twenty percent twenty five percent and I'm just going on you know my life experience who are explicitly racist and we'll expressive and there's another twenty percent who harbor and know that they harbor racist opinions but they try to be you know reasonable\nAnd and then there's probably another thirty percent of white people who you can evoke racism out of them simply by challenging their white privilege which they probably never even thought of but when they're white privileges challenge suddenly the racism comes out and that those three groups are a majority of white people\nAnd so if you were to activate them with the angry black man routine or angry black woman routine\nOr for that matter Latino you know talking about taking on white privilege\nUm I think it would be a big gift to the Republican Party and that's why Brock a bottle was so careful to be so temperate throughout his presidency and and you know and I'm\nI'm just ... I continually and particularly in this day and age and blown away by how how thoughtful how how how much ... this man had a ...\nUm you know it you know the incredible\nA very thin razor edge line that he had to walk and his wife and his ...\nIt is I mean I'm just it's just amazing to me but that's my take on makes sense yeah\nI I I really appreciate that and one way that we talk about fundamentals and here's away specifically about health care if you're a Republican I ask you what does the health insurance\nCompanies use to make it better [noise]\nThey all they do is take the money you get them and give it to the insurance company or give it to the doctor yeah and take a cut yeah there's it's just a skinny\nOperation that's that's all health insurance is absolutely right ... thank you for the call nicer watching us or they should listen to us on the app\nWill be bad I don't know what ever happened to live on it must have gotten any I Will be back with more of the show at the news or whatever\n[noise] [noise] [noise] you're listening to um [noise]\n[noise] Hi I'm Randy and this is Dave word of the founders of bomb makers of the most comfortable socks and the history of feet so comfortable we've sold and donated over eight million pairs\nYes donated why we learned that socks or the number one most requested clothing I'd have been homeless shelters so we started bomb us but the mission of donating a pair of socks for every pair we sell to donate and saw a lot of socks we became obsessed with comfort we reinvented\nThe sock from the ground up using the best materials available like the soft as in most comfortable caught and getting rid of what wasn't working like that annoying do seem you can probably feel if you wiggle your toes right now and inventing a few new comfort innovations along the way like our support that feels like a hug around your mid foot\nAt work people tried them love them told their friends about helping the cell and donate over eight million pairs\nChina now I found is Tom tom and get twenty percent of your race order not to be out and be a ... dot com slash th L.
