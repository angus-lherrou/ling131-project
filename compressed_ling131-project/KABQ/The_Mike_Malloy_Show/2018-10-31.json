{"month": "10", "state": "NM", "station": "KABQ", "content": "I Will just uh I Will just go through 'em real quick uh the first one is mastered on which is actually my favorite so far a mastodon is only ... everything they have to say about mass because I liked that one message on it's all about decentralization it's also a hassle to use\nNo it's not [laughter] All right let's see I like one minute looking at it and I'm like yeah I uh the thing is it very much resembles treat deck\nCorrect which I'd never seen before like the last couple of weeks but apparently this is a part of Twitter that ... I don't know if you can easily access it from Twitter it was a separate app and Twitter bought it\nOh okay interesting 'cause I didn't even know it was there I was looking for like a button to access it within butter I couldn't even find out and got a tweet ... dot com you'll find it I thought it was ... ... Twitter dot com or something yeah\nAnd it was her ... it's out there they basically modeled the whole thing a master ... off of this we had the user interface when you loaded up in the website it looks very much like to eat right so if you use that before in a lot of Twitter users have like hardcore Twitter users will be familiar with gotcha\nSo mastodon represented my first foray into the world of alternative social media networks\nFounded in two thousand sixteen by developer Eugene Raj co it was launched as a kind of de centralized version of Twitter\nIndeed mass down as in many ways similar to Twitter users can blast out hashtags field to ... which have a five hundred character limit boost or the equivalent of retreats where favorite is essentially the same thing as a like\nMaster down like Twitter is free to use the platforms ... privacy policy emphasizes that it does not sell user data to third parties\nIt's also add free which probably explains the crowdfunding platforms patriotic page\nThe main practical difference also take crypto currency I Do on labor Don ... service and he probably go down to that get into that in just a sec ah the main\nPractical difference between masters on Twitter is that massive down his powered by open source software it's comprised of many different servers are instances each one catered to a particular interest their servers are all run independently and none of them look exactly the same\nSince the platform is so decentralized there's no official mobile apps do intrepid developers have released a variety of client apps\nAnd yet there's like a dozen at least of these apps that you can download for your smartphone that will allow you to interact with the with mass what every whichever one you like most and it looks like the website they've done a great job with those open source open source yet\nKnow each instance is different the basic for column lay out at least on desktop is often the same on the far left as a column where you can write a status and choose who can see it to the right of that is the home timeline which is the feet of content from the people you follow\nNext as the notification columns which alerts you to others saying to or about you right so if they tag unit Los even if you're not following that person should pop up and I've been noticed ... is someone follows you it'll pop up there\nYeah and there was a little bit of a a learning curve 'cause like I said I'd never even seen the tweet deck thing before so I was going into mastodon completely blind or there's a there's some level of a configuration that you can do with these columns you can add columns you can remove them so there's there's you know like I said there's a little bit of\nYou can make it your own I mean you can visit you were saying you were intimidated by this so I just knew that I can maybe it's just the way my eyes are my mind works but like I just couldn't get my wrap my mind around ... maybe it's because it had like a vertical like late ... takes a bit of it is it different from a typical Twitter feed\n'em it's more just more I Would say there's more information there is definitely give me more information right on the screen\nAnd and if you if that if that kind of overwhelms you than probably your best stop using one of the mobile apps where you just see the seed right whatever you're looking at at the time\nBut that final column lets users toggle between a variety of options like you were mentioning the tools they favor to direct messages and their local and federal time lines of the local timeliness simply a feat of all the post from that users particular instance the federal aid and timely meanwhile\nIncludes public posts from everyone is it uses in your instance follow on every other mastodon server oh okay see\nThat was that's news to me I didn't realize the federal at a time line was only from\nPost on the ... it was only from people on your instance who's a follow on the other instances so there are thousands of these instances I just thought it was just a straight feed from all the other\nService but it's not it's only the ones followed my other people on your server in true after they follow on other surf so therefore it's more likely to be related to something that you'll appreciate ... if you're on a server that's got like a theme like we are we're on the liberty liberty on server\nThe three of us I think are on that yeah I'm I'm On there I've been using it quite that are you on live or die or did you sign up on another instance\n... delivered on but I I think like I made the account I just didn't post or do you think\nYou've been posting Michael I haven't been posting I have as well um I mean I'm not a a prolific poster but when I Do think of something I Do always supposed to uh I Do posted it and then when it goes out it goes to to ... or anything else to to you a little\nBit more on on mastodon I'm astronaut has probably a lot of fun if you are tech savvy which I'm admittedly not the authors in with over a million users in the handy function that lets you find people you already know from Twitter making connections isn't all that hard oh ... and ... but the decentralization part doesn't really appeal to me\nAt first I thought one main account a masters on social would let me joined as many different instances as as I Want it but my masters on dot ... ended up only working for that one ...\nWhy would you want to join I mean maybe you didn't understand the point of God why would you want to have more than one account on one instance\nIf somebody wants to follow you from a different infants they can yeah you can follow other people from other instance as long as those instances are what's called federation every other and that was the other key term SUV described decentralized which means that there are thousands of these servers\nBut the other aspect is the federation meaning that each server gets to decide\nTo which other servers day will allow its users to search and connect to so if Christopher can't well where to start up a a Nazi mastodon server\nUh than other mass it on servers may decide to this federal aid from that and say you know what no we don't want to follow this not only do we not want to follow this we also want to even make it so argues there's can't follow it had one of our users can't even see it\nThe admission of each individual mastodon instance can decide that they don't want anything from another particular instance showing up anywhere\nI I think it's really interesting and I highly recommend it you can check it out just go to to to dot L. excuse me to duck free chocolate dot com and that'll take you to our mastered on a search and what we call his not the done\nNot an easy I uh just ... I bet they come up with something more offensive [laughter] that's probably not offensive with a quick rundown of the other for just a the names of them you know there for me we knew we centralize privacy means there's no one to connect with was there take away from\nThat that one central central I guess it is okay I expected minds to be complicated in cumbersome is actually in my in tons of fun why am I on DSL or for before it went off line get was where the right activists went centralized find ... five is zero which is one nobody's ever heard of and we could probably get into that stuff another\nTime ... we'll see them are on line in the meantime check us out over it to ... live dot com [noise]\nWell and how fast the heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation listen\nMy name is Alice and I'm sixty six years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries had Seventy percent blockage in one larger lead into my heart they wanted me to go on topics but I refused now in the negative side effects\nAnd body extract of unique valley energy in proportion of herbs reading from head to toe at maximum absorption around Ninety five percent at the level\nWithin the first month I saw the dramatic difference having his legs was produced in within two months I felt completely normal\nNatural organic herbal formula for heart health is hard and body extract\nPart of body extract comes with a one hundred percent ironclad money back guarantee detail that H.
