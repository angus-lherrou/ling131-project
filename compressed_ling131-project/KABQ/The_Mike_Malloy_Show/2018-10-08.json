organize the Democrats to march to the polls every election\nThe boy we are doing it the learner assuming it this is this is the problem is that no no no\nEverybody's assuming it everybody assumed Hillary would when everybody assumed were going to take the house and maybe the Senate and and what I see is\nDemocrats don't understand power I'm very I'm being as as honest and streaming weren't as I can\nDemocrats don't understand power they don't understand how our system works and they don't have the the the intestinal temperament to learn from my perspective and I've been looked in a long time I've been doing the show for nine years now\nDemocrats don't have a long term perspective they don't they don't they don't have the patience to sit and learn how the system works they don't have the patience to sit and work to make the system worked for them the Republicans have a couple of advantages they've got money boys on their side\nAnd stowed them with all kinds of funds to them the

you understand that you understand very because you're educated that it was Seventy seven thousand votes spread across three states with his fuse eleven thousand in Michigan outta for ... million cast\nThat gave this I said that gave all the yes voters are breaking into why were the voters suppressed in Michigan because the Democrats in Michigan or a bunch of bombs who sat on their ass\nAnd didn't do anything and they let the Republicans take over the states so that they could rig at the same in Florida same in Pennsylvania seem in Wisconsin because the Democrats don't\nWork the Democrats don't work day in day out understanding that it's bad that it's election cycle after election cycle the Democrats are purists to say I didn't get what I Want in a system where there was an ocean of\nApathy with Ninety million people never participating to them the system rules them\nThey are ruled by the system Ninety million people have no faith in the government in a registered to

gone tuned out forget it they don't understand this is about their lives and the reason they're life sucks so much because they're they don't get involved in politics I you can explain it to them so

stuff the Republicans give you this half now you've got a half\nSitting there going okay what do we do and then a slice of them says no you're not good enough that's\nHow you lose elections in Florida by five hundred and thirty seven votes because you'll let these people take power in the states they rigged the states the state's run the elections they take over the legislatures because the Democrats don't know how the system works they won't do the work\nTo get it done and the evidence is everywhere look at it I Julian Minneapolis Hi Julie\nHi may not find me don't hang up on them or

getting around there Julie I'm ... I got to leave it there but thank you very much uh I Do believe the Susan Collins ended her political career today and I'm not joking around and the reason for that is is that the people of Maine are really really really upset\nHe did the people of Oregon probably pretty upset with what happens today I Dave in Oregon\nOr outgoing swell what's up well like\nYou I'm having a great day because I Do see this as a as a some sort of a of a of a necessary awakening ah for people who believe in what we believe and I'd like to I'd like to give you said with an ...\nAnd two quotes the date is April twelve Eighteenth sixty one are you familiar with that\nApril twelve Eighteen sixty one was that was that that's what I noticed the civil war was that when the civil war goes up they attack on Fort Sumter\nExactly right and I see this is nothing less than the opening salvo of a political war\nMean this is one of the one of the many jabs and and hey makers in a long political war I I don't view this is I just see this is what you know this is round eighty\nOut in salon ... plus and you'll have relief slump ... to anesthetics including the maximum strength lie to gain available that prescription they numb aggravated nurse for effective lasting relieve relieve try what I use salon posit ... in the silver box with a blue wave\n\nBiggest music festival of the year and it's coming to they're seen W why already oh you\nDon't miss the iconic performances\nAround the the biggest\n[noise]\nNew view streaming and his new to Netflix is we check out some new stand up for low armor with a new cooking series called salt fat acid heat for the kids have got new seasons of they'll be the first boss ... back in business and I do not\nThere's an original twenty two in July which is the dramatize Asian of Norway's deadliest terrorist attacks and next week Netflix that part to making a murderer season three of their devil hip hop evolution seasons do and\nWe got there the shark season for mayor so Hulu original supernatural thrillers light as a feather debut check out the Alec Baldwin showing the fifteenth Taylor Roseanne Roseanne show dubbed yeah\n[noise]\nThis is a very special day because not only is it a one topic interview with our friend now like science wall but it's a very very rare day because we've got\nThe ... now we know we have any new Supreme Court justice come in and this one is very special but not the best way any way it is the day we review the week with our friend Alex science\nWall who reports great work at NBC News dot com MSNBC dot com and Alix ... on T. V. on MSNBC and now it's a special week indeed thanks for coming back on the norm in Goldman Joe\nAnd arm thanks are me back\nWell Alex uh you're in Washington DC you're a reporter at NBC News we're in Washington I'm In Los Angeles we've got people all over the country and all over the world so\nNow that we know what the final score is it it looks like capitals getting through on a bare majority ... what is the final score and are there any Democrats involved here\n[noise] yeah I think uh the we're we're in the end game now too and Congress just went to the Senate floor and uh met her big reveal she had been\nCards close to the chest and ... the key swing vote a but she came out and then his lengthy speech not only said that she would vote for Kavanaugh but basically suggested she had been there from day one and gave\nActually probably the most Folsom\nA and cogent argument in ... in Kavanaugh safer that I've seen anyone gifts but the White House or the you know conservative legal scholars she was really out there going point by point and saying basically she filled in for confidence that uh she is going to vote for Kevin\nSet for tomorrow now that they have the votes are and then right after she did that Joe Manchin came out and said he would too so they have fifty one votes it's a basically a done deal Lisa Murkowski is the only know of of the swing votes but it's not enough and barring some kind of you know crazy divine intervention\nOr it looks like this will be rammed through in half and I will be\nA a Supreme Court justice elect or whatever you call it a sometime tomorrow evening\nWhile it so that's so basically Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nGets to go home and tell the native tribes who were very much against cabinet I voted against him she can tell women I voted against him Lisa Murkowski has to be a hero to Alaska and two women generally Susan Collins is now the villain but also one democratic crossed over\nThat's Joe Manchin he's kind of irrelevant because with Susan Collins it would have been fifty votes anyway Mike Pence would've broken a time Alex is Joe Manchin doing this just for his own politics for his own re election this November I\nIt's a little hard to say with Joe mansion or I mean I should say first of all that he didn't show a ton of a backbone here he he put out his statement according Kevin literally minutes after Susan Collins came off the Senate floor so she's not\nFifty fifty which is the decisive vote because the vice president Mike Pence can break the tie he's fifty one so it was already basically done and when he came out uh but yeah I think part of it is is certainly as reelection\nBut we'll we'll have to wait and see what Joe Donnelly in uh Indiana does because he's also in a in a tough state\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota state justice Trump is West Virginia just about said that she is a no so I I think there's you know other stuff going on here are withdraw mentioned in it it's kind of from people who have been close to him and I've talked to it's\nKind of seemed like from day one that he wanted to get to a yes and was just looking for a way to get there but needless to say he has infuriated a lot of people on the left which she is prone do and I'm seeing a lot of people are on\nTwitter a lot of liberals on Twitter ... who did switch parties or that they hope he loses in November which I think they would probably regret saying uh if it actually happened because\nYou know keep in mind that yes he voted on on this but he also voted to keep a the Affordable CARE Act he voted against the repeal bill he voted against the Republican tax bill and more importantly\nYou know regardless of how you look and individual bill ... he it's terminated for control of the Senate and so you know one senator is a big deal when it comes when you have a a fifty one forty nine Senate break down like we do so you need him to keep either McConnell out of power to keep that margin\nSmall and you know West Virginia has no right having a democratic senator that Trump's biggest margin in the country so I I think if anything he's about as good as you can hope for a Democrat out of West Virginia\nWe're talking to our friend Alex science wall check out his great reporting at NBC News dot com MSNBC dot Tommy's on TV MSNBC TV and I'm following him on Twitter\nAt a sites wall the S. E. L. I. T. Z.\nW. A. L. D. S. A. sites walled on Twitter and you'll see all the great material put out by Alex science Walden Alex since we're doing a a one topic interview because\nThere's only one topic that anyone cares about this week\nUh you're there in Washington seeing it up close and personal we're seeing it on TV out here the hallways of the Senate or all the Senate lost millions of filled with people as protesters being arrested famous people being arrested there's a lot of rage death threats have been flying around\nAlex how bitter is the environment there especially amongst the hundred senators themselves\n[noise] it is very bitter and arm I have never really seen anything quite like I say I've seen a lot of anger and a lot of protesters got arrested in the capital but this week has really taken things to another level\nOr to the point that I've talked to some Trump voters who are supporters who are worried about violence and you know they're probably overeating at a little bit but I don't think they're that far off the protesters have just been button hauling senators everywhere they go\nA they've tried to you know sneak past Capitol police which is something that we don't usually see usually they're they're more cooperative\nAnd senators have taken to being escorted a by Capitol police wherever they are going inside the complex because the way it works the capital there's the capital where they actually have to go to vote but their offices are a little bit further away so they end up having to spend a lotta time\nMoving through hallways and there have been a big tensions around this and fights around this with what they've closed off as her always wished that the ...\nBut the senators say that they really fear for for their physical safety so people are are furious a meanwhile on on both sides we've seen people donors rewarding and punishing a Centers for both ways went Heidi Heitkamp\nAnnounced that she would be an airline cabin are uh her online donations shot through the roof from from liberals who would probably have never donate it\nHi Kevin the past and just now well Susan Collins was speaking\nThere is a fund on line where you can donate to whoever emerges as Susan Collins is democratic nominee in twenty twenty and she's not even up for re election right now but they're just saving this money in a pool that will go to whoever is that the Democrat and they had to set a goal months ago to land dollars", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Malloy Show", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "08"}
