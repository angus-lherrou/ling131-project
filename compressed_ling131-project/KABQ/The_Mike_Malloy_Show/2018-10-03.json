Ito variation on DNA is destiny is you know that that ah you know if you're born\nCompound tuned in for particular areas if you're born very very athletic you have an edge an athlete in athletics if you're born very very smart you have an edge in academics if you're born you know it temper mentally or whatever it may be I mean there's all these other things as well that we've talked about in many times but\nGeography is destiny and it's kind of the same thing you know it's it's it's the the the the the ... the tools the the the gifts or whatever their country is born with but it ultimately when you get right down to it ... what we're talking about here's infrastructure\nAnd it seems to me that the Internet is the most important new infrastructure at SUNY river\nRight it's a new way to transport things to order things on line and they show up at your house\nIt's the it's the new feels\nRight you know and in countries that have large areas of of a formidable arable land\nOr you can go out and buy food from your neighbors you can grow food well here you can order food right so widely available\nI don't think I'm straining this metaphor too much but you know if you think so let me know give me give me a call on this um\nI think this was just a fascinating concept and we're now ties back into Trump engine and the Republicans in the Democrats is that\nIf the Internet is the new infrastructure that is going to rival mountains and rivers and and large tracts of ah you know a rich farmland if the Internet is that new\nOf fourth or fifth characteristic of a country\nThat allows them to prosper\nWhy then are we\nTurning our Internet here in the United states over to about five giant transitional corporations you know Comcast AT and T. varieties and whatnot uh why are we why are we protecting these ... these companies with laws\nThat forbidden ...\nWell I actually don't forbid them from doing this that allows them to prevent other Internet service providers from offering Internet over their copper\nThey own the copper infrastructure but they don't\nBut they you know ... they have asserted that they own the data going through it\nNow in France and South Korea and Japan in the way most European countries\nIf say for example Comcast to use the example I mean you know I don't know that they're operating in those countries but if they were operating in France\nAnd and you got your Internet firm Comcast\nYou could say well you know I really don't like Comcast Internet\nService at a particular I don't like the fact that they're reading my emails and tracking everything I Do so I'm going to go with the acme secure Internet service I'm going to have them as my Internet service provider 'cause they don't track me and they provide better security\nWhere they're faster or they're cheaper I mean there's all kinds of different ways it in a service providers can compete and do compete\nWhich is why typically you know high speed Internet and I'm Talking high high speed a hundred mess up and down high speed Internet in Europe as you know twenty to fifty bucks a month depending on where you live here in the United states is fifty to a hundred dollars of\nThese companies are getting mind boggling Lee Rich I mean Comcast made so much money in this business that they were able to buy NBC\nI mean just breathtakingly rich\nA TNT by and CNN I mean it's just it's\nWow how'd you get all that money oh because we're essentially allowing these monopolies\nAnd if this is our new infrastructure if these are our our rivers and fields and then and planes and if that's what this is\nWe are shooting ourselves in the foot hugely number one by killing a net neutrality so that these companies not only can lock down you know can lock us into this to their Internet services which they can do before you know before the\nDeath of ...\nBut also by allowing them to extract from us all this information without our um you know enthusiastic consent anyway\nAnd then sell that information or market than information or use that information to market things to us\nYou know everybody understands that Facebook\nIs march ... he became a a hyper billionaire\nBased on his ability to know everything about everybody so that advertisers could say you know I only want women between the ages of twenty five and thirty five who live in a in a house worth Seventy Seventy two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in a suburban area in the state of Ohio right and and uh they can say okay here you go\nAnd pretty soon Comcast will be able to do the same thing and all the other Internet service providers\nHere in the United states\nAnd you know which is going to make them even richer but what does it do to us as a country it makes it harder for start ups to get into the Internet particularly if you have to pay extra fees they have high speed transmission it it makes all of us a little dumber\nI mean and then on top of that you've got the algorithms you know Chris Hedges was talking about this yesterday the Google algorithm that has said that all turn out and a truce dig in and these other progressive news sites\nWill not be spiders there they're not going to track articles that show up on these sites and so these sites traffic is just collapsing and when you're looking for good information that might have a progressive ... to it you won't find it on Google\nAnd many of the other services basically use Google was their front it so you're not going to find it on them either\nAlthough there's really no consequential competition\nSo what does this mean for the United states it seems to me that in the interests of monopoly and ... and short term profits\nThese companies are buying off legislators particularly the Republican Party but I'm sure that they own a a you know their own little portfolio and Democrats or they wouldn't have been able to get a lot you know away with this this long\nThese politicians having sold out to these Internet service providers are now destroying essentially\nOr that a walking up I mean it's as if to say okay the ... one of the reasons Germany is so prosperous is because they have lots and lots of fertile farmland and they've got the Rhine River running right through the middle of the country\nOr one of one company or a five giant companies came along and said we now own all the farmland and we now owned the river and anybody who does anything on either one has to do it through us\nHow would that and say that had been done\nThree hundred years ago [noise] how would that have crippled Germany it would have devastated\nAnd yet that's what we're doing to the Internet here in the United states\nI find this just per se\nAnd the fact that there is no discussion about this in any of the corporate media which I can get by in large and increasingly are holding by Internet service providing companies [noise]\nMakes us and even more dramatic disaster in my mind\nThis is the Tom argument program so you know from there we'll get to a cabin on Trump and all the all the news of the day there's certainly a pile of it stick around [noise]\n\nCompelling content on the air and maybe he's toned down

I'm I have a question about um you know there you can count on\nOne hand in five minutes how many times Kavanaugh has literally light that's perjury under a that's a criminal offense and I'm I'm trying to figure out why the Democratic party\nDoesn't bring criminal charges against him and they are they not allowed to bring charges against him in state court or why aren't they doing anything about the perjury\nYeah and I would add Bill Clinton was can was a impeached for perjury and was disbarred he lost his law license for perjury yeah I've seen\nSome of this on the most recent you know perjury is around like you know what the yearbook setting things I you know people would argue whether or not their material there are strong enough that you could get to that level\nI Would argue with people have kind of forgot about 'em because of the very serious allegations by Dr Ford or that we're forgetting that he probably committed perjury for or maybe five times\nIn some previous testimony that I actually I think is more substantial right that he lied bay previously when he was before the Senate for confirmation according to center a former senator Russ Feingold from Wisconsin so\nUm I I think what people have been saying and I think this is probably the most relevant to offer Marcia\nIs that you know um where they can to stop this nomination for a lot of very valid reasons but should he get through and should we win the majority we can do hearings on this and we can really get to the bottom of this and you know there is a process to impeach I'm not saying it's easy\nBut

have consequences and they fully understand that from twenty sixteen\nOr their bases less motivated a you know a family separation at Donald Trump's demeanor et cetera is is certainly dampened that\nBut uh since Labor Day we've seen this kind of a burst of extra energy especially among independents in Wisconsin we had to special elections for state Senate races where suburban voters especially women were key a these are people who are Democrats aren't Republicans but are tired of\nBeing forced into awkward conversations with their kids\nAbout porn stars and apples and very fine uh klansmen and Nazis and and we've noticed is a happening more and more and especially since Labor Day so that is true but we have to get all of them out to vote that they may be with us now but we've got to make sure they're with us in a few weeks to get to vote which is why all the activities that everyone's doing across the country right\nNow campaigning are really are going to be the determining factor whether or not people come out and vote\nTravel is listening to am Thirteen fifty in Albuquerque New Mexico you're on the cars poking\nHello I'm a business travelers a talking I

great question\nTravis and uh I just actually ... ah last week\nWednesday or Thursday sat down with John Sarbanes from Maryland is kind of leading are a good government efforts I'm On a task force with him he's leading it and one of the vice chairs and we've got probably a we're advocating for each are one the first bill we introduced to be a bill that deals with\nA electoral reform campaign finance reform an ethics reform own one bill and I am advocating very strongly to get something added about paper ballots 'cause uh I already have legislation\nThat does just that but I think you know if people want that a confidence that their ballot or should there be a recount we actually have a physical specimen that we can take a look at and count it so I'm hoping that that will get added I'm Still\nAdvocating for that but I you make a great point um that will add a lot to the confidence in our elections\nJohn and author and Washington will sad case yes you're on the air with cars

call call waiting Kim blocking what you were saying John sizes or painting or so the Bush a congressman your thoughts\nYeah even John I I think what we're what's happening right now is what's capturing the public's attention and they may not be exactly enthralled by or what happened when he worked under George W Bush because\nNot everyone follows politics as closely as we all do but what they really understand is a when a woman makes a very credible accusation and is really a dismissed the way she's been Dr Ford has been dismissed and then the good old boy a ah I like beer network kicks in I I think that's what's capturing people's attention and saying you\nKnow let's have that proper F. B. invite a investigation why wouldn't you want to have it right and this is something that people can relate to very easily and feel very emotionally a boat and I think that's why that just is what's getting most of the attention um yeah I also think that you know his lying in the previous testimony four or five times\nIs the significance but right now I think we're the public that is on this moment and Dr Ford's testimony and the other women's to I'm a ... now say testimonies but accusations\nAnd what that means moving forward so that just puts captured the public's interest right now\nNancy ... and Wisconsin you're on the air with Congress in Tokyo\nYeah one thing I'm worried about listening to Michael Lewis interview which was his book should be very very good his articles in Vanity Fair we're absolutely frightening I think we're in a really grave situation if\nTrump doing something off the wall like you know parents wherever that would really upset China\nThey would cut us off I mean other than you know the um [noise]\nStuff to make our missiles and everything but like everything you need in the hospital including our drug are from China is there something without appearing to social less you know that the government can do to put this in reverse [noise]\nBut as we all age our bodies need help generating more natural nitric oxide super maids by human and it has harness the power of nutrient rich beads and created a super food that helps your body make more nitric oxide on its own\nCore philosophy of human ancestor develop heart healthy products for your body one teaspoon of super beats daily supports your cardiovascular health and your blood pressure levels giving you natural energy without the need of a quick caffeine kicker a sugar high\nWe're talking real healthy natural energy\nCall eight hundred five six eight Ninety eight and nine or go to Thomas beats dot com and find out how you can get a free thirty day supply of super ... with free shipping with your first purchase that's eight hundred and five six eight nine ... nine or Tom's beats dot com\nFeel a one plus one equals boom effect of super ... called eight hundred five six eight ... or go to Tom's beats\nDot com today [noise] kind of something larger poke and taking your calls\nAt ... here on the on the on the days with mark Tuesday edition and Russ in Portland, Oregon you're on the air with congressman poking\nCard from a poke at I was just wondering if you heard about the Nineteen eighty five drunken brawl in New haven where Brett Kavanaugh\nStarted it by throwing ice another bark a trend got into a fight and then I Love everything crush deadly the guy who ran for governor here in Oregon several years ago and almost not quite at almost legendary\nDemocratic governor John Kasich harbor\nGodly picked up a broker a broken glass and flushed the broken glass and to the side of the head of the\nOf refuse adversary and there was blood all over the place the cops were all there was a police report and those kind of drunk and behavior flies in the face in my opinion of what he told\nMe Senate Judiciary committee about is he really didn't have any problem with alcohol I think you perjured himself when he sat back and anyway\nRight yeah I did I did hear that story I Do concur I mean there's been so many of his roommates and and and others who said\nA very different story so it does appear that he wasn't truthful or with\nThe Senate but you know something else you bring up that really stood out to me was you know this is a guy who um shows are extraordinary privilege and was shocked that anyone would say no to him or questioned him and his aggressive belligerent behavior based on that uh again just reinforced um his privileged status\nThat he thinks he's owed inside somehow he's entitled to the seat rather than this is a job interview for the seat and I just I also found that to be pretty extraordinary\nIn Missoula, Montana you're out with congressman poking [noise]\nHey congressman ... can you hear me yes\nI stand on if we're looking into caring for women um why are we looking into releasing all the um the cover up of all the Congress men that have been paid off or\nAbusing women ... Ellis then or Cory Booker their accusers I'm Sorry could you say that again\nIs a is a suggestion that Keith Allison ... it was just you know he's a guy trying to get this and hear Keith Ellison by the way the charges against him were just disproven yesterday\nUm and I don't know anything about Cory Booker\nYeah as you know lots of ... sort of talking point yeah things are male black Democrat\nAnd you know yeah yeah it's it's a that's that's awful stuff yeah ... ... or or Oso California here on the air with congressman okay\nOh thank you first time a long time and I wanted to ask congressman anyway there's judge appointment off until the next election Republicans\nI'm by the rules they're going by no uh that's the problem if they have a Jeff Flake or Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski a no they'll have the votes lined up the question is\nYou know is this going to be um a thorough real FBI investigation which everyone's asked for or is this going to be some kind of a abbreviated or more narrow one which then\nDidn't resolve the problem at all or were you have to find that out and hopefully we will this week\n[noise] Gordon for listening to a serious like salmon Jasper, Oregon you're on the air congressman poking\nHi I'm a man and congressman\nMy question is a camera you hold the Republican or committee ... air they vote for Kevin on knowing he's for doing so\nIs there any kind of penalty for them outside of having them out of office\nYeah not really I don't believe so other than a obviously the you know their constituents could say you didn't do a thorough job you didn't uh do what you were elected to therefore we're not going to keep you in office that may be your best reverse\nThat is Patti in Fort Lauderdale is her radio you're on the air with Carson poke at\nHome I got a real quick when asked canonize telling the truth why he's wearing um foreign foreign destination ... or libel\nMargaret agent any kind of yeah petty interesting um the point to put out there you're right I can I just to me and again I I look at things from a very simple upper mid west perspective if\nHe didn't want the FBI investigation to clear his name\nUh that alone didn't pass the smell test right like there's something more to it and the fact that this only happened because Jeff Flake or you know said I'm not going to vote unless you do this or this wasn't asked for it by Kevin ... who should have been the person asking for it to clear his name and to me that the biggest problem I see with his story\nWell even Clarence Thomas was all in favor of an FBI investigation or at least the said so you know I mean they raised an object to it so Congress and we have about thirty forty seconds later left or what should we be looking for this week\nUh [noise] you know we are all about cabinet as far as what you're looking for I think the other thing maybe just to\nSpend a little tension no watches you know Rod Rosenstein was supposed to go to meet with the president last Thursday during the cabinet hearing that got delayed but you know that's still out there and at some point or that can be done while people are paying attention to the Kevin I'm hearing so keep pay attention to that as well um 'cause that would certainly trigger response around the country\nDo you think Trump initially did that as a way of diverting attention from the cabinet herring and then when he realized that it wasn't possible he gave up\n[noise] potentially but again who knows if this guy thought like normal people do you could predict it's a little\nHarder with that yeah that is true although I think we're starting to see some trends emerging [noise] you know the con artist and the media manipulator and everything\nCongressman thanks so much for for

I think that there was a little bit more of a ... as equals one of the interesting thing is is that it was but not Roosevelt during that conference bugging it uh and so I think\nThat that that is perhaps that analogy I I don't know if I Would necessarily can hurt your because I think that um by by strong suspicion is is that at this point uh who has so much over Trump that there is not\nAn evenly health and mental capacity so that that sort of the seats the Cold War we're kind of perk a way to go to the surface or with any all to in a way I don't think that Trump could afford to to push 'em and also there was that but there are a bit so I I ... and and I think at this point that\nTrump is especially once you wanted to he became even more a compromised because the real leverage that food and has now is his knowledge of Trump's vaulted two thousand six to eight\n[laughter] right and and there are and we have about a minute and a half year until we are going to have a heartbreaking my apologies\nBut uh we're totally jak Brian are getting a active measures the movie star to kind of competing narratives about that one is that Trump has been basically a Russian asset a you know that he's been blackmailed essentially a or owned and the other is that the Trump is just a businessman eager to build a Trump Tower in Moscow and that's why he's trying to keep this relationship open\nWhat are your thoughts what is your what is your research tell you\nI I think those are not mutually exclusive I mean our research is that this goes back to the eighties and like any relationship it develops slowly or and for very practical reasons over time\nUh I I think that this is more ... a relationship that began as sort of this is a sketchy guy who is comfortable on during your money in the eighties and in the nineties into thousands a guy who was this business was falling apart and he needed the Russians\nAnd then it became after ten years of that just a ... a relationship where there was virtually serving\nUm and so I don't think that it I don't think anybody came in a room and said hey we're going to blackmail you now I think that they allowed him to know that they're good friends were once you sit on this information so long as he was a good friend yeah uh and so I think it was an all the above approach I don't think that you need one of the threat than\nFrankly there's evidence for all of these so I think that the evidence shows and it would make sense that this was all the above as opposed to just one threat\nIs there enough I I mentioned two scenarios us or a third or fourth\nYeah I think the third and the most likely I think is that the Russian mafia which is a branch of the Russian government has had a huge position within the Trump Organization or\nA and that there's open that there are the reason that he got out of that the reason he has a a business we sort of detail this route to sell a and I think\nThat knowing that have

share a couple of stories where the and then I'll pick of the phone calls here and just a minute or having a union\nAmazon is apparently which just announced says they're raising their wages to Fifteen dollars an hour as their minimum wage which is a good thing I mean that the they they deserve credit for that\nBut they're the Amazon employees and this is probably what's what ties us in the as our employees have been working on trying to get a union it\nAnd in response to that is specifically whole foods which is owned by Amazon whole foods has been in the process of talking about a union for some time now and once Amazon bought them really stepped up\nAnd so now they're managers whole food store managers and department managers are being coached in how to spot people who might be a agitating for a union and people who might want to vote for union or whatever\nUh and they've got these videos that they're showing their employees are the one of them says having a union could make it hard to stay competitive they don't share our values\nReally unions don't share Amazon's values\nI mean you know of people having the ability to have a decent job at a decent wage and decent benefits that\nYou know acknowledge you as a human being in the economy and and acknowledge the idea that the economy is here for the people the people aren't here for the economy\nEh I Would hope that that's a value of Amazon apparently not according\nTo those are the narrator continues the unions summer's the direct working relationship between associates and managers we value so highly\nSo uh\nYou know one manager I mean what what ... does is it provides\nYou know strengthen numbers basically to the employees with the corporation does is it provides strength in numbers for the investors\nAll the investors come together and they form a union it's called a corporation and it acts in their interests but one of the things that it does is it acts in their interest is it hires employees to generate\nProduct that generates profit that goes back to the owners so this was a union who's goal is you know the corporation as a union who's goal is to extract wealth from its workers\nWorkers' union is a group that is a union who's goal is to help the workers share that wealth with the company\nOne training video segment includes teaching managers how to find quote warning signs of unionization efforts this by a Michael's sign NATO over in the guardian\nA warning signs of unionization efforts which included any employees to stick around after the shift as ended warning ships also included looking out for union words such as you\nGet this God Forbid living wage\nOne whole foods employee recently attended one of the media's told the guardian they told us how as team leaders were expected to tell the company line and be anti union as team leaders have been told that we are expected to support the company's anti union stance and the unions are good at the turn of the century that aren't necessary anymore because the government now has labor laws\nRight this is problematic in my opinion I've got to stuff here on the ...
