R. M. they like and they can try to make it really really hard for you to do\nRepairs right I I think calling this and this is one of those things where the word right\nIs just absolutely horrible English as a horrible language for actually conveying what you mean guy because if you call it a right to repair some people are going to interpret that to me in that\nApple or John Deere or GM or whatever other company they can't put anything that makes it difficult for me to do so because the a bureaucrat guy with the library of Congress said I have a right to do their thing\nExactly and that's that's gonna be the challenge it's going to be a educational\nUm [noise] the federal government has shown no interest in requiring manufacturers\nTo make it easier to break Dram which is one of the reasons why the right to repair movement is pursuing state level legislation to force manufacturers to allow it to be circumvented for the purposes of repair All right and this is where\nI split with this right to repair thing okay of there shouldn't be [laughter]\nAnd laws forcing a company to either do or not do anything to be clear there should not be laws [laughter] right there should not be laws and like area to end the book right\nBut specific to this I mean if if a\nCompany wants to make it absurdly difficult for their stuff to be a ... worked on and Michael you brought this up I'm not sure if it was during our breaker or when we were talking but\nThat company is going to get the scorn of their customers that's right and it's the marketplace that she'll be punishing them um and they should not be required or punished for doing something right they feels in their best assuming\nWe actually had a free market where we company wasn't actually being propped up by the federal government ... General Motors Monsanto\nJohn Deere yeah [laughter]\nThey have this pre tempted Dram as quote effective\nBut then they granted quote user exemption and assume that people will be able to bypass Dram to make the exemption exempted uses because they know DR him as a farce Corey Doctorow special a consultant to the Electronic Frontier foundation\nAnd an anti DR am advocate till mother board and the ... um\nThe thing is that these are two contradictory pretenses won the DR him as an effective means of technical control even in the absence of legal penalties for breaking it into the once you remove the legal structure I'm breaking Dram it will not be hard to accomplish this\nThe Copyright Office to sign a decision also does nothing to address the many ways the manufacturers of monopolized

happens to be right it's a matter of national security we can't allow the\n... and that really well with the idea of a\nYou know to make things harder you know for the customer actually to you know but I mean this is the trend this isn't the trial of Oregon you know take away the power of of an individual or they're wrong property\nRight you know that's what that is one of the way up once as\nThat is one of the things that has kept me away from apple products and especially in the iPhone but but to a lesser extent extent Mac OS for for pretty much ever ... is that apple has its sole locked down that you can't do it you can't necessarily do what you want with it right\nIt is and that sort of that it's that Steve Jobs' idea of we have looked at this issue and we have determine what the perfect user experience is therefore I present you the perfect user experience and you're at it yeah yeah and that's it which is fine if you happen to be you know an apple fan boy in\nYeah there was that the thing about the Mac is at at this point just about the only thing I can think of that you really need a Mac for is to develop apps for the iPhone so yeah anyway and you will you feel or even later caught and what I mean I I'm\nCurious here because you know like there's a lot of hating on an apple but does and Microsoft also make it rather difficult to customize windows uh\nYeah I'm really not not not not in now my little ...\nYou can change your background and you can change your screen saver sure that the actual yeah you know ... itself is locked down pretty\nLocked down um my we're Microsoft's guy much a worst security so I mean if you're\nIf you're a programmer you can write a program that will do just about anything in in windows ... and it's all it's it's actually a lot it's a lot more open than Mac\nOS is and there's there's they're hidden switches there's there's there's a\nWhole registered in there [laughter] I'm not even in the register there are places in windows you can go right now and and lock things down or unlock things or power still scripts you can run right\nAnd just ... it's a little different with with I owe us and like I said to a lesser extent Mac OS but ah\nI personally on my computer here I run Linux and I could literally do anything I Want ... nobody stopping me nobody locking me out of anything\nRight so nothing protecting you from yourself well that to price but that but for a lot of people that is the appeal of apple that you know what they've looked at all this stuff and they've given me what I Need and I know that I really can't break anything too badly\nAnd for some people that is I I for me it comes down to two completely different philosophies I agree with open I hate clothes but I understand why some people like close\nYeah but at the end of the day it should wind up not being some government forced thing and there should be a free market fair joy or if people want you know it's a closed doors saying kept you go with the clothes source you want something open source\nGo get you know what the how many different versions of legs are there right now I can think of at least five oh I\nKnow a year yeah

really nice\nThere's a there's a project called Linux from scratch that you can look up that I've seen that yeah I have never heard of this thing but er yeah sounds interesting and way above my

derivative of of uh what Berkeley oh Linnaeus Linux was pretty much a done from scratch\nI thought well at least some of the original ideas or something I was kind of er mimics but uh but there was that was just what he was working on to bootstrap clinics way back in twenty five years ago and yeah it has been that long and he's back involved now yeah he he has returned to the project that's very

of the mouths of you know college students and things like that I just got to think that somewhere along the line that just no longer became important people are not learning learning the civic say you and I learned right right\nAnd uh that was that was part of part of education and it was not something that was just dismissed or or waved through so I think um I think as time goes on we're going to see a further diminished none of those things in our national discourse I mean it's just not going to be important to people\nContinuing on the article says James Madison understood how democracy alone does not guarantee the rights of the individual and\nBreaking yet I Would daresay that democracy alone is repugnant through the rights of the individual because for those of you that might not have had a civics class as Daryl we live in a democracy hold on let me explain what democracy actually is\nDemocracy some people think it's the majority enforcing their will on the minority [laughter] no no no it's actually a minority enforcing their will on the majority and\nWhat I mean is that on most election days it is not a majority of eligible voters that go vote it most certainly not a majority of the population because you've got so many people that aren't allowed to vote right do you have a minority\n... goes out and votes and then assuming that your ballot has more than two choices then it's a plurality of a minority which itself is a smaller minority that then enforces just on everyone\nSo what you're saying is reporting that to the rights of the individual so you're saying is it's tools isn't a sheep voting on what to do with the other half dozen sheet\nAnd same basically under yes a and you know let's just say that in some place that allows ballot initiative that ...\nPeople wind up gathering signatures that say we are banning anyone named Chris from living in this town\nThat it probably saw by drawing of the Mona Lisa\nThey they probably did not a good reason to want to have you leave the towel right on her right then everybody not named Chris is like I don't care I'm protected right\nAnd then all of the people name Chris get pushed out of town that violates the rights of the individual's name Chris democracy\nNow it can't guarantee the rights of the individual because by its very nature it's repugnant to those rights but continuing with the article in the federalist papers number than James Madison warned of the danger of so called factions\nYou wrote by affection I understand the number of citizens whether a melting to a majority or minority of the whole who are United and actually waited by some common impulse of passion or of interest adverse to the rights of other citizens or to the permanent at aggregate interest of the community\nFactions are aroused by a comedy impulsive passion and inevitably without strict limits on the power of government\nThe actions of factions threatened the rights of others in short strong opinions may get out the vote but that doesn't guarantee good government or the preservation of liberty yeah there are there have\nBeen a lot of examples and I've often thought about um nine eleven\nAnd\nYou know what is what have you lived in a in a\nTrue democracy you know where everything was sort of a ballot initiative ... oh so like town meeting and some of the places here in New Hampshire right they they at least yeah they're going to determine first\nWhat goes on the ballot and then the same people growing actually vote right um\nBut I mean if you had like a a true democracy would would Muslims be allowed to practice religion today\nWere possibly not possibly not would a product\nOf prohibition and what have passed but it would have been thrown out by the courts\nWell right but I but we're talking hypothetical here and have you had this you know purely democratic oh without a valid right right right and that's that's the thing is\nIs it does sort of temper uh things that it allows passions to settle a bit and I think that's what Madison was talking about that we wouldn't be prone to those impulses\nMadison and Eighteen twenty five wrote the advancement and the fusion of knowledge is the only guardian of true liberty in Eighteen twenty two he said a popular government without popular in for\nYou should or the means of acquiring it is prologue to a farce

I think he before he became a part of the Louisiana share of power or perish a police department he was\nTagging along as a reserve officer is a lot of states have this um\nSo my solution here would be to fire the regular cops and just leave the unregulated a reserve officers' right there just regular they had just\nWind up going and shooting your next door neighbor's dog with impunity because somebody called it up and they went to the wrong\nHouse I think they were quickly learn but um since they do not have the protections of being a regular police officer they may not act like regular\nWe don't know if they don't have the protections this just says that there's nothing to a monitor their conduct so if their conduct can't be monitored how were you ever going to wind up determining whether they did something wrong or not\nThe agency that supposed to be monitoring them isn't right [noise]\nSo do they still have the qualified immunity the statutory immunity and the other immunities\nThat's a quest it I'm just gotta spit balling here and saying no I think give you a got rid of licensed police departments and just used citizens as\nQuote unquote police officers to keep the peace I don't see it as a bad thing now yes there's going to be some accountability issues um but those things can be resolved locally me and my home town and town I live in today\nAnd we we've got two police officers right now why couldn't I just have to volunteers to guys that like police work ahead of those guys do all day\nI'll live just two of 'em so one of 'em runs it gets the doughnuts and the other one takes the calls\nWhat what does the guys at the fire department and do all day when they're not driving the big red truck looking for fires oh that's right they fit inside the fire department\nMost of 'em just are at work around here um because nobody really gets by on fire fighter wages or anything like that people have different jobs ... but even in the places\nTo em closed the Michigan commission on law enforcement standards but the agency itself has no immediate plans to take on such a task despite gaining the authority to do so nearly two years ago\nNow this is rather interesting to me because generally government agencies want to wind up you know throwing out regulations before they even have the authority to throw out regulation\nUsually they do but the these guys they they don't seem to actually want to regulate these a reserve officers in any way ...\nSo we've learned that uh the responsibilities of the civilian reserve officers who are mostly unpaid volunteers varies widely\nFrom serving as the partners of license cops on patrol to riding horses in parades and units that are generally ceremonial\nInteresting yeah the so a lot of these a lot of these reserve officers are just up there for a show but a lot of them are out on the streets patrolling just like other cops right um so I guess the question is is [laughter]\nAs someone who questions the authority of a lot of police and things that they do anyway um is this just necessarily a bad thing should the state be involved in regulating police officers it with one questions whether we should have police in their current form anyway\nWell the state the state creates the police officers right so you know which should this right really late itself\nThat's basically the quiet of shut the states regulate itself they conduct their own internal investigation into whether or not they have properly regulated the people that are out there enforcing the laws passed by the state that is true\nThis is not a thing of uh should bring wind upsetting rules for Wells Fargo\nRight now I understand what your point is um I I I just look at this and go ah the ANC is misdirected um I I Would rather see citizens um you know taking care of their neighborhoods keeping an eye on things because face it um without\nPolice officers being so gung ho and so built up and so militarized that they find lethal situations every single day even when they're looking at a Chihuahua\nYou know um how how much\nWhy why couldn't just regular citizens be police who you know patrols or neighborhood and you know something's going on they called their friends\nAnd you know I I'd like I said I'm\nMy biggest issue with well you know been done before I mean right not this is not as does not some crazy ideas like how things worked for most of human history exactly and people tend to forget that\nPeople think of these institutions that we have today is things that must have existed forever high memorial and they didn't and when did when was the first police force created in London I was in like the Eighteen thirties I Believe yeah\nHe was he really knew yeah I mean we're talking a hundred and fifty years a little bit more than that but almost two hundred die but still this is not something that somehow we made it through\nYou know the previous almost two thousand sense Jesus was born without having things like this but then again at various points you un soldiers at the street so\nThat's that's true and I write I'm less shall we go on yeah I Want to hear an arm\nA ... do Detroit ... free press says that many reserve officers do serve the public well helping out with things like traffic control crowd security and even on patrol with license officers and despite the lack of state lied Rick statewide requirements it's common for police departing\nIt's the Michigan to require reserve officers' go through some kind of training but typically it's not up to the level of a license officer the critics say not having state oversight and rules that govern training as problematic and pushed reserve officers and citizens that risk\nQuote you have a person carrying a gun who could take someone's life in the right circumstances someone who's a who has a badge and authority who can take away their personal freedoms against the constitution\nUs that David Harvey former executive director of em coals who successfully lobbied the legislature will for his retirement to grant him colds the authority to set standards for reserves\nWell maybe he should've set the standards before he retired he wanted the ability to make standards right he lobbied to get the standard and then he retired does your dad an incorrect right you you would think that if he wanted these standards so badly he would have stayed around to write them and then make sure that they were in\nPlace well you know I I don't know yet who's this success or is that apparently ah someone dropped the ball there\nOr they just don't care you know it's right not I'm not important in their list of things to do\nRight and your eye on the one hand Chris I Want to agree with you\nBecause I agree with sort of the underlying premise of where you're coming from but said this is a government entity and they keep referring these are people that have a badge added authority right they shouldn't most definitely be regulated by the entity that gave them authority\nI don't disagree with that I'm just trying to broaden the discussion a little bit about why why why the system is the way it is and has failed us I think it has\nRight I don't even think that you know the police as they currently exist should agree\nI agree ... I'll go for that they're all in favor say aye\nYeah yeah and that might be some people that are listening that don't really understand what we mean when we say the police as they currently exist shut it\nRight and a historically I mean there's there's been sheriff's longer than there have been police right and the share of Nottingham the sheriff of Nottingham the sheriff or what\nHave various times act as a tax collector at some point he would be uh the one charged to keep the peace he was an elected official um\nAnd he could ... people he could you know call up\nCall up people if he needed help and that was you know the idea of the policy and things like that I'm right but it didn't require a police forces and it's certainly didn't require since we've we've declared war on drugs and drugs are winning\nOr the complete militarization of the police department where you you call the police because you think you hear somebody outside and the guys that show up\nLooked like they walked off a walk straight from Lucia rail you'd end up\nA lot of the immunity you know when we go back and we look at say the uh the wide or yeah frog you know the wild west which wasn't actually that wild right but you know this year of the time\nThey didn't have all of the immunities that currently exists if they were violating the rights of someone that they were held liable for what they did right right now you have people that throw flash bang grenades through a window into a baby is crab\nAnd the court rules well they didn't know what was on the other side of that window so therefore it's not their fault that it landed in a baby's corrupt they feared for their life to\nUse your calls and thoughts welcome eight fifty five four fifty free and if you believe that I've got a

just saying that I Know I already did everything\nYeah they do that they do\nA several other states including Nevada and California have rules that govern how much is already reserve officers have and how many hours of training they're required to go through before they can ... communities\nNationally incidents involving reserve officers have drawn scrutiny or for instance a former reserve deputy in Oklahoma Christ I believe you were mentioning this earlier or he was convicted after a two thousand Fifteen incident in which he said he confused as handgun for his taser and fatally shot an unarmed man who was at his feet\nAlso this year a California teacher who moonlight it as a reserve officer accidentally fired a gunshot inside of a high school classroom teaching about public safety\nOf course there's also been done by ATF agents and yeah yeah there's there's life and the officers have a history of doing this stuff you have\nPolice officers don't always get firearms training which is kind of ironic at best\nYeah there there was the story of the I think it was the police chief in Maine that was cleaning his firearm and shut off one of his fingers because he didn't ensure that the barrel was empty\nWhich yeah kind of kind of basic or firearms rules safety rule there yeah\nAnd this is this is this is firearms one on one it is it right but hey let them come up with standards [laughter] for\nIndiana reserve officer there was booted from the force after initiating a controversial arrest and an apartment complex where he worked as a security guard or we don't really have the detail on that and I don't recall that see I don't recall hearing that one either\nSo we can go ahead and go on to as the article\nSays police officers are trained to make important decisions under stressful conditions and sometimes the choice they make or the difference between life and death\nGiven this reserve officers should have to go through the same rigorous training as license cops said W Craig hardly junior executive director for the commission on accreditation for law enforcement agencies a national organization that is that what's your standards for law enforcement [noise]\nHe says when they have to make a decision about arrests shoot don't shoes search or seizure they often have to make these decisions independently even if they're operating under

is\nRight and then you know the story that really annoys me the most is the story of the cops that are holding down this Ninety pound high school kid\nAnother cop shows up says we don't hot we don't

after I met with her office not her personally she was nowhere to be found signed the paperwork to hire them and gave the confidence in her office do mostly to y'all previews so in all fairness I have to share my experience so others can be forewarned\nUh skips down says that she was given the advice to not talk to the insurance company all capital letters here do not talk to the insurance company\nThing over and over and over so I honored that request bought the hassle group didn't speak with the insurance company either a skipping down says she dropped the case because her mother and

whether did she lied mountain bike lanes that it doesn't deserve a one star review that's a subjective thing\nReferencing that hey if you look around you might be able to find that competition attorney right\nThat's that's subjective too but the question is is did hassle actually talked to the insurance company things like that where you're\nAt a make an allegation against somebody that is patently false well that they didn't hold on defamation is when you are\nA defame someone's character okay and into defamation could be implied by saying they did not do this they did not and that is

I I'm One of the sides all like almost no matter what I Do\nAs well as long as you control the side you get to be one of the sides\nWhat if I don't agree with just decide as it was for the other they started they wanted to get rid of slavery but I'm I don't really like immigrants and I don't really want people to vote more\nAnd I don't really want people to color to get welfare benefits so so I don't really like that and what their side stood for when it started as well that doesn't really matter as long as you can win the most votes you get to be one of\nThe sites to okay well\nIf I if I don't ah if I actually don't believe that everybody should have the chance to cast a ballot or if I think we should make it harder and and so I'm not really big fan of democracy in general\nDo I still get to be one of the sides or I sent me a fringe kinda weird thing that's contrary democracy no no no as long as you get the most votes and or control the most financial contributions\nYou get to be one of the side you mean like half half of the debate and people think I'm half right and major media organizations will think my ideas are half okay\nAs long as you control one of these two sides yes you are half\nOf the debate we have most of the two arms and hands two legs to feed two hemispheres of our brains to is the smallest whole number bigger than one so yes you get to be one of the sides\nBut now wait a minute what by appeal the Christian conservatives but then I nominate a serial full lander and multiple accused\nCory to the presidency do I still then I bought no no you're still yeah though that still okay now what if the only way for me to keep power is to manipulate the rules to redraw the lines to allow for unlimited secret money to win Congress to win the presidency without a majority\nWhat what if I knew that no no ... again as long as the other side is a little bit of it too you'd definitely get to be still one of the sides okay now what here's a big one\nWhat if I get help from somebody who\nActually ever commerce NRA\nNo no no like a like a big advocate well the n._r._a. ... we've had unprecedented frequency of horrific gun violence sure you can still no no I I don't mean them\nYou mean the people who want to erode the middle class and get it may have more gaping wealth disparities you're worried about you know that's that's a tradition in this country no no I don't mean them well who do you still want to decide what what if it's our biggest international ... what if I get out\nFrom that and it may be in cahoots with the murders dictator no it turns out you still get to be one of the sites\nI'm Sorry they're tainted do ... they would never be a political system there\nIn every media doesn't allow their institutions every voter is it going to allow such an absurd hypothetical\nAll the negative vote Tom Hartmann dot com\nFrom Los Angeles California what's up Donald\nMe the president that states no okay go ahead\nNo as a matter of fact the apartment building I live in hardly anybody here will call me by my first name because\nFat I'm Serious people call me by my nickname ah well I've got like about thirty different ... people ... what's your what's your what's your nickname middle\nName or on my ... my stage name is Dr ... the a K that's the most common on\nAll right All right Dr ahead\nAny rate okay so\nHere's the thing you mentioned a little while ago democracy versus not democracy I'd like to introduce something a little more extreme than that democracy democracy versus the opposite of democracy because not isn't the opposite and involved\nIn the absence senator what's that yeah you're right it or not is just the absence that's fair\nExactly and in voting will have the same thing going on when people have a negative vote in tension\nIn other words when they want to vote against a specific candidate they're basically given the choice are casting a positive votes are cast in non vote yeah\nAnd we should be allowing them casting negative vote if they have a negative vote intentioned there have been people who are writing anything is like against Hillary Clinton or not\nDonald Trump Nate how negative ... helped me helped me a duck how would a negative vote work I see on my ballot and I just click know what happens in\nA while it's not exactly know what the you know you didn't have for example instead of just having Donald Trump the belly you would have for Donald Trump on the ballot and against Donald Trump on the ballot and again you would choose one just like you do now so if you choose against a candidate\nIn the system we have no you would give up your option to choose to vote for a candidate you'd only get one or the other unless we change the system\nBut no that that knowledge helpful or I should say doc the alternative voting systems although right now where I Want to harness attention is on the next nine days including what is happening Tuesday to six uh the uh uh what is happening on election day\n[noise]\nYou're listening to talk about the show and Jefferson Smith with us now Luke Vargas talk media news ... news dot com look\nWhat's going on what new information we've already we're already reported here at least pass along reporting here that in the uh the the suspects and taken into custody these rich Republican the Trump stickers on his ban\nHas been convicted of anything to be clear that than they are now been what eleven eleven by Bob's et cetera that twelve [noise] ah what else do we need to know what are you covering\nWell I I'm a covering the story in so far as I'm I Am on the group a messaging\nBored with the rest of my colleagues who are working on the story that they think to uh be saying that uh well let's just say this at two thirty the department of justice will give a formal update on this and I think until then I at least will hesitate I'm passing along information that I Can't quite\nA you know a ascertain it's Providence this is not really my beat 'em so that would just leave it there with your permission I I think what I've been focusing on today are are events over seas which often get quite buried or as we get a swept\nUp you're saying the world is relevant if I'd bothers her male nonetheless world is still relevant how dare you sir how dare you have\nThe one thing I've been looking at with with some interest is that the defense secretary Jim Mattis or whom many folks think might be on his way out there and some reports that the likes of um\nEverybody's election mouths exaggeration but everybody's getting fired after the\n... yeah yeah I mean the ... and it looks like John Bolton may be responsible for\nCirculating reports to the press suggesting that a mad at says on the way out that we have some palace intrigue here where a ball and and some of his ilk seem to think mad as is an annoyance and that Trump or could replace him with\nSomeone who will let Fay go a little bit harder on Iran that's possible to do in the current environment um and and yet what it appears Madison is going to do even though some of us have may view him as sort of the rational savior in a a world of of Trump Tower mold\nIs he's going to give a speech tomorrow in Bahrain which is a very very close ally of Saudi Arabia and according to embark owed a bit of that speech he is going to basically say that if if the U.S questions in any way our relationship with Saudi Arabia but we're going to create a very dangerous political vacuum in the middle east\nAnd that Russia will sweep and instill that vacuum or I think that you know one completely overstate\nRussia's a power to be able to be an ally anything like the U.S has been in the middle east and seems to be in ... conformity with the kind of pro a status quo policies toward Saudi Arabia that the U.S has\nEmbraced and democratic and Republican minister rations for decades so again if if you thought for a moment that the ... killing the subsequent cover up\nA and everything else that's been abhorrent about the Saudi reaction to this is going to prompt a major rethink of this alliance in Washington I think this is a comments suggest otherwise that uh you know we're not just going to hype or over hype or mistake the jobs impact about real relationship\nUh we are actually going to be actively sort of talk up um what would happen if we dared question this and and we were mad as really seems to be implying\nA we'd be leaving a very very dangerous situation if we really thought this relationship I I'm an ear to ear these remarks but they don't bode well as to a possible sort of shift in policy here\nSo let me make sure I've got a I've got the he said he said correct\nSo short the a mad as has been viewed as maybe on the outs certainly in some conflict will jumbled and I think we have this mythology that there's well there's a good Trump people that will save us I that's not how I see the world I don't see a lot of facts of merit up but you know\nSomebody's posted an anonymous ah bad did that to to that\nA fact and and what you're saying is that ... comments where instead of just saying the same old line of no no we need the Saudis because we need a bowl work in the middle east\nYeah and I would say you know um I I agree with you that trying to draw some sort of line separating out the like rational good Trump\nFigures and the unhinged bad ones is a little bit of a complicated task what I Would say and then maybe not one worth even engaging in what it is I think something we can see pretty clearly is a difference in the caliber\nOf person who was brought into the administration early on when I think uh yeah I mean Trump's\nUm based instincts were still pretty clear to a lot of people but he hadn't done a whole lot of\nSpecific arm in office yet and I don't think you would get people like mad as\nTillerson Nikki Haley now I think those were people who are willing to take a bet on their careers um and that's probably why they some of them have moved on to other things that I was listening to Nikki Haley at the U.N Security council\nA on Wednesday when they were hearing testimony about genocide in the andme are I mean she was giving these\nQuote from John Adams about pesky facts and things like that and I said this is you when you are not going to find a new hire to the role of UN ambassador who no matter what the issue is going to go in front of the world and talk about how much\nThe U.S values facts I mean any replacement to her at this point is not going to be in her model and so I think the same is true of mad as\nEven at the stretch to say that you know perhaps he's one of the good ones but uh yeah I I Do think you are a lot of that has a talent that came in a early on you you're just going to get different people now who who probably are okay with a short term spent in this administration and care less about\nRejoining I don't know serious foreign policy circles after their time in in in the White House\nAnd what do you think we we only got a forty seconds left but what do you\nThink should happen ... media news type when he was dot com how\nShould the United states the reacting to Saudi Arabia\nIs a is mad as wrong or the administration wrong that that that alliance is important and should we withdraw from the middle east because we've only made the things worse or is constructive engagement and given are still need for oil or something we should be engaged in what do you think or if you just want to quote someone else feel free of doing that\nOr the oil is five percent of our imports that not giant and Saudi Arabia is a huge purchase of her purse a producer of our military arms but overall you know engagement\nWith that country is still relatively low tide compared with others and I would say you can still is constructed engagement but not just be willing to do anything for your ally and let's see if those are those that military trade as leverage on our side not the other way around [noise]\nMove artist thanks so much we\nHave a good weekend [noise] we're gonna be right back it's not the weekend yet [noise] and we're gonna be

that actually devoted specifically to providing information about what's happening in local government for community members that's reason why the channels are set up their also set up to make sure that people have an education that comes from local educational\nInstitutions like community colleges and public schools and the that people have the ability to communicate with each other that's my public access channel or set up in the United states\nSo as a ... you mean more just really present personal examples\nThe very first media thing I ever did was held by beyond wore a television show I didn't help very skillfully if I was a you know I had a middle school and my younger brother and my younger brother right now uh one of his job he works too but one of his jobs is running video for a successful local artist\nUh and now I Do a bunch of stuff in media helps train people to do stuff as well as covers stuff that's helping out covering local stuff\nWell I think it's as that's why I think it's it's actually at the media diversity success story um but you see in public educational and government access television because you're training grounds for people who want to do creative things they may not be in New York City or Los Angeles um they may be in small towns all across America\nUh but they have a desire to be able to communicate with others to to use the skills to be able to build skills and the medication to build a career so that you're talking about that youth media experience that happens to\nA public school or perhaps in a community setting after school of public access center\nHas a lot of impact on on the creative community in in in many many states across the country and actually we she just her case after case of people who got their start in community access media either on the the public radio side or the commercial television side\nUm and it's actually one of the success stories or media system that we actually have the ability to be able to have people in small towns across the country and maybe and media markets that are\nLarger than that but they actually may not have\nPower they may not have a ... the inside track to be able to get into a she if she be Asher and NBC Universal [noise]\nThe system to actually allows\nIt is right drink a lot a lot of coverage is allowed access not only to information but also to the to means communication to learning those mean what is happening right now with the SEC trying to do right now as I understand that trying to change the rules\nThat a lot of this stuff is funded it's almost entirely funded by cable franchise fees and the cable companies have been lobbying the change of that and are having a little more success now please explain\nWell what's happening right now is the FCC's trying to ... to find a balance between local communities and an industry\nBy tipping the scales toward toward industry and specific uh they're trying to make sure that you just get breaks a but the use of public property to be able to make money the cable ... the local communities give out\nOr is it kicked in the balance so that the public property that that a a cable company has to use to be able to get to your home um\nAnd they don't own all that land they need to get an ease meant to uh or or some other permission to be able to run all that cable they're not just going over the airwaves like\nThey actually need to get a license to be able to get to your home or to get to your apartment building\nAnd the humidity owns the property to be able to go through the the entire community itself rights or the public rights away are are controlled by local communities one of the things that was enshrined in the Nineteen eighty four cable act was a that local franchise fee and that local support\nCould be or could be gotten by local communities from the cable industry to be able to make money by having cable channels go to your home\nNow what's happening right now as the FCC is trying to tip the balance insane and said that\nYou know a cable company is not making enough money how state that you're in for your job the cable company it's not making enough money um how\nNot a real hard time I really I I I very out in fact I've been starting to send money a little bit each month to the cable company because I'm worried about him away now I Know that it's called my cable bill it's expensive it's a lot more expensive than my community media memberships that I'm ... and\nAnd I think you know it was because he give you one example\nYou know how we got I committed to make sure I Want to make sure the most important stuff gets out\nTo the most important thing to know is that what she is specifically looking to change the change the rules are by which we define what a franchise fee is\nWhat other kind of support for community media is and it it will in danger um the ability for local communities actually have these channels the thing that we're fearful of in a room making that's going to be happening this at this fall\nIs that you have to actually redefine what's what is allowed and we actually will see these channels disappear it's it's a it's a terrible thing\nRight and so so you have these yeah these community outlets are the only outlets that actually gives acts of the media that's not controlled by Mark Zuckerberg or by you know media oligarch and people have a chance to use them that is part of the deal\nFor them using the public right of way and they're trying to change it so that instead of getting money they can say well let me use the channel instead but we're going to charge you for the channel and they would be able to afford that they'd go out of business when the rulemaking happening where can people find out more we got five
