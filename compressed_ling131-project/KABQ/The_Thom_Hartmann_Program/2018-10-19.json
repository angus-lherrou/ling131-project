tend to agree with this guy named sander spinner who says that the constitution has either allowed to be a tyranny that we have or has been powerless to prevent that in either case it's unfit to exist and Peter thank you for the call now one thing that's interesting about these edition act\n... is it was not illegal to speak ill of the vice president\nRight right right yeah very very clear on that it was the president a president his cabinet\nOr or the federal government itself but you could say all the bad things you want to hear about one Thomas Jefferson\nNow it'd be interesting to see if I'm both see if we make it through a one or two Trump administration's without the suspicion that being brought up again as potential legislation\nWell there are parts of the and there were four pieces of legislation under the alien and sedition acts right and a couple of those pieces are actually still on the books they did not ever expire right\nSo what so we have the the alien or the alien portion of that was the ability to basically instantly deport anyone from a country that we felt was not a good country they were at war with us or something like that we have this edition act which meant you could not speak\nOf our president what are the other two I don't know this that's why I'm I'm just\nCurious though let me actually go to a U.S history dot org\nOr where it says no protesting of the government know immigrants no freedom of the press apparently lawmakers could also be a incarcerated yes uh they said no it doesn't describe the Soviet Union during the Cold War describes the United states and Seventeen Ninety eight after the passage of the alien and sedition acts\nYeah it was not a um it was a member of the legislature I thought a member of Congress who was jailed for was that a a that may have been a journalist I seem to think that it was someone in Congress who poked fun at how fat a Adams\nWas and that was a lawsuit that ended up going to the Supreme Court\nYeah uh you're talking about I think a representative Matthew lie on of Vermont\nWho wrote a letter criticizing the president Adams quote\nUnquote bounds thirst for ridiculous pop foolish adulation and self avarice\nCome on there's something about being fat in there to write\nA that would probably be the self\nAvarice or foolish adoration or an editor at least I think somewhere else he may have referred to them is bad but that was part of it too you can't call your president fat\nYeah the is it is an act according to the right up here from us history dot org says it clearly violated individual protections under the first amendment however the practice of judicial review whereby the Supreme Court considers the constitutionality of\nLaws was not yet well developed for the more the justices were all federalist as a result\nMadison and Jefferson directed the opposition to the new laws to state legislatures where we got the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions\nFamously penned by a Thomas Jefferson and by who was the other Virginia and bike and I have no matter what it Madison thank you very much I don't know a lot of people uh feel that this concept\nThat the Supreme Court is the one that should arbitrary whether a law is constitutional or not they feel that\nWell that must be in the constitution somewhere right that there is no ... in Marbury versus Madison why the age of the term and that they got to review it was a third party Marlboro in Madison got together and they said no no no no no no no it was the Supreme Court decided in the Supreme Court\nHad riot power to decide every law so really when we think about checks and balances there is no check against the Supreme Court they can change modify do whatever they want with legislation that passed by allegedly our our representatives are hungry right and\nThen you know luckily sometimes the Supreme Court will go back and say yeah we goofed up on some stuff but it seems over the last like Thirty years or so

sentences plus forty years for operating a website\n... like that one notably Trump did not say the solution is more commutation all those those would certainly be welcome there has to be a reform because it's very unfair right now he said quote it's very unfair to African Americans it's very unfair to everybody unquote\nYes I I agree that putting people in jail for a non violent victimless offenses\nIs unfair to the people that are being put in jail it's unfair to the people that are being forced to pay to put them in jail right it's unfair to the prison guards who are having to

and former White House Speaker Newt Gingrich sport as a conservative ref a reform organization right on crime and yes people like Tania west and Kamkar Daschle in\nThat influence could be critical a

totally harmless\nOr the devil\nIt's one of those it's either harmless it somewhere on the spectrum between completely harmless you can't mentioned the spectrum on a libertarian talk radio shows you light up here with the ... people hey a a TV tip for anybody out there on Netflix a typical very good show\nSo what the heck are we talking about ... drug being on the spectrum here um but yeah the idea of schedule one which was a list of things that we didn't really understand in what Nineteen sixties Nineteen Seventy ... about\nNineteen Seventy right even though there was a what was it the Schaffer commission yeah that said that there's not enough research into cannabis it should not be classified schedule was until we know more and Richard Nixon said\nWe don't know enough about Canada as we should keep it on schedule was until we know more\nBecause it will help us ah keep the hippies as the enemy yet we keep heroin on there it will help us keep those dams heaviest blacks on ... Richard dad knew enough\nYeah he was a it was a masterful and and that is not me being a racist those are the nickel into ... Nixon being racist and verified by who is the nature hold them under a Ehrlich men who who back those ever was a John Dean\nProbably several people yeah I'm probably also the Nixon tape [laughter] yeah\nOh yeah we did have that tape recorder going that whole time but you know that was his political plan was to uh to keep his his enemies down and use a drug policy to do that and we're still suffering under it today forty five forty eight years later\nContinuing on with the article from fortunate again they mentioned that ... much like cannabis as a schedule one drug which means that our government says it has no known medical use and they I potential for abuse and addiction by contrast\nScheduled for drugs include things like sleeping pill which supposedly have a lot of potential for abuse or dependent\nAnd here's where it has its biggest impact number one it generates all these laws get people thrown in jail for victimless crimes and and you know we do not support that but the other thing that it does when you're a schedule one drug it makes it very hard for research to happen\nI guess and that's that is a big deal so this whole time we could have had research going on about ... and we could have had research going on about marijuana we could have found ways to help people\nWith these naturally occurring compounds and I've actually tired of calling them drugs they're naturally occurring compound right\nAs cat Williams says drugs you got to do stuff to you got to boil it you got to add baking soda I don't know the entire recipe I'm just saying you've got to do stuff to it right ah but I'm Glad you mentioned about it being you know this drug or a according to the government a drug that\nYou can't really do a lot of trials with you know they they do allow very limited very limited and this article mentioned that it says about before the FDA that's the food and Drug Administration can even be petitioned\nTo re classify ... first has declared what's known as phase three clinical trials that process is expected to take about five years\nOnly five years yeah the FDA that's actually relatively quick\nYes but then you run into problems of\nIf something is that right and you're a phase three clinical trials you've got to start all over yeah and if the FDA rejects the results of your phase three clinical trials you've got to start all over\nAnd it's it's a tragedy that we're still following this I\nIndeed and and I I'm ... I'm sure that there are people out there that don't understand the history of the FDA\nUm but the FDA was basically created during the uh Woodrow Wilson administration and its ideal hurts or from a Roosevelt yes yes yes he had done some things but the idea was um\nHow do we protect some of our friends in agriculture or in the production of foods ah like Heinz ketchup ... so we need to have the government regulate certain things that way we can make sure that revenues flow to our friends our political I catch up as a vegetable\nYeah does that work that kind of thing that came out of this but the idea that that anywhere in the constitution is written that the federal government shop control what you put into your body's that's insanity\nOver say there's the interstate commerce clause and what you put in your body comes out of your body and some kind of way and that might go into a pipe that goes across the state line and so therefore interstate\nCommerce yeah and to ah come up with the actual constitutional reasons Randy's you have to do a mental gymnastics like Darrell just went through to try to do it that way since\nReally what the court ruled and that's a you know about a guy growing wheat in his own backyard was that he was then not participating in interstate commerce and therefore it could be regulated\nOver versus bill burning so yes these are the types of insanity that have led from our our perfect constitution I'm so when you sit there and go well that is not constitutional a congratulations you identified one of about a billion things that have occurred in

better name isn't it isn't it\n[laughter] um yeah so we've been talking about this vice article came out a vice Canada about a I'm a psychiatrist a psychoanalyst up there who has been confronted\nA with how to assist as patients dealing with what is likely the most traumatic event anyone could ever go through and that is their own death\nAnd he had a patient that that had pretty much try anything and basically went to um saying you know if I if I could I Would really like to try um hallucinogenic as as a part of a way to deal with this\nAh ... write a quote overwhelming existential distress and uh and he was reluctant to break the law was studies from Johns Hopkins medical center and New York University in hand Tobin applied for an exemption under the control drugs and substances act\nIn January twenty seven\nTwenty when he got him in pain in early discussions with health candidate Tobin learned he was the first therapist to bring forward or proposal of this kind in Canada\nSo far the feds have been reluctant to move forward with the application without enthusiastic endorsement from a British Columbia is health ministry hand medical regulators players Tobin says have been quote noncommittal unquote when approached by his team\nBut job and says the project about wind in its sales again this summer when he connected with to Toronto, Canada his lawyers interested in taking on his case pro bono\nOne of those lawyers Peter Lewin as twenty years' experience on the cannabis found even defended for one of Canada's landmark cases in twenty Thirteen\nYou know it's always good when you come across some lawyers that are willing to lawyers in your field that are willing to take your case pro bono yeah\nAnd uh I think we're seeing definitely in the cannabis cases there are certainly law firms are springing up around that but there's also a lot of people who just realize it's the right thing to do right and they're more I'm more inclined to take something out to donate some of their time pro bono to making these things happen\nQuote he told me the other day on the phone that this is is most exciting case unquote Tobin told vice shortly after his talk so that's really infused a new sense of energy and momentum into her dream with his new legal team and six other therapists Tobin officially launched\nTherapeutic ... for Canadians project days before we became legal job and has had hasn't been formally rejected by health Canada and he still hopes for a solution outside of a courtroom\nBut given the Canadian course of already decided the limited uh medical access to an illegal drug like Canada's violates our constitutional rights Tobin is feeling optimistic about the future of psychedelic science and treatment in Canada\nQuote I expect this time or the timeline is going to be much shorter Tobin told vice my basic attitude towards the whole thing has been careful modest steps slow and steady wins the race\nSo we have been given our project a very narrow focus in terms of what we want to see initially were targeting end of life patience for whom nothing else has worked\nOf course there are still lots we don't know about psychedelic particularly when it comes to long term effect\nFor now Tobin is limited and his request to patients with terminal cancer diagnoses people's so paralyzed by psychological distress but it's interfering with their other treatment and who don't have a quote long term to look forward term to\nA job and I suspect this definition could expand over time as more studies in clinical trials accumulate\nCorrect me if I'm wrong if I either of you know or anybody listening or eight fifty five four fifty free but when California\nFirst introduced therapeutic candidate is or medicinal marijuana depending on what term you want to ... years got back in what the late nineties it was very limited right\nI'm assuming I I Can't remember the history of it I I Know a lot of states that currently have some form of and New Hampshire called therapeutic cannabis right ah it's\nDistorted off fairly limited to gamble with chronic illnesses or people with you know things that were basically terminal and then it slowly expanded to include right you know a more broad based if you have a chronic\nIf if somebody goes through that video they'll see the crowds that Ron Paul was was drawing during the campaign for twenty twelve a presidential raw\nI predicted effect that called freak dark live and I predicted the and I said Ron Paul is going to win this thing because at the very beginning of twenty eleven he was pulling in crowds of thousands and thousands of people and I went to one of his rallies and I got all excited about it and I said you know ... years\nHere's a movement of the people that people want liberty and this thing is growing and it's rolling downhill like I you know like a rock rolling down hill yet either and they got a lot of steam\nAnd it would have my prediction would have been true in Ron Paul would have been president if it weren't for the fact that the media not only buried every story that was about Ron Paul but then put out false information about Ron Paul because\nA course there were there were at the end you and somebody can go on YouTube and look at a cliff all the clips all the dirty tricks the media did around on twenty twelve to torpedo that campaign now we could have been living in a\nMore liberty friendly environment right nah now had Ron Paul won that election it would be in America would be totally different than what\nWe are yeah frankly living and no argument I I just I'm a ... and you want to single out the media which which I agree I mean it just\nAnd I'll say the mainstream media because there's a lot of people in media like Darrell ah I consider Darryl certainly part of the media who I respect\nUm but mainstream media is pretty much taken of the issue I have is there's this club then that club is made up of the Republican Party the Democratic party and the media\nAnd depending on the issue and depending on which way monies flowing in a given election year it's been a flow of between those three in some direction it's going to exclude a liberty type candidate right and what does a Ron Paul have to offer a Rupert Murdoch\nWhat does a Ron Paul have that's gonna benefit of the Republicans are the Democrats a whole bunch of slow news days right man we have no wars to report on\nIdentical just ... yeah ... yeah the people's candidate was Ron Paul people people were excited people were walking\nOut on the streets with signs I mean I've never seen this kind of energy behind the presidential campaign at the grassroots now yeah there's always energy at the top with the big ...\nYears but this is the first time I've ever seen where average Joes we're spending time dripping signs off of bridges and the climbing up a trees and drape and science from trees and it was just crazy it was an amazing time\nYou know run they never had than McCain never did Trump never did well maybe ... where you from that I don't I'm not in my yeah Trump has been I think the closest for that cult of personality type you know that that in ... fired a whole lot of people that really had no idea what the\nWhat about John boarding Ross Perot and he had like a lot\nOf support but I don't know if it was you know sort of the same level of grass roots\nRoss was never really a a live event kind of guy Ross was not very charismatic well he was funny but it had pie charts he did\n... is as easy as I can tell the rear end of the stair from from Iraq but you know and he was he was he was folksy and he got people listening got people looking at his numbers and but it was mostly a TV show\nAnd the funny thing is Ron Paul was not charismatic\nHe was this goofy doctor from Texas who uh you know he was just this skinny little guy\nAnd he would get up there with this kind of squeaky voice and people would go nuts people were just crazy because of the message it wasn't the man so much as the message and the fact that\nHe had a history behind him that guaranteed that he was going to do what he said he was going to do right there was no question even his or even his enemies realized that he\nWas a man of his word and whatever he said he was going to do would have happened had he gotten I like it was it was a different time and ah anyway I I just wanted to reminisce bring that up to the minds of people who were there and people who weren't there they can go look at YouTube and see what they missed out well\nBecause they missed out on this time around Jean here's what I Can't wait to do I can't wait to talk to you about the next Ron Paul and I don't know who it's going to be but there is going to a rise out of the liberty movement somebody who was charismatic\nSomebody who is who has a strong ethics and is able to convey these ideas to rely a lot of people it will not be Ilan ... I was like a shoe go ahead and get more like Darrell Perry bright yeah maybe it will be I I tried that\nTwo years ago not doing it again the type of running that I'm doing these days and Jane thank you for the call and it's been a running I'm doing this they these days involved you know putting on a pair of shoes and getting a raise ... re shirt and\nYeah running donating marathon you are yeah and uh and and a\nQuest for liberty is very much a marathon and even if you look at the major candidates that the major parties it's not like every four years\nBoth sides throw up these amazing charismatic candidate I Will say that Trump was very charismatic and he's a TV reality show a star ... okay so that translates well to modern politics\nUm but I you know it it may be another two three four election cycles we're going to see somebody rise up that's gonna\nAgain bring this message that more people are grasping you know more young people are getting the ideas of liberty and we just need to write voice to bringing forward\nYeah and you know one\nThing that I Will say and\nYou see this a lot and you mentioned sort of cult of personality mhm and I noticed that with some of the supporters of Ron Paul to where it became more about Ron Paul demand right than anything he was saying right and how dare you speak ill\nOf or say that he made a wrong decision when he endorsed every Republican including the author of SOPA\nRight yeah you're you're going to get this and um\nI I don't think you're ever going to have anybody who will be as pure as the purest are libertarians want right who will ever have any desire to go into the cesspool that his national politics you're going to need somebody\nWho understands if if we want to move ahead\nThan we're probably gonna have to compromise a little bit too hot hate compromise when it comes to my freedom and liberty but\nYou know if it moves the ball forward that's what we got to focus on to your calls and thoughts welcome

for for previously unsolved burglaries without evidence in another arrest the department's pins five separate vehicle burglaries on a thirty five year old the charges were eventually dropped when the department did not provide sufficient evidence to prosecutors\nOfficer Anthony del at Torrey repeatedly told an internal affairs investigator the officers instructed to color any black person was somewhat of a record in charge him with the burglaries\nRight so somewhat of a record could mean oh yeah they had like you know a tenth of an ounce of cannabis that one time\nThey were jaywalking ... writers everybody that crossed their past once before right but I've watched enough TV just say okay we'll go round up some of the usual suspects\nWill pin it on one of 'em that doesn't look like they've got a good strong alibi that's pretty much what they did right and they're not going to have the means to fight against the so hey we get a conviction out of it everybody goes on end of the day or that guy even you know sometimes\nThere are people that do have solid Alibis but as you mentioned they might not have the money for a private lawyer so they get the public defender that never calls the boss right who can testify that yes he was at work at that time\nYeah it's a it's very sad and people who lack the financial means is is a it's indicative of a of an oligarchy when those who are in power or can prey upon those who don't have it and then are likely unable to fight\nThe charges right and going back to something that gene the Christian anarchists that in the last hour when he was talking about\nYou know a government and you know specifically mainstream media being part of the same club to quote George Carlin it's a big club you ain't at it and it's the same club that they use to beat you over the head\nThat's ... that's right so the two cops are going to prison for a year they're actually\nWill they'll probably lived through it but uh the police chief will be sentenced on November twenty seven so we'll we'll certainly have a follow up when that happens yeah and uh I don't know I I mean\nIs a year even a reasonable sentence for for what happened here and that's all they really got them on was was making a false arrest\nRight right so what really should have happened and now I realize\nI'm looking at this utopian Lynn's right ah but these officers should personally be held liable for making restitution to the people that they have wrongly arrested ... these officers\nAnd I I'm One of the handful of people that thinks that in Ninety nine point nine percent of cases prison is not the right answer right on I think that these officers instead of having their housing and food and clothing provided at taxpayer expense for another year of their life\nThey should be forced to take a minimum wage job at Burger King working as the fry cook or or something like that\nPrisons prison is certainly not the right answer it's it's pretty much not the right answer for just about anything but at the same time it's good that these these people are no longer in law enforcement\nIt is um the the right and it will they stay not in law enforcement I mean once you've got a felony conviction that's pretty much it\nI'm I'm not even is or any of these things felonies yeah yes okay well that that may keep them from going and joining a another ... security firm yeah if there is probably not ... probably not because you know\nThere are some states where I Can't work as a security officer because of an outstanding warrant in South Carolina not you're admitting that or your husband lead driving without a seatbelt supposedly speeding and supposedly not coming to a complete stop at a stop sign see how he did that kids he didn't admit anything learn that\nUm but but it's ... it's interesting on a couple of points are so for so first of all\nI Hope they don't work in law enforcement all ah ever again because they are dishonest people right that's that's the biggest thing uh to Daryl point\nRestitution is one of these things we need to make that a thing people need to talk about that when crimes occur people need to be compensated for the harm that was done to them by the people that did them harm\nAnd in our system we don't often get that out of our courts I mean sometimes a a decision will come down that involves restitution but more often the case is well you know if they want to\nYou know pursue this further and get some recover some of their wages they're just going to have to go into civil suit and file suits against those officers in civil a civil civil court\nRight over ... or ... or early then it's not against the officers it's against the department of taxpayers ... this government identifies the officers that does

Cherokee I'm scared to death to be Cherokee because a lot of white people what they have a young kid and that stuck with me for ever but it has given me I'm\nMore empathy is giving them on ... to see the fear and my grandfather than I ever see\nAnd understand as I when I look at it and I I\nDoubt her mother said one bit yeah because if you have people don't know their history and and you say that all the time you were a great historian if people understood history better they might understand today that yeah\nYeah and and and Elizabeth Warren ... she was in a situation where it was kinda damned if you do and damned if you doubt on the one hand exactly the Trump and the Republicans were trying to claim\nSomething that we absolutely was not true and that is that they were saying that she got some sort of benefit out of out of saying that she had to have an American ancestry and she got no benefit anywhere in her career from at a under any circumstances in any way shape or form period end of discussion\nBut then you know in order to to re bought the though the whole Pocahontas thing obviously she's going to be running for president\nYou know she did this genetic test and that it would that she stepped into this incredible conflict the conflict as maybe the wrong word but a debate is probably the more appropriate word\nThat's happening in Native American communities right now because the whole you know it it it is since since Native American communities have been acknowledged as ... as a separate nations and some of them have gotten very wealthy or as a result of the you know legalized gambling and things\nOn their their each try you know in order to say okay you're a member of the tribe or you are not\nUm it it that it's been a very very difficult and challenging thing for the tribes over the years to to to to know who should be and you know rightly should be shouldn't be part of the tribe\nAnd and of course there's no genetic marker for any particular tribe there's just a genetic marker for a yeah you were you know some some of your ancestors were among those people who came across the land bridge from from Russia you know twelve or twenty two thousand years ago\nAnd that's a that's pretty much it and so but but now you've got this you know people who have been denied tribal membership poor tried to say oh well here I can do a genetic test and show that I've got you know a certain percentage of\nOf ... and you know native ancestry and then uh you know other people of the ... there are probably some people who are members of tribes who are\nWho have less native ancestry than there are people who have been rejected by tribes and vice versa that's just it you know it's been all over the map for years and years and years because it's been more like you know but\nYou know I I not being native America yeah I Know several people who are um eh but it's you know it's just it's just a huge issue in the Native American community and they've and they've all just been going you know ... genetic tests are not the way we are going to do this we'd never have we're not going to\nAnd so then when Elizabeth Warren gets this genetic test she was not applying for tribal membership she's not pretending that she's a member of a tribe she's not even identified a particular while you she says the story that her mother told her\nBut um [noise] you know it's like I I Am confident\nAs slash hopeful that this will blow over the the Native American blowback against her using a genetic test um but I doubt it and I think the the Republicans are going to continue to use is against her I I I don't know how to respond to it\nSo anyhow will see a ... thanks a lot for the call\nOh that was that was Carla somehow I I think your caller for that call somehow I I ended up with cliff cliff I'm Sorry I just hung up on you a call us back Marta in big bear California a martyr what's on your mind\nWell I'm worried that Trump is going to win reelection ...

Catholic bishops to state backed\nCatholic Church which the Vatican has always considered to be scared him right not part of the official got like a family and a Pope Francis went to China he recognized the state appointed bishops and said look I understand this is\nGoing to cause some suffering to people who consider themselves true Catholics who follow the Vatican this is going to look like\nA negative compromise but it was part of sort of a deal but it's been explained to me as a you know in the hopes of\nA big causing the Chinese government to respect Catholics in China more in the long run by doing that and I think there's a possibility to see some mirroring of of how that would go in North Korea of course the north Korea doesn't allow their population to openly practice religions but there is a Catholic\nChurch in Pyongyang where a lot of diplomats and other people go and and the thinking or on the Vatican side is that look yes this is a away for Kim Jong Eun to bolster his regime to be seen as\nExtra legitimate but we're not President Trump were not bound by the same sort of political calculations this is about it you know of Angela's Asian of a new part of the world war Catholicism hasn't flourished\nAnd let's also note that there have been people troops in the past where there were concerns it was going to play into the hands\nOf a government think back just three years ago Pope Francis goes to Cuba he wasn't terribly outspoken against the the regime there but he did talk about the desire for people to have greater freedom he said Cuba should open itself up to the world that was seen as\nSort of suddenly advancing political priorities in the Bible back the clock\nTo the early Nineteen eighties ... jump all the second goes to Nicaragua under the sand in eastern government\nThe fender nieces were really excited for Francis or rather a Pope John Paul to go there they thought he would basically condemn American support for the contras and instead the pope on leashes on the Sandinistas for their human rights abuses so there's sort of an interesting history here popes sort of having the freedom to be able to\nDefy expectations let's let's see if this does it happens it would certainly be a very interesting one\nThat would be fascinating meanwhile you've got these are people from Guatemala mostly family so it's a you know seen the pictures a lot of kids\nAre people fleeing Guatemala and Honduras bad both had military coups El Salvador you know there's been run by death squads every now and all this goes back to Reagan I mean he's the one and ripped to this area part I don't know why we as a country are not helping put you know these countries put themselves back together\nA instead when there are people flee and they are more than a half million people have fled Guatemala just in the last year\nWhen there are people fleeing a you know if you count freaks out or or actually he's he's loving it I think oh you know there's three thousand in our Guatemalans heading for the United states through Mexico and of course they're traveling together because that that's how you avoid being\nKidnapped or murdered by by Mexican criminal elements who pray on loan travelers who are trying to make it to to North America so what's Mexico likely to do about that\nYeah well I think you're right to diagnose sort of the hypocrisy of of the government response here I mean on one hand when this caravan sets off earlier this week the president's threatening to nix a aid to Honduras which is predominantly directed towards\nAnti crime you know helping the judge judicial institutions which are seen as\nThe weak points of that society which caused people need to leave in the first place so that would seem self defeating he doesn't look like he's going to cancel that a but it's a it's a very sort of a ... odd instinct that he has\nAnd then you are right again about people traveling new groups I mean we are basically trying to uh we are advancing a narrative at least at the U.S government\nThat we are trying to dissuade illegal immigration because it's unsafe writing it allows a you know smugglers or human smugglers to profit so here these people are\nAre banding together and going through official asylum channels to stay safe and yet we're also condemning them for doing that and you write Fox News series on this talks about illegal trying to breach the border which is\nNot at all a part of their plans but it looks like in this case Mexico\nIs going to react differently than I did in April the big difference there is that they've now got that NAFTA deal rights and eat the relationship with Trump has been passed over a little bit ah unlike in April when Mexico gave the caravan the first minute left a bunch of trends of permits which allow these people to go across Mexico\nThe Mexican government here at the Guatemalan border is basically stopping people they're saying\nIf you don't have transit papers to come through Mexico and if you're not going to apply for asylum in Mexico then we're going to have to turn your back\nUm and they have asked I think and this is responsible policy they've asked the United nations refugee agency to come to the border there and help process these claims rapidly inevitably it's true the the Mexico's not safe everywhere but it is becoming more and more a place that is recognized as safe at least in part\nAs a place for people fleeing violence in the northern trying to uh Central America to go so I think Mexico changed his tune here they want to preserve the slightly improved relationship with the United states\nQuick on the road going to change one animal becomes president Michel him off\nIt's too hot [noise] I don't know I
