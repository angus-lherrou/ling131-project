Institute for technology but it might better be referred to as any pays headquarters yeah and see what happens here the most listeners that had been you know paying attention over the last few months I think have been hearing us talk about any pay\nA because any pay is awesome and it is the solution for retail\nCrypto currency acceptance and I don't just say that 'cause I Know you and I love you Derek I say that because it is the best choice or in the marketplace today\nAnd uh it's been out since about August twenty Seventeen I think was when you guys launched any pay yeah I'm as a solution for retailers who are looking to accept crypto currency because when you go in and you want to pay for you know whatever it is you want to pay for it to a shop\nOr a restaurant it's clunky to pull out some wallet put in a password\nAnd you know try to pay an owner of a business 'cause you can't pay a waiter or something you know generally if they're working for a boss or whatever if the boss is running the business then they could pull out their own phone and you could send them crypto there has to be a system there has to be some sort of\nUm easy to use a method\nTo facilitate real life merchant you know physical real world transactions for crypto currency and that's exactly what any pay does and it does it beautifully it does it well\nUm most of the ... there's been a few bumps in the road but it you know it's still yeah you know there's growing pains are and it's a it's a good thing but thankfully yeah this is great and he paid on global is where you can go to learn more about any pay and get started there's really not a whole lot of learning you have to do just can you just jump right in\nYeah go to the website you can be accepting bitcoin at your business and less than five minutes if you've never even done bitcoin before\nNo joke I mean if you've already got to look what I say is if you've already got a tablet at your register your halfway done yeah because all you gotta do is create your username and password and then you're in there is no an application fee or process or paperwork or government involvement you're just you're in and then you know it's your crypto wallet address destinations instead of page\n... on the tablet or your point of sale and you're done yeah we're\nWe're so pleased to be working in this way I'm any pay is really about retail adoption for crypto currency for and it's more than just a peel west because anyone can make a point of sale system apparently there you know there are dozens and they all work pretty well but where there are not helping [laughter]\nWell well there are I Would\nSay only maybe three or four that do kind of what any pay does\nLie of all things to say about our competitors in the different people who produce P. O. S. but any pay is about retail adoption right and so we're focused on building our network of merchants helping them you know helping instruct people to learn about crypto currency\nYou know setting up a meet up groups around the world so that people are actually going to the places than that up to accept bitcoin\nSo it's it's more than just a point of sale system sure uh\nBut it's the easiest one to use and ah it's the easiest one to get started with and there's no feet to the march and I think that's one of the more important aspects of it is that you don't get jak for one two three percent it's zero percent a cost for the merchant yes except sometimes is negative ... percent\nYou actually get paid when people ... dashed back yeah yeah we didn't even talked about that yet so that's like an example of how any pays more than just a point of sale is like ... and some work on ways to to figure out how are we going to get bitcoin accepted everywhere visas accepted\nYou know how long are we going to get it clean it all of the businesses in town not just you know\nHalf a want all of them right and you still coming up with creative incentive programs like dashed back is how we do that\nWhich pays a right now a dash back is ten percent so if we were to go I think next door ... weeks yes one of the places there's several locations here in in Portsmouth more than a dozen I think at least a too close to two dozen now I've lost track\nOf there's a lot of soldiers who doesn't yeah that that take crypto currency in real life\nUm you can go in there and spend the ... of doing it super easy to do fun you get money in your phone you're just like boom I spent money and then I get money back and emergency like it too because they get one hundred percent of the sale again you're not taking any place not taking a fee\nOn my credit card companies that are jacking them around for three percent or more in a in some cases per sale\nAnd uh and so they get to keep\nAll of their profits which means they could go on a vacation with the extra money that they get or they could get their employees a raise or whatever you know given bonuses uh it it opens up option so there's a real I think goal of what you're talking about bringing businesses on\n'em that how much you're making in\nBut that would really help the merchants in Venezuela to be able to see 'em like an end to help us like people who are spending money try to help the people in Venezuela you know what's the return like when you set up a merchant\nAre people going back and actually spending money there and you know you can't see that with a regular dashed wallet right now but you guys can take a look and you can see oh yeah people are spending money at this business yeah ... and wouldn't it be fun and cool to just target incentives in different places where it's needed most than experiments and see\nYou know what sort of results do you get [noise]\nYeah I always thought it was down in back here I thought it would be interesting to see you know where are\n... and I obviously you guys have this information because you any pay is actually an intermediary a very temporary intermediary between the customer and the vendor you guys in most cases except crypto from the customer ... any money immediately spit it right into the uh the the vendors\nWallets that will never ever hold fun ever touch month but it does allow you to\nThe way the system set up a dozen ... to have some sort of statistics on who's spending what Chris does and and where those are being spent because you do have certain merchants who are verified real life businesses anybody can go to any paid on global and sign up for an account right now and start using it\nThat's how most people do it they don't tell us that they're doing it\nBut if you want to get let's say as a dash back a business where somebody could come in and then get ten percent immediately back on every purchase they make you got to be a real business you gotta kinda prove that you exist in India are going to have a brick and mortar Haitian yet you actually have to have a place to get in and if you if\nYou're in New Hampshire we actually have a merchant bounty program so you're ... you're signing up a business not only can you help them get dashed back but you can also get yourself paid as well which is pretty cool ah so\nYou were going to touch on some crypto advantages 'cause we were talking about uh you know cash and how crypto currency like bitcoin is very much like a digital cash that doesn't have any kind of a you know requirements that the government has placed on at the government of course cannot uh\nEasily tax crypto currency the government didn't create crypto currency and therefore it cannot stop it because it's decentralized where some of the advantages you were thinking well for for me\nPrivacy is the number one but that doesn't work for everybody not everyone cares about their financial privacy they're willing to sign it away for you know one percent backing points on their credit card but for the rest of us are just money back\nActual savings and everyone buys stuff at Amazon some always telling people about purse said at first dot com you know exotic savings and Amazon hell I regularly get twenty percent off every day when I buy at Amazon and even with the Amazon\nA credit card I was like oh you know five percent back if I sign another credit card well I Would I Do have already getting twenty percent or\nSo or more I got a when I was ordering\nLike the chairs and tables and things like that for the bitcoin embassy outing keen I'm ... I I went for twenty nine percent I'm like I'm not in a big rush let's see if I can get twenty nine percent\nAlong every take a few days yeah well I I did a when I was in a I was in a rush so I did two different orders yesterday just one was for five percent because I was like I Need these coffee pods right away I Can't wait for that\nBut then some of the other march I was like oh we'll do twenty percent you know maybe it'll take a few days boom it was a couple of yes yeah I was like OK every time is the last twenty percent for the same day every single every every time so that's a compelling advantage to using bitcoin if for no other reason save yourself somebody right\nIt's you learn one skill one time and then forever you're going to be so many people and we're as we pointed out I think last week we're coming up a January is going to be the tenth\nAnniversary of the launch of ... or so where do you want is the tenth anniversary of when the toast you put the thing up on get hub writes\nA and then again January I was when they officially went live I guess yeah um so we're still in the first decade of this whole thing\nAnd it feels new again I don't know about you guys but with cash I Am so I feel like we're at square one and we get to start over like completely fresh you know ... has this brand name sailing that people recognize but almost nobody is using it\nSo not in ... the early days of bitcoin when we were going back and forth sending people a couple of cents here and there yeah\nThat was that was fun and cool and you can't do that with bitcoin core anymore well video if you really see they they came out with another one called bitcoin core\nI don't know if you really work out quite and cash as I understand really ... anyway I'm just saying equate BTC it's fun again because you can actually use bitcoin again right and uh it and I know that's\nComing for a for any pay that quaint cash support is in the works or is there any update on a on the status\nI'm not at liberty to say [laughter]\nSo you can use bitcoin cash but not on any pay yet\nBut eventually it's a it's in the works right you can say that if I Want it to happen yeah yeah okay okay good so what coins are available on pay right now the the two most popular coins that anyone's going to use our big claim to dash and dashes cool because businesses that are registered with any pay you get dashed back\nAnd the business does too so they get a phone us ... yeah and this is sponsored by the dash investors so to speak so this is something that dashes saying we want to put money towards this to help our claim to be the more popular one to use and it worked they cut out\nMarket share from bitcoin at at the businesses that use it\nDefinitely works I mean I was the one in Keene out there you know pushing this\nProgram basically explaining it to merchants and getting out there and uh we created the flyers that we're basically the same as what you did hear so you've got dashed back flyers that show a list of all of the different ah crypto currency accepting businesses here in downtown Portsmouth\nAnd you you know you've been handing those outer putting them wherever it is that you're you're putting them probably in the businesses are I Would imagine so we did the same thing out in Keene and there were definitely regular buyers that were coming in and using dashed\nBack about something else I did it was pretty cool there's this group of guys that are doing a dash documentary a limb and time and they've they've been interviewing people big names Roger ... in a handful of others I heard that came to town they did they came and I'm stopped by any pay headquarters and it did a few interviews that the businesses around town that take dash right\nUm they set up a business in their hometown so they they were like OK any pays pretty easy to use will show the pub downstairs from us\nSo they they feel like your cat right yeah they set up the pub in in Bristol, England and\nUm they take Daschle ... handful of other crypto currency is using any paying but no one was going\nNo ... they had this Bristol meet up\nBut no one really knew that it was going on you know I created a meet up groups in Bristol huh just to see what would happen until we get some people that go there well they had their first meet up last night and there were like five ten people at the comedy there's really not know\nHow many of the five to ten people did they not no they didn't know any of that that's awesome yeah they didn't know any of them and they were starting to connect with people as like oh you're my neighbor she wants to ... yeah\n...

category for storm when it crashed into shore on the Florida Panhandle meteorologist Tom said her\nWell you should do but I can tend to England you know you can't\nObviously yeah but uh but that's cool and especially that there were four hundred something people in this meta group already that we're interested in crypto currency but none of them had ever actually used it in real life because this is the first time place where they could actually do that um\nAnd none of the four hundred decided hey we should all get together\nAt some well they had me a presumably they had they were having they they were having it all the other day I thought you were saying it was just a group known now I'd lie couldn't use do and so now I'm a ... point lead up groups is to actually meet in real life I mean if you you try and if you're a business and you're trying to accept crypto currency ... you're going to have a hard time\nAnd now crypto enthusiasts\nHave an easy to use free tool that they can get any business they love right to say here I'll set you up it'll take five minutes a hold your hand through it and you know if you're in New Hampshire even get a kick back so well\nLet's think we're spoiled here and that's why you are so shocked Darryl because like for us you know every single day in Portsmouth and keen somebody somewhere multiple some buddies are spending crypto currency ad downtown businesses whether it be to buy a pack of rolling papers that corner news which has been accepting grip dozens twenty Thirteen by the way\nUh or you know going across the street to local burger and grabbing some lunch or some dinner or you know different things you could have your dentist you dentistry done in king now African democracy you can have your\nCar repair jealous about that by the way you can kind of talked with my dentist about it and he's he's really on the thinking about it even go to him and he was like OK someone else is doing it\nThey paved the way that Hillary lot when we lost a business recently haven't onto that thing corrupt used it happened two years ago two years ago I was going to happen to read this was last week I went I Steven went and got his hair cut he added employment partner\nWe paying crypto every time we help or actually the guy who just stuck by is the childhood friend helps this business owners set up\nTo take crypto currency and we've been doing it for a year or two and suddenly a Steven land and paid with bitcoin uh then\nI went I had an ... and later the same day and the girl said whoa sorry we we can do that I was like he just said earlier and she said yeah well you know the business center came in and yelled is she's like we're we're not doing that anymore I told everyone\nWas like wow so this is a real learning moment yeah me what happened I failed I failed to communicate to this business owner\nThe woman at the business news it no she's been raking in a pile of coincidental anything to do with it\nYou know how to use bitcoin so this was a ... a teaching moment for me like she didn't have all you to say hey what do I do with the she just decided by I don't know what to do with this I was crushed because here I Am standing at the only reason I'm going to this place over anyone else right because they take crypto currency\nAnd it was my own failure to communicate to the business owner how to use the crypto\nSo that's a really important component if you're going to set up a business\nThat you know I'm let me ask this lesson along to your listeners like help the business owner\nDo something with the money that they're getting make it useful or else it's just disappearing into a black hole they don't understand that's a good\nPoint um do you did you have a chance to follow up with a business owner after you learn this news yet\nNot yet it was just do the other day though we we've been away but yeah of course I'm going to reach out and and I apologize and thanked her for the long time that she's been taking crypto currency and\nYou know I Want I Want to make it right but anyway I wanted to share with your listeners this does happen it can go in and reverberating yeah it yeah it was it was devastating in a in\n... when it happened to a little shop that was like\nSo they started as a a food truck and they sold vegetarian cuisine and they open up their own cafe a central and I'm like super excited ride like we're gonna we're migrating from food truck accepting bitcoin to an indoor sit down you know cafe accepting yes\nThis is awesome and they in business their business oh great so like it was you know no brainer rights of course they're going to take the quaint and the guy the owner or one of the co owners or you know explained to me that he was really excited about bitcoin\nThat year and that he wanted to start telling his customers about it like he was really into it he loved the idea that it could you know keep money away from the government like he was into it yeah and then all of a sudden\nThey're not taking any more what happened so as you know as you know in Keene there are a group of haters oh yeah and uh they targeted this business and they threatened them while they said to this business if you continue to take crypto currency\nWe are going to stop a coming because they were obviously boycott yeah it was a boycott threaten to boycott\nAnd uh obviously they were actual customers right it wasn't like just strangers you know calling up who weren't really customers red had teeth so did have teeth and they ah they were scared and they they stopped taking it because of\nThat usually what happens is businesses stop taking pickling because no one's going yeah like when we were living in San Francisco we were always asking can we take it can be used because we record and we were the only ones who ever wanted to\nIt was through the you know shocking in a city with so many people over a million people and they're also tech savvy but the one what would actually use the bitcoin\nHere it was just totally political we're gonna continue here he wants to quote us there at least he's with us here from any paid on global we're

wings\nAnd I divided in exchange for money so they didn't wind up you know giving us free lie\nWhat did you pay with a cause yours you know kind of you're you've been our producer here kind of a career so you went over and ordered the lunch while we were pretty adamant not jade without pay with that one big one and it had to go up pretty smooth smooth\nThe girl knew exactly what she was doing she whipped are found out she opened up the up for any paid our global now was this a waitress or\nSo she had it on her personal phone or awake late may be a common phone I'm not sure like a cell phone yeah OK\nI'm the only thing I'd hope for was that she had her own um had her own wall loaded so I could have tipped that way too mhm that's always a big desire when I spent crypto is I'd love to be able to share that with a server right when I'm a uh restaurants or bars or things like that so\nWell and with other than that it's just really fast and\nAnd we have been talking about you know kind of the the real life experience of a not only spending crypto currency but ringing businesses on board or explaining it to them you know uh the all the benefits of accepting crypto like for instance you get to keep one hundred percent of the sale which doesn't happen with credit cards right on for her business owner\nYou know explaining these things to them and it's one thing to get the business owner on board but it's another task entirely to bring the staff on board with understanding at least having some kind of grass that oh this is money oh I can use it in downtown king or downtown Portsmouth where we are\nUm and so that's part of it is you know explaining to the person hey look you can actually not only spend is that the business that which you work which nobody ever wants to buy things from the place where they work the rank and all you can go across the street over there and you can spend it at a you know streets which isn't across the street but it's a it's a little ways away but there's businesses in downtown port missed that take it\nSo you know whenever I'm In ... and I'll be like oh yeah you can spend at a corner news and you know when you name businesses that people are familiar with\nThere's no bells that go off in the back of their mind\nThis might actually be worth my time I might want to actually look at this\nYeah man for some people um you know I I don't want to stress like total because I mean that gets ... whole that whole ... of the word hold yeah but a lot of very intoxicated let's let's use the actual words to be talking about\nBut a lot of people will talk about how bitcoin for example should just be held no hold on to it you should never spend it and there's two sides of that um if bitcoin is part of your income let's say you're a server in a bar and you get some tips in bitcoin\nWell maybe you do put that away for a rainy day doesn't mean hold onto it for eternity but\nYou know what I mean if you get paid in two different ways that maybe a little easier for people to set aside a little bit of cash yeah um\nBut everyone's different so and the nice thing about crypto currency is that can be used as cash it can be used as a story of well you can choose how it works best for you there is no right way or wrong way\nIt's what benefits use the most and you're the one who's gonna decide that not anybody else not bitcoin marketing or ... cash marketing or anybody else's marketing hits you in your hands you're the bank\nAnd when it comes to this idea of holding it is one of the toughest things to get over and as I mentioned when we had Derek on a moment ago the\nDashed back programs seems to have been the key to getting some of these long time crypto holders are to actually spend some of their crypto in real life\nAnd uh what kind of frustrating things that and and I won't say who it was I was talking to but one of our local crypto advocates and hold it mostly holders went back to holding a after dashed back went down in the amount that dashed back right hang out\nAnd uh the person explained that\nThey just you know didn't think it was worthwhile and I said you know this is also activism when you spend crypto currency if you are an activist if you're somebody who fan sees yourself a libertarian activist\nAnd your crypto currency fanatic or interested in in crypto then you should spend it just because you shouldn't have to wait for an incentive program to come come along if you can afford to tip somebody somewhere\nThen you can afford to tip them encrypted if they're willing to accept you if you could afford to eat out with cash and then you can afford to eat out with crypto now I can understand\nA empty and it is a way the way we get on the radio stations is by marketing to those stations effectively are calling them up and putting advertisements in talkers magazine in their weekly\nOr emails that they send out so you know we've got different ways that we reach out to these stations and that's the reason why we're at a hundred and Ninety radio stations coast to coast so if you appreciate the work that we do here on TALK lived the fact that we're talking about liberty\nOn a nightly basis seven days a week on radio or of course we also on line as well if you want to help us do the you know continue this outreach that we do are we talking about crypto currency we talk about freedom\nAnd please become a free talk like apple fire over it amped up free talk live dot com\nThat's a MP amped up free talk lived dot com\nAnd yes you can do it with bitcoin BTC so you can do credit card you can do pay pal but you can also do you see a and pay five bucks a month and we appreciate it you get some cool perks as well get the full list of your benefits you get\nA over at ... dot ... dot com so we were just talking about some of the frustrations of you know trying to be crypto currency activists and having other purported crypto currency activists\nRefusing to do what I think and I don't want to speak for all of us\nIn this case uh in what is the most critical aspect of ... crypto adoption which is using it right is getting out there and bringing business to the businesses that have actually stepped out and taking that first step into the the unknown and have decided yeah we do want to accept crypto currency here\nSome of our customers have been asking for this so we're going to start taking crypto\nThose businesses should get the unless unless you hate their products unless you have had terrible you know ... they're yeah they should get your business\nAre some things that I just don't like in in you know there are certain types of food I don't like sure so if you do accept crypto then you're still not going to get my business I Do like nothing personal uh but I agree completely um we should be doing that\nAnd that doesn't mean and it becomes easier and easier as time goes on I mean me personally a year ago I would've never imagine that we would have a dentist who would accept crypto yeah I mean not out there I'm going there in February ... uh two years ago I wouldn't have thought that we would have had\nYou know a automotive shop I was taking crypto right um and they've been doing it for two years now\nAnd every you know every month I hear about some new place we've now we hear about a car dealership these things national use in real life and that makes it all very very easy to do\nYeah and I tried thinking back and obviously I wasn't old enough Chris you weren't old enough in you weren't a when credit cards really started to become a thing or you know\nHow we're businesses pitched hey guys I've got this brilliant I did called diners club right those the people are going to come in and they'll just like had your plastic card and I promise that the end of the month you'll get the money right [laughter]\nWell I I can tell you um at least from the from the early seventies point of view um that the businesses were dicey about whether this was any advantage by I remember my father talk to my grandfather and I was very young\nBut going my my Father's Day and people are going to start using this and my grandfather going you know way who's going to pay was a piece of plastic right nobody did it nobody used it but slowly the adoption came and now they're ubiquitous ... tell me about stores that don't accept or some form of credit cards there Ira how you doing there are few\nMetals always beats in Keene New Hampshire just stopped accepting credit cards on October first good for them and that means they take cash and crypto\nYeah and let me tell ya I run a small business a route one on one local goods in Keene New Hampshire and\nI'm faced with this I'm going to lose two and a half to three percent depending on the card used of every single sale that goes on plastic ... whether it's a debit card whether its credit card whether it's American Express and everything else\nThat money is just lost and because we sell things based on consignment\nThose costs are passed on to our our vendors you know our other small businesses that we work with so\nIt's not a positive thing I Would rather have people you got to do it though it seems like it feels like you've got to do it I did a card um because I don't want to turn away business right but what we need to do is keep working to the point where\nYou know at least I'm crypto becomes a viable alternative to them and you know that are cash and I understand completely why they would do that\nI I was listening to a pod cast a couple of days ago and I forget what the charity was but the guy was saying that they're a what a hundred per se that a ... a charity meaning that one hundred percent of what is just donated rice goes to\nHelping villages in Africa get clean water\nWhich means that they will take money out of they've got a specific account for overhead\nAnd they've got you know like a couple of hundred a family is that organizations that donate to cover the overhead\nThey take money from that to cover the credit card fees because they said if somebody donates a hundred dollars through our website we only get like Ninety six Ninety seven dollars so we lose money taking credit cards\nBut because we wanted to do this hundred percent donation bottle\nWe eat those cost and we have to take that from the overhead right and that would be and again I Wish I could remember the name of the organization because I Would love to reach out to him and pitch him here's an alternative whereas right key pondered person that [noise] yeah\nAnd that's a that's attractive for a business owner to be able to keep a hundred percent or charity\nAnd that's why we got to finally we got we actually I'm a charity in India we don't mentioned in the ... that much but a hundred ... a we'll also take your crypto currency and they claim base takes they can take now so\nUh it's it's cool but if if people don't go in and spend the crypto then eventually you're going to have a businesses drop off you're going to have businesses say you know what I thought this was cool but nobody else apparently does so we're done\nAnd that that is something we don't want to see happen so and I know this is like more of like almost an internal conversation because people out there who are crypto fans\nThey can't even relate to spending crypto as we just learned you know earlier today right um these these guys that are on line that love crypto currency they've probably spend it on line on things that go to stay the purse dot com and save on their Amazon purchases or whatever\nBut uh I Would I Would be very interested to know of the you know the people at this conference and maybe maybe we'll ask this question um when 'cause we're doing a a panel discussion and hey\nWho in this conference has ever actually spent but maybe before you came to fortunate that they might have done it here but who who in this Congress before you came to New Hampshire has actually spent crypto currency in real life in physical reality right now where they didn't want to be less than twenty percent of the room\nAt a bed and these are going to be you know hardcore crypto users or critical advocates who are people run encrypted companies um I I just um you know I I Want it to be in a place and\nI Want it to be more of a business which is why we incentivize it at my store you get a discount I give it just ... every single you know you get five percent off everything in my store if you spend crypto\nHold that thought we can continue to come up here we got a full ... hour to go from the any paid on global headquarters here in downtown Portsmouth New Hampshire this is fried sock live [noise]\nAnd I talked today\nLess ... let's talk about down home values in the usa blue jays like you more as a kid I remember\n\nOff every\nYear and the way they\nVoted down and cry\nIn the\nI'm In a\nGood old fashioned comfort dime a dozen genes every stitch

G. U. S. S. E.

S. dollar Gemini just launched one yeah and there's another one elsewhere yeah the the idea is these creators of the stable coin crypto plans um corporate projects are\nTrying to make it easier for people to wrap your head around if if I have\nIf I Know that the critical point is worth of a dollar mhm it is not going to fluctuate wildly up and down then will people be more likely to spend it when they can more easily look at\nYou know the price now to me I look at it as if I were living in Venezuela because I honestly believe that's where the U.S economy is slowly had it not at the speed that they are\nUm but when we are confronted with inflation and the loss of value in your currency than the last thing I Want to be\nPegged to as a sinking ship so it may be sinking very very slowly but I don't want to sing along with it\n[noise] yeah so um I think you're you're spot on with ah with your answer there because\nWhile there is no scarcity among all crypto does cause they can just keep making them the fact is the market only is going to value them what they're actually worse right so you can go right now and create Chris going and going oh there's a website out there that'll make us you can create a theory him token\nCall it Chris Klein ... billion up um if you want to give away half a billion to your uh your girlfriend or what we can do whatever you want with these things but is it going to trade for anything on the\nMarket right probably not as a value maybe zero so darn close to it yeah and and that's where I think the projects that I watch\nAnd in the world of crypto there's two thousand odd projects out there and I probably watch six yeah maybe um because they're offering something that's compelling and has something of value something unique\nYeah yeah well ... and there's a lot of unique ideas a lot of them are kind of crock pot bashore is they're going to be value in the marketplace so\nUm or is it going to be really useful for me to use so those are the questions and that's what I Love about this this week um I mean this was such a great program last year at the a free state digital left and right you spoke last night last year I we're doing a panel this year\nUm but just a you know to meet some of the people that you don't normally get a chance to meet and\nAnd hear what they're thinking so\nI'm like yeah it's a it's great events not too late for you to come out and join us at it because again it hasn't even started yet it starting tomorrow I'm sure pretty early I imagine nine ten I don't have the the schedule pulled up in front of me

crypto currency I feel like we've got a lot of the bases here on this particular show um let's talk about Venezuela because we we touched on it earlier\nOr you're on the show today and I've had a couple of stories and my show prep I mentioned the one about the inflation a number hitting four hundred and eighty eight\nThousand eight hundred and sixty five percent in the last twelve months according to Reuters and uh you know there's not really a whole lot more to this particular story besides the let's see your daily inflation they say is four percent according to a opposition legislator\nA angel Alvarado with monthly inflation rising to two hundred and thirty three percent in September from two hundred and twenty three percent in August and the claim here\nThis is the article saying this in an effort to stabilize prices president Nicolas Maduro cut off five zeros off the ailing boulevard currency\nBoosted the minimum wage by three thousand percent and\nPegged salaries to an elusive state backed crypto currency the ... as you mentioned earlier in the show Darryl that all evidence doesn't actually exist it's so elusive nobody has ever had any proof that they've been able to purchase of Petro\nAround and there are people who have tried right up and again\nHeadline Venezuela mandates passport fees must be paid and Petro\nWe're going to get to all of this and more here on what's going on out in Venezuela where people need crypto to survive there you've got that come up here this is talk live where in Portsmouth New Hampshire at the end he paid ...

Indiana unlike Georgia in Indiana\nThey have a federal court order the N. double ACP league of women voters got a federal court order that Indiana could not use\nThe cross checklist to remove voters\nAnd they were twenty thousand and that's fully these are people moved out of state so we actually checked a with the post office special contract with the post office\nAnd with a two hundred private databases we can confirm that at least twenty thousand of those people who are removed in violation of a federal court order at least twenty thousand and we have each of their names um\nRemoved in violation of the law and that they are still living at their registration dresses in Indiana they've been given no noticed that their purged please people I'm\nA show up at the polls bring ID and we're just gonna have to fight this one out there will be speaking to the lord as soon as I get off the phone\nBut they will be given from provisional ballots that won't be countered\n[noise] uh it's the only thing you can do is fill out a provisional ballot do it but ah we're gonna have to fight to get them counted because they are they're they definitely will not be counted unless we can get another court order saying this violation of a court order um will not stand\nThis is remarkable you know you know the power one person's story Greg is so is so great you know like with the the whole you know these kids who are being detained in the children that the Trump Administration is putting in concentration camps right now this one two year old girl who was in court in New York ... earlier this week\nI'm her story her picture suddenly everybody's like oh my God one through your you know and then it's literally fourteen thousand children you've got twenty thousand voters there in Indiana who you can confirm are actual voters who actually live where they live who are registered to vote I'm guessing that\nThe oil companies\nShould we be putting people in jail should we be hitting them with huge fines I mean people are ... are dying right now people have been dying for decades now but it's really becoming obvious\nThat the behavior of the fossil fuel companies is leading to the death of human beings the damage to democracies around the world\nUm and and you know to the potential destruction of of worldwide civilization what we do Steve in Evanston, Illinois Steve what do you think\nWell you know I wanted to comment on ah the oil companies are I think what will they do is to nationalize them and that way we could do you live with her on a you know how they do business as well we can also promote a more environmentally friendly ways of getting energy um what do you think um\n[noise] I think that uh it's something worth considering and you know Norway did it to Venezuela did it uh that didn't work out so well uh you know but Russia is already nationalize but the you know they're functionally national companies\nI think though that a middle ground is to do what uh Alaska did which is to say you know that while you're pumping out of the ground it really belongs to us and so when you pump that oil you know you can lay claim to the to the to the rigs and to the drilling operation and to the\nThe land around and all that kind of stuff but when you pump that are well you've got to pay a tax to us on every single barrel and then that tax goes into the Alaska permanent fund that produces a a track of anywhere from a thousand to the year that Sarah Palin was running for vice president it was over four thousand dollars per Alaskan citizen per year you know man woman child everybody\nUm and ah you know distribute some of that money back so it functions as a as a very small but very effective carbon tax Alaska so that that's kind of a middle ground although I think that we should establish at much higher but yeah yeah good ideas and do\nThose promote you know people getting on that sugar on getting that little check I I think we're looking to the value that fossil fuel business and you are you know bring up the value of a you know environmentally friendly so it was\nDown in ... and the way it is that is where the carbon tax and Exxon Mobil is supporting that but uh forty dollars a carbon tax is not going to move the needle very much it's going to start the process of preparing for the big companies and and it's going to make renewables much much more attractive Steve thanks for the call a maverick in Edmonds, Washington a maverick what's up\nMourning Tom ... a couple of things real quick is it wrong to refer to that orange chocolate I as a pointed rather than elected uh also why does FDR sounded like he's British\nAnd my other thing I wanted to share with the I think we need a doomsday clock for climate change to bring recognition to the urgency of this problem\nOh that's a good idea of the the uh you've got the doomsday clock for the for the nuclear folks you know for a nuclear war and then you've got the debt clock in in New York City that uh that in fact the guy who funded it for years and years has died but\nUh it's it it lives on a yeah I think that's a great idea maverick thanks a lot for the suggestion Jim in Hamilton, Ohio Jim what's up\nTom I'm referring to showcase the Carolinas a Duke Energy came up with a proposal to use the ways pawns to generate electric I just wonder how that would stay restores pollution and stuff\nYou want him in a a waste bonds from the pig farms\nYes huh\nWhat to to just uh you know a ... bacteria or Saturday as radical on us I\nDon't get what you could draw ... you know and and generate electricity\nYeah they probably could actually in fact each one of these a pig operations can be turned into a little mini power plant I'm\nA ... there was a ranch out there out out west that a ... with a cattle ...\nYeah I I remember that story that was a couple of years ago on it yet but it's possible and that's the kind of thing that people might be start thinking about if we had at three or four hundred dollar a barrel or actually a ton tax on carbon or you know from fossil fuel sources\nOr people to start looking at alternatives and that would be one of my I Would prefer to see all these big operations in North Carolina in fact the biggest one is owned by the Chinese government and a lot of that pork as being shipped back to China and we get the pollution and we get the poison and and you know we get the ... you know the air you know miles and miles being destroyed\nYeah I'd say it's a great idea thanks a lot Jim Scott in Missoula, Montana and Scott what's up\nYeah he's ... I think that we should approach this from from a business perspective since that's something that that the oil industry would understand and\nWe should have a somebody like MIT work up a Manhattan Project for correcting what we've done to the environment and what we're going to do to it and give the oil industry the option of either financing that Manhattan Project or painted a fine that's twice as much you and\nYou know if we're if we're looking right now at destruction just in the United states you look at the wildfires in California you look at the the hurricanes and and storm damage and and\nTornadoes for that matter across the the mid west\nI mean we've for example a couple of years ago we saw our first mile wide tornado I think it was an Oklahoma first one of the history of the United states never before and we've seen a mile wide tornado these are these extreme weather I mean we've always had extreme weather events but the extreme\nYou know ... times do her magnitude is the consequence of\nClimate change so right now you could argue that the fossil fuel industry the Koch brothers all their bodies and the and the fossil fuel barons Murray energy and all these other guys that that they really should be on the hook for hundreds of billions of dollars in preparations\nThat in fact arguably the insurance companies can be the ones suing now and I'm you know Frank frankly I'm surprised that they haven't started it but yeah yeah it's I you know we we have to make it in and just incredibly uncomfortable and expensive for these guys and we've got to do it right away\nJake up in Baltimore, Maryland hey Jacob what's up\nBaytown thanks for taking my call 'em\nIn terms of what we should do with the fossil fuel industry I mean I tend to agree with you that we need to do whatever is going to move faster I\nThink personally that if we let them go back in the long run it's going to be a multi decade challenged the not actually holding them accountable and ended up having some long term negative consequences but\nI Want to re emphasize I really want to thank you for talking about this issue because this is a quality to be different issue than every other political ones that we have with possible exception of nuclear war\nIn that we can hear in every single other progressive issue out there for a minimum wage to equal pay protection to minority right across the board and we don't do this one does ... all the spirit victory that will end up evaporating in front of us\nAgree and I think this conversation that we're having right now is the one should be the main conversation that the corporate media is having\nAbsolutely I mean I think to people to\nYear and this one this is this the moment\nTo have more the second most important thing coming up in human history what are you going to be spending your time on her you're in the most important that you can comment\nVery well says Jacob thanks a lot for the call and thanks for washing up we'll be back with ... Benjamin and we're gonna be talking to Saudi Arabia red brick fifty seven minutes thirty seconds desperate\nBest there\nYou are listening to Tom\n... dot com was the first place you could buy custom window treatments on line and because of that pain that what they're doing they've been doing this for over Twenty years and I've covered over two million windows and know exactly how to get you the right blinds at the right price they make it easy they made it easy for me to go in and order\nAnd it was a breeze it will be for you to fly in school or as products are hand built from scratch delivered writing\nThe door and created just for your windows\nTheir aspartame as happy to help you every step of the way either online\nOr over the phone plus they have the industry is best guarantee if you don't like your custom lines are shades for any reason wrong color you measured wrong you don't like the style you can exchange it for another covering for free ... set you up with Fifteen free samples and free shipping on top of the free expertise it doesn't get any better than that\nAnd to get to the bottom of this and holds those who are responsible accountable\nYeah yeah absolutely very well ... thank you very much for the update and uh you know on we go thank you so much for being with us today\nThank you so much by\nTalking with it so we've got that that that's going on a number one this this whole situation with Saudi Arabia\nA number two is a bunch of things I Want to get to hear today uh the last hour we've been talking with Greg palace was just with us and he was going through how a a over five hundred thousand people if I'm remembering correctly it'll be up on YouTube of by the end of the day\nI'm over five hundred thousand people have been purged from the voting rolls in Indiana and Indiana's under court order not to use the cross check list from from a Kris Kobach\nBut when grand and got the purge was he found that there were twenty six thousand people in Indiana who have been purged from the cross check list and he was able by comparing that list of people with the with the postal service\nTo find that at least twenty thousand of those twenty six thousand people have been Persian Indiana from the voting rolls actually easily demonstrably live in Indiana and our insurance there'll be registered to vote and virtually all of them were up near Gary Indiana largely black community\nSurprise surprise so the ... are rolling on a is and you can see if you're in Indiana and you know anybody in Indiana and you want to see if you've been purged yesterday was the ... the deadline to re register you know the Republicans are really playing this game aren't they yesterday was the deadline to register but\nYou may still have some uh there may be something that you can do that I go to Greg palace P. A. L. E. S. T. Greg palace dot com and ah you know you plug your name in and see if you've been purged from the voting role there in Indiana or in Georgia for that matter\nIt's amazing it's just amazing what's going on [noise] uh\nAnd uh the main topic of our ... of the hour that we just finished I Want to get back\nTo it also is an Exxon Mobile now we've got the BCC coming out and saying if we don't cut fossil fuel usage massively we're talking like a forty percent reduction in fossil fuel usage and within twelve years\nAnd take call from being about eight percent of all electricity produced in the world down to about one percent of all they're supposed to be but if we don't do that next twelve years we're screwed\nWe're going to see civilization threatening the weather now I Would submit to you that we have been seen civilization threatening weather for two decades now that when the when the\nWhen the desert move south in Syria and Libya in Egypt\nOr you know across the art of Africa across Northern Africa as the as the as climate change expanded these deserts\nThe farmers who used to farm on the edge of the desert land who's farms were turned into desert\nMoved into the big cities and created these\nA migrant crisis crises and then of course we took down coffee in Libya which you know in retrospect was a pretty stupid thing to do\nAnd and ah and millions of these people I mean literally millions of these people have flooded it from from all over Northern Africa flooding into Libya because you can get a boat and Libya and get across the Mediterranean to the southern parts of Europe to Greece and Italy and and\nThen you know the refugees go from there up into the all the way up to Germany and Sweden where they are coming in and numbers that are too fast and too large to be reasonably assimilated which is producing all these right wing backlash which is tearing apart the democracies of Europe\nHungary has already fallen Poland has already fallen a you know or Spain is on the edge I mean there's just a Italy's on the edge there's a bunch of countries that are\nJust you know ... this is how toxic climate changes to democracy itself\nAnd we're seeing you know the destruction of climate change here in the United states trillions of dollars worth of damage being done by storms that have been amped up by climate change\nFrom mile wide tornadoes across Oklahoma to this cat for hurricane that\nAs we speak right now is hitting the panhandle of Florida is going to kill people it's going to destroy property is going to wipe out people's possessions everything that they've saved for all their lives all their pictures all their letters all their everything it's gonna wipe out people's lives in a way that is just about unimaginable\nThe same thing that just happened in California where the wild fires\nAnd we're not hearing these people's stories the media doesn't want to talk to these people about you know oh what happened to your home because of what Exxon Mobil has been up to because of the climate change denialism that the Koch brothers and other right wing fossil fuel billionaires have been promoting for years and years and years\nAnd so the question I'm asking and I put this out in the last hour I've I've still got a whole born full of callers we will pick you up after the after the break down but\nThe question I'm asking is Exxon Mobil is saying now we will support a forty dollar carbon tax in exchange for a limitation liability\nAnd they're looking at what happened to the asbestos industry that got nailed for for a line from the ... they ... the the especially this industry in Nineteen thirty five is the first serious science was published on this\nThe the substance to kill my father\nWorked in a tool and die shop and it was less exposed to us ... throughout his life the the industry\nThat killed my dad knew in Nineteen thirty five at a spouse was poisonous and it wasn't until the Nineteen nineties that they got nailed for it and they had a number of these companies went bankrupt they're out of business they're gone\nSimilarly the tobacco industry they knew back probably in the thirties also there but it became obvious in the sixties\nThat their product was killing their customers to the tune of a half million Americans we're\nPretty damn hard thing to cover up and the tobacco industry now might happen tonia leading one of those lawsuits\nAnd the tobacco industry has gone from being one of the most powerful industries in the United states the most powerful lobby in the late Nineteen Ninety ... nothing now\nI mean they still have some powerful influence but not not nothing close to what they had\nAnd so now the fossil fuel industry is looking at that go on and we don't want to be like asbestos or tobacco\nWe want a waiver of liability right from the get go\nWe want basically what the drug company has got on vaccines that are there the federal government set up this a fund that has now paid over three billion dollars to people who whose children or themselves have been harmed by vaccines\nComplete waiver of liability it's why the vaccine industries cranking out all kinds of new vaccines for really diseases that people very rarely get\nBecause there's absolutely no liability\nNobody goes to jail nobody gets find no penalties no matter what\nI saw fuel industry wants the same thing and in exchange for that they will support a carbon tax and I'm Wondering if we should give it to them\nIn the interest of climate change sort of like the truth and reconciliation commission in South Africa say to these companies\nGot brothers Koch Industries Exxon Mobil and Chevron\nYou guys at MIT what you've been doing\nConfessed year since just like the clerk did in South Africa tell us what happened\nLay it up give us the names of the politicians that you bought and how much money you gave them\nConfess at all\nAnd we will not hold you liable\nBut we are going to have and not a little forty dollar ... carbon tax we're in a sort of two hundred dollars a ton of time for a carbon tax right now\nYes okay now I can talk a okay I've been working for years now for oil and gas industry are my parking designer so I Do I Do I Do the dishonest with plants one of the big problems so we got mold is should the poor people\nIn the mid west that's how he he's your house natural gas prices how you cook the food is actual gas or oil ... ... ... your bill in concrete blocks for books that we were just\nPure doing dumb but we don't we don't factory work she cost you anything we can check natural gas at the gas string quarter of the ... but like where I'm working right now\nAre the healing process where they treat it puts out tons of snow to math and of course is part of a component natural gas which is\nWhat gets the imagery started as a you know\nIt's actually a marine park so there needs to be more incentive for for a man thing controls\nAre you are you arguing dated for a carbon tax\nOr a carbon tax in more detail but it's going to take the massive more it's going to take more mastery of that I think anybody is considering because unless you're going to leave the poor\nIn with cold and not being able to cook because when they start raising the price of natural gas well they can't afford to\nWell what kind of model hand just saying what Exxon Mobil is suggesting is that a hundred percent of that carbon tax would really related to consumers\nJob\nOf American family in the middle of the\nDirector on ... street two blocks north of Syria or make the tractor dot com\nThat's why you need a trade off to the next year I'm telling you won't believe the difference until you feel the difference why ... is the most stylish sure I've ever owned it gives me a deal posture which means more energy better concentration and more productivity than I ever thought possible\nI Love my extra and you will to here's a special deal just for a huge is Phyllis ... program\nRight now for ... Todd Hartman program the extras on sale for a hundred dollars off so called eight for for for X chair or go to ... chair Tom T. H. O. M. X. chair Tom dot com now to say that a hundred dollars and if you use the coupon code Tom ...\nThey'll even throw in a free foot rest\nSo go to ... chair Tom dot com that's ex chair\nTom dot comical aid for for for ... and his ... just before ... which\nAre media news find out what's going on in the world today this report brought you by goats for the old goat dot com\nAnd ... and do new book by Ellen ... on the line with us is the old goat herself as she broadly calls herself on fire and they'll go oh we are the same age Ellen so I cringe a little bit when I say to that but hey I'm an old go to okay what's up [noise] okay\nSo now we have hurricane Michael which is you know we're getting the ... the Florida Panhandle has now it's very interesting category fine storms are a hundred and fifty seven miles per hour this is a hundred fifty miles per hour so it's only seven miles\nPer hour less than what a category five would be and just by the way Hurricane Katrina which I participated in afterwards in two thousand five was actually a A R a category five so it was really really bad\nUm and they're saying it's too late for people to get out but anyway it is what it is and it's going to cause\nEnormous problems honestly in terms of electricity et cetera now also I'm Mr Bloomberg former mayor of New York city who was a Republican was an independent he's registered as a Democrat and he's also given twenty million ... million dollars\nTo the Democratic party now I think he's running for president because he has not been very complimentary to Donald Trump I agree I think that he is clearly running for president but yet\nYeah he's good I mean there's a billionaire in the White House right now Bloomberg is looking at that go on whom first billion or I could be the second oh I\nI I don't think he has a chance but I think that either I think he has a big chance he has a chance right\nYou know I always say senator looks in the mirror and they see the ... in the United states\nI exactly I I think that probably what he should be doing or thinking about doing his primary Mario Cuomo next time around but you know what do I know I don't live in New York so\nNow there was a recent study that says that millennials are not going to primary care doctors are going to the urgent care places because they don't want to wait around\nSo there are seen very quickly urgent care places and so they're not going to primary doctor's ... also the president by the way I had his people speak to the Saudis they urge them to be transparent about this killing in Turkey a but\nI'm On I ... for your information I'm On the American advisory board of reporters Without Borders she and we have said that there are over ... bloggers and journalists who have not been heard from we have no idea what happened to them who are Saudi Arabia\n[noise] wow so this might not be the only ... the alleged killing right now but if if it is true I might not be the only only journalist who has been killed by the Saudis\nNow of course it's interesting it's turkey which is not exactly terrific towards journalists [laughter] you know\nAir to one has his own problems but I think he's just feels about the sovereignty issue I mean this was not an an embassy this was a consulate consulates are not ... not Saudi land and turkey has the right to go in and and do whatever they want their I don't know about the ambassador's residence do you know if that's considered\nA you know I don't know the law I mean I really don't know the Turkish law or the international law in there um and I cover the United nations should know but I doubt\nUm okay uh Israel said that they are going to continue their operations in Syria they don't care that Russia has missiles there are very concerned about it and they're going to continue on\nTheir operation also Senator Rand Paul remember him he is now saying that he's worried that there's going to be an assassination that he's very concerned about violence or that or even if it passes people express their opinions one of those thousand people could possibly go after somebody\nWait a minute he was already been violence I mean you know the right wing or is killing Heather Heyer higher already a you know how many how many more people is Rand fall afraid that the right where's it going to kill\nWell I guess they're coming after his family I don't know\nOh you know I Know these these poor pathetic Republicans snowflakes you know they they looking at Maxine water and they go home like black people and and then Fox goes hyperbolic on all this and\nHow you know what's really interesting\nIs that may in California they take away children from black families who are using cocaine arm as some other ... but they don't do it with white family really yeah I'm just investigating\nThat as we saw me send me a link on that story I I Will\nWell there is no link yet but wait 'til I ride a pack okay I'm now ... also what's very interesting stat Canada is now going\nTo probably legalize marijuana they said basically that they want the taxes and so they're going to legalize it people are smoking it anyhow so why not get the tax\nYeah I I thought they'd already legalized but it just hadn't taken effect yet it was supposed to take effect well they're actually alive\nAnd yeah I think they have and it it happens in November December but the fact is is that they want to collect taxes which is why they're doing it sure now I Know Donald Trump wrote an op ed in USA Today\nAnd all I Know I I'm Marcus all up I was going to do a major rant about the third over the last scene is criminal one day you know what Trump is set in USA Today and there are other promoting it on Twitter I re tweeted the u._s._a. today thing and said you know why is this company that you know allowing Donald Trump to publish lies in the newspaper\n[noise] well I think that because there are certain people that are able to connect with the news media and get it in the news media\nYeah the Trump in this in this article you said that the Democrats water destroyed Medicare and Medicaid and defense ugly\nAlso said he said\nThe truth is the Democratic party yeah can you imagine yeah and he called it\nThe the party of open border I mean just when I was just lie after lie after lie I as I said I Will be ranting about this in the neck so here you ran Allen's always great talking with you thanks so much on reading him thank you and it was hard media news author\nOf a lot of what you\nWill be back with more of the news that\n\nYou're listening Tom\nHi I'm Randy and this is Dave where the founders of bumpers makers of the most comfortable socks and the history of feet so comfortable we've sold them donated over eight million pairs\nYes donated why we learned that socks and the number one most requested clothing either been homeless shelters so we started bomb us with the mission to donating a pair of socks for every pair we sell to donate and so a lot of socks we became obsessed with comfort we reinvented the sock from the ground up using to\nBest materials available like this office in most comfortable caught and getting rid of what wasn't working like that annoying co seem you can probably feel if you wiggle your toes right now and inventing a few new comfort innovations along the way like our support that feels like a hug around your mid foot\nMedicare for all would not stop Medicare for seniors it's just a lie\nDonald Trump ally in USA Today in the first sentence\nBending it was a dishonest like called Medicare for all the Democratic proposal would establish a government run single payer healthcare system\nThat eliminates all private an employer based health care plans would cost ... thirty two point six trillion dollars during his first ten years well that's sort of a lie right first of all wouldn't eliminate and then I Would simply make unnecessary\nPrivate for profit health insurance number one and number two yeah it's going to cost thirty ... thirty two trillion dollars right now are paying thirty eight trillion some\nSome say the over the next ten years we're going to pay as much as forty seven trillion\nBut according to the Koch brothers study we're we're we're right now paying thirty a trillion and yet Medicare for all would only costs thirty two trillion but in the Trump says it will cost us ...\nAs a candidate I promised that we would protect coverage for parents for patients with preexisting conditions and create new health insurance options that would lower premiums I've kept that promise and we're now seeing health insurance premiums going down\nRight the ones that are coming down and the ones that don't cover pre existing conditions there these emergency plans that are good for only three months that Trump wants to extend the three years\nAnd they're cheaper because they don't cover your pre existing conditions\nSo here you know it's a lie within ally\nIn the third sense of the article\nHe continues I've also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare\nThat is why I'm fighting so hard against the Democrats plan that would eviscerate\nNow that word proves to you that Donald Trump didn't write this there would have ... Medicare\nDemocrats are already harm seniors by slashing Medicare by more than a hundred billion dollars over ten years to pay for Obamacare this is another lie I mean there's been so thoroughly bucked yeah there was a transfer of ... it was actually seven hundred billion dollars in the Obamacare you know moving Medicare funds from one category to another\nBut not a penny of that came out of the pocket of anybody what it did was it extended the lifespan and the Medicare program is strengthen Medicare\nIt was an accounting change but the Republicans like the Y. constantly and here's Trump wine\nLikewise Democrats would gutting Medicare with their plan government takeover American health care not true\nIt would create a Medicare for all plant just like Canada has just like Denmark has just like England ... well actually England is is a if socialized medicine you know the ... the hospital's the doctors work for the government\nNobody is even proposing that the United states\nIt would give us a plan more like France or Germany or Denmark or Holland or\nNorway or ... or you know pick your country right Greece Spain\nHe continues the Democrats' plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice seniors would no longer be able to depend on the ... benefits they were promised to complain why\nIt's just a plain old ball face like why the hell is USA Today publishing this stuff\nBy eliminating Medicare is a program for seniors which nobody is proposing\nBy eliminating Medicare is a program for seniors an outline the ability of Americans to enroll in private employer but he's plans another line nobody is proposing outline in in the Democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of healthcare you think you don't have rationing health care right now\nWhat was the last time you try to get your ... you know be just go to the pharmacy and you know for example\nAh my wife takes one medication for you know armor for a thyroid for she's had a ... for ever since our third child was born it's a common thing with women who ... you know the birth of children's sucks all the I I Know the thyroid apparently and she's been taking this this form of this kind of natural form of fiery medication\nNo the insurance company says you must take since right is cheaper\nDoesn't work as well for I mean someone that it works great for some people it works great for others and does\nAnd she says no this is what my doctor prescribed an insurance company says not where I got paid for it\nSo we're paying a hundred and forty bucks a month out of pocket\nI mean it's nuts right you think you don't have rationing right now\nDoctors not backed Donald Trump doctors and hospitals would be put on a business no they wouldn't be they would have unpredictable ... it's another line from Trump seniors would love to lose access to their favorite doctors another why\nThere would be long waiting in line for appointments and procedures you don't have long waiting lines right now\nHave you tried to see a specialist recently or for that matter a general practitioner in a hurry\nPreviously covering care would effectively be denied another why these are just literally lives in practice Donald Trump writes in today's USA Today\nUSA Today publishes and tweets out two or three point six million people in practice the Democratic party's so called Medicare for all plan would really be Medicare for not under the Democrats' plans today is Medicare would be forced to die\nYou know today's Medicare would become part of a plan that covers all Americans and by the way we'd like to get rid of that you know that whole at twenty percent hole that you have to have you know private insurance to fill let's get rid of that to the Democrats' plan what to do also\nMainly hand of choice for seniors over their own healthcare decisions instead Democrats give total power and control over seniors healthcare decisions the bureaucrats in Washington DC yeah I Would much rather have the bureaucrats in Washington DC who answered the politicians dialect\nMaking the decisions about what gets paid for and what doesn't then\nStephen J Hemsley who runs United healthcare it was taken over a billion dollars in compensation from that company by saying to me when I Do not helped her insurance no we're not going to cover that drug we're not going to cover that procedure\nIt continues the first thing a democratic plan will do is end the choice and choice for seniors is eliminate Medicare Advantage plans for about twenty million seniors as well as limited other private health plans the seniors currently is to supplement their Medicare coverage right\nBecause you don't need it anymore we're going to have comprehensive Medicare that covers everything for everybody you know like like in other countries where it actually coverage dental and eye care as well\nNext the Democrats would eliminate every American private employer based health plan thank God\nIt's right there on their proposed legislation Democrats outlaw private health plans that offer the same benefits as a government plan okay that's fine with me\nAre Americans might think there's such an extreme anti senior anti choice anti consumer proposal for government run health care and find little support among Democrats unfortunately there would be wrong or a hundred and twenty three Democrats allows representatives sixty four percent of House Democrats as well as Fifteen Democrats in the Senate have already co sponsored this legislation thank God\nIt's one triple A.
