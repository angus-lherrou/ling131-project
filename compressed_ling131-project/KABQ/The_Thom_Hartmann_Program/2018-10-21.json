documents to determine that quote ethnicities not a factor in Elizabeth Warren's rise in law\nOr any Lenski welcome to democracy now you did an extensive investigation on can you talk about what led up to the\nSenator Warren's release of the video and the DNA test on Monday but first talked about what you found out all the people that you interviewed a what the allegations are and um what people said to you\nHow to shore happy to um [noise] so you know at the Boston Globe um we had\nBeen asking for um for years for six years really for Elizabeth Warren to really is her personnel records really from Harvard University of Pennsylvania where she's been a law professor um and the reason that we are so eager to look at these files is there's been this long running allegation against her\nThat she um kept the box and used her Native American\nHistory as a as a reason to um to get ahead and so that's always been the allegation and the reason for it is a back I think it was in Ninety or actually the eighty seven when she was at the University of Texas in the ... the professor she started calling herself\nI'm a minority lifting herself as a minority in the ... century\nWhen the very next year she gets this really big job at a at a law professor at an Ivy League institution\nAnd so the idea was oh my goodness the moment she identifies herself as a minority professionally that's when this big promotion comes and then a few few years later she goes on to an even bigger institution to harbor\nSo we went back and we looked at as many documents as we could find and um to to find out I mean what was there some correlation there because on the face of it it looks like there couldn't be\nUm but when you look at you know starting with the University of Pennsylvania um we were able to find a document and never before been reported it was a ten page\nEqual opportunity memo that the University of Pennsylvania or had to fill out when they hired war and\nAnd they had to fill it out because they were ... they saw themselves as hiring a white woman and so they they had to you know and of course are ten pages go through this giant pool of applicants that they had looked at for this position break them down by Sachs by minority in the number of black\nApplicants a number of Asian applicants the number of Native American\nApplicants and then say look after looking at all of these people we ended up hiring a white woman Elizabeth Warren and um because we could not find an equal or better minority for the job and that that is quoted in the report and\nAllow them to not hire other Native Americans because they had one is that true is that what you learned\nI think that's where it gets problematic for her I mean that has not been a criticism that's been leveled I think when she was going into a Democratic primary I'm with a you know Cory Booker Kamala Harris and with a very diverse electorate and the Democratic party she's gonna have to have a very good answer for that\nUm when I asked her about when I asked her that very question she says that she knows she did it was doing a lot of work to promote women and to promote minority hires but I think that that is where it becomes more problematic to for her because her\n... allowing Harvard in particular to use her um do you use it and that's what they claim I'm you know if you look at the statistics they they were they were arguing internally oh we're doing much better um with minority status than\nYou know than than our own measurements want us to be doing and so sort of internally they were saying oh we're doing fine externally Harvard was still saying we need to we need to do better for the most part [laughter] so yeah I mean that is I think that as an area that that's going to be really complicated\nFinally any Lenski you've been speaking to a Senator Warren ah ah after she released the a DNA test and the video\nAnd you've spoken to her husband Bruce men about the effects of what this has meant a and you've covered the response to the release of the DNA test yeah\nYeah yeah and I have and it's that's has been a fascinating um the day is really um I you know it was I'm a big surprise I think to many people that Elizabeth Warren was willing to kind of undergo this DNA test and and do it and put the result out there\nUm I think it's a little early to know what the impact of it's going to be on her political future but I also think I mean\nShe is a bit of her rained and questioned on this for more than a year and her approach to this is quite different than say Hillary Clinton I mean her idea is like well I'm I I took the test well it does actually show that this is the first proof\nThat she has been able to produce that they're her family stories were true and that there was\nNative American ancestry and her family um so you know this is the first time in six years there's been something beyond you know a family lore to rely on and put this claim although that credit because they're saying my goodness it's so far far far far back does it really count\n'em and so people have to make that\nThat decision for themselves um I just I Know that this is one of those questions every time I write about Elizabeth Warren I get I Would get so many emails about why does she just take a DNA test I mean ... you know they ... they would be\nUm come across the board it didn't feel like the sort of normal um you know offer them generate a type of emails they would just be from\nA regular people I got so many from one story I actually had to create like a forum email to respond to them all so my guess is that she was getting in a similar amount of questions for my constituents and I guess this is the way that she decided to deal with it which is very different from\nHow a lot of candidates woods and we'll see how whether it was wise or not\nBut it seems very quickly that she has a maybe for other reasons expressed regret about her decision on releasing be taking the DNA testing releasing it saying I Wish I had been more mindful of the distinction between heritage and tribal citizenship\nIs it your sense that she has been a regretful for this reason\nNo I mean I I don't think she regrets\nDoing the same I have no indication that that that's the case at all I mean I think what she regrets is\nMy sense wouldn't be that she regrets calling herself Native American at Harvard at Penn I mean I think that's where her\nUm she has learned a lot more about ethnicity and about how ... tribal membership works and how a family story is at the same as\nUm you know having the experience of being a member of a tried but I you know ... the idea that she robots doing a DNA test I I have not heard that from anyone\nAny length scale and thank you for being with us Washington DC deputy bureau chief for the Boston Globe will ensure peace ethnicity is not a factor in Elizabeth Warren's rise and law after Brinkley host a roundtable discussion

Native American ancestry she's come under fire since releasing the DNA tests showing Native American lineage and her family tree in a video released Monday she told her family's story\nMy mother was born in the eastern Oklahoma\nIndian Territory until just a few years earlier when did you become\nDaddy own head over heels and mom and my mother\nOr\nMy daddy's parents herrings bitterly they're married my mother read was part Native American\nJust sort of discrimination was common to time\nSo when my mom always Nineteen and my daddy was when they look\nElizabeth Warren has said her mother told her family had ties to the Cherokee and Delaware tribes but Native Americans across the country are criticizing wise decision to use a DNA test her heritage jak costs in junior\nSexy upstate for the Cherokee Nation said quote sovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA test can be used to determine lineage\nSuch as paternity to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliation using\nThe DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nCome are we hosted roundtable discussion joining us from Fargo North Dakota is Tara house a national campaign director for honor the earth she's no ... lawyer\nAnd we go to Anchorage, Alaska where we're joined by mark ...\nWho is editor of Indian country today a member of the ... tribes in Seattle, Washington we're joined by Jesse Ross author speaker lawyer and storyteller member of the black seat nation hosts the podcast break dances with wolves welcome you all to democracy now\nLet's go to North Dakota I'm too tired how SCA if you can respond first to I'm a Senator Warren releasing her DNA test indicating Native American lineage and her video and your thoughts on this\nWhat I see are\nSome non native folks arguing over what native identity is I'm a native people just being in almost entirely left out of the conversation I'm so we saw that Lindsey Graham now is running around and saying you know the I have more Indian blood than she does I should open a casino it kind of shows just how problematic\nI'm senator warns decision to use this DNA tests as her smoking gun now see a native I thought I was um when in fact you know common genetic markers and geographic location does not tell you anything about you know which tribe you might be a part of or\nThat you might have this tendency from she couldn't actually locate an ancestor I'm having done a genealogy study who is a native person\nUm it's kind of this one drop rule that she is reinforcing all these you know understandings of race being something by blood and they're being the difference between um different ethnicities\nSenator Warren in her own words in that video that she released on Monday talking about her Native American heritage\nNot enrolled in a tribe only trying to determine tribal citizenship and I understand members that and\nMy family history is my family and\nSo that's a Elizabeth Warren ... can you respond to that and also explain how is it a a that Native American tribes determine a membership\nYeah you know I think she's kind of walking back her words because she got this really her statement by turkey nation who are saying you know this is really disrespectful and has nothing to do with um\nInto a three ring circus in which non natives and specifically white people by the way\nI feel completely emboldened to to posit their opinions and actually challenged native people about native ancestry Elizabeth Warren and Donald Trump both open that door and so I Believe that both of them should donate a million dollars to the national Indian women's resource center\nAnd um you know because both of them helped create the spectacle and both of them have an obligation to native women I Believe\nWe're going to break and then come back to the discussion or where talking to\nA Jesse Ross author lawyer in Denver a black feet nation speaking to us from Seattle, Washington powerhouse gun with honor the earth Ojibwe lawyer speaking to us from Fargo North Dakota and mark

few\n\n\nChanted ... by the group ... says democracy now I mean he couldn't win their means shape\nWe and today's show looking at the record number of Native American women running for office in the mid term elections there has never been a Native American woman Congress member this yet there are at least for indigenous women running for Congress three are running for governor and so he won a running for seats in the state legislature\nStill with us mark ... editor of Indian country today member of the show named ... tribes also with us in Fargo North Dakota ...\nHouse and national campaign director for honor the earth Ojibwe from the coaching first nation in Seattle, Washington we're joined by Jesse ... author speaker lawyer storyteller member of black seat nation has to the podcast break dances with wolves\nMarc let's go to you in Alaska you've been writing a lot about this in Indian country today about the record number of native women who are running\nFor office in the United states\nIs just this week uh history was made when a Valerie Davidson became the lieutenant governor of Alaska the first date of American Woman to hold out office than any state in the country\nAh she's ... she's one of four other a native women running for lieutenant governor across the country in fact in Minnesota no matter what happens it'll be a ... boy woman who will be the next lieutenant governor of Minnesota red legged mission for the Republicans and daughter Bergstrom\nAnd Peggy Flanagan for the DFL in Minnesota so she's ... so this idea of just this year everything is just lit up a candidate\nA decided this was a time to round up hall is a great example um even though it's because of she said in her announcement because of that Iraq and because of Donald Trump\nThere's also this long arc of she's been working at this for Twenty years and she was built to resume this ready for this job and that's part of the case and the story if you look around the countries are so many women who are prepared and this is the moment they choose to run\nSo could you talk about the contacts you said a ... being in office has something to do with it but how is it that that Native American women organized a to run in this election\nWell definitely the administration has policies was a motivating force particularly the policies that gives women\nUh this one of the great stories is how the Native American women candidates have created this network of early on um I started reading about this I use the outside she representatives and a very soon after that uh the\nFashion designer Bethany yellow tail decided to make sure she calls she represents and list all of the Native American women running for office they formed an informal network they reach out to each other they support each other that help fund raise a Sharif said was a ended up all the time to him to gather boats and Kansas\nA policy Jordan was at um [noise] a ... a ... campaign the night of the primary win and making calls for knocking on doors the network they've created maybe the most lasting institution out of this whole election\nScott can you talk about what's happening in Minnesota and in Minnesota um you have a situation\nWhere no matter who wins on will be a Native American woman I'm we're talking about um the state representative penny Flanagan versus Republican uh John Bergstrom both running for lieutenant governor\n[noise] yeah you know that's been frustrating part I Would say about this whole Warren debacle and like the the concept of native identity being played out by two white folks um is that there is this historic\nYou know I'm representation of native women running across the country there's also you know the um the Indian child welfare act coming under coming under fire and the very core of federal Indian lobbying put into question by that\nUm there's the by and large pipeline in Minnesota where we're looking at you know to potential native women are going to hold the lieutenant governor said\nYou know at the same time we're looking at a a you know massive resistance of indigenous people um that his building against the line three project emerges Landry tar sands project that's actually where I'm coming from today um so you know we're\nSticking lane that while laying them para\nIndigenous representation I'm at the same time the that we're trying to hold back the worst of what's happening\nExplained that you're deeply involved with pipeline politics whether we're talking about the Dakota access pipeline or whether we're talking about the current battle that you just mentioned\n[noise] yeah you know I think that native people as people who are still very connected to the land to the water are you know taking these leadership roles and fights all over the country and all around the world\nUm to protect the existing resources to protect the existing water resources for us all\nUm you know as I say to climate change raging around us um we're trying to protect the last of what's what's still remaining to us and protect our communities and protect those um around us for the next generation so as that's happening it's also in tandem with this with those rising up of women\nUm and particularly women of color and see representation but hopefully you know we can get a a good balance between the two so we're able to all serve hired as climate change is the greatest problem facing this world\nAnd ... um how important is that women were also leading the battle against the Dakota access pipeline and inspiring winning a you're in a North Dakota right now I wanted to talk about the Supreme Court I'm In North Dakota I'm and also indigenous activists\nFighting a daily battle in the swamp plan to Louisiana against the bayou bridge pipeline the one sixty three mile pipeline being built by energy transfer partners the same company behind the apple um water protectors have repeatedly been arrested for protesting and face felony\nCharges under harsh new anti protest law signed by Louisiana's governor earlier this year pipeline construction scheduled to end before the new year\nI think that women as we've seen with the me too movement really building and we've seen the women's march and we've seen women being the backbone of so many different movements basis including um you know indigenous\nA resistance against these extractive industry projects um it's women taking on this role of leadership that's sorely sorely needed\nIt's women record recognizing that missing murdered indigenous women as an epidemic across this country across the across Canada\nUm that these can be directly that these ... cases of ah women can be directly tied to the extracted extractive industry\nUm and also sitting here in North Dakota where I Know there's many women organizers rushing to try to get people I'm home address is that they can actually participate in the election\nYou know the very notion of indigenous people not being able to participate in the election of a country that started after\nUm our nation's existed you know it's women taking on so many different roles and I think it's something that is really really needed in this time it's very critical time of potentially are very survival I'm being called into question with the latest reports of what's happening and we're we're out with climate change\nAnd Jesse must could you also comment on that issue the issue of of voter ID laws that\nCould potentially a restrict uh the the participation of Native Americans and the upcoming elections\n\nI think that you know to me um you know spoke about the Germany\n\n[noise] journalists killing mid term elections I mean case through European powers want more information from Saudi Arabia over the killing of a journalist Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina tells thoughts as Sunday Morning futures that the kingdom needs to be held accountable\nHe was clearly a murder and in a conflict things like that don't happen in Saudi Arabia without paying for the top knowing we'll find out more I like the president's measured response I liked the idea and he wants to consult with Congress about what to do\nThere are an ally but they need us more than we need them\nCampaigning is in full swing across the country with the mid term elections just over two weeks away corresponded David challenges the new CNN survey shows that in the Florida governor's race the Democratic candidate is in\nThe lead in a new poll conducted by us as far as in the gubernatorial contest between Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum and Florida Congressman Ron dissent is we are showing among likely voters eight twelve point advantage for Gillum fifty four percent to forty two percent\nSo what do we have here racist\nI mean just just stark naked pure racism\nAntonia a ... fires on is asking the question\nAre we going to kill with this stuff\nYou know there's the story of of uh out of Michigan\nWhere are the ... of young man mark people's he lived in he lives in Detroit\nAnd there was a a a vacant lot across the street from his house and he turned it into a garden\nBut there's some white people three white women who live in the neighborhood\nAnd they end up in one of them Deborah Nash has called the police on him dozens of times for gardening while black\nAnd Michigan judge yesterday tossed out is she actually filed charges against him for stalking her because he was gardening while black\nAnd the judge not only toss out the charges but said the Deborah Nash the woman who called the police Mr people's um our peoples that she should face the same charges\nNow it's going to be up to you know up to people to see if he's gonna you know\nYou know at the same time we get these these just absolutely obscene ads\nYou know I I think I have I have lost that one I had I had an ad that I was going to play for you but um you know it's I I apparently have closed the tab um\nBut yeah you see a net you've got one uh this is well this isn't about race this is Phyllis hold off on that one that that's a Rick Scott\n[noise] but ah [noise] the there is\nThere is this ad playing\nRight now where it's like basically these these\nOU holdings Ronald Reagan while out of that habit than ... from his house so we don't turn it into a guardian very much for the community now that's\nThat's a yeah that that in any case the the uh [noise]\nSo they're they're asking the question\nGolf cart Gail permit Patty barbecue Becky this all started with barbecue Becky Becky kind of a you know the coolest white girl right a barbecue Becky the cornerstone Caroline or these names too cute\nThese people are racists\nAnd if the names are too cute than what should we be calling these largely white women who are calling police on mostly at well sometimes African American women sometimes every and we're in some cases kids you know do you have a permit for that the lemonade stand that was permit Patty\nBut this this is the the the the the ends of the key\nTo the Republicans electro strategy I mean is this is the this is Stephen Miller on steroids right Steven Miller's third grade teacher calls him a strange dude who ate and glue Mickey Fisk she taught and twenty five years ago\nShe says you remember that character and peanut someone called pink panther the dust cloud flying around him that was Stephen Miller at age eight I was always trying to get him to clean up his desk he always had stuff mashed in there he was a strange dude I remember you take a bottle of blue\nAnd he would pour the glue and his arm lead and dry peel it off and then eat it\nShe said he has such strange personal habits that he was isolated and off by himself all the time\nThis is the guy\nYou know along with the with the rest of the Trump who is like driving this whole thing\nYou got they got the name yeah OK here it is let's let's hear this\nThis is what do you think about what's happening in Washington Congress me French and the Republicans know that it's dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt especially for black me\nIf the Democrats can do that to a white justice of the Supreme Court with no ... no cooperation and witnesses including her best friend said then happy\nSons when white girl lives on the\nWill be laughing black folk again turnout always told my son is don't mess around with that if you get calls she will primary\nI'm voting to keep congressman fame and the Republican because we have to protect me in ... we can't\nAfford can they'd white Democrats take us back to the bad old days of race verdict life sentences and\n... when a white girl screens rate paid for by black Americans for the president's agenda not authorized by any candidate forget\nIt is it's a strange I mean you know this ... it's [noise]\nAte it at ... I I don't even know where to begin with that I mean you know it's a it's a it's a it's a Brett Kavanaugh grievance ad\nThat's been turned into into a racial issue accusing white Democrats of wanting to put in a black man in jail or Lynch them\nYou know voiced by what sounds like a couple of black women I mean this is just like yeah I'm sure you know professional actors and got paid to say it I see it but still\nAnyhow there's there's there's a lot going on a yeah I have a few other stories that I wanted a random but I think\nA lot of racism is going to do one or two things in this country and and me both simultaneously is going to destroy us it's going to tear us apart\nAnd it's also going to wake up a lot of people how evil and cynical and then is\nThis Republican strategy actually\nThis is the\nBeing NGOs friday I'll pick up your calls already\n\nCompelling content on the air and online a beach town not calm nice to have you been there [noise]\n... if you start to lose weight listening carefully reduce zone works I've never before endorsed a weight loss product but I've seen the result first hand my brilliant wife Louise who like so many has had her share of diet frustrations\nLosing weight is hard right Louis heard about ridges on she did her homework learn it's FDA accepted and then it helps us lose weight in a revolutionary way\nRidges on comes out of university research that discovered a molecule that helps regulate appetite\nWhen it's out of whack were always hungry and crave foods we shouldn't eat and good luck losing weight when you're already starting on day one when we try and rid of his own she looks amazing and I've never never seen her this excited about a weight loss product listen when diet and exercise aren't enough and you want to lose the weight you been struggling to lose get non prescription reduce don't\nGo to try to reduce zone dot com and use the criminal code Tom teenager when to receive up to sixty five percent off on your order and free shipping that's try reduce zone dot com promo code Tom\nDo you feel like the investment cards are stacked against you recently I discuss how corporations are buying back their shares to manipulate the market\nAll the actual executives are cashing out\nThe SEC verified corporate buybacks are hiding insider trading and just as casinos aren't built on winters and neither is the stock market is called wealth transfer and you and I are the ones that risk stocks are high with a high downside gold is low with a high upside right now gold and silver are bargains ever the strategy by low sell high\nIf you want to make insider moves a hedge against the volatile market call my friends that idea and trading and find out why smart money is cashing out of high risk stocks for the safest currency ever created\nSpeak to an IT I'm precious metals expert and learned the smart money strategies and gold and silver asked for their free investment guy which outlines how you can use precious metals as your ultimate safe haven asset\nCall one AAA owned goal that's one triple A.

Jeff in Fort Dodge Iowa aid today Jeff what's on your mind\nI ah I was watching Morning Joe the sporting and Schumer and a Tom ... were on and talk about what a great if this was that Mitch McConnell\nAnd given the Democratic party I'm very afraid that a lot of seniors and stuff are not getting that work because I Believe that the media tamped that down pretty quickly after Mitch McConnell at those statements about Social Security and Medicare\nAnd I also want people to know that not only are they going to come after Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid they're coming after rare wrote retirement\nRailroad disability\nIn the state houses like Iowa has they're going to come after a ... it's called I ... yeah which is the workers' retirement savings program that they've paid into for years and that covers all state workers show a lot of county\nWorkers they're gonna charge you an art teacher ship yep\nYou're absolutely right Jeff and you know this is nothing new by the way the Republicans have been had been singing the songs since Nineteen thirty six\nAnd the media just loves to look the other way you know the but the I think I'm ... I think the American people I I I get it that there's probably a lot of seniors\nWho don't know about this number one but number two it's not just a senior issue of one third of the money that is the Social Security pays out goes to disabled people who are not yet sixty five years old many of them are our children are teenagers are people in their twenties in their thirties and their forties\nYou have a multi million dollar a life time\nDisaster insurance policy called Social Security if you break your neck like my friend Michael I just ended and end up uh paralyzed and then from the neck down for the rest of your life like Michael like what happened to Michael\nSocial Security disability pays your way right and Medicare pays your expenses ear health insurance and expenses and things\nAnd and the other Republicans want to do away with all this stuff they want to take us back to Dickens England so yes spot on Jeff and and this is something that we need to be waking up to and need to be very clear about\nThe Republicans are starting to freak out about it because they just got a survey back the good piece about this or a Daily Kos they just do they actually or it was I guess it was a month or so ago they did some polling and found that the American people have figured out\nThat the whole tax cuts scam was a scam just for the billionaires and and the big corporations and that the debt that has created the deficit that are created are both\nDied so you're going to be six trillion dollar data this year it's a one trillion dollar deficit but that that's going to be used as an excuse to cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid people are figuring this out Mitch McConnell goes on TV and says it\nUh you know and it gets a little bit of play but uh you know pay it shouldn't be a surprise Ricardo and Lacey, Washington ... what's on your mind that I\nHave come in here me just fine\nYeah what's up oh good thank you sir I'm trying not to be all over the place policies to but the first time caller a short time listener so I'm so sorry to just barely\nGot its good record on what's on your mind [laughter] okay so\nI'm just talking about I just wanted to talk about the divide in this country and how it just it saddens me to be honest with you just a quick backstory for myself I'm a I'm going to visit a strong moral from nine to the ... and I'm\nA born and raised there and then a little bit of northern California bay area and then six years so I'm a veteran Fifteen Years in the in the military to do once ... once you have to understand and I I\nI Can't understand why we have this racial divide how you've gone what three hundred plus years with all the you know the ... the vendors do that we have\nWhy can't we push forward and I'll give you some examples with with even in the military\nHow are we talking about PC you know they were my my my fellow new senior ... would say hey they hated Obama under like a well they went to Japan right and and my ... year this was when he was really any town and they were getting mad like we don't volunteer any when I was actually\nIt's such a different culture you know you want to you know you're you're you're being friendly to their culture\nYeah there is this happening under shaking hands right right exactly and and Tom I don't understand it it's like we're not born races its history it's a it's a family function but it's just I can tell you what's happened under current up off the you know\nRicardo let me let me give you my theory on this and you tell me if this comports with your experience one of the things that we know about people when they get rich\nIs that as they get richer\nThere's a lot\nOf um\n\nWhat about his ministry for the ... near where the Carla in Greenville North Carolina and Carl what's on your mind that a\nHigh ... this is spot on to me um as a very young child my grandfather who was born in the Eighteen nineties\nSat me down and told me that he was nine hundred percent Cherokee Indian but his parents were so afraid of that that they put on his birth certificate because he was born in ... he was white because they knew he'd have a better life be like\nSo tired life he was treated as a white person he said I'm not a ... to be Cherokee I'm scared to death to be Cherokee because a lot of white people would take me a young kid\nAnd that just stuck with me for ever but it has given me I'm more empathy is giving them a ... to see the fear and my grandfather than I ever see and understand as I when I look at it and I I\nDoubt her mother said one bit there because it you have people don't know their history and and you say that all the time you were a great historian if people understood history better they might understand today that yeah\nYeah and and I and Elizabeth Warren ... she was in a situation where it was kinda damned if you do and damned if you don't on the one hand exactly Trump and the Republicans were trying to claim\nSomething that absolutely was not true and that is that they were saying that she got some sort of benefit out of out of saying that she had to have an American ancestry and she got no benefit anywhere in her career from at a under any circumstances in any way shape or form period end of discussion\nBut then you know in order to to re bought the the the whole Pocahontas thing obviously she's going to be running for president\nYou know she did this genetic test and that it would that she stepped into this incredible conflict to conflict as maybe the wrong word but a debate is probably the more appropriate word\nThat's happening in Native American communities right now because the whole you know ... it since since Native American communities have been acknowledged as ... as a separate nations and some of them have gotten very wealthy or as a result of the you know legalized gambling and things\nOn their their each try you know in order to say okay you're a member of the tribe or you are not\nUm it it that it's been a very very difficult and challenging thing for the tribes over the years to to to to know who should be and you know rightly should be shouldn't be part of the tribe\nAnd and of course there's no genetic marker for any particular tribe there's just so genetic marker for a yeah you were you know some some of your ancestors were among those people who came across the land bridge from from Russia you know twelve or twenty two thousand years ago\nAnd that's that's pretty much it and so but but now you've got this you know people who have been denied tribal membership who are trying to say oh well here I can do a genetic test and show that I've got you know a certain percentage of\nOf a ... and you know native ancestry and then uh you know other people of the ... there are probably some people who are members of tribes who are who have less native ancestry than there are people who have been rejected by tribes and vice versa that's just it you know it's been all over the map for years and years and years because\nIt's been more like you know but\nI you know I I not being native America yeah I Know several people who are um but it's you know it's just it's just a huge issue in the Native American community and they've and they've all just been going you know ... genetic tests are not the way we are going to do this we'd never have we're not going to\nAnd so then when Elizabeth Warren gets this genetic test she was not applying for tribal membership she's not pretending that she's a member of a tribe she's not even identified a particular while you're she says the story that her mother told her\nBut um [noise] you know it's like I I Am confident\nAs slash hopeful that this will blow over the the Native American blowback against her using a

Moore\nCorrectly predicted that Trump would win twenty sixteen election um and I think we should listen to\nWhat he's telling us about what our own commonsense shut palace which is that we have um that the Democratic party basically they trained the working class and in terms of good paying manufacturing jobs\nAnd so many\nPeople just heard what Trump was saying about jobs and a bad economic cloud\nAnd about manufacturing and we the Democrats basically have embraced Wall Street we we we talk about the stock market is being that driver of economic close and a Trump\nMarta that would have been true that would have been true during the Clinton Administration and and part of that was true during the Obama administration but the Democratic party has very much changed their tune\nOr the largest caucus in the Democratic party right now is the progressive caucus if you're going to be a member of the progressive caucus and you do not take pac money corporate pac money\nThey they are the funding themselves with small donations they have said uh the wall street can take a leap\nYeah there was a day when Jamie diamond and Bill Clinton or best buds a and probably still are but that that Bill Clinton part of the Democratic party is fading really really rapidly and I think the Democrats have learned a lot of lessons martyr respectfully thanks listening KPFK um and and\nI think that we're going to see the result of those lessons in the election although you know the thing that scares me is you know like I said yesterday Greg palace said\nYou know fourteen million people have been removed from the voting rolls in the last year by Republicans and they're going to use that in that voter suppression these all these voter suppression ... they've got that you've got the the mail in

a and a ... society basically we're going to change\nThe system we're not going to keep the same corrupt system and put a different group of people from a different race at the top of the different group at the bottom we're going to change the system\nWhich is what I've been talking about on the other hand you've got the Republicans fighting this is absolutely hard as they can for example a dodge city a dodge city Kansas\nIs now sixty percent Hispanic\nAnd the polling place you used to be in the upper class white part of town\nThat was too close to all the Hispanics for the white people in that part of dodge city apparently so they moved at\nA mile out of town\nActually more than a mile out of town and a mile away from the nearest bus stop\nSo the only way you can vote if you're in dodge city now is if you have a car and if you have the kind of job or you can take the time off to go to her to go vote this this is voter suppression this is the kind of stuff that that it is that the Republicans are just like they're all about Maine in Chicago I mean what's on your mind that they\nAre you doing ... well a ... a\nMonth thing is uh you know the uh we have to it as a democracy the democracy must be able to get down and dirty or what do you just republic has a A M M pull this country pull America out of the mud\nAnd a young one of the ways we have to do that with the issues issues such as I'm getting rid of the electoral college uh know protecting the vote to voters or should be federal protective because of what it does I mean what is it means to democracy\nYeah to a large extent it was by the way until the Supreme Court and got the voting rights act\nYeah so I mean you know it should be should be able to do if you're in the United states citizen of age there should be able to walk in\nAnd vote isn't any local state or national election ... with no problem with out to search a voter suppression I say if Percival didn't um we should have fines and like they are thinking in Australia that if you don't vote you get five\nThat's right you get there yeah\nBut do you know to to talking about was how ... been born white just felt like you were rich and I have the opposite of that is being born black\nIs just automatically kind of made Jew a poor rich you know from a birth to a um [noise] this capitalistic system has placed a this\nThing that are being born black was\nA you at the bottom of you you're not worthy of and I see what do we have to fight to bring back\nA shows as a people [noise] uh I had to solve together was right now but we need for American citizenship here in America\nAnd the American people should be able to vote freely yeah\nI ... I it it baffles me how our federal government can track down every single Eighteen year old male citizen in the United states and notify them that they they have to say that they're registered with the draft board but they can't\nGet a they can't automatically enroll every Eighteen year old citizen male or female or whatever um as a voter I mean you know this just like\nWhat really you know we've got to jump through all these hoops and all of this goes back to efforts to prevent people who were considered undesirable voters like women and people of color from voting in back you know when it was just white men who ran the entire country I and of\nCourse white men largely run the country to this day and and uh [noise] you know yeah spot on main thank you for the call\nA Rick ... are actually recalled on just how I wanted to play this ad and they got the same ready to go right\nThis is the weirdest thing I just I I you know and for those of you just tuned in I I I played this in the last hour um this is ... and there's so much boiled into this thing this is like the Republicans using\nA taking the Kavanaugh thing and saying oh yeah you know Christine foreign was lying about Kevin are trying to rape her and you know a damaged his life Bloody Bloody blah and therefore we've got to be outraged and then slipping racially insane and therefore\nWell actually just listen this is this is this is not this is a Republican at\nWhat do you think about what's happening in Washington Congress may French and the Republicans know that it's dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt especially for black me\nIf the Democrats can do that to a white justice of the Supreme Court with no ... no cooperation and witnesses including her best friend said it didn't happen\n... founders when a white girl lives on the\nWill be laughing black folk again\nTurnout always told my son is don't mess around with that if you get caught she will crime rate", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Thom Hartmann Program", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "21"}
