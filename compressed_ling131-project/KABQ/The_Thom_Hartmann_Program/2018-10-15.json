New Jersey actually was by that point in time it's sort of Ohio and\nAnd are they true they threw Rockefeller out in the Eighteen nineties and then you had this charter mind green arrow we're all ... states on the east coast we are competing to reduce the standards\nOf a a corporation has to had to meet in order to charter itself in their state including the anti trust standards and a New Jersey and ended up with Rockefeller's business Delaware editor of the most successful but anyhow that that led to this explosion of mergers and and these these trust\nAnd here we are again ... ... Trump's Justice Department just approved a sixty nine billion dollar merger between CBS or the nation's largest drugstore chain and one of the five largest health insurance companies and I'm not sure where they rank and that five but at night and I'm pretty sure it and those were uh uh\nWell I you know I'm not certain of that so I'm not I'm not going to go down that road but anyway this is the largest health insurance deal in history\nAnd you know the purpose Robert rice is writing about this hour on his blog at ... dot org he says the real purpose is to give at on CBS more bargaining power over their consumers and employees right I mean\nYou know if if this new giant company is the biggest drugstore chain in town and the biggest insurance company in town and and uh you know they're studying wage floors or ceilings are actually\n... this is sort of like you know the old gilded age in in England uh in the United kingdom the Dickens wrote about when there were literally and this was you know from the Seventeen hundreds to the to the end of the Nineteen hundred or you have the Eighteen hundreds or end of the nineteenth century there were literally laws\nThat were called maximum wage laws\nEmployers couldn't pay their employees over a certain amount because they did not want to middle class to emerge because as Russell Kirk talked about in his famous book the conservative minded Nineteen fifty one of the book that kicked off the modern conservative movement\nIf you have a middle class is disruptive or middle class means that you know people will have political power they will not be afraid for their for their lives and their jobs and middle classes are bad things and the conservatives world view\nSo this is what's going on right now it's it's it's depressing wages it's depressing competition it's making it impossible to compete\nAnd it's not just CBS that just pharmaceuticals and so yeah my question to you is what do we do about this and how do we do it um you know because\nA you've got the Supreme Court has involved itself in those and dean basically since eight Nineteen eighty three with Reagan we have not been enforcing are anti trust laws in fact Nixon was the last guy to do this he broke up a TNT it took a while the you know the final unwinding of a TNT happened when Jimmy Carter was president\nBut Richard Nixon was the one who initiated it\nAnd that was really the last big tech you know for banks at five banks in the United states now a whole forty four percent of all American banking assets all American bank assets and you know just Thirty years ago they only controlled ten percent\nSo you were saying the same thing on the Internet with Comcast ATT horizon all these kinds of things I'm as Rob or I should note say you know ever wonder why you're airline tickets are so high\nWell yes because you know even though the price of jet fuel was really low there for a couple of years it's coming back up again now that oil is up to Seventy five dollars a barrel but was around forty five bucks a barrel for a long time jet fuel got really really cheap\nAnd did you see a decrease in your ticket price and now he's I was asked if uh you know a profit things from the airlines right because they don't have to compete with each other or you know they they basically they you know where the ... spoke system they've they've got you nailed down\nAnd in fact it was interesting I was I was at a meeting of the vocal board view to AOL dot org is the website it's a it's a philanthropic organization that I'm On the board of directors of and\nAnd a\nTalking to people about you know everybody was going home Sunday afternoon right and I was I flew nonstop back to Portland\nUm I you know on on United flight and I did a lot but there were other people who are you know there's one person who was flying back to Portland on Alaska Airlines going through Seattle right just to to get the miles it's like the airlines have us locked down\nAnd then you look at this you know Monsanto alone owns the key genetic traits to more than Ninety percent of the soybeans planted by farmers in the United states and eighty percent of the

this\nTo make this you know to give these big corporations even more money that they can use for mergers and also to widen the racial wealth divide the Institute on taxation economic policy I ... just released this amazing new report is the first quantitative analysis\nOr to actually look at the racial consequences of the Republican tax scam\nAnd what they point out is that\nBecause the you know about eighty percent of all the benefits went to the top\nOr to the top one percent the top one percent\nThree times more likely to be people of color are actually in the white people um and then our

thank you uh tell us about your group and how you are working to get young progressives active in to the polls we're seeing a just frightening lay low a voter participation numbers among people that are under under thirty five broadly and under twenty five in particular\nOr you know I mean in some places you know Fifteen Percent of the level of participation that you see among older generations some people think this is 'cause you know when a during the Reagan Administration being your guidelines for public school curriculum or were altered by bill Bennett uh the you know the the Reagan's secretary of education\nA bill about three sixty Sean\nA bill Bennett who famously had this to say back in the day\nUh I push the button there it helps that maybe not I guess it's not it's not gonna\nO'Hare here and I I Do know that it's true that if you wanted to reduce crime\nYou could say is that what your sole purpose you could've border every black baby in this country and the crime rate would go down that would be an impossible ridiculous and morally reprehensible thing to do with your crime rate would go down I mean this this this kind of a a\nIdiot I you know another word comes to mind I Can't say it on the radio um he's the guy who who who did away with civic says one of the standards and so you know since the eighties many of our public school is just simply no longer teach civics um is that why I mean what's going on here what are you doing to do something about it\nYeah it's a good question and and it is you know read it in\nA long ploy on the other side to\nLimit or participation ... of the people in this country so [noise] um well where'd you agree future we're really excited about 'em is uh we've been raising money all year and a maid grants to route twenty seven students are all over the country and some of the most competitive congressional districts\nUh and we made a grant out to them to organize and mobilize their campus for the upcoming election and so they're focused on a two main things as part of our program the first and most importantly as you're mentioning voter registration\nAnd I'm really excited to report just this morning we got report back from all of our organizers across the country and over the last month we registered over five thousand voters of that\nYou know it was just a small part of the overall narrative I and and picture that's been painted a that this year in particular more young people are voting for you to get those numbers up to do more\nNow but we're excited to be a part of that as a big thing that folks are focused on a is a recruiting people to volunteer for the campaigns because as you said\nAnd they're not getting the education about the importance of their votes about the importance of community organizing the importance of getting out and talking to voters about what's important to them they're not getting that sort of civics lesson in school and so we're actually connecting them with\nUh some of the most progressive campaign some of the most competitive campaigns um and putting our students on the ground giving them the resources in training they need\nTo get out the vote get out the worried about are these candidates who are running on a progressive agenda that will really restore some sanity to our politics as a our former president said\nThat is great and people can find out more information about this at our blue future to us Dr that right\nYeah that's correct and certainly follow us on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram as well where most of the young folks are these days yeah\nYeah it's a it's it's pretty remarkable everything that's going on and we have to get these numbers of young people would vote at the same percentage as boomers all across the country I don't think there'd be a Republican\nA job you know to reach totally agree I came out with a research report earlier this year is highlighting last Thirteen different democracy\nThe Congress Nick I

Spencer analogy in Indiana Spencer what's on your mind\nHow you doing so good to uh\nI Want to call you thank you for taking my call I I just I'm an independent and I agree um you know some things on both sides the night I have a question for you I I I Am seeing more on my face\nAnd I want to know why that sort of bad thing because actually it is better city you know in my family so I just\nHow much she makes Spencer a year around a hundred and twenty grand a year\nYeah okay so you're probably getting a tax cut of water on a thousand bucks a year\nYeah somewhere in there\nSo are you saying said well okay here's here's a couple of reasons why this is not a good thing number one you are starving\nOur government yours and mine of the money necessary to do everything from fill potholes Enron police and fire departments to have good schools um education all you know basically all the stuff that that keeps America America\nIs being cut back and being cut back radically with the singular exception of of our military number two in order to fund this tax cut literally every penny of it was borrowed it's a six trillion dollar tax cut over a decade the first trillion and a half dollars and the first two years which we're seeing right now\nAll of that as being funded by buying treasuries is going to have to be paid back with interest the interest is going to be another trillion dollars and that hurts our country in fact that may provoke a crisis for our country\nOr we're at the point now where there were ... twenty trillion dollars in debt where if interest rates go up to points and they certainly have in the past and the seventies you know the the prime was all the way up to around eight or nine percent you\nKnow right now it's in the neighborhood of two percent if interest rates go up another two points the interest on the national debt the annual payments in interests will be greater than everything that we pay to fund the Pentagon all of our wars and everything\nAnd that's a mind boggling and it's not good and it's not healthy\nAnd the number three because of that massive data and what I just described\nYou know the the ... when Democrats come into office the Republicans are going to be screaming okay it's time to end Social Security is trying to and long term unemployment benefits assigned to and food stamps assigned to end any support for college when I went to college who you know when I went to and as you briefly\nA back in the Nineteen sixties and Lansing community colleges well eighty percent of the cost of college it cost me about my recollection is a hundred and fifty dollars a term to go to MSU\nEighty percent of the cost of college in the Nineteen sixties was paid for by state and local governments and the university twenty percent was paid for by tuition\nAs a consequence of Reagan's policy changes particularly those who are championed by bill Bennett is racist secretary of education now eighty percent of the costs of education is paid for with tuition only twenty percent is paid for by governments so what we've had is this massive shift away from\nA society a society for all of us were anybody could you know I'm having you know my parents were not wealthy my dad worked in a tool and dye shopping he could not afford them a major college I but I but I was able to work my way through college the extent that I did I I all of them only got kicked out but\nYou know having dropped out I suppose is the more technically correct but\nI'm the bottom line is I was able to do that\nBecause I ... in minimum wage jobs I worked as a as a as a waiter I actually I I was a waiter for one day when the when the waitresses went on strike but as as a dishwasher and Bob's big boy ... wrote in East Lansing and across the street at the Exxon Mobil station I changed tires and pumped gas\nAnd you know for as I recall two dollars and thirty cents an hour or something like that would that minimum wage part time job\nUh there was a little more fulltime in the summer I could pay for college\nAnd and because that's how things were\nThe complete change in all of these things right you know making it impossible to go to college making healthcare massively more expensive shifting everything out of not for profit into Fort brought it all of that was predicated or or big that whole that whole horrible you know chain of horrible\nThe Republican Party or in the last year the ... of the uh the Bush administration\nOr ... you know cutting long term unemployment benefits from three years out of one year and then cutting it again down to six months um all of that was because they're cutting taxes\nUm if you if you were to go as I did live in Germany for a year where a somebody with your level of income you know well over a hundred thousand dollars would be paying as much as forty percent of your income in taxes\nYou would have free healthcare you would have free college in fact your kids would get a stipend when they go to college you'd have one of the best public education systems in the world you would have highway systems in road systems that are so well maintained that you can travel a hundred and thirty miles an hour on the freeway or you would have\nA ... you know I I could go on and on right um and and you would have a much higher minimum wage the fact of the matter is the the other the other argument that I Would make Spencer I've made this before but you know it's worth repeating fact I've read it written op eds about this you can easily find them is that tax\nRight now that buys spray and we need a place that could make it home\nFrom diabetes prevention around or [noise]\nThe why does the gap in fact if I\nCan do it without us\nWas where there's a wide enough\nOr why are better [noise]\nGang violence I my boss President Trump has introduced\nA new theory about who may have killed the Washington Post journalist\nBefore she stopped to speak with reporters at the White House President Trump saying he dispatched secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia to get the kingdom's take on what happened to dissident turned exile turned regime critic ... plus\nOr ... Goolsbee who lives in Panama City we need food water everything the whole street needs food FEMA referred me to you she's talking nobody issue about the red cross\nAnd and then that person told me to call to one won the Florida United Way so everybody's passing the buck here\nAnd this this is just another example of what happens when new liberalism wins you know this philosophy that the rich can run things better\nThat the rich you know philanthropies from rich people should be you know how we get our health care and how we get our public transportation you know let's privatize everything and let the rich people make a profit on it and then would that profit they'll say hey here you go\nAnd we're seeing a piece of this right here in in Oregon this is an amazing story in Philadelphia\nThey put a three sent attack a per ounce tax on soft drinks\nI was you know I I think I mentioned I was at this so vocal board meeting in Denver over the weekend\nAnd it's a deal to AOL dot org it's an organization that is you know basically passes out money to progress in groups and I've been on the board for over a decade I think\nAnd and uh we're board members from all over the country and uh a couple of people were telling me about how in their towns and I and my recollection is Minneapolis is one of them in their towns the sugar tax on sodas\nActually measurably reduced obesity well here's a report this is from Harvard and this is a couple of years ago this is one Philadelphia was debating the tax and what they said was a three cents per ounce tax on sugar sweetened beverages\nProposed in Philadelphia as a Harvard University medical school could help thirty six thousand people a year avoid obesity prevent two thousand two hundred and eighty annual cases of diabetes over seven hundred thirty deaths over a decade and save almost two hundred million dollars in health spending\nIn addition to that the city of Philadelphia would generate additional four hundred million dollars over five years that they can use for everything from public health initiative to repairing the roads so uh in number one number to Berkeley, California ended this\nThey put a tax on sugar sugary beverages and low income this this from um writers are and I have a column by ruined it Ryan calling as voters consider ... taxes and for US cities a new study finds that low income Berkeley neighborhoods slash sugar sweetened beverage consumption by more than one fifth\nAfter the nation's first soda tax went into effect this wasn't twenty fourteen a penny announced tax on soda one third of what Philadelphia was talking about and other sugary drinks\nAnd ah after the attacks took place in March twenty Fifteen residents are too low income neighborhoods report and drinking Twenty one percent less of all sugar sweetened beverages twenty six percent less soda than the year before\nThe soda industry has spent millions of dollars to feeding taxes on sugary drinks and dozens of use in cities but in Berkeley passed with Seventy six percent of the boat they're doing is on the ballot in Boulder, Colorado is San Francisco Oakland to Albany all over the place\nAnd so what's happening here in Oregon we've got propositions one oh three and one off for a ... I'm not sure if it was both of them I've won all three I think for pretty much for sure\nFunded by and and these are we're seeing all these ads on TV with some like granola eating guy in a health food store going you know we don't charge taxes on groceries in Oregon and we never should but the but they keep trying to put taxes on and then and they ... some of the Republican efforts to tax groceries over the years that were easily knocked down\nAnd says we need to put it in our constitution that there can be taxes on groceries well the ... the constitutional amendment that they want us all to sign off on and it sounds so good yeah let's help low income people it's banned taxes on groceries\nActually specifies sugary soft drinks as a grocery\nIt names them in this thing that they want to put it in our constitution to make it illegal for us ever\nTo put taxes on soft drinks that are causing obesity and diabetes and that's really what it's all about and and it's so deceptive and this is an example of how you know there's a direct democracy sounds like a great idea until\nThe Supreme Court comes along and says yeah but the beverage in industry can drop ... you know millions and millions of dollars into a ... small state like Oregon\nAnd just you know wipe out public opinion\nAnd all you know like you know I'm thirty eight and twenty six days that are four days or however long it is to the election you know how well it worked out but that's what's going on\nSo you've got that I'm In the in the good news side well maybe this isn't good news I don't know I guess it depends on where the climate change goes to the Supreme Court and whether Brett Kavanaugh has anything to say about bart Kevin uh this from the guardian trouble blue in Berlin climate change to cause dramatic beer shortages\nWith climate change set to cause dramatic price by spikes in his and supply shortages according I knew this was a extreme heat waves and droughts will increase will ed increasingly damage the global barley crop so look for the price of beer to be going up as a result of global warming\n[noise] Elizabeth Warren\nDonald Trump has been calling her focus Pocahontas for a couple of years you know ... evoking or invoking a when it said in the way it said by a by a white guy like Donald Trump basically a racial slur\nAnd uh because she had said she now she never benefited from this right the Trump and the Republicans have tried to suggest that Elizabeth Warren got into Harvard because of this or she got a job and a professor because of this or Bloody Bloody blah\nHer saying that her great great great grandmother was Native American has never endured any benefit never given any benefit to her whatsoever\nShe has never use this for our benefit she has you know set of the few times and she even ... you know in in one of her you know part of her resume when she was a you know going to work um as a professor but it you know it had nothing to do with why she got\nYou know the got the job\nSo Trump's and making fun of her and said he'll give a million dollars to a charity she takes a DNA test and there's any ... and she turns out she was an Indian\nWell you know obviously is going to Welsh on it saying well you you know here maybe one thirty second in India and that doesn't mean that you're and you know I Am but but she took the test and sure enough or great great great great grandmother was a full blown Native American and you know she grew up in Oklahoma were by the way this\nNot at all uncommon right and so one of Donald\nTrump said this morning when you know the news came out and and the reporters came up\nTo him and says oh you're going to give that a million bucks to Elizabeth Warren's favorite charity and he's like\nWell who cares I didn't say that nobody better reader to get some roommate I'm quoting Donald Trump's this morning as you just walk and I was like a fighter who say that\nAt work people tried them love them told their friends about helping the cell and donate over eight million pairs\nChina now I found this dot com fashion Tom and get twenty percent off your face ordinary that's B. and B.

see what's going on right now is you've got a couple of really tight races in Florida\nAnd probably the tightest as the governor's race\nAnd Andrew Gillum\nIs running for governor down there\nJust what his job is right now\nMayor of Tallahassee\nAnd guess what the major\nYou know the most densely populated area that took economically the largest hip from hurricane Michael was Tallahassee\nAnd so uh by some I doubt that we're going to see the really speedy response from ... from the Trump guns on this I mean you know I Know that famous doing some some good work down there but\nI doubt it's going to be anything as as big as we've seen in other areas because Tallahassee they want to make the more they want to make Gillum look bad and they want to upset the people plus\nThey've you know the the uh the administration of the of the state has refused to extend the voter registration deadline which expired last Tuesday\nThey refused to expel extend the voter registration deadline for

is paying for it [noise] [noise]\nMm yeah that's an excellent point too I used to live in a ... but it's it's right down the road from around horses\n[noise] yeah\nYeah we were right next door to Esther back we live right right on the border right um yeah it's a it's a nice part of Detroit actually a very very you know kind of straightforward middle class area and um\nBut right or at least I was in the seventies um so yeah so what is the city doing they're trying to raise property taxes\nYes they're trying to increase of ... now than\nThey are it makes sense makes sense yeah and this you know and if it wasn't for the Republican massive Republican tax cuts for for millionaires billionaires and corporations are probably wrong meal is wouldn't have to do that Frank thanks for the call is a great one Barbara in Indian rocks Beach Florida a barber what's up\nOh hi Tom I'm I'm responding to the previous caller that was mentioned they got more money in his paycheck right well I just want to college to know they should check their withholding because my husband and I had pension checks\nAnd we're getting more money but when we looked at actually what was going on they lowered I withholding which added to our paycheck\nBut at the end of the year we'd have to pay it all back when it comes to tax\nTime comes around a little bit you all know about that until next April after the election\nAbsolutely but I just wanted to let you warn your listeners to check that out can be a problem for New Jersey New Jersey teachers tension\nDo you know who I mean typically withholding tables are defined by the Internal Revenue service and everybody just basically follows though is is there is something different with regard to the to the to your pensions or the state of New Jersey or whatever\nI have no idea really knows I called them up and said hey what are you doing now I'm going to have to a more money and income tax time right I Want to put back the way it was so we feel that the forest and they put it all back and I'm getting the same amount of money and my paycheck now\nVery interesting yeah I'm guessing if it's a pension that you're earning a little enough that the tax cut is relatively meaningless to you anyway I mean you know anybody earning under sixteen\nThat was now as a year basically of seeing not\nRight it wasn't much much added but it was enough to make a difference and I just wanted to know how they did that and that's what I found out there you know\nIf you're just going to get the bill in April these guys they is it there is so ... that's a word\nAs they are just ... I'm Sorry it's just sneaky it's just yeah people and they don't\nCheck people just don't look and they don't check for the facts and they just don't do that and they think oh this is great I'm getting more money but they're not and like you said he's borrowing that money to give us more money and when the Democrat gets elected in twenty twenty it's going to be a nightmare forum Jeff I could always is for the Democrats yep\nEver since Reagan I ever since they put those policy in place with the Reagan Administration Barbara and a half to\n... they have to fix it all and people get mad and they have to pay more taxes are going to be interesting there you're thank you for your show we love it we can't wait to listen\nThank you Barbara thank you very much great great to hear from you and I appreciate the call gene in Atlanta hey gene what's up\nI'm aging\nAnd you and your or they'll show I just I just call you to raise ... or ... or get you you got your earlier about the tax and uh\nOh don't you you are a few small community you get good jobs that you're doing and you inspired a lot of people and you mix might easier", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Thom Hartmann Program", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "15"}
