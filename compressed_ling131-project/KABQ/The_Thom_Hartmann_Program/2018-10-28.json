world Scott McCartney as the middle seat column for the wall Street Journal is in front of the show and a frequent guest divide and a friend of mine delighted to have him on and he just flew the longest flight in the world easier to tell us about it Scott welcome to the show\nGreat to be with you Rudy All right what airline did you fly what can the aircraft and where do you go to\nSingapore Airlines have reclaimed the title of the longest flight in the world and this trip is from Newark to Singapore and a shame that since coming back\nUm it's more than Ninety five hundred miles and uh basically um to the other side of the world and they're using a brand new Airbus\nA three fifty dash nine hundred jet I'm that's configured for ultra long flying uh they've Airbus has modified the fuel system um they restricted the cargo load a little bit on it\nUh and uh and it can um uh they face a fly for twenty hours um this this flight is scheduled at Eighteen hours forty five minutes a day when I did it we had some favorable wind so it was a mere Eighteen hours\nIn the airplane [laughter] and it's interesting there are no regular economy seats uh you you wrote in your column that they're sixty seven business class eats a Ninety four premium economy seats and from the photographs\nI'm On a at least on online companies with your column the seats are fairly I mean certainly better than the average economy plus seat in the U.S airlines\nYes yes there is a difference between premium economy particularly at the international airlines and and what we think of is the economy plus or the extra leg room you get on the domestic us airlines um premium economy on on on Singapore\nI'm In and it is nice and you're right they don't have regular economy because they think that would really be too cruel to\nWed somebody into a small fee for Eighteen hours\nUm but ... show this sheet has an inch more ... than a typical a three twenty Nineteen inches inside the armrest instead of Eighteen Inches um and in about six extra inches of leg room\nYou get a little bit more recline and it's actually if you if you think about it it's it's not all that is similar to what business class used to be long before the whole flatbed\nRevolution I'm so it's\nYou know it it it was a comfortable seat um Singapore actually has um a specially designed the seat with some features for this particular a flight it for ultra long flying um where there are extra supports for your for your cab as your legs they said well I'm\nA reduced tension um but you know at the end of the day I Can't sleep sitting up on an airplane um and I know many\nPeople can see and it was a flight ... was I was full\nI mean it's interesting what the premium county feeding 'em a it's two seats together on the side and that's that's nice and kind of spacious down before seats in the middle so you've got you know middle seats in the middle of the airplane and I think the people in that middle section in particular um you know you know it kind of trip where\nUh you know after about fourteen or Fifteen hours you get really restless and humid there\nYou had some specific tips we only have about ... you have some sort of gets which is drink more water which we hear a lot but really getting up every few hours even if you have to set your your iPhone or I've had to set an alarm so you walk around right yeah\nI think that's really important really important for circulation really important for fatigue um it it\nIt and it's a it is a good thing to do you know every two or three hours particularly if you're not sleeping or just you know if you're watching a movie you got to get up after the movie\n... it's interesting one of the things they recommended actually drinking or a coffee and tea and particularly herbal teas and and things and and we think of that is sort of a direct that you know wouldn't wouldn't maybe dehydration chew\n'em but in this case uh um the recommendation is a drink coffee and tea because it forces you to go to the bathroom and going to the bathroom is a good thing that gets you up and moving around um the only thing I think is really important and and and this goes for really any flight but particularly long flights if if your contact lens or anything bring eye drops\nAnd bring a sailing nasal spray you have to do you can stay much healthier on an airplane if you keep\n'em your nostrils moist um the the mucus membranes up there that that trap infection and saw very little bottle with the when you spray it brings a little bottle I drop so stick 'em in the feedback pocket and and use them\nAre really every time I get up and walk every two or three hours\nI appreciate that 'cause I've never done that all good advice and you survive the trip obviously you did round trip out and you're back home in Dallas every Thursday Scott writes a fascinating\nColumn even if you don't fly a lot it's really interesting it's called the middle seat it's in the wall

or the war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman\nWe're broadcasting from Orange County California federal authorities have launched an investigation after pipe bombs were sent to a number of prominent

Want to turn now to a very big story here in Southern California the leader and the California neo Nazi gang the rise above movement was arrested Tuesday in Los Angeles at the airport\nRobert ... faces charges of plotting riots inciting violence for his role and a range of attacks in two thousand Seventeen including the deadly unite the Right rally in Charlottesville\nLast August three other members of the group were charged alongside run into a ... Robert of foreign and Tyler allow were\nApprehended at the homes and tolerance joined ... beach and it's well a fourth suspect Karen ... is still at large the men are accused of participating in violent attacks as well as using the Internet\nTo incite violence the head of various advance the group publicly documented their attacks as a recruitment tool\nEarlier this month for other members of the rise above movement were indicted on riot charge us so\nAt the same time we're seeing one after another suspected pipe bomb on being sent off to a leading Trump critics um we are hearing about this arrest here in California um talk about who Robert ... well\nRun does not from California originally from uh New York actually um grew up in in the city uh and uh\nHis uh you know history does involve a history of violence he spent several years in prison out in New York for a stabbing incident that he'll edges was a form of self defense was\nTargeting alleged members of the Thirteen gang but it did involve a him and or at least one other person a attacking this in an individual and the uh run do actually stabbing the person's several times\nUm he made his way after getting out of prison out out to the west coast and ultimately settled down in San Clemente a in South Orange County and um\nHe and several other folks from from this area for them to rise above a couple of years ago at him in part as a result of their presence at rallies where they kind of formed this identity of being kind of the street fighter type folks that were going to defend\nPeople's rights to free speech uh they they're a group that really a has focused on the idea of of training physical training they do a lot of them may training they they were actually just completed a European Tour where they\nMet with far right extremists across Europe including Russia with a leading and that may a neo Nazi group called a white rex\nUm they do a lot of cross training so they really promote this idea of healthy lifestyle and that they're kind of a opposed to this kind of contemporary decadent culture and lifestyle that's being promoted by\nKind of multiculturalism so they're very Xena phobic an anti immigration\nOr they have links to a much older white supremacist groups like the hammer skin nation which has been one of the largest neo Nazi skinhead groups across the globe since the late eighties so uh they're definitely part of this you no longer traditions of white supremacist group that has a long history here in orange county\nA speaking at the White House on Wednesday at President Trump um ah oh I Want to turn to a video I'm a that comes from frontline\nI'm at a video that describes\nWhat really what we're talking about\nThe new generation of white supremacists are pushing their politics into the mainstream Rob\nRuined do seem to be part of that trend\nGroups first public appearance wasn't it towards march\nWithin Huntington Beach pro Trump rally behind the banner that read\nOne member also attacked\nA journalist with orange county's alternative weekly paper at the\nTime did you know that this was a group or who did this or or what was going on no I definitely saw their organize they stuck as a group you know they also the banner one and I we got box office and I started talking to Gustavo about everything he started having to go out and look for everybody there who who was attacking people\nThat are going to hashtags like hashtags mega march of last few yeah right there so sort of like this was this him hitting you is that or is that later this is right after he had just hit me when I clicked on his name it took me to his profile and you look at his pictures their ... and you say oh that's due to attack me there you go\nThat's an excerpt in the race and PBS Frontline documentary title documenting hate Charlottesville the clip began with a full Thompson of ProPublica who helped expel a rice\nThat's more than ten we were just listening to Frank ... a reporter with the ah Orange County alternative weekly paper talk more about that\nYeah um so you know this is a you know the the the ... the investigative work the ProPublica has done a exposing a rise above than in others as well it's been extremely important in terms of trying to shut a light that otherwise seems to have been\nKind of ignored to to a large extent which is a big part of the problem that my German was discussing earlier I'm a just a few moments ago\nAnd I also want to mention something if you look at rise above and they're a propaganda they they have been a pretty adept at creating kinda glossy videos that show them training and doing graffiti and and and then also adding clips of some of their physical violence at some of these rallies\nThey are very clear about identifying themselves as a nationalist\nAnd so it's an interesting point that President Trump or just a couple of days ago at the at a rally in Texas made a point to the dentist ... has a nationalist and so I think just as important to underscore the law to these groups like rise above they don't call themselves neo Nazis or white supremacist they call themselves nationalist oftentimes\nThey call themselves nationally very interesting that you should say that considering yes this week I'm at a at the Houston rally at President Trump is holding these campaign rallies across the country he called himself a national yeah\nYeah I mean it's it's for folks like rise above that's music to their ears because that word means a lot to them\nAnd they really see that as an important in a way of defining themselves are that can be potentially more palatable to a larger percentage of of the population especially a white Americans who won't\nBe as likely to be turned off by for instance a term like neo Nazi where you have folks that it might be a little bit intimidated by that term so groups like rise above are very very adept at using a turn like national because it is very meaningful within their culture\nMy German would you care to expand on that also in New York\nUh we've been showing this video of the Proud Boys\nOn a the Proud Boys are a number of them were arrested by New York police after they basically rioted and assaulted people outside the metropolitan Republican club where their leader\nWas inside speaking five of the nine members of this far right groups Proud Boys arrested on rioting and assault charges on\nThe arrest followed the October twelfth street attack and which doesn't have members of the group were caught on camera\nPhysically assaulted anti fascist protesters after attending I taught by their leader Gavin again is I mean it's quite amazing Gavin again is speaking at the metropolitan Republican club [noise] can you comment on that\nIt is troubling and you know what are the things to understand is how it the ... governments gain power and one of the things that they have done in history is sanction street dogs to go out and commit political violence and when people get upset at that\nOr what you see is then legislation designed to prevent protests and of course we've already seen that number of state legislatures and regulations being promulgated\nA in Washington DC that would uh shut down some of the protests in front of the White House and elsewhere are and the national parks so you know this is a very troubling trend and the fact that you have the president United States identifying with these groups much like we saw right after Charlottesville\nWhere a comment about very fine people on both sides\nOf this conflict or it again gives these groups ... and I give credit to the FBI for finally arresting these people but it was a year after ...\nPublished an article that basically laid out who these people were I tend to be for a free speech purist and this isn't about free speech and these are people who had long criminal records who who forecast that they were going to these protests to commit violence\nCommitted violence often filmed the violence and use that to recruit people for the next protests were they again they for cats they were going to go commit violence and the fact that they were traveling in her state should have been something that it was tracked by the FBI in real time\nNot here a year plus later after frontline\nOr basically put the whole thing on on national television\nAmazing things progress rights and the Guinness has lecture metropolitan Republican club\nFirst time candidate once Republican now a Democrat or a became a multi millionaire because he actually won the Powerball a couple of years ago so\nI Do know Kim she's the one with the name recognition but the same thing how many people hate young horse he Trump versus how many people actually like ill I Can't really tell you many people who really truly like deal because no one knows who exactly he is\nBut this process to be close ... close all around but he'll Cisneros says oh well known political activists and\nSaying that it I I've been here my entire life I didn't hear about guilt of stairs until you're now\nYeah the people are desperately hoping praying\nThat this can come to Orange County the Democratic whip can come to Orange County\nAgain do not underestimate the ... and the horrible ... of Orange County voters until election day I'm not trusting anything I saw this as Democrats all the time and frankly the Democrats may never expected to be here if that even for the past twenty five years and they had even expected hey maybe one day we could actually challenged the Republicans they'd be at a much better position than they are\nRight now to talk about the growing Vietnamese American community I mean it's the largest and that in a nice community outside of Vietnam is that\nRight yeah little Saigon around Westminster garden grove son Donna up but it and it's interesting how these politics these demographic Baltics player in orange county because of Vietnamese community is still resolutely Republican there are a couple of Democrats out when we talk about Republican we're talking about Donald Trump supporting\nFlaming right wing whack job Republicans and so the running for city council there's a lot of attention being put the oh twenty eight of them are running this year and Thirteen of them have the same last name when he ha ha ha come on like most of these rug Vietnamese are running their worthless politicians\n... I'm so let's turn to San Diego um can you talk about Republican Duncan Hunter\nA running against him are kept button a jar the Mexican Palestinian America of a very significant race um I mean Duncan Hunter on is the person who I think he was the second Congress member to endorse President Trump\nOn he and his wife were indicted in August ... two hundred and fifty\nA thousand dollars in campaign funds on trips to Hawaii Italy and Lake Tahoe or other strapped again personal expenses including spending six hundred dollars to fly as family pet rabbit across the country I dress responded by blaming his wife\nOn Duncan Hunter with the second Congress member to endorse Trump the first New York Congressman Chris Collins has also been indicted on I Want to go to a campaign ad produced by Duncan Hunter attacking his Democratic\nOpponent mark happened after\n... coming a jar is working to treat Congress three different names to hide his family size ... grandfather masterminded the musical my father served as\nMe but I'm never lose your support\nSupport here\nRisk we can't ignore Duncan Hunter and I approve this message\nAnd this is mark camp and NPR responding to this ad on MSNBC\nOr what are we doing as a nation\nWe have policies we have things we could talk about this is a deeply on America that and I feel like John McCain if you were with us today would be so appalled do remember he stood up against a woman who tried to disparage President Obama on the same line of argument\nAnd I think the party of McCain's party of Reagan even as long gone\nAnd it's heartbreaking because I have friends who are Republican it's an American it's not true I'm not a security threat I was given a clear as vi securities ... Duncan Hunter who was a criminal indicted for spending a quarter million dollars and the corruption smoking gun when you talked about when he paid about\nSixty thousand dollars he is guilty it's only a matter of time until people hold them accountable\nThat some are camping and ... I'm ...\nI Love it it's a very American ... are you kidding me demonizing\nBeing scared about Palestinians and Mexican this is like the Republican nightmare\nCome to live I Love it unfortunately in that district San Diego it's basically like Orange County the Nineteen seventies\nFilled with a bunch of Robin right wing lunatics so I think Duncan Hunter got one who cares if he's indicted Republicans don't care if their candidates are indicted the Republican than in the ... the Democrat just for being Democrats\nThey're evil and if you're Mexican on top of that you're even more evil and Palestinian like they can stick ... he's moslem anymore because he's Christian he converted Christianity so it's a nightmare to Canada I think he's a future of the Democrats and I think that'd be a wonderful thing if he's a future\nAnd find a common you'd like to make for people who are watching this around the country the possibility that the house could turn based\nOn the racist here the fact that we're having this conversation itself is historic no one ever thought that Orange County would even be close to a purple I Would say at the the ... the weekly the paper that I used to it and we were the profits we've been calling this for a long time\nBut there's still an imperfect revolution so my hope with the Democrats learn a what's good and instead of a supporting corporate is

I I'm One of the sides all like almost no matter what I Do\nAs well as long as you control the side you get to be one of the side\nWhat if I don't agree with just decide as it was for the other they started they wanted to get rid of slavery but I'm I don't really like immigrants and I don't really want people to vote more\nAnd I don't really want people to color to get welfare benefits so so I don't really like that and what their side stood for when it started as well that doesn't really matter as long as you can win the most votes\nYou get to be one of the sites\nTo okay well if if I if I don't ah if I actually don't believe that everybody should have the chance to cast a ballot or if I think we should make it harder and and so I don't really big fan of democracy in general\nDo I still get to be one of the sides are rides that'd be a fringe kinda weird thing that's contrary democracy no no no as long as you get the most votes and or control the most financial contributions\nYou get to be one of the side you mean like have like I got to be half of the debate and people think I'm half bright and major media organizations will take my ideas are half okay as long as you control one of these two sides yes you are half\nOf the debate we have most of the two arms and hands two legs to feed two hemispheres of our brains to is the smallest whole number bigger than one so yes you get to be one of the sides\nBut now wait a minute what by appeal to Christian conservatives but then I nominate a serial full lander and multiple accused creep\nTo the presidency do I still man I ... no no you're still yeah though it's still okay now what is the only way for me to keep our is to manipulate the rules to redraw the lines to allow for unlimited secret money to win Congress to win the

have a negative vote extension in other words when they want to vote against a specific candidate\nThey're basically given the choice or catch the positive vote are testing on non vote yeah and we
