Do want to mention one thing a hurricane Michaels they ... they they\nThe the the Reuters has a report out and I just wanted to extend my heart felt sympathies and condolences Reuters as a report out that more than a thousand people are still missing\n\nHurricane we know for ... twenty seven\nAnd they said volunteers with the Houston based crowdsource rescue organization were searching for more than a ... eleven hundred thirty five people in Florida lost contact with friends now there is a cab you\nThey're not saying they were killed there not saying they don't know where they are they're missing\nEleven hundred thirty five of them but but what they point out you know the Florida officials say they haven't given them or or how many people are considered to be missing\nThose who are missing might be with relatives and friends are not necessarily presumed dead so I Want to make sure that I get that out there but many of those missing from Panama City many of them are elderly or disabled they're impoverished where they live alone\nSo there's the searches ongoing eleven hundred thirty five people and the devastation has just been incredible\nThere are no words to describe it and again I Hope you can do anything to support those folks are the survivors of hurricane Michael in Florida please do show we contact your local Red Cross or go online and find out whom you can contribute that's not a scam\nThat you know the money or your donations\nWhen will be there will be used properly will be welcomed should credible credible category five almost\nWhen it hits the fan

coup that Trump says the U.S is asking turkey for audio and video relating to the disappearance of Washington Post journalist democracy if that exists\n[noise] yeah I don't know if you wanted to play football or whatever but anyway they were learning only there are there are options yeah but he's he's not necessarily going to be the guy playing chess he might be the guy who is the he's the baby right but what\nWhat what she was saying or what the administrator was telling her or whoever it was that was helping her was just basically yeah there was a teacher is off the table at like half of these organizations yeah 'cause the teacher doesn't want any developmentally disabled person in that club so it was just her expressing some of the difficulties that\nThey had a I mean I I can understand the conversation or this is these are the difficulties that I'm having but what did she want the school to do only have ... her\nSon and the like any other student\nAnd so and so automatically I Am thinking this story Harrisonburg drawn where\nIn order to level the playing field in order to to create this uh equality of outcome you've got to take the strong and you've got to put weights on I mean you've got to take the stupid and you've got to put your ... ...\n... ... which I didn't hear that in what you know was was nothing so uh\nShe mentioned the chess club not eight chess team not a competitive saying with the chess club\nShe just wanted very Ryan says he didn't that by the way so he was in the chess club in middle school oh okay okay in middle school but when he went up to the high school he was also on the cross country team in middle school but at the high school they said people like\nYou don't do these things so they said that about sports they didn't she didn't say they said that about chess club so she had made a statement that he was in chess club and I don't recall where there was no either but what I'm saying is what I'm going back to my my original comment is how do\nYou how do you make room for someone like this to compete and less you dumb down it really it well about competing\nIt was about letting the person into an extra curricular activity and there's a variety of these sorts of things chess club just why I brought up water or it could be\nI see what you're saying but we're not necessarily talking about a competitive extracurricular activity right like there can be an extra curricular activity of like TV club where you go and you make TV you know you make a marriage for news or something like that it was different things\nAnd so anyway she was just expressing that she was put off by the addict right in in general and and it was interesting sitting there listening to this because I'm you know like you pointed out before he went on the air this wasn't a forum in the same way that\nEvery other thing and I've run for office ... times every other thing that I've been invited to call it a candidate forum right\nThey'll have candidates up and yeah it might be you know by special interest organization and what it says you hear from people flooded out it's more they will ask question and I didn't take a while and all that from Canada or every other candidate forum has\nThis well okay I understand that I understand what you're saying but all you have to do is read it here and it it does say that uh you will learn so this was an invitation to for candidates to come learn about the frustrations that these people were having with ultimately the state system\nAnd I thought that was what was you know the most interesting I didn't want to make any kind of statement or anything like that while I was there because it didn't seem appropriate\nAt All right so that's why I wanted to come on the other one was on meet the candidates this was for the candidates to learn about this these ... so this is ... ... ... I I Will not this was not for the public through meet the candidates no it was for the families who were there and the people who worked for a minute\nYeah but ... says the candidates to meet these people okay correct and they told their stories about how crappy\nThe state system is now of course you know the the most of the people in that\nRoom there was Daryl and I we were two of the three libertarian candidates Gillette uh Jarvis also was was there with us She's the gubernatorial candidate here in New Hampshire for the libertarians\nAre most of the people in this room where Republicans and Democrats and of course you know there was a little bit of a sparring ... not too much I mean yeah they they kind of kept themselves mostly under control the ... in this particular case\nUm but but but it was interesting listening to the stories about how people you know they want help and they want to be able to count on the help being there but the fact is when it's the states\nYou can never count on anything and this is one of the things that a a one of the folks who turned into a libertarian so there were three candidates are not candidates but three state representatives in the last couple of years last term here in New Hampshire to Republicans one Democrat\nThey flipped and joined the Libertarian Party and I was really more interested in just all cop who was the Democrat from Keane who flipped in became a libertarian in in learning his story and hearing how he kind of explained becoming a libertarian and this is one of the things that he talked about I thought was really persuasive\nUm you know when you talk to let let these when you talk to Democrats they want to use the state to be compassionate that's what they want to do they want to help people uh and and you know you can't blame them for that even though the state isn't compassion we can get into that\nAnd one of the points that stock up and made was well when you count on the state for something you're always gonna be disappointed there somebody's going to come along they're going to pull the carpet even if you have the perfect state program which of course doesn't exist but even if you had the perfect state run assistance program well next\nA semester or whatever these you know next politicians come in they changed the rules are they changed the funding the change is the first thing to do or whatever and so it gets pulled right out from under you think you've got something that you can count on and it turns out you can't so to continue to talk about you know what those folks at this a forum wanted and what the libertarian solutions are here\nBecause the common solution is more funding we just need more funding more handouts yeah we're gonna come back with that come up here in moments eight fifty five four fifty free like freedom\nFrom the first letter of captain mark history is full of flowery document claiming to limit the power of the crown but these poetic social contracts had been epidemic to prevent the predation limited government as they lied they used to keep us submissive\nThe crown cannot be trusted to abide by us founding charters nor its treaties or even its own rules the essence of the crown a centralized violence and I'd had enough\nThat's why I raised my black banner I Am no revolutionary my aim is not to reset the cycle of violence but to break it\nMy aim as an evil society invisible to the crown not a new hierarchy but decentralized network with no central figure for the crown the target\nIf you want your survival life keep it but we will not submit to the crowds agenda and when you are ready to stop being it's based a burden ready for adventure and opportunity join us at pirates Without Borders dot com\nLiberty dollar was so successful that the United states government had to take it down and its founder Bernard but not house now Bernard son extra his launched liberty dollar to\nL.

F deal saves you Fifteen Percent so we were talking about\nUm libertarians solutions to some of the more challenging issues in this case where the hell mentally disabled people young people children\nUm and you know people taking care of those folks beyond the ability of let's say the parents to fund whatever it is because you know if you've got somebody with a developmental disability and it's a severe one\nIt could be a very very expensive um you know process yeah take care of that person more so than even if you got to keep every single tax dollars that you pay out it would still be a huge burden on top of that but you wanted to mention something about St Jude their rights uh it's just a children's\nA camp was cancer when I say they largely\nTo it's not research they take care of providing treatment for and I don't think it's limited to cancer and uh but they never send the families\nOf bill ... it all covered and\nIt's funded through donation threats we've done some fundraising for them over the years here ... when you do a good service and your provided good service and people like what you do because you're not a whole then people will give you money so that you can keep doing right and providing a good service\nSo instead what we have here are families who feel pretty hamstrung it seems from the testimony they gave to the ... the legislators and the people who are running for a legislative office which is why we were there ...\nUm you know is that they want help and they just don't feel like they can count on the state organizations to do it but that's the only thing that they really feel like they have right 'cause that's the way we have society organized right now as well yeah there are some charitable places out there but ultimately\nIf people need help they turn to the states and as libertarians we don't believe in aggression and we understand that taxation and all these state programs are being run\nA by aggression they're being run by the threat of violence in that if you don't pay taxes\nOr the state will come after you and so therefore your co worst into funding what our ultimate lease them very awful sounding programs and some very you know a ... distasteful experiences for people who are just trying to get help for folks and there's just no doubt in my mind because I Believe in people\nThat if the state programs were to vanish tomorrow which you know there's a libertarian fantasy that can press a button and just make the state you know disappear that\nPeople who need help let's would not only find the help that they need because people in the market people in charity for instance would be able to pick up those balls and run with them if not not developmental services wasn't relying on state funding would they disappear\nI Would say no because they could reach out to the actual community who cone and as you pointed out would then have in the state disappeared would then have all the money they earned and we'll be able to donate to Manhattan knock developmental services\nHave programs that they care about rights so if you don't want fun if you don't want to fund the wall guess what you don't ... you don't want to fund all these wars going on a ... going on across the globe you don't have\nTo take the money that would have been stolen from you and sent to war and actually put it into your local community and help\nPeople like these families right that's what libertarians talk about and you write code and\nA lot of them are very just poor at explaining themselves and why it is\nThat the solutions that we provide which is to say stop using coercion that's all we say hey if you want to raise money voluntarily to help people that's awesome because then it's actually virtuous when you give that money you actually are doing something coming from your own self to give to another\nAnd that's part of the problem not only have and not only my entire life this is the only way to be done either state run or there's a few charities out there doing a good job\nAnd and you have those people who think that they are being virtuous that they are being cared about using other people's money those people were there to fund programs that might actually be good\nOn paper but it's the funding it's the it's the core\nOf how these things are funded that it it's it's it that makes them it's rotten it's like they're they're they're they're based on on being ... just like the school system that I'm always railing against here they get all and that came up here here they are a with their anti bullying policies and always talking about how\nYou know we've got to keep keep these kids in check we don't want them pick on each other and yet their whole\nTheir whole system is just find it on bullying direct their neighbors to fund this rotten\nYou're still eligible for that grand prize of tubes then they get drawn on November seventh\nAnd of course you can learn more about her rise that by going to her rise and ... global H. O. R. I. Z. E. N. or rise that dot global so it was\nWhen when was the last time your clock on the head\n'cause I mean can you can ... yeah like football right or can you continue to use your concussion excuse or is that just you're out on youth are you aware and it's been a couple of years right are you aware of something called post concussion syndrome yeah I just sold that book actually\nA couple of weeks ago actually I was going to give it to you about I sold it yeah I sold it for Fifteen by now there are a small percentage\nOf people that have post concussion syndrome who have memories of the problems and headaches for the rest of their life or have you heard of the tea never heard of is that I was at a news station no\nNo it and I forget exactly what it is a is an acronym for it's one of these really long medical terms chronic something something as simple lawfully I think a but it's basically severe brain damage ... and they right now can only diagnose it posthumously\nA but a lot of the people that are posture basically diagnosed with it they can go back and say oh here are a bunch of ... that\nThey all had concussion ... are they all had many of them a mix but there there are certain patterns of behavior so memory loss again\nOr some people have short term some people have long term uh\nHeadaches irritability those are all symptoms of too many concussions\nOkay let's get back into since we're talking healthcare here we've been discussing you know the libertarian solution which some people at a glance if there if it's not communicated in a compassionate manner written\nAnd they're going to say you've libertarians you don't care about people who just want them to rot in the streets and the reality is the opposite now there may be something we don't care about people okay 'cause the libertarian is just somebody who believes in the non aggression principal and his replies that hopefully consistently\nRight or to their beliefs which does is to say that it's inappropriate to use aggressive force of the threat of it\nTo achieve your social or political goals and in this case uh we're talking about helping people who could use it with a developmentally disabled children\nAnd it was interesting Daryl and I for those who are just tuning in order to keep a forum tonight where we met some of these families and they talked about their experiences with the state system which were every single time poor they were not great experiences are for these rebel\nAnd and the thing is all they could really hoped for\nFrom this meeting was increase budgets and to get bumped up get bumped up the line well right and there's a waiting list here in New Hampshire which they believe the increased budget will take care of that but ultimately\nEven if they get what they want which was the increase budgets it's still not going to solve a lot of the problems inherent with a state run system right okay great now your school system which sucks\nHas a greater budget okay great now these bureaucrats who denied you before have a bigger budget just because they've got a bigger budget doesn't mean they're more likely to approve you it doesn't mean you're going to encounter more compassionate bureaucrats working at these schools are treated your kids rudely what generally happens when there are bigger budgets\nThe people that are paper pushers wind up getting pay raises yeah that's true\nBut even if you start paying people more that doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna get the best quality of people in a state system I don't\nHave that they were going to be more efficient no job that they're not just pointing out that they will get bigger pay raises and that means there's less money going to the people that actually need the monetary assistance\nCorrect and of course as we've pointed out earlier if the government wasn't so regulatory about health care it wouldn't be as expensive as overall and that would save money too but I'm the solution of course is to completely and the states and to end all state funding and all state control over health care\nTo make it so that people can actually contribute voluntarily to the the things the programs the organizations the charities that they support\nAnd it was interesting being there and watching this because some of the people 'cause I'd United Darryl we've been paying attention to the political scene here and and certainly you have as well ... uh for years here in New Hampshire so we know a lot of these players we don't know the minimum intimately but we know who they are\nAnd one of the women who is there who was actually one of the women who was speaking as a family member or somebody who was talking about her experience with Suzanne butcher and she is somebody who is ranked as a constitutional threat previously when she was a state representative\nHere in New Hampshire it was the New Hampshire liberty alliance gives a report card out of all the state representatives and so below asked\nRisk with the tea constitutional threat\nAnd it was interesting kind of getting a look inside of why she you know does the things she does raise got thirty seven year old son who's developmentally disabled and she's had to deal with these frustrations of the system and\nYou know having to raise her son and needing help with it or wanting help with the uh throughout her entire life right basically\nSo I can understand why she was motivated to become a state representative right she wants to make sure the state programs because that's all she feels like there is ... are there for people even though as we were experiencing their crappy programs when they're not the ideal you think she would know better\nIt's like she's experienced this for thirty but it's all she's got a new way to say it's completely that her paradigm has not inside or or her paradigm you know looking at what we're proposing\nWould be shocking an awful to her because she would feel like it would take away everything that they have even though that what they have isn't great it would take away at all and it would then there'll be no safety net whatsoever yeah the safety and it's got holes in it right now but at least to catch it some people so what do you say to that counted gaping holes you say to that I Would try to ah\nWell I mean changes hard and people don't want to change they don't want to try new things even though they weren't quite a long long time ago in ... in the beginning of this country ah but yeah you have to make them understand that\nWhatever money you throw at these institutions they're going to find a way to gobble it up and use it and spend it\nAnd not necessarily a you know create a better outcome just look at a school funding in this country it is skyrocketing it's through the roof right now our our budget here in key went up a million dollars just last year with enrollments going down in Rome is going down schools actually closing and yet\nThe test scores\nHad the test scores got up you would think that would that amount of money or twenty thousand dollars per kid you'd think that they would be speeding up rocket scientists engineers right out of high school kids can't count the ... of them can't read there\nWas an interesting a dichotomy that one woman who was speaking sort of held in her mind she described herself as a conservative she's a school board a chairman in the ... school board which is one of them in the end they bring them in this region and uh she was very excited about the idea of like a voucher\nThat there was a voucher system past but it didn't give us special allocation for developmentally disabled people so her concern was was that well all these other students get to grab their voucher and go to wherever they want to go but the other schools aren't obligated to take her child and even if they weren't going to take it to be more expensive than the old afford it will slow and talk more about this about a fair amount of\nTime and then we'll take your calls of course about anything you want our number here is a fifty five four fifty free three ...\nIf you owe any money to

original and the entire thirty for thirty\nDownloading now\nFinal Harlem last day on barbecue that President Trump said he did not want to ... Saudi Arabia over the disappearance of the Washington Post journalists and he asked for audio recordings Turkish sources say indicated he was killed by Saudi agents in Istanbul corresponding our with Damon says the U.S is awaiting investigators reports\nBelieve that a lot of the specially this the the the legislators who were pushing for these programs if you break it on down and you were to remove the state I'm I Am of the belief that they would be the least likely to be to charities to donate to the such such charities like this\nA speculative I mean you don't have any evidence of that I mean certainly the one one of the women in there is a parents I mean she was also in the state legislature so I don't know if there's\nAny evidence they don't have face in their community and that's true they don't have to say they're projecting they don't have faith in society they don't have they don't believe these programs could exist without ... because they themselves would not participate\nIt's possible I'm not saying or hospital there there are some people\nThat uh and I've and I've run into these people that they think well I Would donate but otherwise nobody else\nWas so therefore I have to force that is very low say what it for other people to contribute or it might not be them themselves but they might be surrounded by friends or family members who are of of that like right grumpy\nAnd they don't want to help or whatever yeah I think you're right about that\nAnd it's sad but that's the difference here that's the key difference between libertarians who believe in the individual and people being good and there's all kinds of evidence for that and and this came up actually in the sentinel interview so the king sentinel is a local newspaper here\nOr were they ask good questions it really is a good interviewer I haven't gone back to watch it but you know being there uh it was really they have some really smart questions and really tough questions and it was it was great to really get a pure volunteer is a pure pro liberty response to some of these questions and the evidence is clear\nIf somebody's house burns down across town wherever it is you live\nAnd they have you know a benefit concert or a walk for the cure or whatever it is that they come up with to help raise money people poor in the phone just\nJust look at any any huge hurricane that's ever taken place in this country\nRight I mean and then there's more money than they can ... you have volunteers loading their their their their U hauls up with food and water clothing and water and supplies down there the hurricane\nExample I wanted to give a typhoon example over in Thailand because yeah we know about the hurricane relief in the U.S but I wanted to point out that not only will people help people across town\nAnd you know donate to somebody to get a new house or you know rent place or whatever after their home home birds down\nBecause they can empathize right at the lousy to empathize with the person who crossed Democrats in my house or I Know that person or I Know that sometimes somebody a cousin or brother or whoever so that's easy to kind of pulling off oh well that's local ... connection right but even when there is it\nThey're still empathy because even though you don't live in Thailand\nOr if they get ravaged by some typhoon that just completely destroys and drowned people and destroy property left and right which happened within the last what was it a decade or ...\nOr so I feel like it's almost a decade now but but anyway that happened and billions of dollars poured into the red cross from people across the United states and elsewhere in the world because people want to help even though the red cross isn't among the organizations\nThey still want to help and they're willing to help people to all the evidence is there that people are willing to help even with the burdens of taxation placed upon them\nUh they're still able to and willing in interested in helping so with burdens of taxation lifted from them\nThey would be able to help even more and without the state organizations the state programs we would see hopefully a thousand flowers bloom of all these different charities and organizations that can actually focused on a local area and can actually provide these people to help they needed like that school\nDown in Massachusetts that one of the women sent her son to after being so frustrated over ... over more than a decade and a half\nOf trying to make the system work for her she just gave up and said her son down to a school that actually is trained you know with professionals who are good at helping developmentally disabled people and it was a private school\nThat that she sent him to and so we would have more of those things because her main concern wasn't that you know it was a private school versus a state school it was that she didn't want to have had to leave the area where he wanted to have him you know be raised\nAnd go to school in the area where he was born where he probably is going to live so he could make connections with the people in this area and now she feels like he has to go there because the state system sucks so bad right that that was her you know her option\nSo it was it was really an interesting you know and lightning kind of a occasion I'm Glad I was able to go I wasn't sure how it was going to be structured our house is going to work but um it really just you know makes it crystal clear that the state programs fail\nThey just do the bare minimum and that it isn't even enough and it doesn't even affect everybody that need the help that want to help\nAnd there's no doubt in my mind because I Believe in people that if we didn't have the state's this idea this terrible idea that justifies aggressive violence against our neighbors that all of these things would be better does that mean things would be perfect no no of course not\nOf course not there are still going to be difficulties in life and a fundraising is always going to be a challenge but it will be easier if people had more money to given the first place and if these organizations could actually tell their stories\nAnd encourage people to give I Know it's got to be hard to stand up there in front of that room and it was certainly you could tell for these ladies that did that to tell their stories right 'cause nobody you know it's your private life right you know you don't want to be telling all the\nDifficulties that your son or your daughter has but when they do that's how people get motivated when they hear those stories and I think that's all it would take is just to communicate that in the marketplace and people would step up and people would get the help that they need\nAnyway we got more come up here let's talk NBC's\nOr on the way plus Canada legalize cannabis today was the number one talking about what it was supposedly like coming up\nHere I don't really

challenging or as I understand that and I've been following this a little bit because I Know Chrissy\nA so she's a libertarian she as a libertarian running or state house in Ohio gotcha and as I understand it because they were challenging your right to vote they were also a de facto challenging\nYour right to be a candidate correct because it may have been three weeks from the ... if you're not registered to vote then you become you're no longer a candidate\nRather than the voices and how many places will let you actually run as a candidate without being registered ... places that heavy

should have already been printed ... two weeks ago\nThey got me to think that after the ballot dining out already started\nBut okay I missed what you said with the outcome was did they say you you

and if you don't mind speculating here because normally libertarian candidates are completely in consequential to most elections\nUm is this a two way race or something like what would make them even care about the fact that you ran against them because usually they just ignore the libertarians and that's all it takes\nA three way race and they pay their eyes debate debate it up and down the

you're an unusual libertarian candidate in that you actually may have a chance of winning this election according to a poll result that the Republicans are hired some polling for him to do\nYet I I I

you sure and they are now out\nGoing to go with the quality of rights opportunity it's kind of gray\nBetter quality of right so that's where that's where I stand what what's the difference I think the quality of opportunity is when you have laws that\nAre support that started to move into the ... such a great sense of equality rights life liberty pursuit of happiness or property and then you start to move towards outcome and that's where opportunity starts to step in and he gets grey who is promoting this equality of opportunity you is that a lefty already I think it's the ... I think the constitution is a is\nSo no libertarians generally would support\nAn ... an equal opportunity so if you want to start a business right now there are all kinds of regulations\nThat apply to various business to okay so there's not an equal opportunity to start a business I see what you're saying there's not an equal opportunity for a lot of different things based on various rules and regulations and structures that exists\nThe reason I asked the question though is because you've heard that phrase before right when it comes to government equal opportunity employer the idea that an employer has to offer an equal opportunity to people of all sorts of uh you know different shapes and sizes\nAnd libertarians generally would oppose that idea on principle saying that well you know you should be able to discriminate if you want to so for instance Hooters\nYou know they want to hire women only and attractive women only they should be able to make that discriminatory decision instead of feeling in some way obligated by some government mandates called equal opportunities that's why I asked the question is to clarify what you meant by that what you're saying is you don't want the government to force some sort of outside version of equality on\nA people you just want the or or you just want them to have the chance to do whatever it is they want without having to ask government permission for right\nNow this is one of the things and if you've ever read Nineteen eighty four\nThey talk about under a new speak how the word equal\nDoes that actually makes sense to anybody because they view equal as meaning everyone has the same height or the same hair color or the same ... the same ability is\nSo and I see that happening now are a lot with the right to where they're like I oppose the equality because reasons of just you know ... the word equal to mean something other than all human beings are fundamentally vests saying\nYou know I Would I blame that on the left definition of equal\nWhich is not what not my definition and I think the rate is up in arms and of course the two tribes fighting with each other it doesn't matter if they both don't make sense it's just it's just it's all about the fight and uh so yeah I think that there I think there are two versions of equality are completely different but because the left\nIs more vocal when that comes to have quality the right this has to be against it doesn't matter if you know it doesn't matter that no one's actually defining what they're against it just hear a quality up against it but I mean I've never actually seen\nPeople on the right who have come out and says I'm against the quality yes\nInteresting yes because they hairy quality and think it means that everybody needs to make the same amount of money or have the same type of vest the same car it\nTends to me that's what I mean that's that's where it's that is the new definition these days it's not even these days I mean is that people have intended that for a long time there is a fantasy that people have\nAnd it's you know mothers mostly people on the left or the right I don't know or whatever but the fantasy is is that the government can somehow force people to be equal\nAnd specifically in reference to the amount of money that they have 'cause obviously you can't force them to be the same height as another person that's ridiculous right um but ah but you know the idea is they can just take a bunch of money for all the rich people and then give it away equally to everybody and that'll solve the world's problems and it's false\nAnd so I'm against that because it can never actually be even if you could\n... again here we are this is left the fantasy right press the button tomorrow 'cause we talk about the libertarian than is the right button make the government go away a press a button or make the state go way\nTowards upstate right press a button tomorrow and then all of a sudden everybody's got an equal amount of money in their bank account or stuffed under the mattress if they don't have a bank account or whatever everybody's gonna equal amount of money\nWithin hours and hours and hours within the same\nExact day that shift will happen to where all of a sudden there's no more equality because some people are most ... I was going to go spend their money their all their ... their funding on lottery ticket or it'd be blurred the horrors or cocaine or whatever it is the way the inequalities no more than ... ... they're going to have to readjust and it can't work with a little magic\nButton that conservatives would want to push\nThat everybody would be moral and obey their version of ethics I guess good question I mean you'd have because Republicans always want to talk about how libertarians vests or liberals that and but now I have to have their own sort of thing\nI I ... I don't want to know tribes I think both tribes want their tribes to think the same\nAs well and I think you ask an interesting question maybe our listeners can call in with an answer that what's the fantasy Republican button right so if it's the left these push a button for money equality the libertarians push a button to end the course of state what is that button if the Republican could push a fantasy button is what would that be wall around our country\nWill go back to the good old days or whatever that at age where they know their place ... wherever they are as ... well the day as everybody that's not me right right yeah like the Republicans by and large I'm not necessarily going to say that every Republican as a racist and that's enough old\nBut they do seem to sort of along for the days when certain groups that aren't white people just sort of knew their place but also\nHow about a aren't men as well yeah well ... thanks so you're asking what they would want I think a lot of a lot of Republicans who art but dude do identify as conservative that's the word we need to\nDissect is I mean could so conservative is a you know family values I'm not going out you're not you conservatives are sky divers they're not trying new things that kind of you know they they like to live in their\nStatus quo conservative and Maine supporter of the status quo ... you want to serve the status quo no they think it means go back to the good old days right whenever that is which is usually a fantasy to some extent right yeah it was\nLife needs to be like it was it and leave it to beaver and have a rabbi Larry that [laughter] and I was never like that\nAnd by the way you're so you're button is to remove the state\nOf course the state that's correct yeah I agree I Would also but I Would also ... that\nAre we the two tribes which are growing further and further I part of one of those to try exactly\nYeah I think I Do I Do believe even though I I'm a little I Do

making copies of themselves year after year after year and they can't see the other side's a they can't they can't emulate the other side because they're so differently so opposed to ... to each

Y. dot com\nOkay great David thank you and keep us up to date and how this is going it's great to hear people who are involved and concern mark in San Francisco with Stan am nine ten in San Francisco what's up our\nBecome you know I think the Democrats should demand the resignation of a Steven Mnuchin for lying to the American people about the deficit and that he caused it with the ... and Ryan and that they're responsible for this deficit that they caused by looting leading us\nA of of of our ah you know Social Security and Medicare\nWhile and Bush did it before them and he had a trillion dollars to the deficit with his tax cut and Reagan did it before them and he added almost two trillion dollars to the deficit with his tax cuts this is I mean we need to roll back all the way back to Reagan we need to go back to the tax rate that we had when Ronald Reagan came into office and we had just completed the three most\nProsperous for the middle class the three most prosperous decades in American history pardon my interruption mark finisher will\nCome to the point is we need to scream out about this who's responsible and what they've been doing and put an end to it once and for all the Democrats need to go down there demand that this man resign yeah ... ... what what he's doing is is you know it's it's definitely a detriment\nTo the to the American people for Social Security and Medicare to pay for this\nYeah it's it's a shame that their sovereign immunity because I think all over America you've got people and and you know who who might want to file a lawsuit against the Republicans the Republican Party individual Republican candidates\nFor basically stealing their their benefits and by the way if you're listening to this show right now and mark thank you very much for for your for your call and you know if you're listening to the show right now in your in your twenties or your thirties or forties and you're saying you know why do I care about Social Security or Medicare for that matter why should I care about it\nWell it number one if you're twenty two years old and you think the Social Security is not meaningful\nAbout a third\nOf the entire Social Security programs payments about a third of it are not going to the elderly no they're not going to retire and people they're going to people who were injured\nIn Social Security disability Social Security is an insurance policy against poverty that's what it is very simply as how it was conceived that's what it does if you're over sixty five it's against the poverty associated with no longer being in the workplace\nIf you're under sixty five it's against the poverty associated with being permanently disabled and unable to work\nMy good friend Michael ... and my dear friend Michael ... who who died just a year or so ago um you know back\nAlmost Twenty years ago Michael was out you know jogging in his forties I mean you know when we were friends with the time he was out jogging in Santa Fe on or about a winter day a cross the bridge with a low guard rail and hit a patch ice and flipped right over the bridge\n\n\n\nWe would have a seven to two progressive majority on the court right now 'cause both Bush and Trump lost in the electoral college\nRight I agree with the caller I agree with your time that the electoral college is\nOutdated anti democratic or I read somewhere that the Senate majority is now going to be representing about Eighteen percent of the population so we do have these structures then or are not reflective of the popular will the only thing we can do\nIn the onslaught of money in these anti democratic uh structures is to mobilize and to get out and vote or in to organize in a way they can over time uh the concerted power on the other side it's a\nA fight or for the soul of our democracy\nLincoln in El Cerrito California you're on the earth guys or some kind of [noise]\nEr what impact do you hope to have\nWell so this is actually falls in line with both the larger\nIf I if I could if I couldn't ... interrupt you before you before you and and and and I am in the context of those two questions are you doing this as theater or are you doing this as a especially religion\n[noise] well I don't see why can't be both um I don't think we'll get mutually exclusive emails\nYou know sort of factors I think that there's something to be said for political theater a because it can be both an incredible commentary on society and on the current state of politics and also really emboldened in and get people who are suffering\nOr so I think it's a mixture of both you know this sort of falls in line with a really\nA Raj history of witchcraft around chime in drought people's each round ages of humankind and much witchcraft has always been practiced by the people on the outskirts you get people on the fringes of people the most at risk and disenfranchised\nAs a but then also it falls in line with a more immediate history which is that of the organization uh which I don't know if you ah have ever read about them but they were a a feminist organization in the sixties uh and which stood for the women's international a terrorist conspiracy\nUm and so ah sorry I I forget actually what it was it was a woman who's international terrorists a conspiracy or to act or something like that\nBut they changed it several times depending on the events that they would do and you know what their first political events ever was in the late sixties and they marched in full regalia on Wall street you have the stockbrokers at the Dow opens didn't believe the next day and that was said to be this great try on\nA so you know it's something it it there is the real religious practice involved but there's also the recognition that like you don't have to believe that and if you just want to share space\nAnd joining an act of solidarity and you want to know that\nYou were hurt and you are understood and you are believed above all a and that this isn't a win for the other side you know we all knew that he was going to get confirmed ah but ah it is a statement that says we're not going to take that we're absolutely not going to settle for this\nThat we're coming for blood and we're not going to federal until we get it you know\nLiterally put on the space to go or ... or ... you say these things on the radio and it can it can bam boom or you're not literally coming for blood\nNo no I don't I don't think that I Need to see by enemies actually die or suffer in physical pain [noise] um I think actually the most satisfying a pain that I could ever wreak on\nSomeone like Brett Kavanaugh or Donald Trump you know these are men that that the scariest thing in the world so that would be to be seen as and potential\nAnd that's what we're acting them you know a hot or not only a pathetic but you're also and ... and you have no power and we're going to overthrow you and that's a very important statement to be made\nThe want to

I think it's twenty four dollars an hour\nNow because the you know the average tax rate on working people as in the thirties thirty to forty percent\nAnd and it's also why if you go back to uh I've I've looked at tax tables going back to Nineteen hundred\nAnd it sure looks to me like if you look at three and five year windows as taxes on working people go up\nWages go up as taxes on working people go down wages go down with regard to the very top though when taxes go down they get more money when taxes go up they get less money is that a reasonable an accurate analysis or am I just out here you know the blowing the hot air into the wind\nNo no no you're bringing up something that is quite valid and it is unfortunately very poorly understood in the larger population but if I could speak for a moment to what your caller said\nThere is no way to nail down in any definitive way\nWhether a wage increase that he may have gotten say over the last eight months since the\nTax cut of two thousand Seventeen took effect was because of the tax cut as opposed to twenty five other possible reasons that lead that employer to raise his wage the employer might say something like a on share with you what I got as a tax cut\nBut both Bloomberg service the Financial Times half a dozen agencies have now study what corporations did across the board\nWith the tax cut money\nAnd their conclusions were very few somewhere between three and five percent of American workers got any portion of that tax cut it was overwhelmingly used\nFor stock buybacks such when companies by back their shares in the market to raise dividends to shareholders and to raise a pay packages for top executives which corporations are free to do and which is what they in fact did all this talk\nAbout how we would end up helping workers' wages that's just the same old trickled down nonsense that if we give a tax cut the corporations that are rich somehow it's going to find its way into average people's pockets\nThat is very rarely true and the statistics are now in that it has not been the case with the tax cut of December twenty Seventy\nYeah and then and he was asserting that his taxes were a thousand dollars lower does he had a thousand dollars a year more in his in his pocket\nBut I I've I've also seen numbers that are in and this I just I just saw this couple of days ago that the suggested that while the average income the average wage in the United states is around forty four thousand right now the median wage in the United states and there was half above half below\nIs only thirty three thousand two hundred dollars and the reason for that difference is that the average includes all these people who are making ... literally millions and millions of dollars at the very very top of the wage scale\nA and but that's not that many people it's just a hell in a lot of money and so the media and is actually you know a reflection of what\nMost people in America are earning which is in the low thirties and or is that accurate\nAbsolutely I and and let me quote to you a wonderful piece of a statistical work done by the economic policy Institute in Washington DC they divided wages into high medium and low and they asked the question\nHow have these three parts of the wage distribution done between Nineteen eighty and now and what they show which is starkly\nIs that the lowly of wage people are actually worse off if you adjust for prices as all of these numbers do they are worse off now they can afford lash out of their weekly wage and then they could Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty roughly\nThe middle group is just slightly above maybe three or four percentages above now what they were back in Nineteen eighty thirty eight years ago\nOnly the high wage people saw an appreciable increase in the neighborhood of thirty to forty percent\nWhich means that over the last Thirty years the missile and the bottom which is more than fifty percent\nWent absolutely nowhere or shrank in terms of what they were getting for the labor effort they put out only those at the top\nAnd particularly because of the very top as you just noted were able to do better\nAnd that's a large explanation for the political divide we have for the rage in the population that watches a show called wealth effect of the recovery that seems forever to pass them by\nTheir right it has passed than by but the whole last Thirty years have passed them by they've gotten the wage increases the vast majority meanwhile their productivity what they do for their employer has gone up and therein lies the explanation for growing inequality\nThe people who do the work are stagnant and the people who get the fruits of that work\nAre gathering in accumulating wealth producing the kinds of divisions that are roiling our culture and our politics\nYeah and then we talk about average wages instead of median wages because we're just economic interests all of that disguises and there you go that's that's that's very well said\nSo we'll see how this all shakes out and so [noise] it's it's just a remarkable time and and uh but rolling back the Republican tax

I think it's twenty six states maybe it's more than ...\nWhere Republicans are in charge of the voting process and according to Greg palace they've purged fourteen million people in the last twelve months in each one of those states to find one person one person who can who get who is sufficiently articulate intelligent and telegenic you know we can go on TV\nAnd and in a very clear and passionate way say this is what happened to me you know I and and yes trying to get veterans as much as possible but I I don't think veterans are quite as iconic as they once were\nBut but uh yes this was you know I have been voting in the same place for and you know in some states that will be an elderly person and some of them will be younger person or whatever it may be and do that state by state and then build a website That's got all fifty of those are all thirty those state you know a little of the the the one on one minute ads as YouTube clips on it\nAnd to promote the hell out of that because you're absolutely right Diane the number one strategy I mean historically Republicans have had strategy is like oh we're gonna\nWe're gonna have anti gay measures on the ballot right I mean that was the big thing back in two thousand or in Ninety eight\nOr or you know a a were you know ... back in the Nineteen eighties you know we want to we want to bring prayer back into our schools I mean they'll find some things that they put on the ballot to try to mobilize their base\nThey can no longer find anything that mobilize their base outside of maybe ... brown people which is you know which immigration is a ... too\nSo instead what they're doing is they're just simply trying to remove a young people old people and people of color young white people the older ... you know why people Ruth retired people actually of all races\nOn and and people of color from the voting rolls that you know voter purges now or their main electoral strategy which is just obscene and yes it should be highlighted Diane thank you that was absolutely brilliant I Love it Patricia in College Station Texas ain't Patricia what's up\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm well two things I've learned to make a comment about Kevin all but ...

to see the column yet that that they printed\nRapturous morning yeah a basically calling for a free press and the Arab world and then there was enough to getting murdered and couldn't cut up with a bone saw while he was still alive\nOr exactly and uh it was sent I think actually the very day he disappeared so the the post you know ran it and the interesting thing of course is that he was exiled from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia not over a fact of calling for a revolution\nOf the kingdom but the fact that he had bad mouth then president elect Donald Trump is the reason\nReally Oh yes\nYou can that's verifiable at the white when he got in trouble again he was not in the inner circle but he had a relationship with uh the NBS as they call\nThe Saudi royal for how rich\nYou know and he didn't call he called for changes in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia as you know I I Lived there in Nineteen eighty three so I'm very familiar with the Saudi ways but he didn't call for a revolution\nOf of the king him you know over the king and show it wasn't on the outs for that reason but he did get in trouble when he um about well when he bad mouth to a Donald Trump it was president elect at the time and it led to the exile and that she'll verifiable fact\nThat's incredible right oh the Saudis are protecting Trump now truck Trump is protecting the Saudis and Trump is apparently benefit to the tune of millions of dollars from the Saudis over the years um but tens of millions of dollars and a ... you know now we've got this report from the New York times that he is a fraud and a tax the cheat\nOr that he that he has committed multiple felonies but his entire family has participated in the guys are con artist I mean you know the Trump crime family has extensive but his daughter was lying to investors about the the number of apartments that they had sold\nThe buildings and so the investors invested in the buildings and the the the trumps walked away with thirty to fifty million dollars in the investors got screwed on apparently his daughter is a graft or as well obviously ... dad went to prison for being a graft or I\nMean we've got the entire grabbed her family here and there are tied in with the Saudis\nWell you said it better than I could list of things and now there are eleven senators now no none of them are Republican but I Do want to know that two Republicans shattered Rubio and Senator Graham have come out\nRather aggressively about doing something about Saudi Arabia but ... senators have asked in a letter to the president\nUh they want to know information about the business relationship\nOf the Trump corporation with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and one of the reasons uh of course the president cited that we need to uh you know basically be calm about this because we need to have the Saudis help us with the Iranians how on earth the Saudis can help us with the Iranians is beyond\nMe Saturday I Want to go to war with Iran and sort of way they want us they would they want us to do it too of course to the to the last American soldier\nRight they don't have a military now this has changed dramatically\nIronically the death of ... a ... and so unfortunate and so horrific how they killed him\nYou know it was not an accidental a situation going wrong from an interrogation they were cutting off finger after finger until they they cut off all his fingers it took seven minutes for him to die\nAnd that was not an interrogation gone wrong that was torturing premeditated murder\nAnd also the person who flew from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia was the personal head of a security for the crown prince so these this was well planned to the level of the crown prince\nOut and bought what do you think about this guy who died in the car crash share this this suspicious car crashes are\nThirty one year old air force lieutenant in the Saudi air force who are I'm Sorry I I I lost his name here but uh he apparently was it was either associated with it was part of this Fifteen man hit team um do you think that ah maybe he was just killed off and now they're going to blame it on him\nOr you know that's possible look they are not going to come out and say we you know plan this chick cetera now they will eventually dumped the crown prince if in fact there's enough pressure put on them that's how they do take care of this to to basically depots him\nAnd then put somebody else in his place because it is a business Cancun they don't care about women's rights they don't care\nAbout it he's going to fight I mean you know he he locked up all his peers in the in the hotel there and and torture and one of them to death and this and shook him down for apparently hundreds of billions of dollars I mean he's got to be he's got to have consolidated both his wealth and his power in ways that make it much more difficult to do that than it might have been before he did this\nOr that is true now all the businesses that you read that it pulled out is by the way now or secretary of treasury after all everybody else pulled out after a lot of heat has now said he won't go over there but he waited ... that's the whole point of this\nGenre files

President Trump on his investigation into reports Saudi Arabia was behind the murder of journalist you mall shooting gee but as it turns out to us we'll wait until the Saudis complete their own investigation before deciding what to do Turkish\nA alliance with a hard line fundamentalist preacher mom it had been up to the lab\nAnd he and his followers have ever since been supporters of the monarchy [noise]\nSo uh you don't have a strong separation or any really any separation of religion and state in Saudi Arabia the\nUh the the the the monarchy is very closely tied to these will hobby clerics\nAre who you know preach this a puritanical form of Islam which is very peculiar I mean it's on like the way Islam is practiced and in Tunisia or Egypt or you know there are one point five billion Muslims or twenty two million Saudis so\nIt's a it's off in its own corner but inside Saudi Arabia the lobby a branch is extremely powerful\nA and there's always been a kind of of back and forth between the power of the kings and the power of the hobby clergy\nAnd what's happened is that this new crown prince Mohammed bin saw him on is moving more towards a kind of medieval European idea of absolute monarchy is not constrained even by the church uh and uh as\nA way to Henry the eighth [laughter]\nYes exactly I mean uh uh he he is a cracking down on the power of the hobby a establishment or they would bother people you know a boy and a girl went to a cafe together in public that's not allowed because I have\nJay which they would come around and and they just run up and start whipping them are screaming at them and getting them off and he's put an end to that or he slowed down\nHe told those people to go home and uh so\nSo that has like a good thing how do how do we add up with a guy who was killing a that Americans are arrows American resident journalist\nWell it's it's sort of like I'm a to make a historical analogy we've gone towards Thomas Hobson leviathan you know argued for absolute ...\nTurkey and uh for its power even over the religious religious sphere uh and then John Milton ... wrote the REO ... about how the state shouldn't be interfering with people's freedom of conscience or censoring people and and the from a puritan point of view he was writing\nSo I think what's going on here is if you put all your\nEggs all your power all your prerogative is in the hands of an absolute monarch\nWhere there's no check and balance a then that might be a form of you know forced a top down modernization and but it's not going to produce stability and it's certainly not going to produce any any liberties\nYeah a tour marketable so so it seems that the essentially structurally it's going to be a long long time if I ever before the Saudis start practice practice in a form of\nOf uh of Islam that that is a more tolerant or for that matter even have a a political structure in place that resembles anything other than an absolute medieval monarchy\n[noise] yeah is you know the Saudis had been I'm a kind of an oligarchy there were a seven branches of the ruling family that alternate needed in producing a king and they kind of consulted with each other\nAnd what ... did was to get rid of that oligarchy you make a coup against it and then to substitute a his and his father's power of solely for it for a and a while you know some of the things they want to do need to be done he recognizes that oil\nYou know it was over with soon because everybody will go to electric cars and renewables and it's bad for the earth\nAnd so
