of the pieces from it he starts out this September fourth\nAnd he says a a a asked the 'cause this rhetorical question what's a pattern of bias\nAnd does a pattern prove by us and he says you know this is a is an important question because ever since John Roberts got put on the court there have been all these five four decisions in fact Ninety two percent of the time he says when\nThe Republican justices well there's a quote from him he says uh\n... the Roberts five has gone on eighty percent of these parts of the partisan excursion since robbers became chief justice and there is a

[noise]\nWe've got a a what the consequences of putting Brett Kavanaugh or any other right wing or on the court would mean which is why there are some of us and Republicans are accusing Democrats of this already this Mitch McConnell is very clear that he thinks this is the Democratic strategy and it frankly I think should be\nIs that if the Democrats win the Senate in November they will refuse\nTo see anybody else to put anybody else on the Supreme Court\nUntil Donald Trump's until the investigations into the legitimacy of Donald Trump's presidency have concluded it's a much better rationalization than the one that Mitch McConnell had which is hey you know he's just a black guy as a as a black president we can ignore what he wants for a year\nI mean I obviously that's not what he said what he said was well ... election coming well there's an election coming in two years I mean it was it was such a BS like\nBut uh Alex Henderson over an alternate published a piece here the

state\nLife is short nasty and British you know without the intervening force of church or state is what Thomas opposite and all of that and this is the core of the other conservative worldview that you need to have an authoritarian state so I what I'm saying is\nThat the Supreme Court has been so heavily politicized now\nAnd you know that I Would say frankly since since the since Eighteen Seventy something you know ... or Abraham Lincoln took the size of the court up to ten so that he can start winning decisions Andrew Johnson who followed him\nWhen a general Sherman gave fifty thousand African Americans forty acres and mule Andrew Johnson then president of the United states retracted that a case went to the Supreme Court around it and Johnson reduced the size of the Supreme

nature of our society there there have always been ever since they are cultural revolution there have always been people who have\nHad more than others and it you know but but I Do have a problem with people who are using their wealth to influence politics for the sole purpose of preserving and enhancing their own wealth when doing so works to the detriment of the rest of society\nI have a big problem with that with the Koch brothers running into a very profitable very polluting company and then buying politicians who will then fight pollution regulations I have a problem with that\nAnd and and and I think Gary also\nWe have to acknowledge the very good science that's been done and it's very easy to find with a simple doctor goer Google Search\nOn the very good science has been done the shows that people who people of privilege people who grow up with wealth people who've never wanted people have never had to to to you know wait a week to be able to go to McDonald's for that great

it but it's a reality\nThat doesn't mean that all rich people are not empathetic or that they're all bad and in fact you know this sounds patronizing but some of my best friends are really rich but you know that [noise] that it does mean that that we've got a problem with rich people in this country that's my point here\n\nAlready spawn okay All right\nJerry thanks for the call a ... let's see here Karen in winter haven Florida Karen what's on your mind\nHey Tom I Know you're a big Frances Perkins fan as ...\nOr ... she was incredible she she's the woman who wrote the new deal essentially she was the first female lead labor secretary with FDR\nYeah she was the the people legislator basically um and there is a great book on line it's an old one it's written in Nineteen Seventy six by George Martin and you can still get a hold of it it gives you more of the politics that were behind all the decisions that were made at the time and\nWhen Roosevelt brought out the bill\nOn what they call now court packing um [noise] the mistake was that they they came up with it a secret in fact she thinks that it was really\nA written by attorney general Cummings and the time and um and they had to write to the Congress but let it go smacked everybody and she felt that the time that Owens Robin Roberts was becoming more liberal\nAnd that there were two or three conservative justices that were\nAbout to retire and she simply felt that it was the wrong move it the wrong time but once I had gotten out there it was worth about ego that he kept pushing for it um but eventually it did die in committee and the justices did start to become more liberal and he\nGot Roberts was the first guy changed his vote as I recall\nRight yeah that's where Francis was she felt it was\nToo much of a risk politically to do it the way he did it but people need to understand the bill was also kind of strange in that it said that for every justice that did not retire at age Seventy six months after that President Roosevelt would be able to\nAppoint a Supreme Court justice up to six of them so that's pretty extreme awful\nRight and all the justices or Seventy all of their votes consolidated into one vote as I recall\n[noise] they were ...\nI don't remember that I'm particularly but I remember that ah [noise] ah it was this odd configuration of where he could get up to six justices\nYeah so do you think that if the Democrats take the house and Senate and the and and if there's a complete sweep and twenty twenty two and a half year two years from now or do you think that it would be wise for the Democrats to try to increase the size of the Supreme Court nine eleven or Thirteen\nI knew a simply because a state with a seat was stolen from them um and if we get this history this past history

is the website or citizen dot org slash trade a and a Lorrie welcome back to the program thank you very much\nIt's always great talking with you so a Trump was on TV this morning saying that he's got a new deal that replaces NAFTA and uh it's the best thing since sliced bread the deal was a terrible deal and we're not and we're not going to call this NAFTA anymore Bloody Bloody bought\nIt seems to me though that well actually before I say what it seems to me what what what's your take on this\n[noise] so the new deal has found improvements we've long advocated for ...\nSome terms we have long opposed including some recycled from the Trans Pacific partnership and the bottom line is that a lot more work wired\nTo stop NAFTA's ongoing job outsourcing downward pressure on wages environmental damage\nAnd the jury is kind of out if the final package\nIs going to get us there there are two big question is number one is the tax it got released last night what's actually going to end up in front of Congress next year ... that would happen next year and depending on what happened to the election nose\nAnd then number two what is going to be in the fall package what's going to be in the implementing legislation trends unions are working right now to try and get in implementing all\nLanguage that could make some some want improved labor standards actually enforceable which right now they're not sufficiently mhm\nWhat about what about pharmaceuticals I read the uh this uh this bill ... and maybe this is what was borrowed from a TPA that are ... to ... uh\nThe TPP shooting or that or if it extends the the patents for these are the pharmaceuticals in ways that will um you know permanently keep our prices high and also raise prices for pharmaceuticals in Canada and maybe Mexico\nYep that's one of the things we have long opposed and it's really outrageously big time big pharma giveaways and here we are in a free trade agreement and right in the heart of it are the protection of monopoly is\nFor pharmaceutical firms to avoid competition and have the ability to charge crazy high prices on the cutting edge\nA biologic drug large molecule drug\nAnd medicines and yet it seems like ... and in its medicines that used to treat cancer\nAnd the\nThe bottom line is prevention is like that which could lock in the U.S from making important reforms in the future and would definitely raise prices in Mexico and Canada that\nIt seems to me ... what's going on here Laurie and and reality check this for me please\nUm is that Donald Trump on the campaign trail identifies a real problem NAFTA has caused over a million jobs to be lost in the United states that the government acknowledges him and most people you know or the the opinion that have certainly probably you know six eight ten million jobs are lost as a result of that or whatever it may be a huge\nNumber one so he says I Want to do something about this then so everybody goes yeah great you know what's it like this guy and I think that that's you know that really helped him in Michigan Pennsylvania Ohio et cetera Wisconsin\nAnd then he takes this terrible deal and two weeks it a little bit gets rid of some of the really ups obscenely objectionable stuff\nBut then an addict as we had a bunch of goodies for his buddies\nUm it you know who are supporting his campaign and giving them money and at the end of the day it's pretty much a wash it's really not going to bring jobs back it's really not going to solve the the big problems that we are confronting um but he gets to declare victory and for the rooms and watch Fox News they're all going to think he actually did what\nHe campaigned on is that are being too cynical or is that an accurate analysis\nThat may be where we are\nWhen the thing comes to Congress next year I think it's worth reserving judgment for one really important about two really important reason is the one that is the outstanding issue so there are some serious changes in the agreement\nI think it's an exact description of Trump and when he's up to but it's also the case that his top trade guys in the U.S trade representative is a guy named Robert Lighthizer\nAnd he's a serious guy for and he has opposes NAFTA and investors state tribunals and job outsourcing\nSuper smart and he's the guy's been running the show on this yep so he actually has made some real changes that that are worth harvesting that are important that could make a difference so the investors states disputes elements system those outrageous corporate\nCourt lights in tribunals are\nWhacked way way way back that corporate lobbies hysterics about this the investor incentives that basically subsidized job outsourcing the protections that meant less risky and cheaper most got whacked that's that's the real stuff transformational stuff actually show however\nApropos of your point about some of the corporate bodies they left a little opening a loop hole into ... oil and gas companies can try and why angle their way back into a state\nSo it's like hey you know Ninety percent solution on a very big problem so that they wrote some decent labor standards including this fairly dramatic antics\nThat for the first time would require that workers in Mexico get secret ballot elections on their union contracts right now there's like a there's like a whole racket where these companies basically get paid by the boss to register a union they are themselves you know written down as a union but it's a business\nAll aboard joined me all the ways\nFor once in

check in with our media news and find out what's going on in the world has report brought to you by goes for the old ... dot com and Ellen writers new book bloody and what you do on the line and this is Bob Ney the author side swipe congressman welcome back\nWell thank you Tom that crew sounds fantastic\nYeah I'm looking forward to it Louis and I haven't been on a cruise alone one time and and this is a this is really a kind of super fancy one uh which you know in our in our ... chair luxury than we've never experience that's fine so anyhow what's up in the world today Bob\nWas kind of a President Trump and Kavanaugh FBI day I'll call it but if we can start a first of all uh of course we know what happened with Senator Flake and he had made the decision to\nSupport an FBI look into this entire thing\nAnd I had a lot of criticism and then at some point in time it seems that rationally you know seemed to of course go along with it he didn't have much of a choice anyway and then the Sunday shows started everybody would have kind of kept quiet for the show from camp by I don't think would have had as much controversy\nBut then there were comments about uh you know that the president didn't want it to be a fishing expedition et cetera\nSo now the president has said as of today was today that he wants the FBI investigation of the allegations against cap it ought to be quote comprehensive but that he will ultimately defer to the Senate Republicans to dictate the scope\nSo there was a national media report about the president providing the bureau with the witnesses they can't interview the White House is disputing that\nBut I don't know no one knows yet what the Senate Republicans ... at this point in time you are saying about it\nI think Trump is lying through his teeth 'cause he does that so often and so well\nDirections of what to do with it yeah\nI you know I think he's trying to characterize this as as something other than a than a handcuffed uh the investigation the FBI is told you can talk to these poor people if they offer you other witnesses or other people that you should talk to you may not talk to them\nYou can't take this any further than this you can't look into the question of how many times he committed perjury before the United States Senate in the past\nYou can't you can't look into the charges from a ... neck\nA Julius y neck or that in a gang rape was going on you may not and but you know I mean it's just it's a it's\nIt's wall paper you know it's a it's a it's essentially a cover up\nNow we all know that the FBI or brings back sometimes it's called non determination oh you know stats are facts but I think that um I Would assume that the Democratic side will be able to or the FBI\nYou know what what was your scope and what it wasn't I Would assume they're going to have to answer that if in fact it's been narrowed\nWith the interference from the White House that may actually cause I'm some votes to go against Kavanaugh Republican yes it may who vide especially for college or extreme heat\nFor Collins and maybe I'm Rogalski yeah it may provide heat if they and frankly flake himself who asked for this I mean if you ask for something and then it is you find that is directly narrowed by the White House the White House can ask for something for example in the case of Anita Hill\nYou know it was asked for they did a three day look at everything\nBut the White House as I understand in that case didn't say here's what you look at they told them to look at you know the uh the allegations against Clarence Thomas\nYeah I Wonder where ... is an animal anyhow what else is up absurdly\nAnyway yeah I wanted to say it but you know you can always say well it's inconclusive kept the ice as a stain on that on the topic of you know releasing information ... represented Maxine Waters has denied\nOn she died this weekend to aid in our office posted personal confidential information about three members of the um [noise] really a Judiciary Committee who are Republicans and that was backed up by uh\nThe IT section by the way the U.S house because they they can determine I can address this you know et cetera so I didn't want to mention that 'cause I got a little bit of a\nOf controversy to it you know we're period of time we are looking at NAFTA it's to be determined yet what exactly it means I mean I think it's positive that there was a deal cut frankly uh I didn't think candidate was going to come into it whatsoever but at at at nine o'clock to nine thirty right before the uh [noise]\nYou know the deadly I've been told Tom I don't know if you pick\nIf anything that this was orchestrated by Jared Kushner have you pick that up the trade deal yes\nNo I my understanding is Robert Lighthizer has been running the show\nRight but I I was told no I don't know my friends on Capitol Hill to push ahead a huge a back and forth was I don't know doing some type of talking with somebody in Canada too\nOh yeah he might be the guy who brought Canada into it I I just I have no idea\nI haven't I haven't heard that I don't have it confirmed by Showtime but I Do want to mention it that was possible so we've got to see the details of it and where you know in fact it all waist down has launched missiles into eastern Syria and that's a basic retaliation\nOr they are saying uh against militants over there who have stirred a lot of um different you know obviously much against it in ... in the south western region\nOf the laws in support of Assad essentially\nRight right and that's the uh the militant area which is also against the Saudi and against Iran and of course Iran is pointing out you know the implications the involvement of Saudi Arabia and it shows again that remains to be a little bit of a out or cake\nI yeah I was just going to say Saudi Arabia can't be happy that Iran is helping Assad\nRight and and there's proxy wars and then you have John Bolton in the White House who was constantly saying bomb bomb bomb and a is a great influence just you know his position with an essay\nAnd then a there's a new democratic strategy this is fascinating ah I like grassroots politics\nAnd if you look what President Obama has been saying about uh you can bring your hand you can yell you can be angry and that's good but you need to do certain things well the national democratic training committee Andy tc is launching the first ever online training platform it's called vote builder it's targeted by the waste all most specifically\nFor the most part two legislative

N. de\n... its its economic crisis so in because of Henry Kissinger and the CIA a ... and the IMF and you know they orchestrated a crisis in Chile they created a crisis there was fuel shortages and everything else\nOf Weimar is is or I covered the war in Yugoslavia which was also caused by an economic meltdown what it is in essence the the established political elites are unable to respond in a rational and effective way to increasing distress within the society and then are finally discredited by\nA usually an economic crisis uh in our case you had the destruction of the popular movements including labor unions and I would argue the press that once protected\nAmerican working men and women are in essence the and both the Republicans and Democrats especially under Clinton are culpable so the system seizes up its seized by a cabal in this case corporate\nSo all of the institutions rewrite the Louis ... out of the book on this divide there's essentially two tiered legal system one for the rich one for the oligarchy one for corporations and then one for us\nUm I mean they look at this point of orchestrated virtually attacks boycott under Eisenhower are the highest tax rates for the wealthiest individuals and corporations was Ninety One percent\nI'm In and out of control military we used to challenge weapon systems now Trump just gave them a ten percent increase and the running the wars in the middle east so essentially what happens is the system doesn't respond to the rights and grievances of the underclass and that\nProvides fertile territory for a demagogue like Trump or in the case of Yugoslavia so but I'm Milosevic Radovan heritage or go back to Weimar because in Nineteen twenty eight the Nazi Party in Weimar was pulling in the single digits then you had the Nineteen twenty nine crash\nHow did ... and the Social Democrats respond well they imposed draconian forms of austerity are demanded by the international banking system that had bail the government out including abolishing\nUnemployment insurance and what I fear as we stand on the cost of another economic dislocation it's coming even the New York times a couple of weeks ago ran an editorial on this or is that\nA everything is in place for some very frightening re configurations of American society we already have a president in office who insights violence\nWho is a openly carry out attacks against other ethnic and racial groups I mean the whole idea that eleven million undocumented workers all of whom probably aren't below the minimum wage or somehow responsible for the economic freefall of the United states is patently absurd\nBut when they have a lock on the media system so I mean I mean you discuss it but but you know when or even on MSNBC are ever going to hear a serious discussion of corporate capitalism and how it works that that's been banished from the airwaves to\nYeah and so and so we have now\nThe Republican Party planning to impose austerity on us\nA this you know and when we had these tax cuts permanent when this is insane but it goes beyond that I mean there there are serious conversations going on inside the Republican Party right now about can we use this debt or or wherever they ...\nYou know this was the ... latest out in Seventy six with is to Santa Claus theory when you know when Republicans are in power run up to ... am a crash coming to power just scream about the death and Reagan to write and exactly and in fact Reagan was the first president to actually enact when his case to Santa Claus to replant\nMe triple the national debt and the debt is reaching the point now where within ten years our interest payments on the national\nDebt and New York times nine hundred bill yeah are going to exceed our military or the right and well not just the military education oh all the military budget already alright alright has subsumed all that stuff\nAnd so what it is providing these guys is and their guinea about yeah perfect excuse\nTo to impose austerity are literally just say you know we really can't afford\nFederal long term unemployment insurance I mean they've already cut about a one year we can no longer afford Social Security longer affords Medicare Medicaid we can't afford that that's for poor people\nAnd and and and then they're going to get a court if they get Kevin on the court is going to go back to the locker era and say you know Medicare and Social Security or actually unconstitutional they should be voluntary programs and the minute they become voluntary programs they're dead this is a massive re configuration of America they were right on the edges robot he's talking about the strikes that the Republicans that I Know who are\n... ... is there any I Know I I Can't come up with a better word this is about\nHappen when they're working on that since Nineteen thirty\nFive when John Ralston Saul calls are slow motion coot coup d'etat Don slow motion and we are now coming to the ... of that and then and then let's be clear to the Democratic party has been culpable in this\nOh I agree you know this is the deal and that is not just a Republican yeah in the late eighties yeah this this is ... do you are right we are now and for the Democratic and away from that and that's why the police\nIn your town or carrying long barreled weapons in wearing Kevlar vest and driving armored personnel carriers\nRight because they're they're anticipating social unrest which will happen if we have austerity so Chris Hedges what do we do about this\nWe have to ... you know and the ... the problem is is not an overnight we have to rebuild those popular movements that\nCreated a rational response where the breakdown of capitalism under Roosevelt in the Nineteen thirties so they start with unions of course unions we have to rebuild I mean we people like you and me who've been pushed to the margins of\nThe media landscape of because of the subjects that we tackle our taboo uh I'm In the corporate landscape including of course Comcast which owns MSNBC or NPR PBS is a wholly owned subsidiary now the Koch brothers um so we have to rebuild\nInstitutions to ... power against power but they have done a very effective job and we just had this right to work law I mean there's a this was also another track that there is a constant assault\nOn a ah all of those mechanisms by which we can organize a game self knowledge and understanding\nAnd resist that's what the abolition of net neutrality is about that is what Google algorithms which are imposed on the left wing sites black agenda report counter punch alternate truth did which I write for we have seen referrals from impressions or would you type in let's say imperialism in\nGoogle if I had written an article on ...

because the video is there also Donald Trump was standing outside the the Rose Garden and uh decided to do a press conference after his little rough about uh\nYou know the the NAFTA replacement and a silly of a Vega of ABC News raised her hand and he called on her and she said that I hear this right and the Trump\nKind of turns to the men around him either and and they all start laughing by the way when he says\nHe says she's shocked that I picked her she was in the state of shock\nAnd Cecilia Vegas as a I'm not thank you Mr President Trump says then\nI okay I I that's okay I Know you're not thinking you've never do\nAnd Sicilia Vegas says I'm Sorry and at that point you know all these guys behind Trump or just laughing hysterically like oh yeah he's putting down a woman and he says oh go ahead go ahead\nI mean just the casual disregard of the humanity of other people it's just rest take bill in the alternate Illinois bill what's on your mind today\nYeah Hi I'm a thank you for allowing me to exercise my First Amendment rights share and also thank you for having Chris Hedges on who's my favorite our writer\nUm and she was a Stephen King and all the stories unfortunately or non fiction professor the reason I called is um I got a suggestion for people in heavily blue states I'm In Illinois\nOr got urban and ... and I you know it was very pleased with the ... this time out\nOr in his performance as we're proud of him um\nHowever I think a lot of people in blue states they feel like well\nMy guys are are you know they're down with it Joe ... is so well I'm doing this I just got off the phone with the shouldn't columns his office and I'm calling Murkowski a corporate shoes or get off and do I'm not a constituent of\nWhat I Try to pressure on them is that I have the right to exercise my free speech which include now because it was called\nMoney is now free speech so I Will if they would all be watching to see if they do the right thing as we move ahead here and there's this\nThing with with Kavanaugh if they don't do the right thing I'm making a flash that I Will support their opponents in you know in the face of a shift in college I think she's up in Twenty one\nI'm In I Will I Will work phones I Will shed whatever money I can and I will do I wide with Murkowski or I don't think you need to necessarily\nYou know keep adjust to the strategic a senator is you know I Would advise you to call their senators as well but it seems like they're probably the easiest one is uh what do you what do you think about that idea\nThink it's a reasonable strategy I think that um you're you're always going to be well I Know that you're always going to be most effective contacting the elected representatives to represent you\nUh you're a member of Congress your two senators are that's and and and do a lotta people hesitate to do that\nBecause they figure oh you know well beer Patty Murray represents me in Washington state or I got Ron Wyden you know and and and and Jeff Merkley um you know ... ... well also in Washington state why do I have to see how they're going to do the right thing but the fact of the matter is that if they can say to the Republican\nConstituents you know I I got seven thousand phone calls on this issue and and a nine percent of them were\nIn or anything like that that's actually useful stuff but but also um you know ... and ... and funding and phone banking for and all the stuff that you just described bill that's that's the core stuff that's the that's where the real juices\nGreat great I'm Glad to hear you think I'm On the right track 'cause that's what I'm going to do a follow up with emails their officers as well\nYeah actually physical letters if you ... it don't send them to the D.C offices because that takes six weeks for the anthrax check but you can settle letters and the local offices and they'll get at the same week and a handwritten letters in particular have a tremendous impact among Saturday live\nStart tying was the essence but I I'll actually do go to Iraq and\nShiny and actually the one thing that you can send that will get through to Washington as a postcard postcard don't have to go through the ... anthrax check and that's that's another thing another great toy bill I Need to move along the banking for the call spot on I I really appreciate your your input your feedback and what you're doing Jerry in Lansing, Michigan my home town Jerry what's up\nA town well uh I have a point to make and then I have a couple of ah just suggestions um ... we keep talking past each other and they were not getting through and we're not we are not convincing anyone but I'd like to make this point\nDr Ford has already passed a polygraph in and another woman has agreed to it\nJudge Kavanaugh or I heard in the media has written a legal paper supporting the use of of the a polygraph a and he said he wants to prove his innocence and clear his name and that he will do anything in that regard\nNo no he said he would do anything the Republicans on the committee ask him to do and we shouldn't\nBe hearing but I Believe he said in other instances all he wants to do is clear his name he said that on Fox yeah okay [laughter] I Know uh he uh we know that a a polygraph is not a admissible in court but we're not conducting a court hearing", "show_name": "The Thom
