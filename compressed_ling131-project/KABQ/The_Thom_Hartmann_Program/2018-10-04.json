letter Iraq ... officers and sheriff's deputies came under fire in Florence County South Carolina in an update sheriff Kenny boon says one officer has died six other members of law enforcement injure\nNo it was sitting down and mine was just sitting there\nAnd the black screen lit up and this warnings thing came up and there was this you know little triangle thing that was just flashing to get my attention and then it didn't vibrate and making noise it did nothing and light up and\nI Hope this number ... locked down this great [laughter]\nIt's so annoying to have the government be able to just send you messages and of course all of these phone companies are going along with whatever this program is um there's just I'm sure there's some sort of mandate on them to do this or maybe they're just doing it because they're good corporate citizens so but the other way\nThe war to act which was an avenue for warning alert and response network that was signed into a thousand six that says cell phone users cannot opt out of presidential ... and then there was another\nI'm going to figure out a way to do it because I I heard all you can dry up and all that there was discussion about this this afternoon or in the one of the cats we have right local law activists here\nAnd apparently the allegation is that if you have a special\nOperating system on your phone called lineage o s\nWhich is kind of like is that how did I and I said my God it was ... also all the I I only last night which widens preceded by other people don't know what either of those things are\nThere like a special kind of hacker geek or operating system that you have to do a lot of ... spent ... dangerous steps to your phone to be able to get this thing to work so\nYou have to be willing to basically destroy your phone to do what they call a brick\nOr observers phone in order to get to\nThe point where you can load this thing on\nAnd or or if you do load this thing on it could break your phone depending if you don't follow the instructions just right or the instructions are partially wrong\nAnd you don't know that so there's like it's a pretty risky thing to do but the ... the rumor is is that people would this operating system can go and turn off these presidential arts I don't know if it's true right um but ah now I feel like I should spend a few hours trying to do that just because they bother me\nSo I posted something earlier that says if George Bush signs a bill authorizing presidential alerts to be set to every one cell phone and the system isn't tested until Trump's presidency can I still say thanks Obama [laughter]\nA toll free number here tonight is a fifty five four fifty free that's eight five five four or five zero three seven three three I just hope that Trump doesn't decided to start sending out tweets\nBecause I mean it's almost seems like something that he would have the hubris than that you go to do but I doubt it you know knowing that he has this special\nPresidential tweet phone or whatever and you can just by the people like to think that he wouldn't do that\nBut I don't think we are allowed to do that\nAre so let me jump into this article that we've got from the New York times\nAgain about this test this is only as house I'm just imagining Trump drinking too much one night and just decided to go for it he claims he doesn't drink really that's what he claims but he's also in various interviews talked about a certain alcoholic beverages ... he does a drink maybe tears of his opponents maybe\nHe quit drinking at some point but it's hard to imagine somebody you know living in Vegas or and or New York city and you know running in the circles he ran\nA lead yeah says he doesn't he lives in Vegas that's a good point so again it to eight ten pm on Wednesday cell phones across the United states mated the ring of an emergency presidential alert it was the first nationwide testify wireless emergency alert system\nDesigned to warn people of dire threats like a terrorist attack a pandemic or a natural disaster\nBe alert red yes as a test of the national wireless emergency alert system no action is needed\nAnd here's the part that I missed ... two minutes later\nTelevisions in radio broadcast test alerts there was no notification plan for landlines so it sounds to me from the opening paragraph of this New York times article that maybe people wouldn't dumb phones you got some kind of alert as\nOut on a blast um so this was some sort of multimedia coordinated test in fact I found out about this this afternoon with the the radio thing because I was calling radio stations you know as we do the right to to try to pitch free talk live and this week actually there's interesting news\nI'm a longtime weekend talk radio show called money talk with a guy named Bob Brinker ended production all of a sudden basically there wasn't didn't really seem to be an ...\nThen it heads up like hey this guy's going to retire or just the news came out on Monday that hey this guy's done and so that means there's like two hundred radio stations that we've got a call here this week uh that we need to talk to and pitched it it's pretty talk lived to them\nSo that's why I was on the phone this afternoon I called one guy up shortly after the uh the test happened\nAnd he was just grumbling about how he's got to fill out a stack of paper work uh for this particular test I guess it's different than your typical ... test because probably normally you know I've\nI've worked in radio or you know I've I've been there when these DAS machine go off normally it's just picking up a signal from one of their other machines and the sort of daisy chain them from what I understand in an area\nAnd that's it you know I don't think there's much logging that is done and if there isn't the automated so he was complaining because apparently this one was a stack\nBureaucratic paperwork that he had to jump through gay I'm

did not come through on was this all on a TNT carrier all three of these phone\nJust to go on his own war more than it did not come\nSo you did get it on a flip phone now would you describe to flip phone as a dumb found like it's not a smart phone and doesn't have Android or anything like that you\nKnow just because\nAnd you're saying that came through even though that phone is no longer active supposedly doesn't have a line you can't pick up that phone and dial out\nWe call nine one one on that's why I keep it on the right\nNext to you know and that's what you can see whenever you turn one of these bones on if it doesn't have service you can still see it's communicating with the towers somewhere it's just that you don't have whatever access code you need to have to actually be able to dial out which is why nine one one will were and apparently these presidential alerts will\nWork but uh but that's about it Neal thanks for the feedback appreciate ah any thoughts on you know it was just an annoyance to you or do you think that this is a good thing\nOr whatever or\nI'm with you thanks for the call dude I appreciate hearing from it so for number's eight fifty five four fifty free\nI mean that's a good point I mean let's let's back up and ah\nI think about the alerts that we have been receiving over the years uh amber alerts for kids missing kids and what not all that without a long time ago and of course the the ... you have children\nOf course you know as a libertarian and of course the the storms moving in you know growing up in Florida that was a big deal I mean the hurricanes of course last time I checked I'd know weeks that\nYeah you don't need a damn phone alert to let you know there's a hurricane blowing in\nNow tornadoes in the Midwest might be a different I don't see that being a forest fire up to that crop up immediately but usually you have a whole lot of time and right and advance the to plan ahead\nAnd I don't really object to the idea of a missing child alert necessarily but right the problem is you know you give the government an inch and they're going to take a mile or ... to this is what's the next what's the I mean we already know what's next you remember hearing about the blue alert [noise]\nDid you hear about what you look it up I thought maybe they call it something slightly different like this is like blue pill go back to know you know a blue like the police\nSo the idea is that they will send out one of these blue alerts or when they you know some cops in danger somewhere or when I see where it was this was alert not you\nKnow what they're doing a house to house a siege to check for ...\nOperated by the blue alert foundation has a five oh one C. three public charity uh so yeah apparently they're trying to get some ... there was already something about this I'm telling you we've reported started and\nFlorida mhm I'm someone else on a national it's not a national thing that I can tell a but this ... not us website mentions this thing that went into effect in Florida oh let the ... with\nThe police are going to get a an alert they now have whether or not what a aids on board what about the firemen who are more likely to\nDie and that and duty how about the uh in and they're just they're not they're not you know\nTheir middle ground was was talk about the the forest fires and the the fisherman and taxi drivers and ... you know the people who really a ... you know perform dangerous position dangerous jobs in their lives should we also get them an alert\nIt's really annoying or here's the story or at least not the story but\nA according to what can the to the national blue alert active twenty Thirteen was a bill that was introduced a the question is did it actually pass according to this it passed the house by a vote of four hundred and six to too so\nI Do now are the clear who were the two voted I I Will pull that operate with it because I also have the way article but if you read the title it's to encourage integration of this it's not always landing mandate\nThe thing you know well either way that's what's that's what's next right alerts coming to your phone about when you know cops are in danger of God you know what ...\nAnd speaking of is this Blue Cross blue move this blue movement that are no votes by the way we're a Martian Massey okay\nAh I deliver mail in in North north of us yeah and that kind of in the woods is kind of a mixture of conservatives and a lot of liberals it's very very half and like the like the entire country\nAnd ah I tell you what the last couple of months in the last four or five months I've seen so many of these American flags with the blue stripes are just ... just cropping up everywhere is I mean first it was just one one customer and now it's at least a dozen\nBrand new flags that I don't I don't know where it's coming from\nBut well you'd have to ask each one of them you know because everybody got every you know when you when when it comes to the flag everybody has their own opinion about what it means to them", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Thom Hartmann Program", "city": "Albuquerque", "day": "04"}
