on on YouTube people will expect you to know who their favorite YouTube or czar and I've never heard of almost any of them but that doesn't mean I you know they're not popular it's just it's so easy for people to be to become popular within a certain ... of an interest these days but\nThat doesn't mean that anybody knows who these people are so who's a rabbit Andy is he a like you know what is

because uh normally you can't have more than one color on our discord line so there are you know what I thought that this is great this is pretty great ... keep going\nWere drawn\nI won't call when I own [laughter]\n\nJust dropped off all the way I Want to know why the Satan didn't want Carlin in what God did I Wish we could have gotten\nTo more of those detail I I've also curious because Lucille Ball for George Carlin doesn't seem like an even trade so did you wind up getting like a carton of\nCigarettes to go with it and maybe some mob ballpark Frank's right right and here's another question where exactly is hell are you saying what are you ... and ... player to be named later are you saying Carlin is a better comedian and Lucille Ball\nI Would say that George Carlin was a better comedian now hold on hold on I think they had different audience they ... they did have different audience because it was different types of comedy and uh I mean there's some funny yeah honey you're still ball comedy stands up longer\nWell let me have around longer so you don't have no no no I'm saying you could put in a tape of or pull up your two videos of and I Love Lucy episode from the Nineteen fifties or sixties or whatever it was\nAnd it would still be funny today sure whereas there's certain comedy that George Carlin did that might not still you know stand the test of time\nWith our speculating on that or do you think there is stuff that he's done that hasn't ... there's\nProbably some of this stuff that he did from the seventies that was David comedy is what I'm saying could be I mean that's it's fair to speculate about that but you don't really know I'm not watch didn't listen to not an every and right\nYou know the ... are you a fan of Carlin idol like it I wouldn't use the term fat because fad and I realized that code I Would say no that is bad boy what you're describing or for fanatic\n... but in my view the word fad would be somebody that has listen to everything that a person has done\nI wouldn't say that that's fair or I mean a a well an affair and you're just like something but I mean if you know what they've you know the inner workings\nOf the word that I'm finding that it is somewhat it's the guy that go through the football game or to face pay if they lack the Jersey died right now they're they're tailgating for five hours before the game the guard down nine o'clock in the morning Mansour fan boys\nYeah uh I think to a lesser extent\nI think you could argue that fan boy isn't even further than than like you know fan boy it might be more likely to engage in fan fiction or something\nLike that to go to an even further a cost play or whatever but uh fans are certainly not like I just like him because I I liked George Carlin I've enjoyed his comedy\nBut in by no means am I a Sam I Can't name any of his albums I Can't name any of you know the\nPlaces he's played I don't know have any of the statistics where it's like a sports fan\nYou know those people they know where their favorite player was and what year on what you mean and we'll start rattling off statistics of how many yards Barry Sanders hat on Thanksgiving Day at a certain year against what team what the weather was I got to say I got to hand it\nTo a Satan and God whoever is you know doing that a that is pretty good stuff I appreciate that cause was a great a call I had to it which we wish we could have gone further but I suspect since they've called more than once now there's a chance that we will hear from them again\nAnd I I Would like to know where ... where where it's located in their mind that Antarctica is it in my mind just use it in the center of the earth hold I thought it was ... you that that's where the door in Antarctica goes\nThere are not allowed to sell you are not allowed to go there anyway so is this a ladder like it's not like and go find out\nNo no so there's something vet and I don't know if anybody's ever actually been to the thing but there is something that if you go on a Google Earth somewhere and add art because somebody found this thing that appears to be a door\nOh you mean the the the ... the the the opening into the yes there's like a whole and there's lots and there's lots of faded out areas that you can't that satellite has not picked up for whatever one of the theories\nAbout this weird door is that it was a secret Nazi base that was built in the Nineteen forties and that other people say that it's like a trap door into the hollow earth and something that I'm just making a joke that it's the door to hell

entering the country he told reporters at the White House today but he is not using the issue to try to score political points\nSay that there is no such thing as free ... because God Knows something is going to happen so therefore it cannot change so therefore God is making everything happened correct whereas in the way let hold on hold on hold on let's let's get a different example of improv theater\nUh-huh where you've got some actors that all they are told is here's this saying and here's where you get to at the end\nRight as the director you're just telling them here's the in place I don't care how you\nGet there you keep trying to relate the omniscient God to humans and their choices but humans I understand the human\nUh-huh and God would understand though even try to explain something that people don't understand it it's good to give examples they are doing sampled out makes sense because we're talking and we try and set up on this year the difference between free well existing while simultaneously not existing no I'm not trying to confuse that at all I'm explaining\nWhat sons play very well does it exist if there are all I\nAm not saying that at all I said I don't believe in God like that right okay so I don't believe in that right my statement was that you said if a if there is a God then than it had an agent is no that's not what I said\nI said if God is omniscient which is the belief of many of the people in the Christian religion as I understand it having used to being a Christian\nThat's my understanding of it okay are you saying that Christians don't believe that God is on mission because most of them I've seen too much either believe God is omniscient which is you know if you're pulled the definition of that maybe I'm getting it wrong but I'm pretty sure the definition of omniscient is all new\nYeah right about that I think most Christians thank God is on this if God is omniscient if God is all knowing then God Knows what the future is 'cause God exist outside of time\nHe or she or whatever got is by the Christian viewpoint created all of this which means the argument would be from that perspective that there is no free will that's not what I Believe\nI Believe in ... that everything is God that\nI Am God but just a little piece of it the ... just a little piece of the whole universe is God's creation and I believe in free will because I think we're all here creating as God essentially not that again not that we're all omniscient not that each individual knows everything about the future everything about anything\nBut that we're just a little piece of the universe sort of experiencing itself and creating itself so does that make more sense what my perspective is versus what a Christian perspective is I Would love to hear a Christian argue in favor of free will and at the same time explained to me how God's omniscient\nBecause if you're a Christian who believes in an omniscient God you couldn't possibly believe in free will\nAnd I'm telling you that there are some Christians who build on one of them\nI don't use the term Christian okay that's who I Want to hear from if there's if you want to keep this conversation going let's hear from somebody who can make an argument that an omniscient God could somehow not know what the future is actually we have thought I might\nKnow again I I was trying to explain and I I don't know if I was talking past few ... just because you know you're getting more going on Saturday or just because you know something is going to happen does that mean that you are making that thing happen if your God\nYou're talking about a humid if your God you made it happen\nYou're saying Haitian yeah and\nThey're my interpretation of what I learned as a Christian nation where you press interact with\nThat God is omniscient right if that's the claim then he's made it all happen\nBecause he's the creator he set the ball in motion he knows all directions the Balkan rail and he created again caused it they're they're okay I'm denominations and I believe the Presbyterian argued all believe in free will I Know that the I don't know what the president had to leave I don't believe eventually you will\nI grew up in the church I don't even know what they believe I became an atheist at age Thirteen basically after asking too many damn questions like this that go through that and not getting good nothing and throw me out I just decided I didn't want to go to church anymore and I came out as a came out of the closet as an atheist at age sixteen\nOr to my parents and they were relatively supportive of me thank goodness\nI was a little nervous about you know coming out of the closet as an atheist in that particular case\nBut uh yeah I mean look you you're not arguing for them Daryl you're just saying there are those people who exist great I'd love to have someone explained to me how it is it an omniscient thing that created everything\nWho didn't know what was going to happen because that means by definition they're not omniscient does that make sense\nIt does again you're confusing knowing that it's going to have not waited a few making it happen not confusing and I'm telling you that the same thing that's not confusion I'm quite Lee I'm quite not confuse\nYeah I'm having a hard time I'm actually starting to lean towards the barrel on this one in you know something is going to happen it doesn't necessarily mean that you are responsible for making it happen\nIf you're a God you are you set the rule I mean what about created it\nYeah but not appeal or wait wait maybe you know you're going to be getting right and you get that ball rolling and now you have any you don't have any control over the last ... that's the idea is this guy the one that sort of create another thing that I my God is the one who helps\nInstead it loose just do the ds said that the ... got his omniscient cause I bet they dumped the toll

R. A. I. because they know everything ... uh\nBut at that level if you feel like you're making a choice that's what you're saying is you feel like you're making a choice but the reality has got no has the album is all about choosing\nNo that's all it was all during a pre determined turtle that all that matters we we're not on his level we can't understand it so we we ... we might be making free choice he might know the outcome but he's not a whole new level than a [laughter]\nYou know what possibly I was like well I'm Sorry guys get computers can a similar thing\nIf you want to argue that the ds God the set it and forget it God gives people free will sign then have that viewpoint if you're a Christian however and you claim that uh God is on missions and omnipotent then you don't have free will\nBecause he's already pre pre determined program as anything else besides what he's what he's\nLetting you choose and when he's ready to turn around and I\nCan I ask you quite a ways nothing\nEverything okay\nTime you seem to fight the wrong choice\nIt always seems to back up on you know sometimes if you just asked you know or you just feel that a what am I going to do for goodness it it seems to work out you know you guys know what I Do there's a lot of course you're a police officer that\nThere's a lot of questions that go through your head when you're doing something\nYou know it's like you were saying a long time ago and I'll tell you it's me for that but the fact is is that you know trying to make the right choice some times you have to go with what would be the best outcome\nWell I mean I think that when it comes to making choices I agree with you that if you choose good things good things are going to happen if you choose bad things bad things will likely happen because I Do believe in choice than I Do believe in free will and I think that that's you know all part of what God is all about it's about continually creating something new\nA and you know essentially the universe experiencing itself through us that we're you know little bits of God but that's just my belief system I'm not trying to convince anybody that that's right or wrong and I'm not trying to answer right or wrong I'm just trying to understand what they're saying I think many Christians don't even understand their own belief system\nAnd I ... I\nAgree with you a hundred percent with you a hundred percent because you you go out and you you hear people that are so\nOver the top on yet\nAnd yet you see on making constant wrong decisions that are causing harm you wonder where is their words their faith or worse village to do it but yet they say they're following the word of something that was written\nMany many many years ago and and you know if you just listen to the morals I guess there's there's good that is involved in it but it really it's something that I ... that is a good question for Halloween appreciate you guys bringing that up\nAnd wish you guys and your family a very safe\nThanks dude appreciate the call tonight and by the way that's my experience in the church that do you mean the level of hypocrisy it's just so many people going to church you know multiple times a week\nAnd then finding out that they're having an affair oh or they are they beat their kids or you know just any number of things and they and then when they're on Sunday you know singing the praises and say and hallelujah and the whole nine it's like you're you're damn hypocrite hypocrites\nYou know one of the funniest a onions I think we have these\nSixty seconds long onion clips from the onion which is a city right all or was in print newspaper they don't print anymore but they're still on line is still very funny\nOr is that all seven sins were observed happening at the church bake sale yes [laughter] and then you know they spend a minute or identifying the seven ... the pride big let me at all [laughter]\nAnd given examples of how it's being a it's happening in the church bake sale alright so uh let's continue to hear your calls and thoughts are welcome as we go to diarrheal on the line in I don't know where you're on free ... go ahead\nHey guys thanks out of my car first time caller I'm I just noticed that\nI've been born again and born again Christian and I just want to say is the greatest decision I made my life and why\nThere is what I said that because what brought me to fake believe it or not it's fun and now\nA flat earth hour ...
