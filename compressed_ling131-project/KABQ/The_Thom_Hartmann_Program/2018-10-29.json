[noise]\n\n\n\nThis week tops the stream and\nHere's what you've been watching on TV this week starting things that is the latest from at Riverdale cw theories take place [noise] see them three out of this is that is underway and they tell the episode Atlanta number four\nGood grief is the newest Halloween episode of ABC's Modern Family they take a third place this week NASA number two it's the everyday angel episode of Grey's Anatomy\nI'm a bill Bennett who gave us such wonderful little clips as a check this out this was literally Ronald Reagan's secretary education back in the day this was in the eighties\nA year ago of\nA tough line anyway a ... you know you just said some pretty outrageous things but basically uh my understanding is that they took\nCivics out of the recommended you know national standards say they weren't mandatory national standard but the recommended standards for education\nAnd not very ... you know some minority of our schools apparently teach civics\nUm and again I'm not sure on that fact I Know that you know because people call it a program all the time saying well you know we never they didn't they don't teach physics here in my town in Mississippi and then somebody will call in from some you know wealthy town in California upstate New York and say oh we had a great physics class just you know last year or excuse me civics class um so uh what do we do\nWell you know what I mean the question I Would ask will Bennett and I know last answer your question remember when he wrote that book the death of outrage after a ... Bill Clinton scandals I mean we're is willing to end it these days\nHe wrote the book virtues too I might have passed away I mean you know you have that huge gambling scandal\nWell maybe maybe I Am and I do know I don't want to speak ill of him but we are the people who who shared his view and were clamoring for virtue and\nCriticizing the death of outrage I mean why don't you hear any of those voices are with what Trump is done and making a mockery of of the presidency I mean there's been silenced but I look I I think having some basic civic education\nOr in teaching folks about the constitution the declaration of independence or the Gettysburg Address\nThe I have a dream speech Dr King's letter from Birmingham jail his speech about militarism and the Vietnam War some basic things about\nA ... of American history or would be a ... the part of the answer in a in combat adding a propaganda that is totally inconsistent\nWith our founding founders a do not perfect over really a a folk philosophers I mean they had this sense of the enlightenment ideal of knowledgeable citizens there was a very small group of citizens white\nMale property owners but amongst those citizens they thought are you ought to have education and you don't have reason and you know what the debate and you really ought to read\nA and so uh we're so far away from that are in terms of what constitutes political discourse then a a return to some of the uh basic principles that are founded this country and bring that into education\nAnd education every part of the the the country I think that is the only long term way or that you combat the ignorance and the hate yeah I\n... and yet there's this um both sides is and that makes me crazy I don't see\nA ... a alley Jackson's MSNBC show guys on seven AM here on the west coast and and I watched the first ten minutes or so this morning and she started out with John Case it up as a Republican governor from Ohio who was doing his both sides as you know well both sides have to turn back the writer\nI'm Sorry I'm not here in this kind of hateful rhetoric on our side number one and number two then she ended that segment with a clip from Ronald Reagan talking about how we can't\nHave racism and I'm an in the United states is a terrible thing\nAs if you know that was like Reagan's position Reagan's first speech after he ... it was in Philadelphia, Mississippi where Schwerner Chaney and Goodman were murdered\nAnd and it was a speech on into an exclusively wide audience on states' rights here's the bill Bennett clip that I was looking for this is what Bill see again these guys they they they they've been catering to the races since the Nineteen eighties this is bill Bennett former secretary of education\nBut I I Do know that it's true that if you wanted to reduce crime you could if that were your sole purpose you could aboard every black baby in this country and your crime rate would go down that would be an impossible ridiculous and morally reprehensible thing to do with your crime rate would go down\nTo that and and now you know and nobody got when he said that back in the eighties it's\nAmazing I mean it's a it's just so shocking when you when you think about historical figures and you wonder how they said certain things that are this is an example of someone in contemporary times is spewing that kind of paid just shocking\nI think you can draw a straight line from from Reagan speech in Philadelphia and build balance comments like that and these were not I mean these kinds of comments came out of the Reagan Administration regularly they were just very rarely discussed\nOr the other thing that the blows my mind I'm Sorry to monopolize you hear I Will turn you over to our caller was talking about it but at the the other thing blows my mind is that there's really ... the synagogue shooting in in Pittsburgh there's three pieces to it that are that are really pretty major um you know I think in fact let me get the exact quote here\nUm the the first major piece of it is exactly what the what the shooter tweeted out an hour before he went to before he committed the murder\nThere's a a a Jewish organization or called high ass H I Am and you know the the uh and I'm I'm looking for wanting to exactly that's an acronym form of the base as the international ... it's a it's a Jewish group that helps refugees and originally mostly they help Jewish refugees and now they're helping refugees from all over the world\nCheers his tweet from just before he went to shoot these guys up high in these ... these these people in the Senate got higher gas likes to bring invaders in to our country who kill our people I Can't stand by and watch my people get slaughtered screw your optics I'm going in\nAnd then uh on October twenty out he had a in response to buy a on a national refugee ... event that it was put on by us um he tweeted in response to them because they had just listed the address is a three hundred Jewish congregations and thirty\nThis was done by lender credit works like this a raiders consistently quarter to three quarters of a percent lower than other lenders and New Mexico if we just match the rate of other lenders we won't keep the profit on higher rate return that money over to the veteran he's lender credits can save the veteran thousands of\nScholars and clothes and cars there is no reason lenders be charging such high rates being loans so I encourage all veterans looking to purchase or refinance to shop the mortgage around\nDon't take a higher rate if you don't need to and if you do let us pay your clothes and cars going to go mortgage and three six five seven zero zero that's a three six by seven zero zero or on them that they need to go mortgage dot net and I'm a less when his eight three four\nMonths a mass celebrates the importance of math in our lives October takes a closer look at math an air and space [noise] prevent details and

defined family is you know we are surrounded by people in our lives that we consider cousins and close close loved ones that are closer to us and\n[noise] [noise] or back\nIn here with you and on the line with us is Congress in a row kind of taking your calls for the hour is website ... how's the job you're going to it in my ... are OK H. A. N. N. A. is knee vice chair of the rational progressive caucus and Congress mental let's pick up some phone calls okay sounds great already Jonah Nashville, Tennessee you're on the air the congressman car\nJones is again the IRS John yeah you're on the air\nUm\nJust let me say I'm Seventy four years old and the state of\nThe country right now is new for whites so therefore it's knees and if the crises African Americans and this has been through this same state of tension\nAnd violence every since you've been in this country for now it's a problem because it's negativity affecting whites\nIs racism is to be erased it can only be done about white black people cannot do it for whites only whites Ken\nAnd I'm not saying if whites\nWho find themselves says non races should confront the races and violent way\nBut they need to call them out each and every time they make statements like we see and have her that these racist make\nAnd even if it means alienating your friends and family is something that you have to do and whites alienate a friendship families all the time I Will make take a an opposite political position so why not on racism\nYou know if a black person and count as a white person who respects them as a human being thin that black person is more likely to general last bad experience to all white\nWhereas if all quake experienced is a positive situation with a black person they will not been generalized that positive experience the all black people\nAnd you just I mean it's it's it's just pervasive now you see on T. V.\nBelong to commercials and in different sitcoms and other shows where you had different variations of families it includes a different ethnicities\nThat's something that America could have been doing all along you know since the invention of TV but now the I guess now doing\nAnd you know racism is something that was\nCreated by whites it spoke Petra weight it by whites and I can understand why because they think that benefits them and that's you know I can understand that but you know when they talk about\nPlaying the race card the race card is never play it's always on the table\nAnd you know go ahead\nI'm Sorry John finish your thought and then I wanted to add a comment and we'll toss it to Congress from ... no no you go ahead I'm okay the the the point I wanted to make is that I and I just learned this over the weekend\nThe last Democratic president who was elected with a majority of the white vote in other words the last Democratic president for home more than fifty percent of whites voted\nWas Lyndon Johnson in Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen sixty five he signed the voting rights act the civil rights act and never again that a majority of whites both for any Democrat up till this day never has happened again\nAnd you know of course Richard Nixon went in and said okay well scoop up you know all the white people in the south and tournament a Republican and and like that and uh it is far more pervasive than you are absolutely right John in my opinion as far more pervasive I think than even most white people realize joining done shall we toss it with a congressman\nUh\nYeah I just wanted to say something about Lyndon Johnson I mean you know\nIt's actually black people talk a lot about Lincoln\nBut he had his reasons for doing what he gave which was the trade union he didn't necessarily care about the freedom of black people but what Lyndon Johnson and and I put him even over FDR because the programs that FDR instituted black people were not able to benefit from\nIn the very beginning\nAnd even now because our lifespan is shorter than whites I mean when you think about Social Security but what Lyndon Johnson he did the morally decent paying and he knew the political cost when he did it but he did it anyway to me that is a true leader\nOn that Congress on kind letter or package on thank you for the call a congressman garnier thoughts\nAppreciate a Jones perspective and obviously comes from a a life experience and great wisdom\nAnd I think it's important what she said about the FDR I was down south to a gym Cliburn and we were talking about\nFDR in the new rights and I was a enthusiastic about the FDR and philosophy and Jim Clyburn said to me you ... a African Americans didn't get to participate in most of the programs of the new deal and made\nA Jones point that it was really Lyndon Johnson who are opened up a those programs so uh I Would take away two things one is to realize when we're talking about\nUh the new deal or government programs we have to be mindful of the country's history of exclusion of African Americans and\nThirty thirty\n[noise]\nBack in here with you and Congress than real kind of taking your calls for the hour um Congress and you want to finish that thought or pick up the next call\nJust to say that I appreciate your continuing to raise that because it's a big issue voter suppression of the voter suppression 'cause it's structurally related to everything I mean you want to get Medicare for all Fifteen dollar minimum wage net neutrality and\nGet us out of these bad wars well we wouldn't be able to do that what sizable majority is if we really were counting every person's vote in this country and we're not and that's why we have been a losing or many of these states which we would be winning if there was\nA forget if there was massive turnout we will be winning them have just the people who wanted to turn out to folks were being counted\nYou run in a barren springs Michigan will sand that we see if you're on the air with congressman congressman ... yes\nYes Tom and congressman or\nA car earlier call said we should have truth squads and you are commented that could be dangerous these are pulling meetings you remember the ... meetings from the thirties and forties they had to be confronted I'm almost Seventy years old and a Vietnam veteran I volunteered to go into into Vietnam to fight against the war in Vietnam\nIf we don't stand up now\nYou know are we going to walk to the gas chambers and dig our own graves\nThere are people who are willing to stand up now to these one meetings if there are people willing and we should have the backing of people like you the truth has got to be put forward through we're not caught words to confront these\nNazis American Nazis your comments or\nOh thank you for your service in Vietnam and are certainly a a in Meyer your courage to speak out then I Would stand a with any a citizen group are willing to\nUh whether it's protesting a Donald Trump rallies or whether it was the courage people showed at the Kavanaugh hearings and a confronting a senators and exercising their freedom\nOf speech or whether it's a organization at town halls and the courage that takes a my point\nWas not to to to discourage people from doing that\nA rather to just point out the courage the absolute coverage it takes to do that in the world we're currently living where\nA violence or is a possible consequences and I admire very much uh people are like you were willing to to do that didn't take on that confrontation and agree that this is a time for active citizenship to honor the sacrifices that ah those like you made that to defend or an America\nAdam in New Orleans you're on the air with congressman car\nFor congressman or what kind of vibrant trusted free press democracy guys we need laws to make it legal to use psychological warfare tactics on on the people\nI'm breaking up media giants that dominate messaging and the new ... who helped to his Congress ready to take up\nYou know making it illegal to use psychological warfare tactics you know the propaganda gas lady that kind of thing illegal to use on the American people\n\nWell actually there have to be some standards uh uh to to certainly cable news and broadcast news of the fairness doctrine I support which is basically do allow alternative perspectives and that something that uh we don't hear and I would be a a willing to to look at a not censoring people but having some standards\nUh that doesn't allow psychological manipulation just like we don't allow a pornography or don't allow a speech than inside the violence on these TV stations that there should be some a basic standards and so I I Do think that's a fair project for Congress to undertake\nJohn and count Washington You're on the air the cars from car\nPillow age out here on the air\n[noise] yes I just wanted to make a few comments about what's going on with Trump and his rallies [noise] um and if their congressmen hasn't been aware of what Obama did to a al ... clerk\n\nIs that your comment John yeah okay\nUh I'm not sure which I was talking about there do you do you know congressman\nI I Am not sure that that that I\n... and let's get another caller in here then Walter from North ridge California you're on the earth or some kinda\nIf parents may yeah that seems we have just wanting to the end of the our eyes are are very very eager to see the good people she's the\n... much better are due straight from our point of view congressmen and that's progress to store for rational people there's an overwhelming majority of people who are eager to see everybody styles and that that\nOr I won't try to stop at that point we have thirty seconds left congressman your thoughts\nI agree with the caller and that there are an overwhelming members\nOf a number of people who were progressive were decent who seek leadership and I think we have to go directly to the people you talked about Bernie Sanders is\nTown hall I mean I think we've got to go have these rallies across America on issues of health care minimum wage mass incarceration getting on a bad wars are and have people mobilize a on our side and\nThat's the only way we're going to be the kind of propaganda or enclosed mindedness of the president's rallies and we need someone people on our side who are going to have that energy fire inability to mobilize people uh is directly and go around the traditional media stations directly to the people\nCome and congressman road ... thank

of\nSuspicious package I'm like most Robert Bowers is due in court short lead is likely going to face the death penalty for the alleged killing ... people inside of Pittsburgh synagogue corresponding gene ... at the courthouse\nHad fought on his part\nWell I Can't I Can't say that um that's a good question it was one of the questions we raised certainly\nUm and we talked to one former federal prosecutor who said that uh some of the deceptive practices we were describing did um resemble a elements of fraud cases that he'd seen prosecuted investigated\n'em to that question is out there there there was a case in soho where there was a criminal investigation um prosecutors they were prosecutors here that wanted to um make a case\nAgainst the trumps ah you know one of the statements they made was that they were the developer another very common mistake they made was to inflate the number of sales that had already been made and remember these are new buildings and so people are kind of making commitments they're putting their down payment down even before the units been built they'll get\n'em so it's all it's it's more risky than sort of you know buying into a building that's already there and so that Trump's you know we'd go out in a number of cases and say things like um you know if I Would say and so we're sixty percent sold when you know documents showed later that really it was only Fifteen Percent\nI'm In Panama she said they were more than Ninety percent sold at one point and it was at a at a critical point when the ratings agency ride right around when the ratings agency was considering a downgrade which they did a couple of months later\nUm but she said they were over Ninety percent sold and in fact it was um Seventy nine percent at best and a lot of those buyer's end up walking away I'm so these are very sort of specific statements that they made that were a demonstrably false in a number of cases\nWell so we basically have a grew after as president and and a ... and his daughter as the uh uh one of his principal advisors\nAt her husband his father went to jail for being a grew after and then the sort of thing in investment scams um and uh what what do we do with this [noise]\nI you know I mean I think it's one of these things where these projects are she knows they're spread out over time to spread out over jurisdictions um buyers have filed a lot of lawsuits um a lot of those have settled there's been a couple of cases where Trump has one\nUm they were cases a year and my understanding is they were cases where a judge looked at the contract and found that um the actual sales contract had all the necessary disclosures 'em and did not make a finding in favor of of the buyers\nUm but uh you know there's a lot they've they've gone through the civil route ... in a lot of places um there were considerations of criminal charges and so some of the behavior may have be outside the statute of limitations at this point I'm you know they really it's it's really an open question about whether anything happens from here\nI'm but certainly a lot of people were hurt in these um in these deals because so many of them went belly up um\nAnd when they went belly up what happened right trucks\nAnd well that that's what's interesting about it um and that's actually what drew me to the story was I was taking a look at his real estate deals the more recent ones and when I was really struck by how many of them um failed bankrupt you know foreclosed never built started weren't you know construction wasn't finished\nAnd it just raises a question to me about what you know why is he doing this over and over\nA and E. and also why are people partnering with him um 'cause he's got a number of different partners in these deals\nUm and uh what what I found out with his licensing agreements um provide often I'm a pretty sizable upfront fee and then some of it is predicated on you know that the percentage of sales and things like that\nBut we found clauses like one in Panama where even for unsold units he would still get paid\nEven if you weren't sold by a certain time um he would get paid per unit for even for the unsold unit so um there was a lot of money that he could get 'em without the project having to perform I'm very successfully\nSo he he he he goes to deal with local developer to build a build to build a Trump Building\nUm he charges them a whole bunch of money millions and millions of dollars for use of his name he promotes the deal people put money into it\nIf ah and and a piece of that money is instantly skimmed off the top and given the drop is his licensing fears is fee for that and then the thing goes belly up it declares bankruptcy there is no way to call that money back from Donald Trump's for him it along to walk away with the money\nAnd the investors are stuck with a you know with the bankruptcy getting pennies on the dollar and why is that ... is that my understanding what you're saying\nYeah I mean you know he'd ... yes mostly ah you know when when the project went bankrupt in Panama twenty Thirteen heated shaved his fees I'm by twenty million dollars but from our estimate he's still receives thirty to fifty five million dollars\nOn that project end what to me one of the more striking things about that project um to me was that there are so it was financed with the corporate bond so people bought bonds\nOr in order to you know is basically sort of a way of lending their money to the project a two hundred and twenty million dollars in bonds were sold now eventually on that principle only a hundred and twenty million a I'm Sorry there was a hundred and twenty million that was not ultimately paid back as one investor told me\nUm [noise] so um\nYou know but he again still made between thirty and fifty five million from what we can figure out they were interest payments to so they didn't\n... there have there we're we're going to hit a break here and it's like the one the one thing that you know I mean it just blows my mind that the that the Republicans held years and years of congressional hearings and lots and lots of ...\nThat Hillary Clinton

AC on the flagship video was caught doing half a billion dollars worth of sales a year end quote Trump also told investors he had experienced the opportunity and done a lot of research\nAnd that his

alongside the founders in praise of the company should listen to this as Trump said than investing in ACN was a great business opportunity and the strength of the business opportunity is why she was

so sorry about that\nOh no it's all good I I uh you you couldn't you couldn't hear anything in the background oh\nI Know okay so okay what's really fascinating is that Donald Trump tweeted about the media he sat there is great anger in our country cause in part by being in accurate and even for our reporting the news I guess that means that\nThe fake news media that true enemy of the people must stop and open and obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much more to put out the flames of anger and outrage then we'll be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony give me a break you\nKnow when he does is Ellen ice I'm guessing nine times out of town in fact according to the media matters and and a new songs about us um it probably is tight times out of ten he's simply re tweeting Fox News and\nThe thing is it's amazing to me is how shocked America is because so few Americans actually watch Fox News and know how how ... how insanely intense the propaganda is over there\nWell as you know I'm a liberal on Fox News or not going to come and\nSay that you know that going after us you and me as fake news and some of the larger news organizations it's crazy yeah I that's what he's doing okay now also originally the president has a plan to spend eight hundred true to the southwest now he's sending five thousand\nIf you couldn't believe that and Mexico is giving people in the caravan temporary work permits even though a second caravan of started\nYeah well in these caravans I mean it's not like there's an unusual number of people coming from Guatemala Honduras or El Salvador the United states it's just that instead of trying to make the track alone and ending up you know raped robbed beaten killed\nUh or or or the sold into slavery and other literally those things a little label are banding together for their own personal safety that's what's going on I mean that's where that that the innovation is\nRight and that Trump is trying to stop that and you know under international rules people get a right to hearing\nYeah when that cross the border yeah and he's not doing that yeah and this was not just international laws is are also American laws\nRight okay so now that they're that what what happened and I have to say the Democrats are both sides um but when the Trump Administration got the house\nOr when they Republicans got the house they eliminated a inability to check with the minority on subpoenas well now what goes around comes around and in fact if the Democrats take the house which were course hoping they do ah that they will now have subpoena power\nKnow what goes around comes around\nYeah if if they can all if they can older carcass together I mean if if the Democrats vows by one or two votes is going to be really really tough if they take the tough\nBut I still think that they will hold the clock is together I really do are\nYou from your lips to God's Ears on a okay what else is up\nAs secretary of defense Mattis is in a he's talking to NATO people as you know the president wants to eliminate the arms control treaty with the Soviet Union saying the Soviet former Soviet Union Russia is now cheating on it\nA NATO is very very concerned about it so a defense secretary Mattis is trying to calm down everybody\nYeah I'm also the crash just after take off of an Indonesian airline killed a hundred and eighty nine people they haven't found any survivors the seven thirty seven was a brand new seven thirty seven it was only in service since August\nUh and the ... the pilot had radio the tower right after take off that there were problems ah and there had been problems with that the it before but nobody has found any evidence that anybody survived\nYeah it's really sad

blades was was a faulty or defective um well this\nIs a very good for for for Boeing for sure yeah OK also angle of Merkel is stepping down as chancellor on twenty Twenty one when her tournaments but

United states you can't on those in Canada you can on those in any country in Europe where you can also knows you know she had\nHim on them in Canada you just have to go through a pretty rigorous process\nIt's it's more than rigorous it's it you know I mean is it okay if you if you have a gun range and people want to rent them and I don't have a problem you know I have I have shot ... I'm shot a AK forty sevens I shot old Thompson machine guns and I'm sure they are Fifteen and I did it all on a licensed gun range when we lived down in Atlanta\nAnd uh you know I got no problem with people being able to walk into a gun range a new professional environment and in fact I took my altering my kids are shot these weapons\nI'm ... and uh you know I have no problem with that I you know looking back on it I'm I'm a little concerned now you know the one thing I've learned that I didn't know then is that there's an enormous amount of uh lend dust that gets blown into the air whenever a gun is fire and he ended up with a lead us all over your hands and this causes severe and permanent neurological damage\nSo you know I I I don't so much do it anymore but but I still do patterning slowly and we went in with my brother\nThat's a that's a problem with an indoor downright\nWhile 'til I is is the problem with your shooting the gun 'cause you know the IRS right there right and you're right in front of your face but but and and yeah there's a lot of lead man arrangement but my point is that\nYou know I'm not calling from guns to be banned I never have what I'm suggesting is number one\nWeapons of war and and and frankly I think ... ... I include certainly ought to ... semi automatic weapons including pistols in that category now we can have a debate about that but you know if you if you look at the cop shows prior to the Nineteen eighties\nEvery cop and America was using a revolver they were they were not using semi automatic weapons they were they were they were using normal revolver\nAnd and and and I think that you know we went back to that and get all these semi automatic weapons off the streets obviously the cops need them right now 'cause like this because the bad guys had but if we could purge our society a semi automatic weapons\nUm number one and number two I think we should do the same thing with guns that we've done with cars and we started doing this with cars in the Nineteen teens\nBecause cars were killing people guns are designed to kill people so you know I mean it seems even more appropriate for guns as three simple things number one is you have a registration or a serial number of in number or in the case with a weapon it'd be a serial number that follows it from birth to death and always was attached to one person\nBy virtue of a title that has to be registered every year with the state just like your car number one number two that everybody has to demonstrate their proficiency when I when I you know went through the Georgia police academy I learned how to shoot\nYou know the professional way I'd I'd you know learn how to shoot before on on gun ranges and in fact back before that and in in you know when I was a kid\nIn our class you know with twenty two pistols or twenty two rifles but but you know\nIf you can prove that you're ... and ... and in every state has the mechanism for this\nUh you know it's it's ... it's what you have to go through to get a a in most states anyway you know to get a a concealed carry permit and number three insurance I think it's crazy that if a malicious or a drunk driver or just you know a craze homicidal terrorists maniac\nHad killed all those kids in Newtown or in Parkland with a with a car Geico and be fan out a million bucks each one of their families and because they were killed with guns there's there's been you know there's nothing I mean you know families at the wrong go find me pay just to pay for funerals and things\nThat that makes no sense to me and in fact that's a a Republican free market solution that was suggested back by ... by the Reagan people in the eighties\nYou know that there should be liability insurance for gun owners\nBecause then you're going to have the same thing you have with cars where you know if you've got a ... a couple of domestic if you've got a domestic violence convictions for example the insurance company is going to look at you and say you know as a gun on to this guy has higher risk than anybody else so instead of being fifty bucks a year the liability insurance is going to be five hundred dollars a year\nOr you know if you've got to a domestic violence convictions it's it's five thousand dollars a year and they just like if you tuned drunk driving convictions it's damn hard to find insurance and it's very very expensive these seemed to me like reasonable thing is William and the majority of Americans support these positions they had been polled why would you oppose them\nI oppose them because while I'm there it's constitutionally protected right\nToo I mean\nThe ... in there are ...\nYou know in the constitution it says that the you know one of the functions of Congress has to pay for roads right it's article one section eight you have a ... so you could argue that you have all those ever been adjudicated the Supreme Court the best of my knowledge but you could argue of a constitutional right to drive a car to on the public roads but once you're on the public roads\nYou know once you're outside your own home I mean you can you can own and driving a car all you want on your own property without a license without registration and without insurance but once you're in in the public world you've got to have those three things why not for gun owners\nAnd this is what I'm saying is like you said earlier guns are made for ... yeah some of them down to or I\nWin the founders made the constitution\nThe reason my up back in there is because we had just barely gotten out of a war with a tyrannical government I\nThat's not why that that was that was actually a Seventeen year old kid wrote an article for the n._r._a. magazine in Nineteen Seventy four that made that argument that the founders wrote the second amendment because of government ever became tyrannical ways that people should be able to overthrow in government\nI have the collected writings and James Madison from the convention I've written extensively about this I just finished writing a book about the second amendment there will be out on June fourth of next year it's called the hidden history of Second Amendment\nThat was never even discussed it wasn't discussed at the constitutional convention in this in the summer or Seventeen eighty seven it wasn't discussed at any of the ratifying conventions the original second uh\nWas a way of maintaining a militia in each state in the union\nDuring a time when when the consensus of most of the founders wasn't they did not want there to be a standing army when there was not a war going on they were fine with the standing navy\nBut there should not be a standing army and less we're having a war is so you have to be able to bring you have to be able to mobilize the militias really quickly and the proof of that you can in in addition to literally page after page after page of discussion of this and Madison's notes from the constitutional convention\nThe proof of that is that in order to make sure that that was the case article one section eight says that the army may not exist for more than two years without Congress reauthorized in it every two years forever\nAnd if Congress fails to reauthorize the existence of the American army air for everything except the navy if Congress fails to reauthorize that every two years it vanishes\nSo no they had nothing to do with being able to overthrow the country and had to do with a militia and they changed the word a free country in\nThe second amendment to free state because Patrick Henry the largest slave holder in Virginia got up and gave a big speech about how the in Virginia the militia was called the slave patrol as it was in Georgia and he got up and he said if the if if we ever get a president who is a northerner and we ever had a crisis where the militia and you're in Virginia it gets it gets mobilize\nThey will destroy our slave patrol and they will in fact probably nationalize all of our slaves and put them in the army\nAnd and so they and so Madison a call him paranoid you can read it in Madison is now to be he said to Patrick Henry he said OK I'll change or country to free state the state is safe militias will be protected this had nothing to do with overthrowing a tyrannical government land\nI Am hopeful that that is not the direction we're only now we haven't been through a civil war once before and we've also been through multiple areas of our history where we've had ... and things like that but you know even them and they are Fifteen seems to me like overkill\nMark thanks a lot of good to hear

out of their first opportunity to repudiate the vial and filthy regime led by Trump\nNow we see the terrible cost to Trump ism the lies conspiracy theories code and racist and anti Semitic language
