thesis here in the article that I that I wrote basically which is that the only\nThe only two things that Republicans are running on this this time right now\nFear and principally that fear is obviously a fear of crime they've always Ron that but also the fear of the other explicit an overt racism and sexism massage in a a and now even you know a fear of trans people and voter

that\nThere is this you know ongoing well back to to voter suppression like usher uh back to voter suppression\nI mentioned that you know by twenty sixteen they had really fine tune into this thing so the New York times noted that in Washington around three\nHundred thousand registering voters were turned away at the polls right after Scott Walker's new id law because they didn't have the kind of

the only way you can get these numbers is to Sudanese Republican secretaries of state which he has done he sued like thirty states and and they're starting to come in in Nevada\nIn a democratic parts of Nevada Ninety thousand people have lost their right to vote\nIn Colorado at seven hundred and sixty night and this is just no last year\nSeven hundred and sixty nine thousand four hundred and thirty six voters purged in Colorado in Georgia three hundred and forty thousand one hundred thirty four voters purged in Illinois five hundred and fifty thousand voters purged there's a large but on counted list in Nebraska these are all in Greg's Web site at every single name\nAnd in Indiana Mike Pence who said four hundred and sixty nine thousand voters purged\nThis is\nThis is now the single strategy essentially that the Republicans are using is voter purges and if it wasn't for these voter purges George W. Bush never would have been president\nIf it wasn't for voter purges in Ohio Wisconsin a Pennsylvania and Michigan didn't Donald Trump would never be president we would have seven liberal justice is on the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd we would have had president Al Gore and then president Hillary Clinton\nSo vote voter purges it brought us some real hell by the way final round then I'm gonna pick up your phone calls here are Nikki Haley\nThis is getting real interesting\nNikki Haley drafted her resignation letter on the morning of October third she was our ambassador to the United nations and was one of the few people in the Trump Administration who was actually in\nRegular contact with our intelligence agencies\nRight I mean Trump doesn't take that stuff seriously he gets his quote intelligence from Fox News in fact he doesn't even take the day of the presidential daily briefings any longer he's the first president not to do this you know since the the whole thing was created I Believe during the Eisenhower administration actually it was probably during the war during the FDR administrators\nBut Nikki Haley does or did\nSo on October second cause show he was murdered\nIn Turkey constantly in the Saudi conflict in Turkey\nThe next morning\nNikki Haley presumably knows about it and writes for resignation letter she sees the handwriting on the wall in my humble opinion\nAnd submit that letter\nTo to Donald Trump it was a full week later before it was the tent that October before there was any reporting on us\nAnd by that time Nikki Haley was out\nYou think there's a a\nAn if this than that\nThere's a a a post ninja a over a democratic underground posted this along with a a link to I Believe it's a link to a a\nRelevant to this so anyhow spot on our our played here today a lot on the agenda I'll add a lot of news that we are going to get too as we continue\nBut ah let's pick up your phone calls here Brad outgrow village Illinois I hate Brad when\n[laughter] here's here's my here's my thought and that is this the\nThe right to vote it's not a privilege it's All right and it's freedom of speech and I just see the Republicans as the party over my my freedom is for freedom in for me and not for you if\nI hold poll politically it blows you or despite shoot yeah and uh\nI'll take my comment a you you could uh\nYou can go to the next call but I I just think that Democrats the to argue that the Republicans are now [noise] there were about defining the constitution only for themselves and not for any one else\nOh absolutely originalism is a disease that has only practice a psychological disease that is only practice by Republican judges it's\nLiterally end up at a Republican thing this is in in Seventeen Ninety five Thomas wrote a paper called dissertation on first principles of government brand thanks for the call dissertation on first principles of government\nWhat'd you marry sir Paul McCartney and none of them and treat them with Joe leading to talk about his new album Egypt Beijing then of course some discussion about a little band called the Beatles we were when we were playing music or radio present video check it out now\nAvailable in all fun book stores now [noise]\n... here where the nine ... coming up and nine minutes before the our neck in New York Phil Illinois and Nick what's up\nAnytime good afternoon or good aren't you yeah all of the above [noise] um [noise] you know so I was thinking about it I was trying to come up with them or you know some bumper stickers\nFor all that our parents and well one of them I thought of over the weekend was a well what's your pre existing condition\nOr something like that you know because everybody's got one yeah I'm a Republican you know\nI'm thinking about that or if you're a girl or one of the patrol come on and they go off and then that growth and I love ... and challenge them with well what what you know and what I Do it out and then they\nAre not in my mouth and drop call or something like that that was pretty good yeah um I wasn't good but\nUm but I actually really called about um something about you know which I think what's most frustrating to me it's a lot of others is all this energy and time spent\nHaving to add all these people in all the energy if you think about all the energy and time spent that they put towards all this voter suppression and or you know like let's say you know like the old direct oil company how much ah\nHow much uh money and effort they put towards uh the false science for the last Fifteen Years of this dial\nYeah it was all about the money I already macro industry does it was before that and the asbestos industry did it before the tobacco industry did\nAll of them\nAre arguing about whether or not it was human cause you're not okay\nNo one whether or not it was at that point the point is that there is something going on and now when you have to figure out what are we going\nWell and it is human cause that's why you've got four hundred and twenty dollars for a million of CEO to in the atmosphere and methane is exploding right now so it's over two thousand parts per million\nParts per billion and and they are going to\nYou can point to the floating plastic island in ... and you could say well was that natural I mean that's obviously human caused on the hill goes back even further to it's like where like Greg I'm kicking down with solar panels off the White House like what the heck was al about where would we be at that well\nThat that's the oil industry yeah well ... where we would\nBe is we would have\nA you know we would have a a a a government that actually is looking out for all of us I mean you know it's it's very simple and straightforward by your points are well Maine neck and and the effort I mean you know I remember it was like ten Fifteen Years ago it was early on in this program that the Republican started rolling out this thing up waiting to secure the vote\nThere are people who are not citizens who are trying to vote and wait and you know how do I need him to to to fill in the blank what was it get on an airplane why couldn't you shouldn't have to have id to vote and I thought these are such stupid\nGirl a you know just inane arguments why are they making these arguments well now we know now we know it's the only way they can win elections Laura in champagne Illinois hey Laura what's up\n[noise] [noise] Hi Tom I'm I think we should distinguish between voters depression and election fraud election tried you know being that\nWhen you finally get to the pausing actually vote and then she puts your votes or they tell you that your signature doesn't match or even after the election they threw out thousands of paper ballot so the votes can't be counted for 'em\nThey lend that I think that the only way maybe you could\nCome up with another way to to fight back against that and that is to find out who I'm In charge of the election senior Cathy and make sure you voted Democrat in that position mhm yeah and so there's a lot of Republicans how to\nWrite a ... state\nRight in various states have Iraq\nNo no I said I said first I and also make sure that you have a Democrat as secretary of state because the secretary of state in every state is the chief election official for the state\nOh yes yes and\nSo and the right and they're the ones who are conducting the voter purges by and large they may have the county uh the the judges are elected officials I mean the the title varies from state to state\nUm they may have the county people doing their work and in some cases you get roped county officials but you know and spot on you want to make sure if they're if they're partisan elections or even if they are elections has appointed as opposed to being appointed\nThat that you have Democrats in those places and that again varies from state to state but\nAnd they didn't have any energy solutions so that's probably because we've had to fight back against\nThe the the straightforward solution is we need to have a constitutional amendment that says than voting is a right\nWe have to enshrine voting as a right we can do it the short term solution is to have is pass a law saying that voting as a write the long term solution is to write it into our constitution Laura thanks for the call I Need to I Need to get I Want to get another caller in here before we hit the end of the hour Stella in Tucson, Arizona watch us on Facebook Live based all what's up\nMy Tom thank you for taking my call sure what's up I'm yeah I just well actually traveling now I had this idea I I was listening to him one night and like all minorities should just I'm registered as Republicans\nThey'll still get kicked off the voting rolls because they're doing it based on common names and while there's\nYou know if there's a there's some common names for white people there's a credible diversity among white people in their names because there's all these different language groups that white people came from basically among Hispanics and African Americans and Asians there are a couple of dozen names that constitutes a really large chunk of all those people\nAnd so when you're just purge against common names\nYou wipe out people of color but not white people and that's and regardless I mean they're not doing it based on their voter registration Stella\nUnfortunately\nI is a cute idea you know Trevor no I think we're putting it out as a joke but it wouldn't be I think\nYou learn more ill but yeah I was thinking about it 'cause I used to do that myself and I used I was a registered independent\nAnd I can get Mary on the voting Republican vote em yeah and that's you know and I'm In a lot of open

what you do speaking of books Bob is also the author of side swiped and a Bob congressman welcome back\nOh thank you Don so what's at the top of the news today\nWell it's ... news is fooling naked in this and that is coming from the president of turkey and that's what he's going to be calling what he's going to speak about the press conference he's giving the issues in the details of ... death and he said it's going to be fooled naked miss with\nThe gruesome details to it so I'm sure even more than we've heard is going to come out\nAnd this was going to be in his speech to is the Turkish version of parliament tomorrow and uh tomorrow will be like probably what two three four o'clock in the morning our time so we should know all this by tomorrow morning news cycle\nOh yes you're right we should and uh and and it's important you know people ask me today well what do we think the accuracy of it is well let's just say it this way everything they have said has been accurate so far anyway you know the Turkish government\nAnd you know some people say well maybe they're spinning things no they aren't that they've been accurate there's a reason to not believe this is not going to be accurate\nThe Saudis have made some absolutely bizarre absurd statements a fist fight\nYou know started and I'm also they\nFound is Cheney in Athens fifteenth professional assassins and you're gonna have a fifth at this point with I'm really right\nAnd and they cut all his fingers off and then they said you know ... is so gruesome it it's it's unbelievable yeah and um they had a man who looked like him that they put into we know the snow into his clothes\nAnd had him walk out in taped it as if he was leaving they were going to use that and then that got that was found out by the Turkish authorities\nWriter body double\nRight now meanwhile uh Jared Kushner has been communicating with NBS Mohammed bin Solomon and he's telling him the trans parrot\nI Can't say that the president is backtracking but obviously they're starting to make statements that you know are talking about some lies and deception but still defending the crown prince\nAnd some issues are coming out and some stories about Norm Coleman the former senator who's doing lobbying for Saudi Arabia and so a lot of of numbers and money that the Saudis have spent is coming out now Norm Coleman is attached to a pack that is supported by Speaker Ryan\nSo of course he you know some of the of the money what do you what do you think\nOf this conspiracy theory that's been floated that you know the murder happened on October ... and by the night of October second\nUh you know ... when it happened in ... a very very early in the morning our time on October second\nI'm so by the end of that day our intelligence agencies knew what was going on you know both from direct knowledge and probably by a Turkish intelligence and the very next morning Nikki Haley sat down and wrote her a letter of resignation\nUm ... do you think that it's possible that gene I mean she pays attention the intelligence a Trump doesn't get his intelligence briefings anymore and the CIA has no interest in them inside watches Fox News but Nikki Haley actually reads the intelligence briefings\nDo you think that she went to our this possible that she went to the Trump Administration whether it was Donald himself or whether it was\nIn a bowl or somebody like that and said hey this is going on and this is going to blow up in our faces this is really\nGrow any I don't want to have anything to do with this and we need to get ahead of this and they said oh no no we're going to be just fine we're going to we're going to protect the Saudis they'll they'll cover this up don't worry and at that point being the very very smart politician that she is Nikki Haley said okay I'm I'm getting the hell out of here\nWell you know Tom there's no doubt that Nikki Haley as sites on the White House down the road there's no doubt that people would like to see her on the Republican side you know to run obviously\nA for president I think that it's very possible what you just said combined with the fact of John Bolton and I also believe uh some of the theory that she knows that John Bolton was attempting to begin a war with Iran\nAnd if you look at the president's statements well we need Saudi Arabia to fight Iran no we don't we don't need Saudi Arabia can't even find its way out of wet paper bag they can bomb\nYou know kids and other countries but they can't um a fight so we don't need them to do that I think that's part of it she may have had access to information also and just became tired of the whole scenario because you have to look at something\nLook at what the president said when he mentioned this might be broke he used the word for Saudi Arabia is the word Roque and you know she had access to this this information that might have been the straw is set her over the edge\nTo get out and I think Bolden is a big key factor in this a key factor with it the deal going on right now with Russia\nAnd the agreement so I think anywhere you go you're going to see naturally you know his his fingerprints yeah and with the Saudis they're close there's a business relationship Jerry ... been on the phone closely I Am predicting that some of the people that have now been rushed it\nWill confess that the crown prince and the and the royal family had nothing to do with this which is I think a complete lie nothing to do with it then those people will be headed why would they confess 'cause there's threats to kill their own family this thing gets Saudi Arabia the royal family it's going way deeper\nBusiness connections you know push her entire nine yards but to use the word wrote for the Saudis used it I thought was kind of a coordination\nYeah and why they were there wasn't of course our family bailed out by air uh money I'm I'm not sure it was Saturday I thought it was from uh the UAE but it's basically\nThe same thing as I Do I refuse to him and then you're off the show he got in trouble that the President Bush's you're involved in business I mean there's a lot of\nThings that's right that's that's right you you you you know for me about that last week they show he had no any Saudi Arabia is because the bad and I'm trying not to allow these as right out the house note\nAmazing Bob

same as probably true for Honduras and El Salvador these three countries that Ronald Reagan just just a you know devastated back in the eighties is is this the the echo of that\nWell it's an echo for sure I mean we cannot deny that the U.S intervention in Congress in Central America has the story the factor that it shouldn't be allowed back in because of the consequences that intervention I mean we're sticking up out on the\nFace the extreme violence extreme cold but the market not patient and of course people pushing their people out but also\nThey may be foolish to leave the country the cost of the you know Neal there's governments to feel that we want to believe these different sects of life in the case of me that I was in a country whose scenic you in the end of the war skim and quite quite the same town we study over the last six months\nOr even meet April of this year at the earliest of a reform to the Social Security system part that now break off on the government shut

groups\nThat are having the uh on with a rifle I got life will thrive on how many done them all the weapons that we see in place just a complete\n... what what could or should the United states do I mean right now what we have is a president at a at a political party\nThat is uh basically screaming a particularly on Fox News oh my God I'm Around people are common basically that's their message you know be afraid to be afraid I'm you know it's it's it's racist it Xena phobic kids ... and and it's activating\nA you know not that ... and in considerable amount of fear in among a older white Americans\nUm but there there have to be policy things that the United states could do that would cause these governments in Central America to\nReconsider the shift toward authoritarianism and especially fascism and move back into the sphere of of being functional democracies Arthur\n[laughter] yeah I have to say that these kind of a Cold War we story that President Trump has used against a country that we can if not you know the way and then go to the people that I mean these leaders you seem precisely be black and white\nOr not like the ... the fight to violate human rights and we have to learn the ah you know for many years the U.S because they said that President Trump is willing to bring back\nThe very difficult time for the Latin American countries\nAh I just think that that
