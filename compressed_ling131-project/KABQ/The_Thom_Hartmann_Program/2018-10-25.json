then they'd have to you know they'd have to adapt to it in the same way that the postal service has to do a bit of a better job because people can use FedEx\nAnd people can use a UPS\nBut there are other headlines in the news about Canada and some of the ramifications of this so bad news side of it there's a little bit of good news we'll start with the bad news here from South Korea\nWhere according to the guardian dot com\nFor South Koreans in Canada the police in their home country have no problem harnessing their mellow candidate became a second country in the world to legalize recreational marijuana last week but for South Korea and hoping to try the drug their hopes have just gone up in smoke\nPolice in South Korea have repeatedly told their citizens not to partake in this newfound freedom with the latest warning coming this week\nQuote we'd smokers will be punished according to Korea and law even if they did so in countries where smoking marijuana is legal there won't be an exception unquote said June ... a siege in\nHead of the narcotics crime investigation division at their provincial police agency and as a cover what type of consequences they face in South Korea\nA good question I have a little bit of weed good question will uh yes it does actually five years in prison [noise]\nUp to five years in prison south three laws based on the concept that laws made in Seoul still applied to their citizens anywhere in the world and violations even while abroad can technically lead the punishment when they return home now obviously\nYou know the only way you're going to get caught on this is if you're stupid enough to post pictures of you doing it on Facebook page or which people are going to do oh you know they will and especially if they're tourists they and tourists and they love with this ... and their pictures\nOr I could see it we're going to hear it you know we're gonna be hearing about this well we're hearing about it now because they're intending I mean if it's this is what they're gonna do they're going to be looking for this they want to bust people or the south Korea strictly enforced is drugs\nA drug laws even for small amounts and celebrities caught smoking we're often paraded in front of the media for apology tours\nOfficials worked to project an image of a drug free nation you remember the story\nYou this was years ago it must have been like one of the first years we were ever doing free talk life so you guys wouldn't but on the show at the time but you might remember they had the headline you remember when Dionne Warwick got caught with lead in her like in her purse at an airport or something like that or ... yeah and so like she got caught a little bit of wheat\nAnd she made this big to do about how it wasn't hers and she didn't know how it got there [laughter]\nIt was just there was the most laughable thing as though you know a celebrity like Dionne Warwick in the United states is going to face any kind of penalty for having candidate is and again this was probably Fifteen or something on your way\nProbably what a face penalties if head had been you know a white famous actor probably not\nOh I don't know about that man I mean look Snoop Dogg is still a free man and it's pretty clear that he's smoking we left yeah and he read about it more as arms and Willie Nelson too he's a white old white man right which would suggest though if you have to wrap sheet longer than his arms then the judge is going to throw book at him if he gets caught doing something else the fact is celebrities\nWhether they be black or otherwise are are just they don't just hasn't gotten caught in Twenty years well then they're not try and [laughter] it's their dog hasn't gotten caught than they are ignoring him at this point\nI'm going on though is so they strictly enforce the laws officials worked to project an image of a quote drug free nation\nAnd only about twelve thousand drug arrests were made in twenty Fifteen in a country of more than fifty million people\nHowever details on how police would test those returning from Canada remain hazy experts suggested enforcement would focus more on drug traffickers then casual users lead Shanghai Noon professor and department of police administration in died John at a university\nSaid quote South Korea can't screen everyone who visited a foreign country but the police maintain a black list that leads to certain individuals being supervised\nThe police are more concerned with the transportation of marijuana into South Korea\nAnd their uh their messaging shows they're anxious about tackling this issue in the near future judges in South Korea have a significant amount of discretion and will likely assessed the crimes individually\nEspecially when marijuana is prescribed for medical reasons there are about twenty three thousand South Korean students in Canada according to statistics from the ministry of foreign affairs\nAnd then they go on to say that ah it has a long history of use and making hemp fabric and South Korea and the plant was only band in Nineteen Seventy six hundred dictator park Chung hee before prohibition was only Indian marijuana\nWas labeled as a narcotic and the drug was common in music and artistic circles in the sixties and seventies where many took to quote happy smoke as it was commonly called at the time [laughter]\nSo what's up with an opium smoker called if it's if marijuana happy smoke\n... must be something like sleepy smoke was opium a saying in the sixties and seventies and sell them spend thousands here has been around but there were times when it was more and less popular certainly here in the United states has been when's the last time you guys saw opium\nThought I've never seen it

three three\nWere doing a little bit of a Canadian candidate is legalization recap there's obviously been a lot in the news about this we can't cover it all but uh did a little bit of good news and bad news the good news or the bad news is for people in South Korea view are living in Canada they they catch you in South Korea\nHaving smoked candidates in ... in Canada however it is it going to do that or they will punish you with criminal charges the good news is that if you're a Canadian who's got a criminal record for marijuana possession well\nYou know longer actually have to pay what apparently it was a at one time six hundred and thirty one dollar fee\nIn order to apply for a pardon from a criminal conviction so prior to legalization if you'd want it and it's still true for other crimes right like if you're going to apply for a pardon of some sort of criminal act in Canada you got to pony up six hundred and thirty one box probably Canadian\nUm but that's a lot of money for simple application or hundred eighty three dollars us us roughly and that's just an application there's no guarantee that's going to be approved\nSo keep that in mind in this case they're gonna prove it now if it's if it's pot is pretty much going to be a rubber stamp\nOr because the the last changed and they're actually being okay about getting rid of these convictions um and one of the other things are getting rid of is the waiting period according to the story a global news dot CA\nOf applicants would previously have faced waiting times between three and ten years after the completion of their sentence before they can apply for one depending on the crime the waiting time to apply for a partner for possession was at least three years depending on the circumstances of the case\nAnd I'm guessing you can only apply once every so many months there's probably\nSome sort of restriction like that you know if you apply you have the hearing and the judge says well not this time because reason there's a lie again in your ears denied or whatever and then you've got to wait however long yeah\nOr by the way I Want to make sure you know about the blink home security system will tell you more about cannabis you're in a moment but whether you're protecting your marijuana crop or you're protecting your family\nThe blink home security system can help you with that in fact their motion activated HD cameras you can set 'em up easily because their wireless okay you on boxed them you put the batteries and you put them up wherever you want him and if you need to move them it's no problem because again wireless it doesn't get any easier than this\nYou are set everything up ... why why financial device so like your smartphone or tablet or even a laptop\nSet it up on line and then they will deliver to you clips of what happens in front of the cameras during the hours that you specify they should be operating just go to blink protected dot com slash FDR you'll say Fifteen Percent on your plane comes security system there which by the way there's no contracts know subscriptions you pay for this product up front\nAnd it's affordable by the way I was shocked at how Ford will offer the quality that you get your it's actually really good\nA very very affordable price and then there's no more you know no more cost that's ongoing which is awesome whereas a lot of these home security systems they want to every single month offer some kind of monitoring\nYou monitor it yourself because they just send you the clips and you can even tune in live if you want to your camera feeds Blake also works with Alexa because blink isn't Amazon company go to blink protects dot com slash FDR and you'll say Fifteen Percent like that\nSo wiping out the waiting times\nWiping out the application fees for candidates possession charges the campaign for cannabis advocacy it can it a Canadian non profit that has advocated for pot possession pardons in recent years estimates there are roughly half a million Canadians who have been convicted of simple pot possession\nAnd who would be affected by changes to the part in system\nOr the part and however does not make past convictions disappear rather essentially sets aside the criminal record to give the person a second chance once part in a person's criminal record is removed from the Canadian police Information Center computer system\nThe exception to that is pardons for sexual offenses which remain flag in the system despite the pardon\nThe part is also different from expungement which can legally make it past conviction disappear\nThe process of expungement was most recently used by the liberals in bill see sixty six which allow the criminal records of consensual sexual activity between same sex partners over the age of consent to be destroyed\nWhen asked why the government was not pursuing a similar approach for cannabis convictions the spokes bureaucrats said the matter came down to the fundamental injustice that was that the root of the criminal convictions of el G. P. T. Q. Canadians\nThat is not the case he says with Canadians convicted of illegally possessing cannabis quote the laws with respect to candidates that had existed historically we believe are out of step with current mores and views in Canada\nBut are not the same nature as the historic social injustice that was imposed in relation to the L G. P. T. Q. community so apparently a gays and lesbians and trends were violated worse according to this bureaucrat in\nCanada or their pot smokers yeah fundamental civil rights where the argument is going to be well you choose\nTo Canada I see you're not choosing to be gay or trans or by gotcha [noise] so if you want to join us you can that's some of the good news coming out of Canada now one thing that I think\nI definitely learned here uh I didn't realize that apart and didn't automatically come with an expungement\nWell maybe ah that's that's probably true in the U.S as well I'm not sure probably because it's all based on British common law right\nUh yeah like I I live on the record yeah I Know that there is a difference between a part in the end a commutation where commutation is saying you're still guilty we're just cutting your sentence or you've been punished enough that's what they did with Bradley Manning or Chelsea Manning so that's the\nGood news now to get back into the bad news this story actually provided a Michael Hampton found this when he deserves credit 'cause I've been looking for this story I I predicted\nThis is going to come up now I don't think you were on the show last week come in when we did this because we talked about it the day before we talked about legalization and now we make predictions on what was going to happen we predicted that they were going to run out\nFast and that's\nHappened in every every state that they've legalized has happened\nYou don't actually have to wait until we are a lot until we're on the air in your area you can call during the live hours then since you're a delay broadcast station listener you'll hear yourself later on\nSo just make a point of calling in about whatever it is you want to discuss All right so welcome aboard the W.

they're\nAll right so a toll free number tonight eight fifty five four fifty free we are going to have been to Venezuela here Daryl you saw a headline this evening right before we started the show it was by me sees Cuba yeah\nI actually thought earlier but then I was reminded now because I as we were going through I posted it somewhere where I don't normally put my show proud right and was run minded of this headline breaking\nM. U. D. and Venezuelan opposition parties are dissolved the energy being the a round table for democratic unity or en Espanol miss a day you needed\nA devout propaganda mhm ah which again was sort of the coalition of opposition political parties\nQuietly according to me says Cuba quietly dissolved by decree of the constituent national assembly\nWhich is ... rubber stamp Congress a witch legally and formally dissolved all political parties that did not participate in the most recent national elections ... from which the MUD was banned\nThe eighty is due was spelled out a year ago but today and this actually dated October twenty fourth so yesterday but a does but today\nIt was codified by the new rubber stamp Congress the only recognize political parties in Venezuela are now members of the great patriotic poll which is the unanimous majority in the constituent assembly mostly the\n... majority before you go on let's talk about this constituent assembly yes um it replaced basically orders is essentially a quietly replaced it the other nationalism\nLurk the national assembly right so there's the ... the constituent assembly which is the new thing national assembly was the original thing and basically what happened what was it like a year or so ago\nA year and a half ago they had just essentially BS elections where only ... who's the president of the country only ... cronies were essentially allowed to run in this election yes or to get on this new constituent assembly\nWhich was formed for the purpose of completely supplanting the previous national assembly yes which sort of still existed but essentially became a non issue I\nSo what they did they created this constituent assembly stacked it stacked it and then took all of the powers and authority away from the national assembly right and now they formally dissolved the national assembly\nAnd all political parties ... did not participate in the election from which they ran alone to participate in it\nSo and this was some of the\nWell no they have that as well as their they just can't do anything ...\nThey're like all of their powers were stripped it would be a kitten to F a a group of people created a new a community council to replace the city council and strip all all of the powers from the city council\nThe city council but still exist they just wouldn't have any powers and then this new thing formally dissolved\nOr they say way if Trump\nCould somehow go and just create a new Congress full of all of his buddies right and then somehow get rid of the old Congress without any kind of uprising because that's where that would be great [laughter] that'd be I'd watch that movie why why why\nShe do dictator to wind up naming his own people to Congress\nBecause of the because the civil war you guys were talking about yesterday what happen tomorrow you think so oh yeah\nYou know Americans happy if you try to ... like that there are there are too many people are upset with him if you try something that outrageous\nHow is it that there are I mean look Monroe has been doing so much that is outrageous down there and he's still in power you know like so these guys can get away with a lot of Columbia has\nHis followers as does the orange van bad right he has his followers who would be right there with him getting their rifles out their walls to go to war\nI and you you were talking about you know what the mindsets in in how this will book I'm listening to yesterday's show yeah concerning the civil war that everyone's talking about right now on both sides and who's gonna win and what states would survive and how would the country be divided and this and that I\nSickly is the sick I Believe that the people actually want this they always say no no no we don't want this is the last thing that we want we don't want you to be fighting our brothers and sisters on across state lines and you know we don't want all of the ... the destruction that it would bring all the revolution and bring but I think on a sick way people want this\nI think they are I think that a man the backs of their minds they they are they ... they are ready to wake up easy to the to a new war just to prove\nWho is right [laughter] it's gotten to the debate might makes right the division is so great right now the one side believes there right and then the other believes that they're right that the division is so great that they just want to prove\nAnd the only way to do that you can't you can't we can't sit down and have a conversation you're with your neighbor any longer than that now it's got to come to to to an actual all out fight and all out war\nWell I Hope you're wrong about that but you're not the only one on this show that's predicting it and I I mean I don't want to see violence I definitely don't want to see a people being afraid to go out in the streets for fear of being attacked by somebody who thinks that they're politically opposite from that other person I mean that that sounds absolutely awful\nI Hope you're wrong about that kind of em but that's about all I can say\nWell into his family history repeats itself and the the cycle of the cycle is full turned and it's ready for another true until somebody's already ... until someone is ready to break the cycle of violence it will control the only way we can do that I've said before is for us as human\nBeings to evolve passed this nice sense of all for the next level where we're not there yet where we respect the individual and or the collective comes next\nWell that's why you know we want to see people move to New Hampshire who love liberty because look the fact is libertarians are to do a deaf diffused out there there's there's too\nFew of us distributed amongst all the rest of these angry people that are looking to fight with the with one another and getting caught in the middle of that conflict isn't going to be any good for our movement if people who care about freedom were to migrate would have joined the New Hampshire freedom migration and come to a place where we've got a bit of a foothold\nWhere the libertarians actually have in Keene New Hampshire more candidates on the ballot then the Republican Party does or the libertarians here are actually\nIn political offices in the state representative seats\nSo we've actually had tremendous success here was a relatively small number of movers we could take the number of movers we've had was just maybe a couple of thousand and multiply that by ten\nYeah the amount of influence that we would have would be tremendous already we have influence inside New Hampshire already there's a a king sentinel article where we're on the front page\nOr where libertarian it's all about the differences between libertarians when this article ever been written in the history of news media yeah\n... I mean really has it ever happened it has there ever been a mainstream media public maybe it has happened where they've actually looked at the differences between the you know so called radical libertarians like us on that show actually believing the principles and then those who are like small government kind of libertarian they talk about that and they get it right right the articles very accurate\nThat just just yesterday morning on the local on a talk show the we had libertarian a governor for governor or a Gillette arm is\nFor any show or an entire our rates and it was very fair you know he was he was he wasn't being easy argues thrown a good question has and she she she and she is kind of a small government she ever libertarian\nUh but uh it's you know but she actually has a chance to get a get a script parents are the three of us know where you're not running this year not yet not this year you can't 'cause you work for the post office they prohibit you\nAre but either way there's some exciting stuff going on here and it's just it's not duplicate Hubble anywhere else because nowhere else has the numbers nowhere else has the uh the influence that we do as a result of those numbers and so anyway back to Venezuela where things are definitely do a\nDegrading they're not getting better\nYeah so there's a little bit more from the Macy's Cuba article out just post that up on the social media is and then I'm jumping over to this article from our guests media where they say that our guest was able to obtain a draft of proposed constitutional reforms\nOr that's what I propose to Venezuela's constitution a part of the plan is to dissolve the state owned P. D. V. and replace it\nWhat they know stayed on the end of the what the hell's the point of that\nYou know kind of like what the Republicans want to do with the patient protection and Affordable Care act\nRepeal and replace it with their own version yeah we just stayed Romneycare and forced across the country instead of Obamacare because somehow it's Democrats when they do it a artist says P. D.

whatever you want our number here\nIs eight fifty five four fifty free that's eight five five four or five zero three seven three three suicides on the rise\nIn Venezuela across the country the numbers are up quite a bit compared to what they were just six years ago when things were relatively stable by comparison in twenty twelve\nA compared to what they are now it's hyperinflation ravaging the other country and of course that results in all kinds of problems like shortages of food like basic food is very very hard to come across\nYou have to stand in line for hours in order to get the most basic food items if you even can get any ah you're probably better off going through the black market where at the very least\nProducts are more available although you obviously you're gonna pay black market rates for them but if it's available then that's better than nothing and uh it's just a tragic situation we've been following here for years on free talk live as it's gotten worse and worse these poor people\nAre a now trapped there are more so than ever with a new formation of a border patrol to keep people inside Venezuela and prevent them from leaving the country because well as you might imagine human capital K let your kid let your peasants girl right people want to get the hell out of there\nAnd uh so remember remember a couple of years ago there was actually a story where\nA ... allowed some people to leave Venezuela\nLike thousands or go shopping to go shopping in Columbia across the border there came back a lot of them did never come back ah that's true some of them did and they complained about uh the price gouging in Columbia\nYeah because uh you can actually buy things in Columbia like magically as soon as you cross the border into Colombia there's\nProducts available you know you want to buy a bunch of rice no problem you know there's bags full of it but uh yeah you can't get that in\nTheir own understand they were complete what price gouging the gouging their own country or Columbia's ... so the claim because in Venezuela the government sets prices correct below market value in a lot of cases yet in Columbia\nThey sell things for what they're worth for what their work [laughter] so when you go to a store that has zero of something but its price at too\nWell you can't buy any because there are no good but it's only two and then you go across the river where they actually have some but it's actually worth six\nBut do you think that if they're right if it's right there on the board or do you think that they might have raised their prices a little\nBecause she has a new a bunch of ... they got the same thing they do with cigarettes in Ghana agency or the other hand is high\nSo why not raise the price a little bit um but but\nBut still even if it's available key words it's available like hey you your your country if you can't do it I mean you've got to got to be the prey that you and if they only had it marked at whatever the regular price is it would seem expensive it would seem expensive to a Venezuelan who is used to prices being set below market levels\nEven though it's not available I'm sure most people were grateful to get whatever they could at whatever yeah it's obviously somebody's\nThe complain when you're dealing with ten thousand people crossing a border right and was because some of these reports were coming from state media ... they may have only interviewed people they knew that were loyal to my door oh who would say the things that they wanted that to point\nSo uh there's a little bit more here but we are going to you David he's in San Francisco we're talking about the suicide rates are which are up drastically in Venezuela go ahead David you're on TALK less\nWell I was gonna I was going to tie it to the fares\nAnd and Saudi Arabia as you might know Venezuela it's got I think they say they've got twenty five percent of the oil reserves of South America\nSo they potentially or a fast wealthy country\nBut Saudi Arabia was playing with a price it was a product you know that\nThey were doing price of oil and brought it down so low that Venezuela was going broke and that's part of the reason why Venezuela's economic crisis this way and then ... and what's going on right now in Saudi Arabia\nThe fact that king is seen as very suspect\nThat should allow for this year we're talking about mark horses to come into play again um\nOh I see the thing you're missing here is there aren't market forces in the oil business in Venezuela\nThere's a one size fits all government company that has basically been run into the ground by government mismanagement and it doesn't have anything to do with the claim that you're making your that somebody somewhere in the UAE you're Saudi Arabia or whoever in the middle east has been unloading product at you know so called it rates\nThey've started doing that in twenty love and remember when ISIS captured so much of this Iraq and\nSyria and oil fields oil prices were at a hundred dollars and ISIS was selling them from between ten and twenty dollars\n... ... and it it got it all in Swiss banks that got involved in\nEvery oil company in the world was buying this oil so cheap and the Saudi Arabians were behind ice\nDo they do understand though that Venezuela is a well situated in a very warm part of the the globe they're right there in near the equator you know a very very nice you know temperate climate they can grow all kinds of things there's much more to Venezuela than just oil\nAnd there's no doubt that there was a lot of money coming in to the government or from the oil sales because again the government runs the oil company therapy BSA\nAnd uh so if the Venezuelan country was actually a market where there was some freedom\nThen people would have been able to decide on their own what they want it to sell that the market but it's not unusual landing harm and creates and bring to the market and compete with and the idea that because somebody's competitive on price is going to destroy an entire country's economy\nNot ... dot com [noise]\n\nWell you know it's not smart job sites that

meanwhile blind camp and as I said we're gonna be talking with Greg palace about this and about a twenty five minutes a blind camp\nHas come out and said well this was actually in a private campaign events they didn't come out and say he simply said to a group of Republican donors and this was a leaked on Tuesday by Rolling Stone day before yesterday\nHe said that uh he was you know well here's the quote\nA he ... he said he was talking about how Abrams is quote put him behind\nPutting a lot of resources behind the get out the vote effort and she said\nAnd he said this is something that concerns us especially if everybody uses an exercise is their right to vote\nBrand cab voter suppression\nChief in Georgia the secretary of state who is also running for governor against Stacey Abrams who if she wins will be the first African American governor in the United states history\nAnd I believe certainly in Georgia history and\nWhat's he doing any suppressing votes in black areas\nIn in African American communities and in ... in Ohio and and we're seeing in fact a federal court in just stopped going that county the most diverse county in Georgia from from purging for throwing away actual ballots people that actually voted\nFrom throwing them away because some you know presumably Republican election officials said well you know that signature doesn't quite match you know in the first cigarette sure they've got their middle initial and the second signature they spelled out their middle name it doesn't match we need to throw this away\nOr go in that county is twelve percent of the population in Georgia and yet you know as of about what I think it was last Thursday or friday at first reported this on this program they accounted for forty percent of all the ballots that had been thrown away the early voting mail in ballots\nThe Washington Post Christopher Ingram they they did this a really really in depth analysis of a new report that was published by political scientist at northern Illinois University in Jacksonville University and China's hon university\nSeriously and they were looking at the thirty three different kinds of laws election laws that we have in the United states in our fifty different states because you know the constitution and and tradition ... have given\nThe individual states the rights to decide who votes of how they vote and under what circumstances they can vote when they can vote when they can't vote with the exception of that you know first Tuesday in November thing that's for the president\nAnd he's thirty three different kinds of laws range from on the one and where I live here in Portland, Oregon\nVoters are registered automatically\nThe said males out ballots to voters weeks before the election I got mine last Thursday I voter friday I voted on Saturday mail them back\nAnd a ... you don't even have to show up you know it's all vote by mail so there's no electronic machines or anything so so Oregon is the most compliant or the the most easy to vote stayed\nAnd then the hardest to vote state is Mississippi\nWhich doesn't allow early voting doesn't allow absentee voting unless you can provide a doctor's slip\nAnd requires\nA ... by a very very strict and narrow definition of photo ID at the polls and what they found this is you know just quoting from this report\nThe five most restrictive states had turnouts in twenty sixteen that were on average nearly nine percentage points lower\nThan the turnout in the five states that in which it was the easiest to vote\nSo it it accounts for a nine point swing\nIn voter participation\nThat that's really substantial ends and then they they also said there are a you know some variables having to a large stay small stays things like that and\nIf you just look at it you know in the as a mathematical construct like you know what would these kind of laws do\nThat suppress voting versus what would these kind of laws do that encourage voting what they found out a again I quote the overall the model predicts an eleven point turnout difference between the least restrictive and most restrictive states and twenty sixteen\nSo you wonder why a minority of Americans voted for Republicans for the house of representatives but they control the house representatives\nAnd that and that was like ... you know slightly less than half of Americans voted for Republicans for the house represented in the in the in the mid forty percent of\nThe percentage of Americans who voted for Republicans for the Senate\nWas in the neighborhood of twenty percent\nAnd yet Republicans control the ...\nThe ... the number of Americans who voted for for a Republican for for the White House for the presidency\nWas three million fewer than the number of Democrats some more Democrats voted for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump more Democrats voted for the for the U.S senators then did Republicans and more and more people voted for Democrats in the house of representatives than voted for Republicans and yet\nThe Republicans are so ring to the system over the last Thirty years and this has been a very well funded very well organized effort that the Republicans control the house the Senate the White House and by virtue of that they have installed their people in the United States Supreme court\nAnd now Donald Trump doubled down on this and you know one of the most naked attempt to voter suppression literally ever in modern times between all levels of government law enforcement are carefully watching for voter fraud including during early voting cheat at your own peril\nViolent usually subject maximum penalties those civil and criminal\nYeah\nThis is the Tom our program may well or Republican Party in Montana says oh sway mailed out

and\nHe has been doing just amazing work uh suing Republican secretaries of state who had been suppressing the vote I was just ranting a few minutes ago Greg about how you um if we're still doing the exit polling\nAnd I frankly I don't know where it's being done who's doing it or what states are going to do it this year but exit polling that has been probably our most reliable indicator in the past of how successful voter suppression efforts have been because people go and they're given a provisional ballot they don't realize it doesn't get counted they tell the exit polls are that they voted\nAnd and uh then you know the exit polls and pollsters say well you know Al Gore won Florida by two points\nBut then the actual numbers come out and all it's a dead heat a you know and that's because Ninety thousand people got the African Americans got thrown out the voting rolls in Florida ... that kind of thing that we are going to see that that kind of red shift in state after state do\nYou know what the state of exit polling us before we get to Bryan camp and everything else is going on [noise]\nTerrible or what's happened is after the exit pollsters are caught the the Bush family in stealing the two thousand election they're hauled before Congress then\nThey found out then the exit pollsters that\nJohn Kerry won Ohio on the president the folks that got hold and again so now they do something called conforming are you ready for this they ... they do their exit polls and then when they get the official note the official numbers they start loading in the official numbers and throwing away their own actual data\nWhich is one thing that we have to to try to figure out whether they stole the election you know for sure the United states State Department uses exit polls as the gold standard for determining whether an election was stolen that's\nYour real return the election and Ukraine for God's late because of the bowl ... exactly\nAnd so now we we find that the Hillary won a the ... states when the electoral college in sixteen we and and you had to actually right by the way I Know what you said that I Do with the Tom Hartmann program\nKais\nLadder and by

and KPFK dot org is the website so anyhow back to back to exit polls\nYet so we have this horrible thing called conforming where they simply take the official word and the the the official bogus numbers and you're absolutely right on on why this is happening we'd had we're talking in the last election officially\nTo point seven million provisional ballots reported that's probably about half the number actually cast\nTwo million of those were never counted and that's the official word from the federal government\nSo we have this massive kind of back of the bus voting system called provisional ballots which is pretty much for a voters of color\nAnd uh I just came back from Georgia and you are going to the\nProvisional ballots in Georgia like you can't believe are coming in plus you're right um you have after ... being thrown in the garbage they they use in Georgia and a system a Brian Kemp me I should say excuse me Brian Kemp he's a secretary of state\nHe's the guy runs election count for the ... and he's running for governor at the same time I'm avoiding the usual a inconvenience that secretaries of state run for higher office resign first so there's no conflict of interest I mean conflicts or us is is that these operations name\nTongue in cheek but yeah [laughter] yep yeah [laughter] ... yeah that would that I made that up\nSo the Republicans have been caught warning donors about voting all black is that donors are voters do I have a ...\nThey they they ah they use on a private all with the private ... or did\nA that is a Brian Kemp the secretary of state who is running against Stacey Abrams he's the republic\nAnd she's the Democrat and as you should know by now she'd be the first African American female governor of the United states if they count all the ballots at least from what the polling you're showing\nBut so ... got on the phone and is scaring his donors and to get more money because it you know Stacey Abrams is is basically beating the crap out of us on the absentee ballot people ask ... thousand advance\nNow he had some trips up his leads to make sure those ballots don't get to those voters don't get counted et cetera but in the meantime he is you know he's basically telling his donors man if they have these ballots we lose send me money\nWhoa whoa\nSo ... what is the ... what is the state of things right now I noticed on

better policy never going to get better poles when when people think that they voted and come out and tell your pollsters yeah I voted\nI mean you know and and it gets report and you know well here's

was fantastic I think we really need to conceptualize everything that's going on right now but my my question and and my real problem is how\nDo we get people who don't believe in facts to understand facts or more importantly the people that are apathetic and just don't know not that they don't care or just that they just don't know how do we get them to see what's going on in historical context and and really be as concerned as I think people should be\nWell the red eye open the show with will be up on YouTube and a few hours or as a stand alone YouTube clip and the you know You're welcome to to share it with as many friends as you want a the most of what I was reading from was at a at history dot org or their page on crystal mocked\nAnd uh he share that with people or you know the the the simple fact of the matter is that while there is a a good chunk of anti Semitism in\nTrump in his white supremacists and when you're ... you know the last time I talked to David Duke on this program and I I won't have him back any more as a as a consequence of how he responded\nUm every thing I tried to discuss with him he turned into a you know well how many Jews run Hollywood you know these kind of these kind of a question really really rose anti Semitic questions\nAnd ah you know tried to turn the tables on it so but my point is that there's a a big chunk of anti Semitism in here\nBut it wasn't just the Jews that Hitler was going after and just like it's not just the Jews the Trump is going after he's going after African Americans now there are not\nPeople of color in it in Nazi Germany at the time\nNow you've got the Turks in Germany who were brought in after the war to rebuild the country there they were called the guest workers gassed are fighters as the German word for that and now sometimes two three four generations down many of them still don't have German citizenship and there's a whole issue around us\nAnd a lot of the rage of the modern day Nazis in Germany and I'm Talking to literally the people who are and and the and the and the hard right a party political party in Germany the just acquired some seats in parliament is against the Turks side against the Jews because they got no Jews what\nWell where very few but what's happening here is it's against Hispanics and it's against African Americans and it's against Jews it's a it's a three for and I'm I'm telling ya de on\nAfrican Americans know what's going on they know what I'm Talking about\nHispanics are quickly figuring out what's going on and what I'm Talking about and the one one problem might be that many many a recent visitors to the United states or or residents they as they started in Citizens United states\nWho are Hispanic or listen to Spanish language media or watched Spanish language television and I don't know how this is being played out there\nBut I think that the only thing that we can do is spread the word is far and wide as possible and not and not allow this both sides is um you know this this crap that you hear from time to time well you know there are radicals in the Democratic party really uh you know well you know it's like a Newt Gingrich said

I mean with us Israel relations uh thirty four percent of American Jews will support President Trump on that same issue is very lopsided\nSo it's ... it's a very serious by it's a very substantial minority of yeah okay that's very\n... I wanted to point that out and also with a pack that was something with Tom DeLay of Texas who worked very hard to combine some people to try to get money out of a the American Israeli political action committee and I was there when I saw it happen\nTo the Republican Party absolutely it was a concentrated for by Tom DeLay to do it he focused on it he made it a daily chores to do that\nAnd you were there and you saw it I was there I was in the room I heard it all of direct vacuum up so what's going on in the world\nWell of course the situation with the the horrible situation with the uh the bombs have been sent they seem to be at this point in time at least a you know they are not sophisticated but they seem to be from\nAt least the same person or the same group or because they are dangerous but not sophisticated or than people that you know I've talked to people that are sort of bomb experts\nOn this show is nothing coming from the government but they seem to believe that they will be able to track down uh whoever person or again groups\nThat were involved in this just become a horrific situation of course yeah and the president I made a you know a conciliatory statement but then he went to Wisconsin last night and went right back\nTo the national media a battery and rushing to heat the media is related to debt or the other thing is that the have you talked about the president's a cellphone yet today\n[noise] no I have not okay for this one is I mean this is amazing\nThe ... just to put this in context\nWhat the Republicans spent years harassing Hillary Clinton over and trying to prosecute her foreign millions of dollars trying to prosecutor for was using a private email server in her home or to conduct big government business when she was actually a state which turns out she didn't do but she didn't use it for you know private stuff\nBut uh and the whole thing was you know that server isn't secure it doesn't have a government level security it could be hacked and therefore we should lock her up\nIt never was acted turns out but we should lock her up because it could have been hacked now to Mr Trump\nWhy I I Would make that conclusion to make that parallel because of all that was said there is also part of this that is humorous but it's sad\nUm and it was a defense in the story and I'll get to that President Obama when he became president he loved his blackberry we all knew that he wanted to keep it they said you can't and he didn't he turned over his blackberry well President Trump we find out did not turn over years to phone ones that quote government vote and the other is his personal phone didn't turn it over he has used it\nOr they are saying uh categorically point blank the Chinese have listened in\nAnd not for secrets but they have listened in\nTo try to understand him have psychiatrists psychologists look at it to try to see how they can manipulate him how they can ... and ... which is very fast\nRight they're they're probably teaching president Xi outta high behavior toward Trump the way Sean Hannity does every night when they have their conversation why that maybe the here's how to get him to be your best friend\nSean Hannity to do it so that part of this is actually in a story that is amazing calm is when the story says there wasn't concerned about the president because he doesn't read security briefings anyway\nThat in the story interests on his own down an uninformed that he couldn't spell American secrets because we don't give any to him but we are kind of bummed out that that the Chinese are figuring out how it relates to people out of one to one basis so that they can they can suck up to them more effectively\nBasically yes ... better than I go to and that's in the story it is actually an amazing story so he still continued to keep a cell phone how he does that why nobody is able to take that from is you know\nHe pointed out saying that story was wrong but he didn't offer any\nEvidence [noise] amazing bomb they would talk radio news his book is side swipe at ... ... it's still out and Kendall also it's it's amazing [noise] five thanks so much for dropping by today

added if we have a downturn in the economy there are a lot of firms that will go bankrupt because of this debt she's talking about all those corporate debt\nIn fact she was back up a little bit she
