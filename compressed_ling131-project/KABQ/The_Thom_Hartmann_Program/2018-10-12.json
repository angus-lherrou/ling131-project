that I'm about to 'em but I think there's a lesson here I don't do man\nI Know where you go ahead go ahead\nI Know I Know but the ... so I don't think of an elephant this is why would never do this are typically but the con man and Kanye match made in heaven now the reason why I mean the first time that someone sending me messages you got to see this and I I didn't I wasn't near a TV\nI watch five minutes of the crap and it was five minutes I'll never get back in my life\nOut of the first thing I thought was an arm and and and be ready what but one of us from Joe\nWell island yeah yeah what the hell is this is a joke is is buried somewhere how about this or you can work for you dirty who make a deal and they feel wonderful deal I've been doing deal I got it\nWell but that was the thing is it it was so obvious and it was a rare thing actually that's why I'm only mentioning it and here's my um presentation or it was rare that a youthful idiot used a youthful idiots trying to gain the headlines\nAnd and I think some of us so for nine right now kind of fallen for it in the sense that I just wanted to\nSpotlight the fact but here's the thing by letting a racist use a\nBlack man use you as a prop and then you know ready for something is wrong with this guy\nThere is some ... this guy is sick this guy is sick there's something wrong with this guy\nYou know what else John this is ridiculous this is ridiculous you know you go I found it for you so you know any well\nYou know I mean you can't make the strong\nShowing you can make this stuff I mean you can't make this stuff up however ... joking around the side I Do believe and and I'm not look I'm a white guy me James Taylor I'm an old white guy so\nThe world all of us there were all white guys now so I'm an old white guy\nAnyway to me when I'm observing is that the African American community kinda writ large uh has\nAll ready largely discounted in deeply discounted con yang basically saying he's not real he's just you know whatever you do a part of what we got in mind they think they just kind of mentally separated from him he ... he seems to be you know\nI look I don't I don't follow this stuff I'm not target demo I don't have young kids like you do uh but I Know that he's kind of had these breakdowns on stage where he's been supposedly doing a concert and all of a sudden you start talking to ... years not than about his\nDebt situation or whatever I mean the guy obviously you know look this is something wrong with the guy he's\nThis guy is sick or something like this guy said\nThis about one more of the labels that needs to be put to rest norm\nNinety nine percent of us now means almost all of this reality show people and and the news and all the uh the cable news networks do we use reality t._v. it's not reality to have a TV camera in your face\nEven if it's for a week or however long you have it for the show that's not reality reality is we don't have that in our lives and so we got to stop that because that is a bad label and this guy isn't crazy he's just not bash right\nWell John I guess everybody's allowed to live their lives the way they want to live their life within reasonable limits right I mean if you want to be an ax murderer or you're not allowed to live your life the way you want to live your life I guess we have laws against murder and stuff but if\nKanye West wants to act like a fool Kanye West has the right time like a fool absolutely I mean they lie and her absolutely and the fact that Benedict was act like a full well look we we allowed him to be there\nIt if it were up to me and I have you know my little weight on Twitter has been hey why don't we just ignore Kanye and they'll go away and and obviously we can't ignore him and he's not going away because he's been invited to the White House\nBy Benedict Donald and when you get invited to the White House my whoever's in the White House that make the news and the media is going to retire at around so we're just stuck with this guy\nAnd that's the problem is this guy this guy was stuck with both of these guys don't love me the one of those guys Sean does our crime syndicate\nIt operate with you and what we do we can\nJust use them just used them just basically you know\nUse Kanye to say the guys obviously if you want to feel sympathy for just ... you know there's something obviously there's something wrong with him or the fact that he is cast in his lot with someone who would ... and early ... send him to the nearest plantation for hard labor ...\nIf he wants to act the fool the best and the only thing it seems to me that we can do is say hey everybody looking tiny he's a fool let's not you'll be like that\nWhat you and I'd be normal don't wash the stage and steal somebody's microphone away from them when they're experiencing a special moment in their life that's not a nice thing to do don't make I tell you don't do it right Domenico\nLeading to do anything anyway so look ... is I guess he's married to a she married to give ... who's married to a night so that's going to get him in the news anyway I'm going back to ignoring the guy\nI'd like to ignore all of them Justin Bieber Sean minute I'm happy to ignore them all area and uh granted I'm Darryl Katy Perry you're doing a heck of a job I'll be back tomorrow radio where justice is served without any of that stuff [laughter]\nHow ... ... Russian cracker\nDot com [noise] appearing auditory about Albuquerque convert to better December [noise]\nImagine what it's like to be active your whole life and then find out you're going blind I have a trendy to macular degeneration or AMD\nAs a white mother and grandmother my site is precious to me so I was relieved to find a treatment for some forms of AMD are available and research for additional treatments is on her way home accommodation fighting climate today at one eight hundred line for a free pack a dumb reverse thing are managing AMD or go to the website\nSome of them probably don't see them I don't but but you know we say forget him do it right I mean that's what we're excited about and we're talking with Derrick about this yesterday of that it's not it's yeah sure all the technology is cool and there's a lot of really neat aspects to it but it's the real life use of crypto currency\nWhich is really special Rand underutilized why would someone have a coin that they don't want people to use I don't know well because they're not\nTrying to create cash so we're all of a throw grass no no no but they like like for instance there there was a talk about security where you want to be able to to have an ownership stake in something without having a third party\nUm permission giving you that then they so like I went to jail or on my house and traded with other people without having to ask the state to who exchange it in their their leisure\nExactly so there's a you know people that are just doing programming and they're real proud of the thing they've created they didn't really like the guy with ... he did he had it was a joke he had no idea that it was going to become this thing that took on a life of its own I'm so he couldn't control it was a joke but it depends who you ask\nWell it it's similarly the people who don't want their point is to be used as cash they think this is not cash I think they will learn in time that everything will be cash that uh that\nThey want and they all want their assets to be liquid ... so that they can buy and sell them they can use them and if they're liquid than they might as well be you if there are a liquid then you can spend them in the future\nThat I see is that\nAll the coins have some amount of liquidity and then you can spend them anywhere and they will convert into whatever the business wants to accept\nAnd that's something you want any pay to facilitate down the line [noise]\nThat's right well someone has to do it and just like someone had to create a cash register for dash\nBut let's be honest there's they're just not worth that much of your time I mean you guys are busy you only have so many programmers on staff at any pay\nThere is a two thousand plus you know crypto currency is out there probably gonna be another thousand within a year or whoever the largest the ones that are listed on clean market cap and sort of already listed on there because they don't have enough of our I mean I Love the idea of being compatible but\nMost of them you don't even want to bother with you can only spend so much time do they pay us than the way All right so that's our business we\nWe we've always been wondering like how does any pay make any money they make\nMoney if the software as a as a service um coin companies subscribe to our platform they get their coin in our software in our network of businesses makes sense and we also designed promotions with them that that helped drive consumer demand like dashed back\nWhich is ten percent back right now it dashed back that there might be other promotions with other coins is what you're saying that\nThere will almost guaranteed the promotions with other coins because people are already asking us to to do even like free things and I'm at the different types of discount on\nAnd that makes sense because then you're only dealing with the serious coins the ones that actually want to be currency the ones that are willing to put some money behind their goal of being currency rather than just throwing something out to the market and seeing what happens\nYou guys already have an established position in the marketplace as it certainly here in southern New Hampshire as the leading a cryptic currency accepting app at storefronts at retail or establishment and so you can come to the table to these uh coins and say hey look\nWe've already got X amount of does in real life verified merchants that are doing business with these crip does right now would you like to be in the menu of options it's more likely\nThey are coming to us and saying can we be in the menu of options even better so that you know they see an announcement ex coin was listed now they really want to get on there\nAnd and often it's it's like people will tell them about us mhm they'll tell you you need to talk to these any pay guys because they can get your coin in circulation in some real retail businesses like\nFor instance um we're working with a team that bond that have ripple I'm actually involved with ripple and they have this technology\nThat they want to get into retail businesses and it's a protocol for exchanging coins crypto currencies\nAnd it's like an open way of exchanging different coins like reading a centralized exchange as some sort of it's a decentralized exchange protocol so it's not even an exchange at all but a protocol for making exchanges\nAnd they are very nerdy extremely brilliant on these guys are craving like the new and unknown is for them they're so awesome but they\nHave they don't talk to businesses Martin coined like they just don't they don't do it so what and they wouldn't be good at it if they try you know where you ... you come in that's why they like me and that's why we worked together and they want to get their protocol\nIn an actual businesses and and you know videos of people spending dash but receiving bitcoin cash ... and using the inter ledger protocol um is that that's one thing that's very exciting for me yeah but we're working with multiple parties to build this this any pay system\nI Love it I and I'm so excited by what you guys are doing can you stick with us and stay for another segment your Steven Tyler I one of the founders one of the two founders of any pay along with Derrick Freeman our former co host or we're gonna

know Ron's last name nor did you know we we didn't ask permission to give it out so we went and give it out even if we also didn't give it yes so us Iran is our winter of one and a half then\nAnd you could win one point seven five then by entering the new contest that they're taking about a week so you've got about a week or two a until next Wednesday so through Tuesday and then maybe early submissions on Wednesday will get in\nThe ... yeah so then you're gonna draw another winter for one point seven five is Dan and here's how you enter that contest you just email Darryl Darryl at free talk live dot com there's two hours in Darryl Darryl ... live dot com\nAnd a include yours then address your transparent and then address which is like the normal public address\nAnd also in the subject line of the email you need to put a number between one and nine hundred and Ninety nine yeah and then you've chosen a number between those numbers and I have generated a number of between that and so whoever it is it gets closest to the number that's been generated will win the one point seven five so yeah so that's how you do it\nAgain email Darryl free chocolate dot com\nSubject line has to have the number between one and nine Ninety nine\nAnd then uh the emails text needs to have your trends parents was that address and your previously one you were not eligible\nHowever um isn't there a grand prize give away the\nThere is a to Z them yet okay and if you enter you will be eligible for that and you know if you've entered previous weeks then you basically accumulating ... anyway\nSo that then and they have some cool stuff and we're so glad to be partnered up with that and and this comes back to what I was talking about with dash which we also had a sponsorship with last year\nUm where they can be a little stickler right like you're dealing with hundreds of people who are the decision makers there and they feel very strongly one way or another about whatever the proposals are that are being\nMade their community for funding whereas with then at least at the moment you just dealing with the guys that runs in who happened to be very libertarian guys we've had ...\nYeah that's true that's true uh we have Robert who is one of their founders on the show multiple times yes um and he's like a volunteer is like truly they've actually got volunteerism written into their white paper so like these guys are the real deal they understand economics they understand liberty\nAnd that is one of the things I like the most about that 'cause you know anybody can have zero knowledge anonymity technology right like it's open source you want that for your coin grab the code but it in your coin you've got it\nBut not every coin has a libertarian philosophy backing it\nAnd so my my concern of course is wins then goes to more decentralized like ... or ... whatever kind of voting system comes up how's that going to change how things play\nOut that's why all the libertarians listening right now I Need to go buy up all of this is is that we got on the entire system and have a majority forever\nThat's how you solve that problem but then again we've also seen libertarians love to fight over petty crap to\nYeah without a doubt and democracy seems to be really annoying right and and uh I'm doing business with with executives and much ... and people who have been delegated decision making power is awesome\nRight as long as they're on on board with your ideas and they absolutely are and they're excited and you guys just announced that then is partnering up with a with any pay we didn't get the press release that tell us what a what the you know what's the big news here\nHooked the news is that at this summer's is an approach any pay some people from then because they heard that we had the best cryptic cash register ab\nAnd that we were helping dash get into retail businesses yeah which is unheard of basically for any coin even bitcoin ... and I'm so they came and they said what how can we get on your platform\nAnd we negotiated them um but basically what we wanted was a certain stake in the network and other than to run a certain number of than\nSecure notes and then I'm an exchange reading them so that anyone can use them\nIn their business right now one thing that they did and now it's which is a little bit not accurate they they announced that you can use then at two hundred merchant but the truth as you'd have to convince those two hundred bird at an added to accept that right and they're not going to\nNot right away they're not going to\nI mean I I was in his very very successful and the I mean I guess they will be but it was it was going to take a long time and look no where the opposition venting them and so this is this is why I really am strongly\nLeaning I really want to develop its enter ledger concepts right\nSo that then can be activated on all two hundred of of the retailers without them doing anything and then it does it needs to be added in automatically to any new person even if they just set up dash\nSo this enter ledger thing would this be some kind of like Quan told them swap are atomic swap sort of the visit article it is\nA an atomic swap kind of protocol um ultimately it wouldn't be cryptic graphically atomic and there would be a possibility of the transaction being rolled back ... or so this this protocol is very deeply developed and it has a lot of um nuances that\nSo you've already coded some some of this no\nDefinitely not and actually this is something we're working in our business now only pre selling a solution so we we're not we're trying not to build anything and like listen forget that said that it with respect to cash because we really did a lot of work before selling it but we are going to sell it before you really watch it right um but\nI don't know I've paraphrasing here but if the government came to um this uh organization this this wallet and said hey you have to turn over all your customers bonds he would say no and go to jail\nBats moths without lynching and that was so cool and so right now and ... yeah I mean you need to ... you need to fix that\nHe said he's going to watch it with his kids which is yeah it's awesome yeah how old are the kids I don't know I didn't start talking about setting of wallets and and how easy it can be and we were also talking about clean taxed before in art on each time more bright\nAnd our money's project yeah check it out I oh I think if we go back to that but yeah sure so easy to ... all the difficulty of having someone set up a a wallet sometimes they get stopped at the apple password part where they're like oh I can just call it a bit of like pathetic but if you know rather than making fun of these people\nGive them an easier option right hey what's your phone number I can just text you some bitcoin right it's not really perfect bitcoin but it's the easiest way to get big clean into people's hands they have nothing to do they just receive attacked and they are able to use ...\nI was really impressed with ah with it when you know Vin first told us about it on free talk live um because one of\nThe things that I think was was so important about the original bitcoin BTC as it as it was originally kind of intended it seems was that it was useful for people who were on banked it was useful for poor people and like the deepest depths of Africa where they're just now getting Internet service\nOr or or phone service and that was because the fees were so ... so low so it didn't cost a whole lot of money for these folks to send money around which previously was an unreachable service for them they couldn't afford it with a with banks and that sort of thing couldn't even get an account and the first place and so ... ... people who just have like a dumb phones\nPeople who don't even have a smartphone can send and receive\nA bitcoin yeah we're going to have a a smartphone but they can't download a darn app have done phone that will have to make it easy for them and the interfaces way easier than you would you would think\nOh yeah I tried to how joyful it is to just have no work to do but just received bitcoin on your phone like uh you would attack right it it'd be like oh great yeah and it's easy because you don't have to deal with the long number the address the crypt of using the phone number is great now I Wonder did you argue hosted by\nSo I keep I keep a balance on quaint expert cool different coins just in that instance you want to tip someone they don't have the times has set up a wallet here\nYou've got basically ... okay so he's one of the the speakers the yeah been a ... at night haired and Daniel ... is a crate what's yeah Daniel Craig Craig with uh the emperor of that coin was while you were telling us still profess to be I think bitcoin heretic segment that you're telling us about that's happening tonight that's right yeah\nUh he describes himself as a software engineer author and commentator he's the co founder of the ... Institute a wow which people should look up if you haven't heard of that\nAnd the Yahoo Finance or called him the leading crypto currency philosopher and who is this again Daniel Craig winner crew it's okay and there was another there's a third gentleman yes Christian heroes or he's a bit quite evangelist public speaker podcaster journalists\nHost of heroes uncensored which is a wide ranging and insightful look at people projects and culture of crypto currency and watching technology\nSo uh any in the picture he's wearing a narrow hats so he's definitely a cool guy right on well he's going to love and that's what makes them a bit quite heretic\nBecause looking at the definition of a heretic right and it is what I thought someone who goes against the church basic ... person believing in or practicing religious heresy so if you ever say going against whatever the dog dog more doctrinaire right\nBut you know like there are a lot of a bitcoin maximalist than ... coined can be the ... and there can't be any other ... well if you're doing but there are\nA bit and you know your a heretic to the hospital if you're promoting raven coin or dash or is this an or one of the other\nWhat twenty billion other coins that probably exist we only know about a Twenty one hundred that are listed on quite market cap and that and all level\nOr though if you're promoting anything else than technically you would be a bitcoin heretic even if you say I like bitcoin as well\nI guess you're right about that um and these guys sound like they're going to give some excellent presentations you said you're going to get video so folks will be able to to see this I don't know if we can uh I'm gonna ask then oh you didn't have that in a gotcha All right we'll talk to and we'll see\nWe'll see what he says about that yeah he'll be the ideal bitcoin or the role of the individual and crypto I\nMean maybe they want to put it behind a pay wall or whatever but at some point ... if you're going to get video somebody will be able to see it right or at some point if they can't make it 'cause it's always so important or if you're ... if you're hosting an event you know I did this with king mention where everything is recorded you see it later on\nBecause the fact is not everybody can make it right and they shouldn't be excluded after the fact if you want to be there and get it in the moment there's nothing like that right ah but after the fact but it online let people you know see it that way they can come to the next one\nRight and whiskey invention we were putting it on community access CD yeah that's true listen to this as the culture surrounding crypto currency become ever more tribal\nElection of individuals' dare to express a set of provocative and intriguing ideas about the historical significance of watching technology and the vision for a new way forward\nSo ... of these big quaint heritage except come together during the free state block chain and digital assets conference for a special conversation on the role of the individual and crypto I Love it so yeah this is cool and again it's going to have a cocktail cocktail bars so it's going to be a fun place to hang out tonight\nLooking forward to it and that's going to be happening at any paid on global headquarters and also the ... Institute of technology a so wow what a great event this has been ah we've got more coming up here with a with free talk live of course and he paid ... global we talked a lot about that a couple of days ago um\nThere's new developments behind the scenes already we can't talk about that that's off the record but we're going to update you as soon as new new things were added with a with any pay and future you're excited that is meaningful to your town\n... I like that even more because uh you know we've got something special here in New Hampshire and and that's part of what we tried to communicate yesterday uh when we were on stage we actually had a panel which Chris three of us um it was a I felt really good panel where we were explaining why New Hampshire's the crypto mecca\nAnd why people who are not just into liberty but people who are into crypto and liberty really ought to get up here\nEven just for a visit the joy of using crypto currency in real life is unmatched by by anything I've experienced you you feel more free\nExercising your financial freedom you and protecting your financial privacy than than you ever have experience and you're living in New Hampshire so you like extra free well yeah no taxes that helps right but\nWhen people it's cool you might have a a big point like a credit card or a debit card that you can swipe at that point of sale it registers around the country of the world and you fund it with bitcoin and it feels kind of like you're spending bitcoin uh this is even better than that sure is Jay Freeman from\nAny pay dot global we're going to continue here this is talk live where the free state block

hypothetical\nDemocrat right and so surprise surprise so they never had a libertarian debate even though ... already met the criteria and I'm sure Erin de would have as well\nRight but there are rules said if only one candidate meets the criteria then nobody from that party gets to debate\nBut I Believe they were also using because there was a Democratic primary poll that was done they were using that to say oh well see they're both pulling ahead of the ... of course a and there were never any polls of in the libertarian\nPrimary who would you vote for now and of course so after the primary they jacked the requirements up to twelve percent twenty five thousand dollars and fundraising yet in part because they know that first off not all the polls even include libertarian candidate which

that was you're a good time we're talking with Lou wonda at that time and I'm like we've got to have\nLuanda on the radio to talk about these a scam artist targeting older women but you know not just older women probably you know all kinds of folks who are lonely people who are looking for attention who doesn't want attention everybody does it's it's one of our\nOne of one of the things that makes us feel good about it right and and uh so we're going to get back into that but I Do want to mention bitcoin dot com which is a great site for people all around the world to visit and learn about bitcoin crypto currency ah you can get your first bitcoin BTC or bitcoin cash through the site\nAnd it's a great way to get started in the world of crypto good bitcoin dot com you can also get the latest news headlines over at news dot ... dot com\nSo low on that you were talking about how you know how can people fall for this I mean whether you were Eighteen or Seventy eight or this is the scam you you said wouldn't have worked on on you\nRight I I don't know what happened I I don't know whether we're more naive or maybe we're more lonely\nBecause of social media people don't have any personal contact so then when they do make contact a on the Internet they think that you know somebody's paying attention ram and talking to them on a daily basis and tell them they love them and and I think\nThat gives them some hope for the future but it shocks me because there's um\nThere's things that happened during the scam that that myself I see right away that something's wrong here you know like um I started getting pictures of military man\nAnd the the first one or two I thought well this I'd be a pen pal too man in the military you know send them pictures from back home\nBut then I realized that the pictures are very pixilated and in the military man ever response to me even if it's a five star general in the picture right it'll be very poor English and you realize you know this person has nothing to do with the military or\nNot to say young people in America don't have poor you know\nWriting well ability room [laughter] where do you think a five star generals usually do pretty well yeah yeah you would think somebody is probably going to West Point right in a four year degree and do a little better post graduate studies could probably put a sentence together yes yeah one would hope\nThat people are lonely and and then that's that's true of the folks of all ages for sure\nI imagine that uh some elderly folks the more isolated they become more desperate you know they might be\n... what happens the family has grown up and go on their way but it's not all um\nIt it's not all the male female kind of scams you know there's other scams you know I'm ... oh yeah college educated and I almost fell for one\nI'm a woman had contacted me on my email address I should have wondered how she got it right and said that she enjoyed my book\nAnd when that made me feel good and she loved my writing and that made me feel good for us and she wanted to help me with my writing group so that sounded wonderful so we talked a couple of times and she said she was terminally ill\nAnd she was going to die very soon and she had no family and she learned to leave her money to me\nAnd not that I should use it for good you know right good things and how the writing group\nAnd that sounded very realistic to me she knew the name of my books you know my name and your ... so I'm thinking well gee that's very nice of her and then I got the tech saying I'm going to be dying in two days\nAnd I want to spend the money to you so you need to send me your mayoral routing for creating ... routing affirmation so my barrister now this is the first time I realized he's not my own country can send you a lot of money\nSo sadly that was the end of our\nYet that ship\nOh yeah I mean we've had a and it's not so much the routing number it's actually the account numbers what we learned if they have your kids reading those are all public anybody with Google can find any banks guide writer of the easy part yeah yeah um but it's actually getting the account number\nWe've actually had people ah authorized that because we still some bitcoin on line ... we've had people authorized\nLike credit card payments and car payments because they had the numbers and the way the old banking system works you can just do that if you have the numbers whether it be your credit card number or the account number on your bank account\nOr you can just authorized people to take money out of it you know strangers African authorized to take money out of your own account somebody made up a fake check\nOne yet I run a small business but I've had um\nUh my business bank account my checking account for my business has paid people's capital one bill in one instance in another case we uh\nWe graciously paid off somebody's automobile through Toyota Motor credit [noise] um God it seemed like there was another one in there too but it was hell because somebody got a hold of the actual account number right and that's it\nAnd they scammers can be very very clever I once had a\nHad a Persian silk rug I wanted to sell I put a picture on E. bay and I got a couple of people asking questions about it and one man said I like the right I'm going to buy it\nUm so hold it for me a couple of days that it's OK so it was selling for Fifteen hundred so he agreed on the price we didn't you know go back and forth on that\nAnd then uh we made arrangements for when he was going to pick it up and I thought well I'll be smart where I won't come to my house in Enron grocery store parking lot that was fine with him\nSo the day before we were supposed to me\nHe sends me a message and says that his wife is pregnant and she's very sick and the baby's coming early and he has to go to the hospital and his friend is going to come and pick up the ... and thinking well that's okay you know and all I have to do is give the friend\nTwo hundred dollars\nAnd then the friend will give me the check for the ride [laughter]\nOkay and I'm I don't think so we're we're\nHave done here is is not how they work so he had the rug and the two hundred dollars you'd have to say I had as a station prefer unreal that\nWell one guy in New Hampshire is there's no home rule so the towns actually are subservient to the state government as far as what they can pass so they can only pass what their theoretically they can only pass what they're specifically authorized to\nUh by the state government they can't go outside of whatever those bounds our lives and it helps keep them in check yeah\n... yeah and then as a former selection of a small town in New Hampshire I mean there's it's a relatively short list of things that you could do um\nReally there's a really short list of things you could do period you can do exactly what the the state says you can do and that's it and by state I I mean the representatives from everywhere\nAnd so we could do it on Wyoming in there and yeah sure here but Caitlin you're also like a block chain lady I'm former Wall Street's a person for twenty something years yet and you know Chris you guys have something they want to forget what it was yeah we're we're talking about lots of stuff\nThe big quite embassies sock Colleen last time I we drove through quite a few weeks ago and you're beautiful shop and\nWell and I've I've certainly followed your career to distance or\nAre you as a token Austria and that's what you yes on Wall street all straight to work again a lot more now mainly\nYeah yeah and I'm not a lot of uh Austrian economic thought um I Would say oh side of the big banks I'm washing or on in Wall Street\nWell and but I must convince it must have been I was into the Austrian when I started um I came out of the University of Wyoming did a couple of graduate degrees at Harvard and then I was in so much debt that\nI kind of told myself that high is better in Wall Street was was the place that I ended up I was pretty good at numbers and so state I after paying off my debt and and I was sixteen years in before I figured out\nWhat Austrian economics was and then that just changed my world view an interesting question at that point that I had as do I stick around it was after the financial crisis\nThe year the financial crisis I did get a bonus and I donated most of the ... Institute and the ... at ... at that time I was really trying to figure it all out and you know it it's a kind of have an existential crisis when you realize that what you do professionally\nIsn't necessarily a hundred percent ethical but I loved the Michael breweries um um uh he he gave a UCLA graduation speech and I just read listen to it 'cause I'm going to be speaking at the University of Wyoming in a couple of weeks\nAnd he had a really interesting message which is you know the world around you you're going to find is there's a lot about it that's not ethical there's a lot about it that's corrupt it's true and what you do is find ethical ways to\n... to live in the world because you can't necessarily change the system right and so what I did was spent a lotta time educating people about the system and also everything I did in the pension business was about de leveraging an asset liability matching and let it ride with him singers\nIt basically if you think back to like the ... um [noise] there a couple of different ways rational Reserve Bank and can happen we tend to think of it as the ... you know banks multiplying of a ... money and to you know ten dollars of\nOf him to 'em and it but but there's another aspect of it which is the maturity transformation aspect\nWhere banks basically borrow short and lend long\nAnd that's one of the reasons that they can hit the wall because if there is a run on the bank all of their liabilities or short term everybody goes in climate here deposit other assets that cash isn't coming in for years right so the maturity to transformation stuff in the financial system is a real problem as well as rational reserve banking and long story short the\nThey um [noise] I ... everything I did was getting at getting the maturity transformation issue fixed and a lot of these pension fund so I'm very proud of the work I did on Wall street and yet I co existed with a lot of people who\nIn many cases just weren't curious and didn't really understand the system around them in some cases they definitely did but I I actually give the people the benefit of the doubt I'd um lots of noise\nBehind it All right we're hearing a realize what we are are we are today I can attest to that for lunch so\nI was gonna say of the very simplistic view of what the fed does yep uh for a lot of libertarians is just well they just print more money um but that\nWas er banking is a completely different thing and it's interesting to go into the aspect of the short versus long and that's that's part of this the hard work completely never um been confronted\nWith that is right and a lot of pension funds because of the the adverse incentives any accounting\nUm are are significantly I thought liability mismatched and once we pulled out the\nPension liabilities and got annuities written for the pensioners so everybody instead of getting a pension from General Motors if they were in this these these pension transactions they we are now getting an annuity in that case from potential but those are new days were\nWere over a hundred percent funded right and they were all asset liability match the cash flows from the assets had timing to coincide with the cash flows of the pensions that had to be paid out so um and they were they were the risk from a credit perspective so long story short\nHe must be rough and I think it would have approved of what I was doing right in spite of the fact that yes it was at one of the big banks that is a you know is subsidized by the fed\nInto boiled us all down what would've happened if you had not pursue this path where we're the funds hadn't well\nThey were ... they they would have stayed underfunded and and duration mismatched right so not sustainable not sustainable yeah you know it's it's also worth saying\nThat a lot of it basically everything we did was with the base there I did we need to be part of a fed subsidized Balanchine no because the clients are paying fees to advise them on how to structure these transactions\nAnd uh you know what I'm really proud of it because when I look back\nThere was an interview with a General Motors pension or they had just come through their bankruptcy\nAnd the pension or in AARP magazine was talking about how thrilled he was that he was now not worried about whether his pension was going to be paid and you know what that really made my day because you made it more rock solid yeah some of these problems and it wasn't me it was but it was the it was the business that I was running and fried\nAnd somebody bringing a fresh out of ideas or to the absolutely\nAnd proving that it was actually in everybody's interest it was a win win situation to take these leverage pension funds out of corporate America corps\nYou know the duration of a of a business is not as long as a human life right and so frankly pensions don't really belong inside corporate corporations anyway because the ... the workers have a longer life expectancy than the business itself\nDo you want to stick with us and keep going for another segment of users\nOr with Caitlin along your moments her website by the way Caitlin with a C.

Wyoming is somebody it's like a hamster that's a pretty libertarian oriented place and doesn't mind taking on the federal fight\nAnd something big happening in Wyoming very recently which is one of the biggest banks in the state stopped banking the energy industry and that's the biggest industry I went home says Wyoming we do coal crypto and a cat coal cattle encrypted okay\nAnd I would add and gun in Wyoming um ... those are the those are the big industry in Wyoming and so um as you can imagine those are not exactly politically correct industries right and the weaponization of the financial sector pulling out of these non politically correct industries are\nIs a problem for more than just the crypto industry right on the n._r._a. has been targeted they're not\nUm they can't get anything that's related to New York\nA and actually I think I saw they just sued New York over this and then a bank of America Citigroup and and I just saw fifth third are no longer banking anybody in the\nFirearms industry doing the um and and you know so ... marijuana is an interesting one because that's not legal at the federal level right and so I don't know is is that if what we're doing in Wyoming is going to solve that problem right if\nIt will not only going out on her level you told me it wasn't even decriminalized in Wyoming is not to go to medical is what you said we're not even medical\nYeah so I I I I expect that that we're going to have interests but the the industries that I think are going to be the most interested in this our course crypto and also the firearms industry\nAnd we look at this stuff and say okay well live crypto has a bank or they have a reliable bank relationships that they can go to\n'em then that opens up honestly the use of crypto in other industries that are impacted by bad ... so that you know again your guns year marijuana has the sex industry is is another one that's really a a job that they wouldn't like that in Wyoming either I mean what is your there's probably not a big sex industry a\nLarge family underground and downloading\nWyoming is is uh is pretty much a one party state I'm right within the party there is a big divide between the traditional conservatives and the more ... more literate Harriet at exactly and so you know again this is not\nThis isn't going to be limited to to one particular industry industries are going to have to get together and form a mutual it's a five million dollar minimum capital requirements but it's not a small\nUndertaking and and yet for some industries that have trouble keeping access\nThese are legal industries that kind of marijuana ones definitely a question because at the federal level it's not legal but right but everything else you talked about crypto guns porn right entered ... whatever it is um those are legal right it's just that the banking sector because they get they get\nWhen they when they bank these industries either they get pressure from their own shareholders or more specifically they get pressure from the compliance people at the regulatory industries because they're going to get more compliance audits and they know that it's going to cost them more money and time and hassle\nSo they just decide not to bank these industries well if we can get a state chartered bank who's\nWho who is going to comply with all those rules so they don't lose their fed master account that's the critical piece they still have to comply with rules right because they are going to have to keep that fed master account\nBut their job is going to be to support the industry so if you are a fraud stir and you can't pass and do your customer requirement you're still not going to be able to get ...\nService city to five million dollars worth of assets or something University in order to bank you know it's a five thousand dollar minimum deposit oh about a bank itself has to have five million dollars a capital\nSo ... from although I must understood I could really forbid you don't know it's not like a mom and pop could come in here and like a mom and pop business we ... we were talking about a hundred thousand dollar\nMinimum deposit proposal realizing that most startups can't do that right\nSo so were dropped it to five thousand to try to it it it does have to be a bona fide business that's what the language and the proposed bill and I'm so not only tell but\nYeah so you you register with the state you've got your domain very private L.

USA Today yeah okay congressman\nWell the best response to Donald Trump's op ed is Donald Trump's own words I mean someone should simply print from his book the America we deserve which he published in two thousand his defense of a single payer system\nHis admission back then that candidate had a superior healthcare system his argument in that book that while he's usually a free market person he believes that single payer healthcare is cheaper and has better benefits so what USA Today really ought to do and these papers ought to do\nIs take that excerpt from his book and print it and print that side by side with the op ed of course Bernie Sanders has done a full response but Trump is basically contradicting something he believed Fifteen Years ago\nThat's amazing cars I had no idea I'd written a book that said that\nHe hated it in America we deserve and he actually says I think Kennedy has a better healthcare system than we do ah I usually a free market person but when it comes to health care I think a single payer system is better and I really think the Democrats need to be putting this out more that ah this this was Donald Trump's own view back in two thousand\nUh is incredible Joe in Cupertino, California you're on the earth scars from kind of\nTheir morning Tom good morning congressman I'm more interested in trying to follow up are made contact with your office

disappointment to the Supreme Court which what sitting out in front of us I Believe\nI'm Dr Ford you're not like you know as a ... graduate what do you think about the fact that they weren't seeing class to you know not being Christopher Wray\nIn a cabin on how he can not refuse himself in if the parents what appears to be a conflict of interest and I I just wanted to actually you can take or who you can persuade ... do you do run this to ground because I think the Supreme Court deserves\nTo be fully staffed with competent people not just whoever's picked and I'll Wait for your answer after\nAmen congressman did you graduate from the la illogical\nYeah I Try I Try not to mention that I Am [laughter] [laughter] somebody at a it's a\n... and he would have went to Georgetown Prep or or or Yale ... is a highly get the\nClock rang in their hands right now [laughter]\nBut uh I I appreciate the caller's comments and let me make two concrete uh points first Jerry ... who hopefully we'll be chairing the Judiciary Committee has said that we are going to continue to investigate the matter\nOr and or the house Judiciary Committee will have tremendous\nA power over this Nancy Pelosi has said that the FBI report a ought to be declassified and a ought to be made public that we are going to subpoena a that we're going to subpoena or the FBI we're going to try to do our own investigation or to get to the bottom of this\nThe second thing in terms of the court expansion I was just talking to Bruce Ackerman the other day who teaches at Yale and he pointed out that one of the things we ought to do as a modernized the Supreme Court just from a perspective of\nA what we need we need for the twenty first century the Supreme Court currently only hearing eighty cases that's down from a hundred and eighty four cases during the Reagan Administration the reason that they're not able to hear these cases as they have so many cert petition and nine justices simply isn't sufficient\nThe court started with six justices and Lincoln and Jefferson\nAdded justices so we want to look in a reform that would be a for expanding the court maybe you can have a super majority required for confirmation or to modernize the court in the twenty first century and then I think we'll avoid a constitutional crisis\nBut if we don't modernized the court and you have majority in policies struck down by counter matured tearing cork that's going to be far worse\nYou know and these are things that can be a pastor Congress of the simple majority vote\nOr they they are but you know one other thing that at the end is Bruce afterwards idea but he and he spent his whole life studying the constitution you could actually term limited justices or and then have them sort of on a court of appeals because the constitution says they\nNeed to be in the judiciary for life not that they need to be on the Supreme Court for life so you could see a system of ten twelve years on the Supreme Court and then you go down to the court of appeals\nOh that's interesting because at the founding of the republic they all rode the circuit in fact they did that until Eighteen Ninety One\nUm that's why they kept expanding the number of justices because the number of circuits went all the way up to ... which is why there were ten\nTen a justice is during the Lincoln administration and then of course they cut it down to six when Andrew Johnson came in because the radical Republicans were seriously PO the jobs and it was a democratic cetera et cetera but all that drama but wow I I yeah that's a brilliant idea\nAt Bush's idea and I you know his point is that if one of the things he said ... ... s stop people from gaming the system right now for people in their forties and fifties you\nReally want someone at the end of their career and if you have someone say that you can surf twelve years Fifteen Years Eighteen years you probably have someone to be appointed in their sixties and then they go and serve or on the circuit court and say you get people also a warrant trying to game the system and have someone be there for forty fifty years\nYeah yeah and ... and you do on

Texas and they give you a provisional ballots and they get ... because if somebody's in the car and they cannot get out to the polls to vote\nRight few to zero five Suzie please check I mean there may ... heads as possible attacks us all the Texas is the only state and the union that does that\nUm but to the best of my knowledge there is no state we're filling out a provisional ballot is the same thing as registering to vote or making sure that you're registered\nAnd are and I believe that even in Texas the provisional ballots are not crowded Suzie I just you know if if I'm wrong I Will correct myself by the end of the show but I'm virtually ... percent certain that I'm writing\nYears I've done this for Twenty years calm but I'm telling people to vote provisional ballot are all in Texas okay where at the ... the state okay a provisional ballot\nYeah and the placebo about any of congressman your thoughts on this what do you know about this\n... well I think through these uh animating principle that everyone needs to vote early is right but I wouldn't encourage people to be voting provisional I think they need to be registered and voting is time you're right that provisional ballots are counted until after the election day many times candidates have already conceded or the media is already called the election\nI Do think we need lawyers and advocacy to try to make sure those provisional ballots are counted ah but um my understanding is that it's very hard to get those provisional ballots counted and often they don't get counted so uh that's something that we need to uh to fight for it but to the point that we need people going in voting early and we need people are\nAware that ah the the tactics that folks are going to go to disenfranchise them I think the important take away\nYou know Linda in Deerfield Beach Florida you're on the earth cars from Kara\nHi I'm thank you our congressmen and Tom [laughter] for taking my call I wanted to hit you were the real quick fun fact\nUh the federal judge rules against extending voter registration down here in Florida judge Robert ... no you're not going to it hit where it the hurricane hit the pan handle her I said no I wasn't that nice\nHotel in ... city isn't it we can't let that happen that we can't let people vote there was an interruption hound right\nCollege I'm Gillum Gillum happens to be from Tallahassee so I mean these folks know exactly what they're doing and who they're trying to disenfranchise\nAbsolutely the young voters but um my other question was and I don't know if you know anything about this because a congressman ... can\nI said that they're putting a committee or together for the Teamsters pension I'm One of those many four hundred thousand not pension ears and uh they're talking about now cutting Medicare they're now talking about Social Security\nI Am almost sixty congressman I Can't make this money that was I was supposed to get fourteen hundred a month and now I'm not even going to get security on top of that how long they want me to work I mean I'm just ... have you heard anything on our pension plan to a teamster pension plan\nI appreciate your raising it I haven't Marco can enrich your Neal who was a going to be hopefully the chair of the ways and Means Committee and Tim Ryan\nA all have been working on this there's a house a bill in ... to protect ensure up a pension plans it's just a wrong for people like you to work their whole lives and then a C. or their pension not to be there for them\nAnd so this was going to be a priority for House Democrats and it's a priority frankly uh that progressive than more moderate Democrat Sherrod say consensus view so I'm quite optimistic once we get back the house that we should be able to get\nVotes in any restriction on the boat is the subject a prosecution Bob law or are\nWe at and get rid of the electoral college so that one man one woman\nOne vote house so you have a real democracy yeah ah and our country right now we don't have that with the joy of college and as much as you talk about voting to we'd get rid of that electoral college well we don't have a truly democracy yeah\nYeah [noise]\nCongressman add if it wasn't for the electoral college we would have a seven to two progressive majority on the court right now because both Bush and Trump lost in the electoral college\n[noise] well I I agree with the caller I agree with you time that the electoral college is\nOutdated anti democratic or I read somewhere that the Senate majority is now going to be representing about Eighteen percent of the population so we do have these structures that are are not reflective of the popular will the only thing we can do\nIn the onslaught of money in these anti democratic uh structures is to mobilize in to\nA get out and vote a into organized in a way they can over time uh the concerted power on the other side it's a\nA fight or for the soul of our democracy\nLincoln in El Cerrito California you're on the earth Congress and kind of\nLincoln hello there are a you're on the air I didn't hear a minute this is Lincoln yeah you're on the air either\nI'd like to talk about shifting the burden of taxation from corporate America through the wealthy\nMoney income profits are not actually well until they are one of the individual I think that the Democrats could steal a serious march on Republicans well actually calling food ... of corporate income tax none of the factors but corporate income tax\nAnd beginning of return progressive tax structure on the wealthy ...\nCongressman I I Would like to to add to what you are inside and that is that uh that that a\nSales pitch for no corporate taxes which has been coming from the libertarians and the Koch brothers for a long long time ignores the fact that corporations use our comments which is what taxes pay for\nCorporations use you know they've got it at an educated workforce by virtue of our public schools um they get to work by a public roads are they use the same infrastructure electricity to telephones everything all all these ... rights away though that we collectively own\nAnd that are in fact you can make the argument but depending on the industry and that might be a way to adjust taxes corporate income taxes or even just taxes in general\nUm they actually probably in many cases particularly the polluting industry has a has a much greater impact on the commons than individual voters to an hour or even individual billionaires do so I I think I can make an argument that we should raise corporate taxes back like you know back to where they were back you know during the Eisenhower administration\nOne third of the total income to the federal government was from corporate taxes now it's down to a lot of ... percent are your thoughts\nI agree with your time and the that the corporate uh there's no argument for the corporate tax cuts that are the Republicans are passed\nA they also are by the way or the top corporations are consuming the most energy ... contributing to climate change most of these corporations the effective tax rate is ten a present in some cases is zero percent where they're paying a no corporate tax because of all of the deductions\nI and I've traveled around the country to places like Huntington West Virginia paints Kentucky Jefferson, Iowa places that voted for Donald Trump I Am never heard a local mayor\nOr or local community say to me you know one or because of these corporate tax cuts suddenly we're getting jobs in our communities what they talked about is the need for high speed Internet a community college education\nApprenticeship programs the money would be far better spent a on those programs rather than these massive handouts to corporations which by the way aren't even located often in the United states in terms of the employee base it's\nA really a tax cut that's helping people uh many outside the United states\n[noise] Alan in Oakland, California we had about two minutes till the end of the hour here Alan you're on them with Congress in ... at least make for\nTaking my call gentleman farm media constantly terrorists the myth that our elections are free and fair most Americans are not well enough for them to to realize the fall sort of that ... the Republicans only win by massive disenfranchisement gerrymandering\nBut most pernicious of a changing the vote counts electronically to totally on verifiable electronics are voting systems with secret tabulations software I suggest every\nDemocratic office holder immediately challenged the fact that we now have fake elections every time they take the floor in Congress or at any press interview or town hall\nThe demand must be first hand counted paper ballots with full transparency now with everyone being allowed to vote the American people need to be educated that we have elections theater not elections and the Democrats have been silent on this for the last Eighteen years since the staff to Florida\n\nBy I agree with the caller that we need paper ballots or paper verification I also think we need a ballots to be posted on a website publicly so that you can trace to make sure that your ballot\nOr was actually received and counted and there is a public accounting of that uh they was necessary to\nMake sure that people believe in our process and so that there is no tampering in any election and the tampering is often most possible in local elections I mean obviously it would take a huge conspiracy given the localized nature of our elections to\nA rig voting machines in every county in every jurisdiction that's not the case when you're talking about local elections where fraud in hacking is even easier\nYeah congressman or a little less than a minute here about a half a minute thoughts on the next week of the upcoming week\nWell we're uh in recess so most of the focus has been of course on the ... elections and making sure that uh we're mobilizing our base in ... giving it everything we have\nTo win back the house I did have an Internet bill of rights that I put forward I mean after the uh news about the Facebook scandal uh in Equifax in now Google's breaches\nOr we need some legislation that's going to inform Americans when they their data has been compromised that's going to require consent for your data is\nTaken up a and I'm hopeful to push that uh when we get back in the lame duck session\nGreat cars and kind of thanks so much for dropping by today thank you for taking

hope\nAnd change lives with a family in your community\nNow that now\nThat habitat doubt on\nPastor released Hi Mike moss\nOr or Bill Gates or you know fill in the black\nWhereas a historically and certainly this was my understanding the American dream back when my dad used to talk about it\nYou were a tool and die shop his whole life but he could you could put his ... you know he raised for kids ... you could put kids through college he I mean it was a small group of six of us in a three bedroom one bedroom house but it was a year on the resume cool laws that was the American dream you took the other two week vacation every year he bought a new car every two years\nUm and and he was a single brought in Britain winter I mean that's the American dream right that you're talking about\nYeah absolutely and and I think that that's it right that that the the sense that the country was there to protect the rights of everyone and to aspire to equality of opportunity but also that you know ... ... says certainly that notion that if you work hard you could provide for your family and all of those ideas that are under threat\nUm but you know they've always been threatened by inequality and when when you know too much out while says in the hands of too few people\nThat opportunity constrict for everybody else but now people too many people in my view would say that the solution is the American dream of individual free market opportunity but that's just you know that's just exacerbating the problem whereas a hundred years ago they were arguing that\nThe American remember reminding us that the American dream was not about wealth the American dream was about democracy equality and justice and that those things would be threatened by two by two I'm much you know individual accumulation of of wealth and power so so that some of the earliest examples I found\nSaid that a multi millionaire would be the death of the American dream because that was the worst possible thing for the country for that much wealth to be in the hands of so few\nWell and then America First the genesis of that phrase\nYeah so America First I'm On like the American dream it hasn't kind of flipped its meaning I'm like that but it it is an older and darker phrase than I think most people realize when Trump resuscitated it and it began to be you\nKnow used again and commented on a lot of people noted rightly that it was associated with Charles Lindbergh and the America First movement of Nineteen forty in Nineteen forty one to keep America out of the second World War\nBut it actually is it is a good twenty to Thirty years older than that and it was incredibly ubiquitous in the political conversation in America from Nineteen Fifteen going forward it was the campaign slogan of Wilson and his Republican opponent in Nineteen sixteen Wilson used it to urge America to stay out of the first World War\nUm but very quickly it got taken up in the name of isolationism protectionism Harding ran on in America first platform in Nineteen twenty to keep America from signing the treaty of Versailles in joining the league of nations\nHe tried to pass a permanent protection is terrorists in the name of America First and throughout the Nineteen twenties again in the name of America First there was sweeping anti immigration laws that were passed that were um ruthlessly ethnic in their\nUh I'm In their thinking and indeed you genesis um and that they were they were that those were the immigration laws that established quotas um of different ethnic communities that was known as the national origins act so only certain certain number of people from a given um ethnic origin we're going to be allowed into the country and not law\nHeld from Nineteen twenty four to Nineteen sixty five that was in the name of America First so it was as it is now a way of talking about isolationism and protectionism but at the same time it became associated with\nThe rising power of the Ku Klux Klan um which of course was I'm very dominant in the Nineteen twenties and they would carry America First banners they they took out advertisement saying that they were the America First party\nAnd they um you know that you tried to copyright the the slogan at one point I mean that was how much they kind of associated themselves with it the thing and I think you know people know that if you you know people on on social media and in journalism have commented on the fact that\nThe KKK is associated with America First I think much less well known is that at the same time in the early Nineteen twenties when Mussolini was taking power in Italy of course that was when the word fascism entered the English language was when Mussolini was using it\nAnd what I found was that in this conversation around the country that was happening in the early Nineteen twenties people were trying to understand what this new organization the KKK was all about\nAnd they were also trying to understand what Mussolini fascism was all about you know maybe separately right but that was another thing to try to explain to your readers and for people to try to understand\nAnd and when people were trying to define these two things they defined them in terms of each other\nSo what they said over and over again was if you want to understand what the KKK stands for it's basically um ... Mussolini is doing but in America or if you want to know it was ... doing it's basically America First but in Italy it's Italy First\nAnd they constantly treated them as synonymous and reciprocal in other words it was very very clear to them that the KKK with a fascist organization and that America First was being used as a fascist slogan from as early as the Nineteen twenties and and it's just kind of everywhere\nIn the political conversation in the twenties and it increasingly became associated with white ethno nationalist\nFascist movements I'm with an American fascism homegrown American fascism and you know I don't know about you but when I was growing up I wasn't learning about American fascist movements I wasn't learning about\nThe history of American Nazi movements I wasn't really learning about the the the true horrors of the Ku Klux Klan\nAnd what they perpetrated you know we learned about burning crosses we I didn't learn in school about spectacle lynching and about the fact that the KKK burned people alive I'm up through at least Nineteen thirty four and and and that was associated with ideas like America First\nWell neither die or we just have a minute and a half before I had a heartbreak here um what do we do with the snow we're talking with sir a Church World I Will because we hold America\nWell I Hope we use it took to fight back I Hope we use it to recognize the danger that I really do think that we're facing I I I think that we use it to fight back against arguments that what we're looking at is in fascism just because it's a twenty Eighteen version of it um and because it's a very American version of it\nUm and I think we use it particularly to to to push back against arguments on by the alt right that you know that there that this isn't fascism that it's not not seeing them um you know I I Am of the school that says if it walks like a duck and you know I'm an ... quacks like a duck than it than it is one and and\nYou know I think we have to recognize the danger that were in in order to uh in order to\nUs here in St Louis and Lee defining the Trump Administration has fascists\n[noise] um I think that they are promoting fascist policies unquestionably um and what not\nYou know where that takes us is is going to be you know question that we don't know the answer to it on the history will show but there are certainly that some of the the policies that they are supporting particularly the the white nationalist policies that they are supporting our fascist\nAnd the authoritarian on policies that they're trying to implement some of those just our fascist policies they are recognized Ripley\nFascist um and the and the cult of personality that he is developing his recognizable fascist\nThink about the amount of time you spend every day in your office chair for most of us it's over two thousand hours a year so if you're spending all that time in the wrong chair\nIs it any wonder you're having back problems trouble concentrating or artist productive is you could be\nThat's why you need to trade up to the next year I'm telling you won't believe the difference until you feel the difference my ex chairs the most stylish or I've ever owned and it gives me ideal posture which means we're energy better concentration and more productivity than I ever thought possible I Love my ex cheering you will to\nHere's a special deal just for listeners the Marvin program ex chair is now on sale for a hundred dollars off the call aid for for for X cheer or go to ... chair Tom dot com T H O M dot com now does have a hundred dollars is the ...\nAnd they'll even throw in a free for the rest go to ... chair Tom dot com or call it for for for X chair and use the coach Tom G.

what's on your mind\nTony in Fort Myers\nYou're on the air\nTony is hey just just for everybody right now we're getting a lot of first time caller is here we have a a seven or nine second I forgot how long it is delay here in Studio it's for an obscenity laced so somebody drops on Saturday and Sean can push a button and boom that nine seconds just vanishes before it even gets to air so there's that\nPlus you know it takes a few seconds for the wonders of electronics to get the signal from here to Denver the satellite up like the satellite to process it\nBack down to your local radio station for your right as Aisha rebroadcast so in that and that is depending on whether you're watching TV or radio or whatever there was a delay of typically between ten or twelve seconds or as much as twenty or thirty seconds\nFrom the time that I say something to the time that you will hear it on the telephone\nOr excuse me on the air but if you're living on the telephone you're hearing in real

it on the radio for another ten seconds but you're alive and if I don't area I'm going to hang up Mike in West Palm Beach Florida a Mike what's on your mind\nHey Tom great show and I'll take that Fort Myers their time I don't mind do ya I'm Down in Florida year ground zero for resistance and had a great speaker talk about fascism and make the comparison throwing that out American history and that's the point that I Need to have everybody believes\nActing as if Trump is something new um we can go back fifty year eighty years when it does not matter um but the point about fascism and I I Love Mitch McConnell in this too because there was no more of a power grab and a fascist move than the judicial move that he made 'em that\nYou need to ask these Trump people cut to the bone to try to save them for this country because if we don't it will be some kind of social civil war and the point I'm trying to make when you ask these people about trees in that Donald Trump committed\nFor that you believe he committed or if you ask about Brett Kavanaugh whether or not he is so good a woman for\nDrank too much you don't as to whether or not these people didn't ask them what is your gut feeling\nIf you found out it's true ... you're going to find out because I've done this with her support is you're going to find out that it's not treason as long as you're leading Democrat\nIt's not a salt as long as we're getting a conservative on the on the Supreme Court and that the argument these ... you need to bake it these people um the locker of reality in fact we know has been going on we know about climate change we know about science we know about history\nThere is no such thing as history science or back or reason with these group Trump will be gone\nAnd when he's gone we don't have the same remnant and as you said the word pernicious is especially good because it quiet it's ... it's the Republican Mormon is the evangelical right\nFor playing the game of let's say that but it's all about the power grab and um that's the only point I wanted to make\nYeah well you made it very well thank you very much amen I all I can do a second and Jill in great falls Montana hey Joel what's a\nPython um\nI Want to point out that the woman that called in a world Congress on a encouraging people to vote provisional ballots might be a troll ... as Republican are ...\nAre doing this

Saudi Arabia myself and of course you know I Lived in Iran also a Nineteen eighty three and Saudi Arabia and very familiar with the kingdom saw out operated when I was in Congress and now we go to today\nWhich is the first time that I can recall and modern time that Saudi Arabia is actually a sweating a bit and um you know I wanted to mention something that I don't know how much has been carry but there's a very fascinating ... a series of things that happened with Joe ... show\nYou know he actually a man who was killed yes the man who is co I'm sure he's actually not left his home in Saudi Arabia years ago he left at approximately a about a year and a half ago and he put himself in self exile Washington DC\nAnd he thought he would be arrested if he returned the United states\nNow Saudi targeted other people just hasn't made a lot of news riots but do we got a thousand lashes for insulting Islam\nAnd could show himself was not exactly the uh I Want a revolution guy I wanted to mention that he's not a guy that said we should overturn the royal family and in fact he he was quoted Thomas saying that that type of regime change would be quote ridiculous right\nI Want to point out when his troubles started because it's just quite fascinating\nMister show gauge of mulch show it was was killed or his troubles began when he gave a speech to an American think tank after President Trump's victory he argued the Saudi Arabia should be quote rightfully nervous about a Trump presidency\nAt a time when the kingdom was cozying up to then of course President Trump we know the whole history of that now many presidents have goes up to Saudi Arabia I'm not saying that but I didn't want to point out his troubles seriously began with the kingdom not ever calling for revolution\nBut his troubles began when he tried to say that you know the two countries should watch to ties with the Trump White house so I make it\nInteresting I Wonder if that's why I wrote is what provoked to Mohammed bin Salman to reach out to Trump and then you know do do that whole song and dance to to impress tromp and suck up to I mean yes\nAnd also you know the fact that um the president's comments I'm sure you whatever that today on your show\nI haven't yet no but I have to what basically what Trump said\nIs that a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of arms sales is more important than a human rights record\nAnd by the way it's not really a hundred and ten billion dollars with the arms sales it was twelve billion\nThat a Trump a deal with Trump or soak the things he anxious but actually there still is no deal I was just a a memorandum of understanding so there are no arms sales or at least from the Trump Administration a lot of business you know goes back to deals that ... caught\nSo Trump is lying through his teeth as he always does a about this but apparently you know the Saudis have had tens of millions maybe hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump\nIn in laundering money or buying apartments and things you know from his companies and they are currently a saying in the Trump Hotels and ... you know to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars a day in some cases are all over the country\nOr you're correct to show here's what he said twice when he had a chance to at least backtrack a little bit on what she did a he has eluded to the fact that show is not a U.S citizen here's here's the quote it's in Turkey and it's not and it's\nNot it's not a citizen as I understand it right but the thing like that shouldn't happen president said again comma this took place in Turkey and to the best of our knowledge ... is not a United States citizen is that right question mark [noise] so\n... is a resident he lives in Virginia and he works for the Washington Post right now people are starting to put out a thing they're tall which is pretty disgusting that all the media never went after Saudi Arabia only what when one of their own is gone after they've always let them slight on human rights which is not truth media is\nOr they expose it but the United states government\nLets Saudi Arabia slights I just wanted to mention a little bit of background there's also a very interesting fact it\nBecause uh the precedent show law Jared Kushner is the Mid East guy you know and obviously very close to the Saudis as he was at one point in time with a guitar east do alone you know his father attempted to get\nA lot of wrath is going to go back to cushion or two on this because there are businesses that are ... are pulling out\nOf it is a conference that Saudi Arabia is going to have one of the other including news media including CNN and others are pulling out of this\nBig economic a conference where it was the last ... British fascinating on their withdraw because Saudi Arabia funds a ton of money into their systems\nYeah there were one of the early venture capitalists investors before they were went public right\nRight and I think this is going to heat up and I think it will become a bit it could become besides Medicare for\nYou know health care Cavanaugh I think this could become a factor in the midterms to see where you know some of the people especially of course Republicans trying to hang on come down on this because the president is setting the tone\nThat not a citizen you know it's not\nYou know it it kind of ... do you stand for American values or do you stand for making a buck when those two things come into conflict\nRight to boil money's got to see what happens to\nBomb a author aside swipes talked made it his second bomb\nAlways great talking when he will be back\nWith me or it was a third of our of our program here on this or anything goes friday a lot to cover a lot of news will be like you have your phone calls pretty much get back to stick around the news is coming up next to send us twenty seconds has the [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] you're listening to Tom Hardy [noise]\nSummer is the highest and I've got the perfect formula to help and wind camera and use ultra premium one can't purchases direct from boutique wineries no middleman and bottles and keeping his sources secret so he can pass the savings directly to you often forty eight percent less than you pay for the same wine at retail\nShipped to write to your door if I Want to Kansas new six bottles sampler packed\nThe luxury mix sampler regularly Ninety five dollars is now anyone or the elegant red sampler regularly a hundred and one dollars is now just eighty five bucks Louis and I tried lot five sixty seven an apple cabernet fantastic definitely a deep full body rich red wine just spectacular for a limited time\nIn your Fifteen Percent off one of the new radio mixed sampler packs plus free shipping go to C.

was this a young venture capitalists who bought a pharmaceutical company that that made an obscure a drug that was absolutely essential\nTo our you know a couple of tens of thousands of people in the United states whoever rare genetic in genetic condition as I recall correctly if I'm wrong Albert and then he ... the price of that drug rep seven hundred percent just to make money for himself and then he bragged about it um he's in jail right now for fraud because he also runs a venture capital firm that was apparently\nA you know gauging fraudulent behavior I Would add another name to that and I believe her name is Heather brash which was Joe mansions daughter who\nIs the CEO of the company that sells ... and she jak the price on those things off another vitally important thing for people who have allergies [noise] making sense Albert [noise]\nThat is correct um and also a lot of that I thought that we can't be scared to that that's the only way you're going to be able to control costs but also with Medicare it would be criminal and I would say it would be criminal if you don't\nWorry about the supply of doctors and people going into the health care profession understand that there should be protected and recent that not their education because the only way you're going to truly long term of on that more people giving chair\nI agree I agree we should also um by law stopped the AMA from limiting the number of people living graduated from medical schools in the United states\nAh this this is a lockdown monopoly in the air may has had you know operating as a union basically are only as kind of the worst aspect of unionism limiting the supply of labor to drive up the price of labor is not doing a a any kind of favor to the American people Albert thank you spot on\nLaura in Chicago I Lara what's up\nYeah Hi I'm so ... with clean count Cook County I'm In the actual election integrity activists I'm not um what's your name turnout on track to eventually say not to draw out of trouble so I wanted to talk to\nYou about what people can do if they find that they had been purged from the voting rolls are there are things that they can do\nSo if you discovered advanced on November ... you\nHad been purged we're asking everybody to check your voting rights a registration online ... if you discovered advance then it's really beneficial to take ... voter registration cars mailers from the election division copies of emails I'm Down to the election division with at least two pieces of ID\nOkay most states require two pieces\nRight you need to get a residency and your and your citizenship\nThat's exactly right that's exactly right and you go down to the election division if other people in your neighborhood had been encouraged to spell than go down in the group that does help do show up with several people\nMy age and he will um and if she can record what the official said back to you in some manner but you have to be discreet okay and so you go down there and you have to be reinstated\nAnd don't um you know the they made a put some hurdles over you know whatever asked every time they put up a hurdle say okay if I Do this and then when will I be reinstated\nPushed them for an actual date that he will be back on the rules so that you can check okay I have heard of many people that have gotten back on the rules if they push push you know it's the squeaky wheel decay\nRoyal otherwise us after the election that they'll take care of it is the problem\nI yeah well here's the deal that's exactly right so if they you also at the same time\nI think that everybody if you're supporting the candidate or candidates in your area you should notify them that you've been encouraged and that you're in the process what the election officials have\nTold you so that they can start gathering names there have been challenges to elections based on voter purges show that's very important for candidates to know you do have the right to go on a lecture day or I and in early voting on the states that have early voting and vote on a provisional ballot\nThat you cannot stop at just voting at the ballot okay here are things that we recommend first of all you have to complete that ballot on the outside envelope exactly how you are you think you're registered to vote so carry your voter registration card with you because\nSome people may say say I am too need junior\nAnd forget they registered junior right\nRight or in Georgia if if I said Thomas see period Hartman in one thing and I just simply so Thomas see her without the period after my middle name from a middle middle initial in another place right now Bryan cap would refuse to register made a vote\nThat's exactly right that's it so on your voter registration card it will say how you registered to vote so please sign the ... like that okay and I'm In complete it completely a lot of traditional speech actually did a study in Chicago\nUm after the election on provisional ballots and only thirty percent of them were counted and uh but some people didn't fill out the antelope they just didn't they didn't even\nTouch guarantees the provisional ballot gets thrown away\nRight exactly so eight and you fill that out\nYou take a picture if you can in the privacy of your uh voted voting both of your voted ballot an ear that completed ...\nTurn off the flash okay 'cause some in some states you it is illegal to take a picture of you about okay so turn off the bat and it's definitely illegal to take pictures of other people voting in a polling place so they may have a real connection so\nYear old John ... introduced the nature of six Seventy six at least a decade ago and maybe longer I mean it was probably twelve Thirteen Years ago he was on this show on

President Obama came out and started his leadership of the Democratic party and said he'd state Medicare for all he sees college education tuition free community college education\nShe didn't like that it is no longer a thing going on it is the leader of the Democratic party saying these are rich\nAnd we also need to point out to people we are literally the only developed country in the
