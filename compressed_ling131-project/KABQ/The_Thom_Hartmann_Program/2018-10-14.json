minutes\n[laughter] that\nThat's actually my question for you perfect fact by Robert and I are obviously married we do the show we travel together all the time we've been doing this for not to show

forgetting them but let's begin with you sharing exactly what southern living hotel collection is and does the collection cover the entire south eastern portion of the country\nIt does we worked very hard to bring together a hand picked group around twenty two independently owned boutique hotel um that includes the bed and breakfast for small ends and some larger property but that is um that's how we got to discover these folks through our southern living\nStories that we ever as we traveled a full region of the south and we invited these folks to become members of ours and living hotel collection just a few years ago so it's relatively new for us but growing rapidly\nGood to hear so from what I understand you do have sort of a wide mix of properties you've got some new properties as well as uh\nSome of the older more iconic hotels that I Would think are deeply rooted in some good old fashioned southern traditions I'm curious for our listeners who have not traveled er stayed in the southern region of our country can you just described some of that old world sort of southern hospitality that you look for in these properties\nSure I'm In southern living our bags are always that we love to travel but we like to experience very different very\nRegionally specific\nParts of the south and hospitality is always number one when we're thinking about what property with belong in this collection so for instance you could go to greater Ashville area in the mountains of North Carolina maybe for some beautiful fall color like I think like eighty percent of southern living people um consumers book a trip just to go to the fall color\nAnd she's got seven rooms all decorated\nIt looks like the pages that suddenly the magazine and the food that she served\nIs based on the other living recipes and her hospitality Selena the owner and operator and it's like you're saying with a friend and that's\nThe perfect example of a small mountain that at breakfast and then on on the flip side you could go to wall in Tennessee Knoxville and blackberry farm which is the complete opposite end of the spectrum all little cottages there's no you know vertical inner hotel like you would traditionally think of\nTheir all beautifully decorated little cottages and the restaurants and it's an incredible barn that it sounds rustic but it's absolutely seven star LA\nAll these properties that I'm looking at here I mean there are some cross section so who is the worst thing the hotels for inclusion in the southern women collection and you know what are some of those features that you look for require besides the obvious as married just mentioned southern hospitality aspect\nMhm or food and beverage is a big driver it has a lot of the car and they'll drive\nAnywhere to date them incredible regional their food and beverage is a very big part of our criteria um the decor and the\nArchitectural integrity and does it speak to the region though Gingrich Seventy Seventy and the ... South Carolina looks over the river and Craig is an old stately homes beautifully done\nLooking at right now it's going in Utah ...\nIncredible Frank and Frank and Amy or the owners and they're just great people but the hotel itself is just a fee for the eyes it's architecturally beautiful right down the river I Love each of these speak to that\nI Love the these are hand packed that's a great way to describe it so Chris and we have about a minute left a United in hospitality for a long time you work in a hotel branding I'm sure we could ask you a lot of questions but I'm curious and these are sort of more luxury and certainly boutique type hotels\nWhat's the single biggest factor if you had to choose one that you think today's luxury brand new hotels really need to get right for the traveler\nYou know it's all about the people you have to feel like you want to go back there again and again and what makes it memorable is that experience and these folks that own these properties they get into the details and making\nThat trip special for you you might be there on a whim for a weekend or an anniversary but it's going to be a place you want to go back to that what is so hard to put on paper but that's what makes these places special every single one of them\nYou know I think anybody who's had a memorable experience yeah they look around and they will agree with that when they're hearing that will Christian list a week ago on and on a number of these properties the ruler girl written orange Virginia a lot of folks are going to give it a website for its southern living hotel collection dot com southern living hotel collection dot com go check them out\nChristian we really appreciate your time today enjoy your travels okay\nThank you so much having a great weekend Kristin thanks\nYou two are married there goes costume and other property I'm looking at right here the Chesapeake Bay beach club I see they're all on the other one that's on my short list of so many places yeah they're really ... really interesting obsolete so we'll definitely follow the bumps more\nBooks written that were going to pose briefly for some sponsor messages is really rejoined the show for second before and then marry him back to the ten minutes to talk\nTo them so we hope to go with\nWill travel returns of pleased\n\nTo join robber Marion Rudy call eight hundred three eight seven eight to five or above us on Facebook and Twitter\nSimply safe is home or a small business securities it finally gets it right they started ten years ago with a mission to fix the industry they cut out contracts middlemen and pushy sales guys\nThey made their system easy to set up with no hard wiring or tools and you get professionally monitored twenty four seven protection for just Fifteen dollars a month simply say protect more than two million people so\nBeach with a social worker who is in her let's say early early sixties and she is sort of thinking I don't know how I'm going to pay for my retirement and so they can learn from each other and that's what's beautiful as having a wide diversity of people\nDo provide a combination or in yeah\nI Would take a tire so we did that right if you go to Martin her cat dot org you'll see get combinations just yes three minute video that shows people things and yeah it's like staying in a boutique hotel on the beach three acre campus\nRight on the beach what hour north of Kabul that Lucas is very very safe rural part of a\nBobcat and they'll get it from me and the last week the costs where we get\nIt is five thousand for a week um which you all close to ... which also looks you know actually massage and but it's a ... scholarships allow you to get that down to zero a hundred percent scholarship or fifty percent scholarship twenty five hundred dollars for the week\n... he's the founder of the first midlife wisdom school in ...

about climate change and the impact our coastal waters are seeing now\nI'm with a fever eyes um warm waters of water's coming in from our stormwater drains from the bay\nUm and then the the impact of

more affluent community um and the community I live in the yard is the oldest African American community\nIn Pensacola and we're constantly the sights of flooding um accent you a couple of pictures of the um\nThe water coming in our stormwater drains now that's without any rain the road in front of my house flooded just from the\n... what's coming up in the bay into our stormwater drains and so when it does rain and those to mix a\nThe sewer um sanitation can't hold the a capacity so we're surrounded by about I Would say twelve to fourteen sewer heads and they just\nBlow and go\nWhat are the hardest hit areas\nIs allowed to get used to live a bomb\nOn a you know citizens and and and to be out here when this guy is he's a road and you know he he's a liar he's a sea of criminal who is a is a scam artist and he and he's a danger to society\nAnd and the fact is is so close and and more than likely lose the money that was used to build this company with money that was paid to him by our government I mean this is ridiculous because of because he's an asset\nTo our government and he's bringing them manufactured cases of terrorism or this is why he's allowed to continue to stay in this country and to flourish and run these illegal businesses and which have constantly cutting corners and and and but if it's just sad twenty people that I as a result of this guy's negatives in\nMe this is\nTalk about how you met her saying\nYou know I I met him um to the other and former that was involved in in in the case um luxury of\nBeing told me one day so a memoir brothers coming in from out of town and and I really want you to meet him he's a real source for a you know in our office you guys will get along deal with related\nAnd so that's how nearly a new show um introduction was made I only met this guy a once reporters lawsuit differences and the you know I didn't want\nTo meet him from the very beginning with already knew that I knew he was going to form and I knew that\nHe was trying to attract me and what he was very aggressive in trying to facility and and and the ... the top of me and it's the friend man to hear this news you know it really is [noise]\nCan you talk about where you're speaking to us from and how his actions lead to you or in person meant\nYeah sure I'm I'm I'm speaking from Vicksburg\nI'm I'm going to half way how I'm On right now I'm just focus on trying to uh you know my transition back into society to reunite with my family and and this guy's actions have less and less than mine president because of his\nAttempts to attract me and then after I publicly exposed them than the government came in with a two year old picture of me and some friends having fun at a gun range and use that to invite me and and give me a rack of years in federal prison and yet this guy's responsible for\nA directly or indirectly for the for the homeless out of a forty people and he's not going to do all day in jail\nHow did you figure out he was an FBI informant\n[noise] there are new because that I knew this was going to be on a form that though the fact that this guy was in the journal produce and we'd go to another guy ah I just I knew immediately\nWell really high I don't\nYou to get in trouble and you're in a halfway house and I know you have to get off the air and half past the hour so I Want to thank you very much for joining us ... Kelly joining us talking about how he was in ... had Hussein who is the man\nWho owns the prestige limousine service the limousine that was a legally on the road a number of his cars um had a failed inspection and yet this limousine carried\nA twenty people the driver and Seventeen friends between the ages I think twenty four and thirty four who are all going to a thirtieth birthday party\nTwo of the couples in the car had just gotten married\nI'm the driver of course killed two bystanders we're joined now by two other gas who can talk about the man who owns the service not exactly clear where he is right now his son has been arrested on manslaughter charges as a result of the accident\nHere in New York San ... tests and attorney who represented one of the new bore Newberg for who are convicted after she had a Shane led the rope an organized this game he'll tell us about that\nAnd in Los Angeles lyric ... co director of the film terror\nThat's key in parentheses and the word era camera a documentary that follows undercover FBI informant say ... ... ah who I'm a college I was just talking about another FBI informant um\nWe met you at the Sundance Film festival this astounding film a few years ago if he can finish um how leaf a story for us how he figured out who shot had was significant I mean he not only was involved in the jailing of men in Pittsburgh\nBut also as we'll talk about with sand braver men the men in New York\nWho were then and trapped and are serving decades in prison at this point lyric\nYes so ... Hussein I'm In Pittsburgh and he was going by the name Mohammed\nUm and he had been assigned there presumably to investigate ... um but because of the new bird for case because that was such a publicly critique the example of entrapment\nUm during that trial shy had Hussein was photographed and was exposed um has photographed with placed on actually it was the front cover up in New York Times\nAnd so because of all the publicly available information um important data than braver men and other defense attorneys on the new bird for team um there was basically this publicly available information about ... Hussein\nIncluding recordings that he made of the new broke for that were entered I'm as government evidence during their trial in two thousand nine to all of this was sort of public\nAnd so when Khalifa had his suspicions about Hussein um side is saying in Pittsburgh under the name of hominid gave ... business card I'm with a number\nAnd ... did his suspicions hit Google that phone number and it reference a number in one of the Newberg for trial transcripts that was publicly available so Khalifa through the Google Search was able to actually confirm on paper that I had Hussein was an informant\nI mean that is simply amazing this guy Gibson is number he's very nervous about him any checks it out on Google and he sees its a number of the FBI informant and the Newberg for case which brings us to Sam brave from in the morning and Hi it's great to have you with us on TALK about this case and Newburgh\nAnd yes it was front page news but I think for many people in this country it's long been forgotten about as they right away in jail\nOh absolutely true so the trial is essentially ... food webs his nickname in our case of course I don't think anybody could honestly say they know what his real name was because he ... he did so much immigration fraud on his original us on occasion so I don't think anybody believes that he could be for it I mean nobody knows Israel knew\nBeyond that he comes to Newberg these terrorists to go into new word he goes into mosques and specifically test\nNewberger very depressed I\n... very depressed so he was in ... before originally when you went into a mosque and people said get out of her\nGet out of here he went to the ... going to your mom there said get out of here why why would they telling him to leave they were telling them to leave because he was in there to say let's have a hard let's have a holy war and the people in the mosque was saying well this is something to do with us we're here to pray we're here for a peaceful mission\nAnd so he kept getting thrown out of places and he found a disaffected person in a parking lot\nAnd that's how the newer cars name whose name was James comedy so Jim's comedy was allowed ... for his own absolute admission he shot off his mouth endlessly and then like ... he wonder you said you know I don't have any interest in this ... and he did for a month and a half\nHid the FBI knew exactly was was they were trailing memory loss but every time the mugs she would knock on his door he was hiding behind the door where he calling me on\nJohn I'm In Philly wherever I Am but the FBI was paying ... to do something he had a job like a salesman so as a salesman you only get paid if he makes the sale\nAnd he has to tell the person who wants to sell me tell you anything you want to hear so in our trial ... Hussein said things like I'll give you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a barber shop free cars free travel my client or look at it pay and was totally impoverished and my client was bought for food\nSo every meeting my client is eating that's how you got my client to join us saying there's a\nFew feet somebody rice they're starving though believe everything you asked them to believe because they're starting to them as was my client ... so that that was the premise that got everybody into this once they were there shall we say in just kept doing things his everyday task was to make the story better\nAnd the FBI was continually try to real him in at the same time so there is a no no don't offer those things you can offer five thousand dollars so he went off the reservation said no to fifty is good and then he did these things are going to lie to his handlers about it and they didn't know about it until they actually heard the tapes where he said two fifty us I often do you two fifty you didn't want it out of the car\nSo it was endless and he said yeah I'm gonna fly on a plane my client said I Can't go anywhere to have a passport\nYou're talking about the the the most on educated the most on salvageable young men\nIsn't this is harder to this is ... very significant 'cause um I had no is enough that\nHe cannot just be offering financial inducement ... as he talks about the cause they have to be there for the cause right jihad not for the money because I don't get the FBI in trouble\nSo I Want to go to the HBO documentary the New Bern staying which features secret recordings the FBI native conversations between\nNine one one after nine eleven\nHis colleagues to the FBI were saying you know the rules no longer apply and he was walking around saying what are you talking about\nThe rules or will he says the rules you mean the constitution I actually will start with Michael ... from ... to Dr\nSam braver men lawyer for one of the Newberg for lyrics ... co director of the award winning documentary terror which is now on Netflix and we want to thank ... who joined us from the halfway house in Pittsburgh\nWe thank you so much a ... a ... a foreign lightning act as we continue to try to find out what had taken place on the roads of upstate New York and where I\nAt this point a showerhead um\nHussein is his son is in jail [laughter] this is democracy now when we come back yeah yeah how fascism works a new book by Yale professor Helen ... stay with us [noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild performed by ... democracy now I mean he could and then within their means shape\nWe end today show with a remarkable new book titled how fascism walk the politics of us and them which focuses in particular on current trends under the Trump Administration arguing that the president is not as much of an anomaly in American history as we often think\nThe book's author Yale professor Jason Stanley whose parents were both Holocaust survivors who came to the U.S as refugees\nShows instead that quote in its own history the United states can find a legacy of the best of liberal democracy as well as the roots of fashion the aunt indeed Hitler was inspired by the confederacy and Jim Crow laws to family right\nHe also wants of the dangers of normalizing fascist politics saying quote what normalization does its transform the morally extraordinary\nInto the ordinary it makes us able to tolerate what was once intolerable by making it seem as if this is the way things have always been\nWe're joined right now by Jason Stanley philosophy professor at Yale University his new book is just out its title how fascism\nWorks the politics of us and them his previous books how propaganda works welcome to democracy now ... to have you with us why now why are you releasing this book how fascism works now well\nWe have a global ultra nationalist far right movements crossing many countries both in our Owen Brazil we've just seen and they feed off each other so I think right now it's a very important to make people aware\nOf the features of cautious ... historical features and to alert people to the fact that the United states has always been vulnerable to this kind of politics\nWill explain what fascism defined what it means to you\nSo fascism is an ideology based on power liberal democracy is based on liberty and equality liberty and equality require troops because any truth to speak truth to power\nAnd a free up if if your rely too you're not ... no one thinks the people of North Korea are free they've been lied to\nSo if you're going to attack liberal democracy you replace it with power to slash truth so fascism is an ideology based on power and loyalty it ah it it creates it's based on hyper nationalism so one group loyal\nTwo to one group and one person the leader represents that group it's hyper masculine and hyper patriarchal\nYou talked about the ten pillars of fascism what are they\nThe pen colors or fascism our number one a mythic past the great mythic past which the leader harkens back number two propaganda to others certain kinds of a fashion a fascist propaganda aware everything has inverted the news as the fake news ah anti corruption is corruption ah\nSo ah so three or anti intellectualism a as Steve Bannon said\nIt's a emotion rage gets people to the polls we got elected I lock her up and build a wall a Hitler and mine ... says you want your propaganda to appeal to the most to the least educated people number four unreality you have to smash truth so a reason gets replaced by conspiracy theories\nI first started writing got out of my academic shall and twenty eleven when I wrote a piece about birth or it's\nBecause I saw a conspiracy theories comic not so deeply concerning talked a sigh\nUnreality so you you you smash every smash truth so all that remains as loyalty a hierarchy a in fascist politics the dominant group ah\nIs ah is is better than everyone else they were they were like the loyalty to the great people in the past or who deserve respect just for being that the victim hug\nAnd fascism the dominant group or the greatest victims the men are the greatest victims of encroaching feminism\nOr whites are the greatest victims of blocks Germans or the greatest victims of Jews law and order what are the victims up their victims of the out group who are criminals what uh what kind of criminals are there the rapists sexual anxiety a pillar nine ah\nIs ah Saddam and Gomorrah the real value is come from the heartland of the people in the city or decadent and pillar tan is all by multiply\nI'll work shall make you free the out group as lazy they're not just criminals they're lazy and ... and social Darwinism it's all about winning so\nWell I Want to turn to one of the features of fascism and he liked Denis ... that are on reality a trunk or speaking earlier that yeah and he took aim at the media Cindy T. has multiple times using a phrase that prompted comparisons with George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen eighty four\nRemember [noise] what you're seeing and what you are reading is\nWhat's happening and we have to make our country great again remember\nMake America great again\nAnd then and join a half years this call\nAmerica great so that's chump thinking or near the here and just to say that George Orwell's line read\nThe pine she told you to check the evidence of your eyes and and it was that final most essential command so can you talk about this particular feature of a fascism as you see it in the U.S ...\nYeah you have Trump is very clear that\nAh that loyalty to him\nIs the only guy reality is of course the greatest threat to fascism because fascism is based on power and reality as a way of responding to power he said just false so you have to make everyone destabilize knocked back into the truth and you have to represent yourself\nAs reality and you have to show them you're stronger than reality 'cause fascism as much as ... and power you\nAre and the son of Holocaust survivors how does that way in to you or scholarly work and what you're seeing now and whether you believe or you can talk about the United states and this way right now\nWell uh I remember when my when I talk to my father about being the son of a Holocaust survivor and he read me James Baldwin's Nineteen sixty eight peace uh uh the negro negroes or anti Semitic because they're anti white\nAnd he said and one of the lines in it he uh he was a was you think you're more connected to us because of our shared history of oppression were more angry at you because of our shared history of depression because we know you're glad not to be us so because of my background as my mother worked in Manhattan a criminal court for thirty three years\nI knew that the United states was replicating feature\n[noise] missing reporter hurricane aftermath I'm In Saudi Arabia is\nPushing back against any possible sanctions over the presumed murder of a missing journalist correspondent are with daemon reports the Turkish government is asking the Saudis to cooperate\nBehind the scenes at this stage at least the the Turks are growing incredibly impatient they don't necessarily want to deal with this mass and they do feel quite hamstrung at this stage because there's only certain aspects of the investigation the intelligence that they have access to\nI called them complained about it because I think any opinion from the opposite for the president is different than any other opinion I had not scenery ... I'm hoping there is one that the Democrats and progressives are going to put out and I'd like to get a copy and put it in our local paper at least is there any information about that\nAnd I'm guessing by the way in a while your local papers probably owned by getting at the company that owns USA Today they own smaller papers\nYeah they're ... USA Today yeah\nOkay congressman\nThe best response to Donald Trump's op ed is Donald Trump's own words I mean someone should\nSimply print from his book the America we deserve which he published in two thousand his defense of a single payer system\nIs admission back then that candidate had a superior healthcare system his argument in that book that while he's usually a free market person he believes that single payer healthcare is cheaper and has better benefits so what USA Today really ought to do and these papers ought to do\nIs take that excerpt from his book and print it and print that side by side with the op ed of course Bernie Sanders has done a full response but Trump is basically contradicting something he believed Fifteen Years ago\nThat's amazing cars I had no idea I'd written a book that said that\nHe hated it in America we deserve and he actually says I think Kennedy has a better healthcare system than we do a I'm usually a free market person but when it comes to health care I think a single payer system is better and I really think the Democrats need to be putting this out more that ah this this was Donald Trump's own view back in two thousand\nIs incredible Joe in Cupertino, California you're on the air congressman kinda\nTheir morning Tom good morning congressman I'm more interested in trying to follow up our meat contract with your office when I got a really nice letter in regards to you or your support of\nWhat's going on with the Kavanaugh scene but you know yesterday I saw congressman or senator or Harrison you interviewed\nA Christopher Wray and I was dismayed I could see that we do a Little America Charlie ... self hearing the referral and his admission that the scope liberties you said by the White House [noise] over the Kavanaugh confirmations ... really good\nDoes he now I'm ... talked about activities court was more a courtroom Supreme Court people but I don't believe we should keep seed this nomination do our disappointment to the Supreme Court which which sitting out in front of a ... I Believe\nA doctor for your not talk to you know as at Yale graduate what do you speak about the fact that they weren't seeing class to you know not being Christopher Wray\nIn a cabin on how he can not refuse himself in the parents what appears to be a conflict of interest and I I just wanted to actually you can take or who you can persuade you do you do run this to ground because I think the Supreme Court deserves\nTo be fully staffed with confident people not just whoever's picked and I'll Wait for your answer after\nAmen congressman did you graduate from the la illogical\nYeah I Try I Try not to mention that I Am [laughter] [laughter] because it uh it's a\nEdie Edie ... went to Georgetown Prep for or or Yale ... is a high to get to collaborate\nBanging their heads right now [laughter] but\nUh I I appreciate the caller's comments and let me make two concrete or points a first Jerry ... who hopefully we'll be chairing the Judiciary Committee has said that we are going to continue to investigate the matter\nOr and or the house Judiciary Committee will have tremendous\nA power over this Nancy Pelosi has said that the FBI report or ought to be declassified and a ought to be made public that we are going to subpoena a that we're going to subpoena or the FBI we're going to try to do our own investigation or to get to the bottom of this\nThe second thing in terms of the court expansion I was just talking to Bruce Ackerman the other day who teaches at Yale and he pointed out that one of the things we got to do is modernized the Supreme Court just from a perspective of\nA what we need we need for the twenty first century the Supreme Court currently only hearing eighty cases that's down from a hundred and eighty four cases during the Reagan Administration the reason that they're not able to hear these cases as they have so many cert petition and nine justices simply isn't sufficient\nThe court started with six justices and Lincoln and Jefferson\nAdded justices so we want to look in a reform that would be a for expanding the court maybe you can have a super majority required for confirmation to modernize the court in the twenty first century and then I think we'll avoid a constitutional crisis\nBut if we don't modernized the court and you have majority in policies struck down by counter mature tearing cork a that's going to be far worse\nYou know and these are things that can be a pastor Congress and the simple majority vote\nOr they they are but you know one other thing that ... and this is Bruce backwards idea but he and he spent his whole life studying the constitution you could actually term limited justices or and then have them sort of on a court of appeals because the constitution says\nThey need to be in the judiciary for life not that they need to be on the Supreme Court for life so you could see a system of ten twelve years on the Supreme Court and then you go down to the court of appeals\nOh that's interesting because at the founding of the republic they all rode the circuit in fact they did that until Eighteen Ninety One\nUm that's why they kept expanding the number of justices because the number of circuits went all the way up to ... which is why there were ten\nTen a justice system during the Lincoln administration and then of course they cut it down to six when Andrew Johnson came in because the radical Republicans were seriously PO the jobs and it was a democratic cetera et cetera but all that drama but wow I I yeah that's a brilliant idea\nIs that Bush's idea you know his point is that if one of the things you say they'll stop people from gaming the system right now they look for people in their forties and fifties you really want someone at the end of their career and if you have someone say that you can sort of twelve years Fifteen Years Eighteen years\nYou probably have someone to be appointed in their sixties and then they go and serve or on the circuit court and so you get people also a warrant trying to game the system and have someone be there for forty fifty years\nYeah yeah and ... and you do want people who are wise and wisdom really is the older I get the more I realize a function of of experience on top of a knowledge you know it's not just um\nAnyhow Paul in a looser and California you're on the air with congressman so kind of\nWeight while I'm On I'm going to hit the brake here I'm I'm Sorry we're\nMore for just a thirty seconds away from the machine for San break on me let me put you on hold and we'll pick up on the other side of the spring of\n... is

Texas and they get a provisional ballots and they get ... because if somebody's in the car and they cannot get out to the polls to vote\nBut she says he says he plans check I mean there may it heads as possible attacks us all the Texas is the only state in the union that does that\nUm but to the best of my knowledge there is no state we're filling out a provisional ballot is the same thing has registering to vote or making sure that you're registered\nAnd are and I believe that even in Texas the provisional ballots are not counted Suzie I just you know if if if I'm wrong I Will correct myself by the end of the show but I'm virtually ... percent certain that I'm writing\nHere I've done this for Twenty years calm telling people to vote provisional ballots are in Texas okay I ... off to the state okay a provisional ballot\nYeah and the placebo about any of congressman your thoughts on this what do you know about this\nWell well I think Suzy the animating principle that everyone needs to vote early is right but I Would encourage people to be voting provision all I think they need to be registered and voting is time you're right that provisional ballots aren't counted until after the election day many times candidates have already conceded or the media is already called the election\nI Do think we need lawyers and advocacy to try to make sure those provisional ballots are counted ah but um but my understanding is that it's very hard to get those provisional ballots counted and often they don't get counted so uh that's something that we need to uh to fight for but through these point that we need people going in voting early and we need people\nAre aware that ah the the tactics that folks are going to go to disenfranchise them I think is the important take away\nTo Linda in Deerfield Beach Florida you're on the air with cars from Kara\nHi I'm thank you uh congressmen and time for taking my call I wanted to hit you real quick fun facts\nOr the federal judge rules against extending voter registration down here in Florida judge Robert ... no you're not going to it hit the where the hurricane hit the pan handle her I said no I wasn't that nice\nHotel in ... city isn't it we can't let that happen that we can't let people both there some water and the interruption towns right\nCollege I'm Gillum Gillum happens to be from Tallahassee so I mean these folks know exactly what they're doing and who they're trying to disenfranchise\nAbsolutely the young voters by um my other question was and I don't know if you know anything about this because a congressman poke can\nI said that they're putting a committee or together for the Teamsters uh pension I'm One of those many four hundred thousand not pension ears\nAnd uh they're talking about now cutting Medicare they're now talking about Social Security I Am almost sixty congressman I Can't make this money that was I was supposed to get fourteen hundred a month and now I'm not going to get Social Security on top of that how long they want me to work\nI mean I'm just ask have you heard anything on our pension plan to constrict pension plan\nI appreciate your raising it I have and Marco can enrich your Neal who is going to be hopefully the chair of the ways and Means Committee and Tim Ryan or all have been working on this is a house\nA bill in ... to protect a ensure up a pension plans it's just a wrong for people like you to work their whole lives and then a C. or their pension not to be there for them\nAnd so this was going to be a priority for House Democrats and it's a priority frankly uh that progressive than more moderate Democrats here it's a consensus view so I'm quite optimistic once we get back the house that we should be able to get something done\n... harbor Washington You're on the air with congressman or\n[noise] [noise]\nHi thanks for taking my call 'em my question is if we knew about voter suppression\nAnd then the purging back in two thousand how come I was a emphasize are brought to light prior to the two thousand six gene elections and what can be done now and can't we like to the states for these kinds of activities\nBut I didn't\nGet candidly a one we were probably over confident in our ability to win and two dozen sixteen I certainly didn't think Donald Trump would win and I don't think many people in the party he thought he would and so uh we didn't do enough\nOr are\nWe at and get your the electoral college so that one man one woman\nOne vote ... she'd democracy yeah uh\nIn our country yet right now we don't have that with the joy of college and as much as you talk about voting do we get rid of that like college well we we don't have a truly democracy in America [noise]\nCongressman add if it wasn't for the electoral college we would have a seven to two progressive majority on the court right now 'cause both Bush and Trump lost in the electoral college\n[noise] right I agree with the caller I I agree with you time that the electoral college is outdated anti democratic ah I read somewhere that the Senate majority is now going to be representing about Eighteen percent of the population so we do have these structures that are are not reflective of the\nPopular will the only thing we can do\nIn the onslaught of money in these anti democratic uh structures is to\nMobilize and to get out and vote a into organized in a way they can over time uh the concerted power on the other side it's a a fight\nOr for the soul of our democracy\nLincoln in El Cerrito California you're on the earth congressman kinda\nLincoln hello there are a you're on the air I didn't hear a minute this is Lincoln pain yeah you're on the air\nEither I'd like to talk about shifting the burden of taxation from corporate America through the wealthy\nMoney income profits are not actually well until they arrive at the individual I think that the Democrats could steal a serious march on Republicans but actually calling fluid gushing of corporate income tax none of the doctors but corporate income tax\nAnd beginning a return to the progressive tax structure on the wealthy totally ...\nCongressman I I Would like to to ... and that is that uh that that a\nSales pitch for no corporate taxes which has been coming from the libertarians and the Koch brothers for a long long time ignores the fact that corporations use our comments which is what taxes pay for\nCorporations use you know they've got it at an educated workforce by virtue of our public schools um they get to work by a public roads are they use the same infrastructure electricity to telephones everything all all these ... rights away though that we collectively own\nAnd that are in fact you can make the argument ... depending on the industry and that might be a way to adjust taxes corporate income taxes or even just taxes in general um they actually probably in many cases particularly the polluting industry has a has a much greater impact on the commons than individual voters to\nAn hour or even individual billionaires do so I I think I can make an argument that we should raise corporate taxes back like you know back to where they were back you know during the Eisenhower administration\nOne third of the total income to the federal government some corporate taxes now it's down to eleven percent\nAre your thoughts I agree with your time and and the that the corporate uh there's no argument for the corporate tax cuts that are the Republicans are passed\nA they also are by the way or the top corporations are consuming the most energy ... contributing to climate change most of these corporations the effective tax rate is ten a present in some cases is zero percent where they're paying a no corporate tax because of all of the deductions\nI and I've traveled around the country to places like Huntington West Virginia painful Kentucky Jefferson, Iowa places that\nVoted for Donald Trump I Am never heard a local mayor\nOr or local community say to me you know one or because of these corporate tax cuts suddenly we're getting jobs in our communities what they talk about is the need for high speed Internet a community college education\nApprenticeship programs that money would be far better spent a on those programs rather than these massive handouts to corporations which by the way aren't even located often in the United states in terms of the employee base it's\nA really a tax cut that's helping people or many outside the United states\nAllen in Oakland, California we have about two minutes at the end of the hour here Alan you're on the congressman kinda please\nMake protecting my calls gentleman farm media constantly terrorists the myth that our elections are free and fair most Americans are not well enough informed to our to realize the fall sort of that mom trust the Republicans only win by massive disenfranchisement gerrymandering\nBut most pernicious of a changing to vote counts electronically to totally on verifiable electronic center voting systems with secret tabulation software I suggested every\nDemocratic office holder immediately challenged the fact that we now have fake elections every time they take the floor in Congress or at any press interview or town saw\nThe demand must be firsthand counted paper ballots with full transparency now with everyone being allowed to vote the American people need to be educated that we have elections theater novel elections and the Democrats have been silent on this for the last Eighteen years since the stuff to Florida\n\nI agree with the caller that we need paper ballots or paper verification I also think we need a ballots to be posted on a website publicly so that you can trace to make sure that your ballot\nOr was actually received in counting and there is a public accounting of that uh they was necessary to make sure that people believe in our process in so that there is no tampering\nIn any election and the tampering is often most possible a local elections I mean obviously it would take a huge conspiracy given the localized nature of our elections to a rig voting machines in every county in every jurisdiction that's not the case when you're talking about local elections where fraud and hacking is even easier\nGo cars and a little less than a minute here about a half a meta thoughts on the next week of the upcoming

put his ... you know he raised for kids ... they could put kids through college she\nI mean it was a small crew of six of us in a three bedroom one bedroom house but it was a year on the resume cool laws that was the American dream he took the other two week vacation every year he bought a new car every two years\nUm and and he was a single brought in Britain winter I mean that's the American dream right that you're talking about\nYeah absolutely and and I think that that's it right that that the the sense that the country was there to protect the rights of everyone and to aspire to equality of opportunity but also that you know ... so certainly that notion that if you work hard you could provide for your family and all of those ideas that are under threat\nUm but you know they've always been threatened by inequality and when when you know too much wealth is in the hands of too few people\nThat opportunity constrict for everybody else but now people too many people in my view would say that the solution is the American dream of individual free market opportunity but that's just you know that's just exacerbating the problem whereas a hundred years ago they were arguing that\nThe American remember reminding us that the American dream was not about wealth the American dream was about democracy equality and justice and that those things would be threatened by two by two I'm much you know individual accumulation of of wealth and power so so that some of the earliest examples I found\nSaid that a multi millionaire would be the death of the American dream because that was the worst possible thing for the country for that much wealth to be in the hands of so few\nWell and then America First the genesis of that phrase\nYeah so America First I'm I'm like the American dream it hasn't kind of flipped its meaning I'm like that but it it is an older and darker phrase than I think most people realize when Trump resuscitated it and it began to be you\nKnow used again and commented on a lot of people noted rightly that it was associated with Charles Lindbergh and the America First movement of Nineteen forty Nineteen forty one to keep America out of the second World War but\nIt actually is a is a good twenty to Thirty years older than that and it was incredibly ubiquitous in the political conversation in America from Nineteen Fifteen going forward it was the campaign slogan of Wilson and his Republican opponent and Nineteen sixteen Wilson used it to urge America to stay out of the first World War\nUm but very quickly it got taken up in the name of isolationism protectionism hurting ran on in America first platform in Nineteen twenty to keep America from signing the treaty of Versailles and joining the league of nations\nHe tried to pass a permanent protection the terrorists in the name of America First and throughout the Nineteen twenties again in the name of America First there was sweeping anti immigration laws that were passed that were um ruthlessly ethnic in their\nUh uh I'm In their thinking and indeed you genesis um and that they were they were those were the immigration laws that established quotas um of different ethnic communities that was known as the national origins act so only certain certain number of people from a given um ethnic origin we're going to be allowed into the country and not law\nHeld from Nineteen twenty four to Nineteen sixty five that was in the name of America First so it was as it is now a way of talking about isolationism and protectionism but at the same time it became associated with\nThe rising power of the Ku Klux Klan um which of course was I'm very dominant in the Nineteen twenties and they would carry America First banners date they took out advertisement saying that they were the America First party\nEx jurors the most stylish true I've ever owned and it gives me ideal posture which means more energy better concentration and more productivity than I ever thought
