significant other will be as far as how high the bump will be compared to what the normal level of purchasing is it's too probably soon to really know what that is and we can't know what that is because the government has failed at supplying the demand or in the marketplace so if there's a bump it's going to be exacerbated\nBy the fact that a bunch of people showed up to buy some weed and it wasn't there and so then they're like oh well I guess we'll just call my regular dealer\nRight now I'm not saying that and there is no such thing as a shortage but I'm not saying that that\nThat's what all of these shortages but that is a factor\nI'll give you that it's a it is a factor and again it is you don't really know what the real market demand for something's going to be until it's

but as far as figuring out\nWhat kind of volume is being moved right you have no idea\nBecause you don't know how many of the dealers there are in a given area\nAnd so you can't pull them 'cause you don't know who they are\nOkay you know if you didn't know who they are then they could contribute some sort of data to some kind of knowledge about what it is that the ... the demand is I mean obviously it's coming from somewhere but it's probably coming from different sources and who's going to voluntarily shared data about their illegal business for the government well nobody I mean they're not going to share it with each other\nThat makes sense this year that kind of data about your lifted legal business what what kind of volume you have and not necessarily well I see what

Honduras\nI was traveling with her eight month old daughter and two year old son and husband she says if they stop us now we'll just come back a second time and they had the headline here or the I guess like the video byline or or headline is anything is better than returning is what one migrants was quoted as saying\nWhen the place you're coming from is so bad that you would rather die than go back there\nThen that's motivation that motivate as inspiration to ah to do this and and of course numbers are powerful right groups of people\nAre doing something like this this is incredible and that's part of the reason why I Would bet the Mexican government has essentially stood down\nTo they have the facilities to hold seven thousand people do they have the you know the guards and the men to be able to stop a group of people like that going on on the border they they will have a they ...\nThey don't have anything right and the government you know ultimately relies on I mean at some level\nWe know governments not voluntary right like we know the government is violence or the government is aggressive force but at some level they do rely on people's obedience and as soon as people stop being obedient as soon as people stopped doing you know kind of what's the expected thing to do\nWhich is a few people at a time go to the border\nThey get stopped by guards with guns the guards with guns demand id the guards with guns demand obedience you have to fill out paperwork you have to do things that we say you have to pay the fees that we say you have to pay so that's the way it normally works they they can expect a certain number of people to do that every single day and that's just a normal uh order of things\nBut when people decide to say uh you know what we're not going to wait around and this line because what the story was on Saturday was that people were being stopped by these border guards they were letting people ... through one of the time right or to apply for asylum and some people did um style\nAnd now that the stats here that that CNN is published is that a Mexican authorities say more than one thousand Central American migrants officially apply apply for refugee status over the past three days that's out of Seventy five hundred people where does the ... what did the other sixty five hundred do\nOr because they have some sort of principle I don't think matters ultimately the principle of civil disobedience still applies here because when you do civil disobedience and they are being civil they're not you know hurting people there were some people throwing rocks but that's because the police were shooting at them or you know so there's that\nBut generally they're being peaceful they're trying to travel from one point to another four\nPeaceful purposes likely to get work and you know to settle their family down somewhere so they're doing it for a peaceful purpose they're going forward and they're not obeying what the government tell\nI mean we didn't have motivation component to that\nThen it's not cooperation it puts the government in a position where they have two choices and one of the choices which we just outlined is escalate from tear gas and rubber bullets to actual bullets and start you know killing people\nOr the other choice is the choice they did which is to ignore\nThe disobedience ignore the non cooperation and look impotent you know they risk looking like oh there's no actual rule of law here there's no system that's actually in place that must be followed now that they've stood down it's proof\nLarge numbers of people who are willing to uh you know break these arbitrary desktops forced upon them these laws are statutes or whatever you want to call them that they have a level of power that the government is quite afraid of because they put them in that position of\nDoes Mexicans government and want to look like a horrible group of murderous tyrants well we know that is what they are because all governments are groups of murderous tyrants\nBut because you can see what they do now in a way that you couldn't easily do a hundred years ago or three hundred years ago or whenever you know governments were more likely to shoot large groups\nOf news about the Boston Massacre sure got around and that was but almost three hundred years ago and I'm sure that's true but it's even faster today than it was then and it's\nEven more persuasive I think now because you can see what's happening you can see the violence you conceive of government shoots a dog to death or that gets passed around and stories like that certainly wouldn't have made it anywhere right you know in in previous decades\nSo you know you put them in that position so what do you want to call it civil disobedience or not\nIt definitely was not cooperation there were the few people who did cooperate you so thousand miles away it was a thousand I don't have any five hundred I did go through the asylum process and now they have paperwork of asylum of asylum nature from Mexico maybe some of those folks are going to settle in Mexico\nMaybe some of the going to go all the way through to us but either way I I Love seeing as\nCompared to where they came from Mexico is not bad so I I couldn't do any of them for for staying\nYeah I mean I don't know um if they're going to face a greater\nYou know difficulty from the Mexican government than they would the U.S government but I suspect the the greater difficulty would come from the U.S government I mean they're they're better funded they have better likely have better technology would be my guess I mean I don't know for sure I've never\nSeen the officers of the Mexican immigration compared to you know what kind of tech they they might have access to but you just presume since there's more money in the United states for them to tax write other probably much better funded\nSo ah they talked to some folks at the border one young lady said she'd waited at the border until mid Saturday but became desperate at how long it was taking to be processed\nSo again many people were willing to jump through the governmental hoops but when the hoops became so arduous\nBecause they'd have to wait right you're waiting around on a bridge for three days straight right didn't have\nNo food no rallies to go to the bathroom where at least even cook there's no port a potties they're either right so you know people are going to be gotten off the side of the bridge that's going to be a bit of an ugly circumstance\nWhere are you gonna lay your head a night to go to sleep are you going to get any sleep you're surrounded by people I mean these people were packed in shoulder to shoulder or on this bridge at least in the photographs that ah that I had that is true\nAnd then of course they are they talking about Trump on Twitter talking about how the U.S will turn them away saying the migrants seeking asylum must first apply in Mexico\nWell why is that exactly why don't you have to I don't know anything about the process you have to apply for any country that you pass through\nI don't have all the details offhand but I Do know there's an agreement between a quite a few countries that you had a if a migrant comes in and they have to apply for asylum at the first country they reach interesting\nA Mexican officials have said migrants seeking asylum or under no legal obligation who apply in Mexico but under a proposed bilateral agreements that the Trump Administration has discussed with Mexican officials are just propose\nUs border officials would be able to legally turned back asylum seekers who first pass through Mexico forcing them to seek protection south of the border but again it's just a proposal\nAnd okay so they haven't actually done that yet right so what's the you know motivation for Mexico to agree to that why would they why would they want to agree to that and why would they want to be the glorified a initial processing department for the U.S government I don't think they would I mean I've stood in the\nEnd what are they training that from I don't know a whole lot about Mexican immigration law what pressures ... it was under from either the U.S or the emailer under pressure whatever but\nBut what what is that any change from kind of it's like you know shiny the new version and the statute and saying is this better but I don't know I haven't read the original ...\nI mean the thing about ... even if Mexico did agree to this and processed all these people for asylum anyone they refused asylum to they could just give them a free ride up to Texas and drop 'em off at the border there and then it's the US's problem well I don't think that\nMakes it kinda fairly wants to fund that or deal with them while they're on the way through\nSo according to store here in southern Mexico Sunday officials encouraged the migrants to apply for asylum or otherwise seek legal immigration status in Mexico but they may barely any effort to halt the migrants as they walked along the main highway\nFederal police officers were times president on the road so they were they're monitoring the procession and a police helicopters circled overhead but the authorities allowed the perception to carry on unimpeded\nAt one point a senior migration official standing in the back of a police pickup truck like I like I describe they've got these things everywhere urged the migrants to register themselves with the authorities and seek legal immigration status saying the migrants could not cross the country without documentation\nBut people said they feared being deported the group kept moving north by evening most of the migrants extremely wary from the arduous walk had reached the city of ... about a twenty mile journey by road from Ciudad who doll go\nThe group plan to continue their journey north on Monday the toll free number here if you want to join us is a fifty five four fifty free that's eight five five four or five zero three seven three three\nAh basically federal police just standing back and watching this happen technically if you want to be legal in Mexico you you need to get their permission slip you've got to have the paperwork from the immigration are goons or they could stop you and if you don't have that paperwork they could remove you from the country and you could pay a fine\nThat is true but that requires them to do things that would require them to actually like try to process these people or try to intimidate these people or do something at all and why should they I mean yeah that could be money in it for ... for 'em but there's all these people probably dirt poor and can't even pay the fees marijuana\nHas unleashed a green

when the the newspaper interviewed them about it and like well why aren't you doing anything their\nResponse was\nWell we don't think there's any marijuana being smoked have investigated and we looked we didn't see any writing so people were complaining a and they responded to the complaints and then when they responded they they could not find any evidence of marijuana being smart I don't\nKnow that you're allowed to smoke tobacco inside a state building's either oh this wasn't tobacco oh no I understand that claim of the cop was that the backup but I'm pretty sure that's also a legal\nI don't think I've ever made a claim about that I don't believe that it wasn't ... no no no no I'm not talking about when they went into the police station I don't think the police have ever made any kind of public on this ... where where\nMarijuana was being openly you know consumed every single day for a period of a few months now above ... until I got really cold and people didn't want to go out anymore\nBut uh you know every single day it was happening and so that's what they were claiming that they sent officers down they found no evidence of ah the lobbying broken and so therefore they weren't going to continue on\nOne of those rare situations where even if you're the type of person that considers that a problem if you just ignore the problem it goes away because it has no reason to be there any\nMore [noise] up so in this case that's going to be true in Mexico they can ignore this group of people\nAnd not true of this case at all whatsoever\nWell I mean there's probably going to be some uh people are going to go away yeah I mean that's what I'm saying they're going to go away it may be they may not be able to leave without a trace because it is a large group of people and while we can hope that many of them are picking up the garbage that they're generating\nThere's probably a few that aren't going to although to be to be clear even the hippies have a leave it better than you left it kind of a ...\nSo they have these are the first world with infrastructure and wealth those hippies\nYeah those those have I'm not going to jump to a conclusion though I'm Melanie without any evidence and say that these people are going to leave the place worse than they found it I'm not going to do that we don't have any at\nAll I think that there is evidence there there's large amounts of people fleeing from a place that's a bad\nIt's not that don't land is bad the land isn't hers with ... socialism or some of the most societies or poor cultural behavior is it's not like the dark and the trees that the problems are you're taking all the people over here\nAnd moving them over there\nOr whatever and those people are like\nThe good and the bad parts of them are coming with them to wherever they go to\nAnd I think you're gonna see most of these people are going to be good so that's why I'm not worried that they're going to be ... you know destroying their their paths on the way up to these places but either way the caravan\nEven if there there's even if they're good\nThat doesn't mean that they know how to navigate society\nI mean forget that Mexico is a cause all they have to do is they were in our society is going to take more than an hour to walk through Mexico sure take days I imagine I don't know how many of them all day long and they don't necessarily know how you know get a society with\nYou know more attack with higher sanitation standards what is going to be a problem now is going to end his you know it doesn't matter that they are good people if they can't afford soap and don't know what to do with it if they saw it because if it's really it's horrible and they say these are still issues I think we open about\nIt I don't think that's the problem I think the the problem is the the gangs and the government and the corruption and there's so many issues are down there\nWith a caravan here according to the New York times is part of a tradition of mass migrations often organized by advocacy groups that provide safety in numbers to migrants who face many threats to their safety along the perilous migrant trail\nMany say they're fleeing economic distress and violence in their homelands and such caravans have usually numbered in the hundreds and it passed unnoticed but the current care of it by far the largest on record\nHas angered Donald Trump who has seized on it as a campaign issue to fire up his base before the midterm elections well other caravans of generally wizard as they've progressed north this one has grown\nPerhaps in part as a result of all the media attention that it has received Mexican authorities warned as the migrants approach that only travelers with valid documents and visas or was claims for asylum or other forms of protection\nWill be allowed into Mexico they threatened deportation for those who tried to enter legally and said they would progress the migrants one by one but on friday morning thousands tried to cross the border and mass surging past Guatemalan border guards before being turned back by contingent of unarmed Mexican riot police\nOfficial said that as of late Sunday they had received more than a thousand asylum requests from caravan members at the border\nSome migrants were taken to a local fairgrounds that've been converted into a temporary government shelter

to you over discord dot L. are indata them\nWe're looking a little bit deeper here into this migration of a a massive amount of people that has essentially for the most part ignored Mexican border officials and guards who had initially shot at them in order to keep them away from the border checkpoints in large numbers but\nUh the numbers were so large they were able to just essentially jump over the sides of the bridge and up in a raft and make it to the shoreline where a Mexico's border guards basically let them move on and elder march in North down\nA which is going to result in some very interesting conflict\nWhich you know I Wish there wasn't conflict I Wish they would just be allowed to cross into the or the United states and\nGo about finding jobs and settling into different communities and making a new life for themselves but a Donald Trump he's got politics to play\nAs do the Democrats as well and they're going to use these people and uh they're going to take advantage of them on both sides both the Democrats and the Republicans will be utilizing this as we've seen over the last days that this has been getting a major coverage all these politicians on all sides have been using the opportunity\nTo pander to their base and of course all of it happening right up\nTo the the ah right before the midterm dumb it terms right which is what two weeks\nI think at this point does pretty close yeah 'cause it's not next week it's the week after that after that on a Tuesday so we're just over a Fifteen days here\nFrom the election now I think it's going to take a longer than two weeks to make it to the border\nUm I mean Michael you bicycled across the United states and it's a bit of a little bit of a journey on it's a journey on a bicycle that walking it's going to be quite a distance because they they're basically started to get the bottom end of Mexico I mean this literally\nThis is very nearly the southern most point in Mexico yeah I've looked at uh the distance of ... you know how long it would take to drive a in Mexico to go from Acapulco which is not quite as far south\nItself but it's not as far south\nOr two from Texas to Acapulco and you're looking at basically a full day of driving if you do it uninterrupted like twenty four hours meadow sounds about right and so you know you're doing that on foot is going to take I Would what would you say weeks\nYeah hey weeks is that going to take and you know two weeks and that's if you're moving pretty quickly and these people are not moving pretty quickly writes ah so the story here from\nNBC News about pointless in from from terrorists which is organized by or one of the organizers is Rodrigo a bay how who said he was surprised that Donald Trump has deemed these migrants to be dangerous\nHe's led ... for over Fifteen Years they've had migrants are leading them to the United states via care of it has to help them seek asylum in other countries\nQuote these people are frustrated and desperate he said in Spanish in an interview with NBC News from Mexico the group's volunteers help the migrants stay together to protect themselves from danger along the way including from criminals and natural elements but also to move past law enforcement officials\nThe organization has been relatively unknown to most Americans until the president began tweeting about the people abandon volunteers\nBegan a company to the border during holy week the final week of lent as commemorated by Christians the president's tweets came after a story by buzzfeed headline quote a huge caravan of Central Americans is headed to the U. S. and no one in Mexico dares to stop them and quotes\nThe caravans are referred to in Spanish as via ... or ...\nOr migrants way of the cross their fashioned after the stations of the ... stations across procession celebrated by Latin America and Latino Catholics to mark and reenact the final days of Jesus from prosecution to his burial into\nAnd such procession someone plays Christ carrying wouldn't cross and people from the congregation or community following similarly the volunteers from pointless in front terrorists and other groups the company migrants in a caravan that travels in buses on trains and on foot\nPublished in front front terrorists also runs a shelter for migrants a bay has said this year's caravans different from previous years and there's cause for concern\nBut not the sort Trump raised in his tweets a bay has been helping out with the caravan since twenty Thirteen said about eleven hundred and Seventy five people were taking part in the Caribbean this year with some ... gang violence in El Salvador and many more from Honduras than in previous years again we're talking about the one that happened in April back in ... of this year\nQuote about eighty percent of them are from Honduras we have around three hundred miners ranging from one month old to eleven years old as the rest of the people we have about twenty used to identify as algae beauty and about four hundred women\nA bass said the Hondurans and the Caribbean or fleeing the continuing political crisis in violence in Honduras that escalated in November with the election of President Juan Orlando Hernandez is election was seen as rigged and was followed by violent protests that were shut down with the military enforced curfew\nAnd then you know again up here in the U.S we don't get all the international news I mean\nWe hear that Honduras is a bad place to be where you hear about the murder rate I did not know what was going on there politically so yeah curfews that that's got to be tough to live with\nAnd here in the United states they've certainly done curfews they tend to be limited time and I believe they should be protested and they should be you know people should not be told\nOr what time they can leave their house if you want to take a risk if it's dangerous supposedly out at nighttime for whatever reason and you want to take the risk of leaving your own home you should be able to make that choice for yourself\nAnd no government goons should be able to tell you\n... know if you come out we're going to arrest you which is basically what a curfew is as you get caught you get a rest right\nAt least thirty people were killed during Honduras election aftermath the organization of American states called for an election do over after finding irregularities in deficiencies in the Honduran election process but the United states recognize the elections outcome without insisting on another election or review of the results\nAre going on the Obama administration faced a surge of arrivals from Central America at a U.S Mexican border in twenty fourteen mostly women and children the numbers forced the administration to set up emergency shelters and a family detention center in Texas they were also criticized for some of the steps that they took\nOkay so no those are interesting allegation\nYeah I hadn't I hadn't seen any stories I've I haven't read every single me neither about those you know that I have not seen one yet about this this particular care of and having a private security or a crimes going on I'm sure I'm sure this came from somewhere I'm\nCurious to know where that came from I mean I'm not denying it it is true but that has certainly hasn't been reported on that doesn't mean it's not true right just grows the news media doesn't report on a thing doesn't mean that that's not going on they did mention that people along the route in Mexico have been giving them water\nOr they have been giving them tortillas bananas so they've been trying to help these folks and I don't know I mean it doesn't seem like anybody sit in a port a potties but maybe they're doing that to maybe there's some uh\nSome individuals in the towns that there are crossing through who are offering up their homes are or who knows it will be interesting to know that could be you know what a what all are acts\nOf kindness are being extended or is the private security being hired by a ... the group that we're talking about so pointless in front terrorists\nOr who's hiring the private security are they local interested people that's a good question anyway he goes on here he says ah it formed quickly using those handouts and it has also experienced the number of cases where individuals in it were arrested for criminal activity\nAnd of course this is going to be the big issue that\nPeople focus on and Melanie you certainly said earlier that you think people aren't good I'm generally is that I don't want to put words and\nYou know so I guess we can and that's an entire philosophical discussion but that's OK he got out okay so yeah people know people generally aren't good and people so even and even if they are you're dealing with the traumas based on their story ... you're dealing with traumatized ...\nIn ... large groups of traumatized impoverished people who don't necessarily know how like just because there\nIs nobody is evil I mean if they're really that impoverished and really that traumatize\nThey're going to need a lot of work to\nIntegrate into anything remotely resembling a stable society\nOkay well let's let's accept that people have been a traumatized in Honduras which is where most of the\nGalley and then that means that where they're coming from isn't that bad do we need to send therapists down there and then well let's well we don't need a new anything that's down here we're up here\nBut what are you saying do should be done are you saying these people should not be allowed to come into the United states because they were traumatized somewhere and what it\nWill just because there is not a good solution to something doesn't mean that it's not a problem and I think that this is where a lot of and I take the the the non position of the if I don't have anything anarchists to say I don't say anything at all but\nIt's been in the past ... two hours and I can't just not say anything hurdle is that right but so something can be a problem without a solution like that that's possible\nSo you're not calling for government intervention on this I'm not calling for government intervention in anything okay but ... ... a lot of interest to do this thing where they uh\nEspecially the the um I don't want to say left in our gifts but the more people who tend to identify as ... um do they think we're like well if I Can't think of a solution that's not compliant therefore it's not a problem that's not how\nIt oh no I mean I don't think anybody hears the only problem I mean we we spent the last two hours talking about it\nBut you've you've spent the last ... hours talking about the Caribbean and how horrible Honduras is and I don't agree on that I see what do you have two hours talking about the practicalities of mass immigration\nOkay the the practicalities are if some people are allowed to come here than the people who want to step up to help those people out will step up to help those people out whether it be to provide them with therapists or whether it be to provide them with the place to stay\nUm probably the most comfortable of arrangements likely will be available but uh there will be places you know to stay if people were free to make those\n... I I Would agree with you if\nI was listening anybody from just like adopted me an immigrant assuming like if it if they come here legally\nIf they're they have asylum no nothing stopping anybody from just like adopting an immigrant but that doesn't fully ... except for what except for the government they're the ones where I was from getting in but one of their here nobody stopping you brought up in your local immigrant and\nRight and that's not a problem like as far as what happens\nBut what do you mean you mean they uh they're not going to be able to get work or find a place to stay or you don't ... them some of them are some\nOf them aren't but that's just people in general so that's not really right unique to immigrants but yeah I mean have you ever had to like have you ever had to like\nTell a grown man to wash his hands or show a grim person how to sleep\nOr there was a kid yeah like and the people in the U. S. and I like I don't want to bring in that area of the country to New Hampshire and so I kind of have to assume that since people are willing to die to get here but it's a whole lot\nWorse where they're coming from like the\nWhich they'll be appreciative likely you know the things that they're going to have your by comparison well see\nThere but you're imposing traumatized you don't believe in good morals\nWell adjusted brain on to someone who's leading a deadly aggressive state\nNow they may be fully deadly aggressive state and they may have been traumatized but that does that really mean that they suddenly become uncivilized I I I don't buy it I don't buy it absolutely\nWell that's kind of a spectrum\nOf course there's going to be a spectrum there is going to be some people in this group who absolutely ... serious therapy from the horrors or whatever it is that they've experienced a down in Honduras maybe some of their family members were murdered or who knows what what has happened to them they solve crimes you know violent crimes being committed in front of them or whatever\nUh they've been raped by gang ... I mean I don't know maybe the government do do do two but either way\nI don't you know there is a difference between all I can see some people need that kind of help but I don't I don't see it being a majority or even as a significant minority\nYou'd think they did not even a significant minority of people who are ... laying a so somewhere that so dangerous and so horrible that they're willing to risk of getting shot at with machine guns to walk halfway across the continent don't have mental and emotional issues that they need a deal\nAnd you of course have mental and emotional issues everyone does but you moved from a very dangerous place to move from Louisiana one of the most dangerous states one of the most in ... states the government locks all kinds of peaceful people up in Louisiana\nAnd you made the migration here to New Hampshire which is a very long distance not quite as maybe about as far I don't know darn long drive from it's a significant just from Louisiana to New Hampshire and\nYou know you have an required significant taxpayer resources or anything like that I don't know if you see a therapist but uh you know you don't talk about it is if you do a you seem to have settled in just fine and you've identified correctly the New Hampshire is better than where you came from a lot of ways these people are going to be just as well\nBut so the adjustment you see people moved to New Hampshire the adjustment you and you've seen people need to make an adjustment and not quite know how to deal with being in a better played\nUs some people get a hold on hold that thought we'd come back with more hearing moments are out of a three ... you can share your thoughts with us as well as ...\nHas unleashed a green gold rush across our nation is creating ...

everything they know and the place where they came from it's amazing I don't need this any more and walk through Mexico you don't think there's a level of desperation is\nThat for Asian yeah that would address the desperation that does not does not murderous rampage type of desperation right these are people who that is I Need to find a better place to live kind of desperate\nI find it inspirational I find it a amazing that somebody would do exactly what you're talking about is is leave everything behind that's how bad things where they were willing to pick up\nAnd take whatever risks are involved in getting however many thousands of miles they have to go to get someplace better I mean that's incredible it's desperate but that doesn't as Michael pointed out that doesn't mean they're dangerous or dangerous so I said they okay handy\nOr if in the right circumstances or the wrong circumstances or whatever but the fear about what people might do is never justification and you're not doing this just to be clear\nBut plenty of people listening probably are and we know that some of the callers on Saturday Night certainly were when we were on a bunch of a big radio station they\nUse that fear that ooh there might be ... ooh there's some criminals who are in this group oh there's dangerous people in this group to fear mongering around why we need the government why we need the state the idea of the state what you are fully again\nOne you're causing this problem and the first player in Honduras and there'd be nothing to flee from if there wasn't a great from the U.S it would all be property in line and let the chips fall where they may absolutely\nAnd that would be wonderful if you know if we had that but just because the state exists I don't think means that people in mass are immoral or a moral as you\nWell I kind of definition only does because if there's three people were like hey let's have a state and then they actually tried to do that you shoot them and then there's no more debate sixty percent of the population who like hey you know it's a good idea at state you can't fight that effectively\nFrom zero okay you don't just wake up the next morning and have people former state the state has been an idea that has been voice\n... head of the nation worthy of people are generation if one of the world's oldest me right because they've been taught to believe in is\nRight it's just an idea that is you know dresses up violence the state actors we know they're violent people read they're willing to use aggressive force do get their way\nBut they've managed to dress it up in a lot of ways certainly in the United states more successfully than in a in other places they Honduras or whatever but they've dressed up with the trappings of legitimacy they have court rooms\nThey have vehicles they have badges they have uniforms and they have the indoctrination process to go along with it there's a reason why you're not going to likely put your kids in government school right\nYou have kids that's because you don't want them indoctrinated into these pro state beliefs but the reality is people when they formed the the states this idea again that just justifies violence against people they formed with all this flowery language of how it's going to respect rights and how\nYou know clearly false and it's even more clearly fall even more this falls in some place like indoor and yeah it is why they're leaving New Hampshire\nYeah but you're talking about today it's false it's clearly falls to us right but you know there were people for whom that was not fall sport for whom they believed the idea they\nBuild one and you're not in opinion in the state is aggressive or direct\nBut that doesn't mean that he sees it for different people on both for different people it's just a statement of fact that is a fact but that doesn't mean that everyone sees that backed clearly okay\nSo so they're either explicitly supporting evil violence or are there are and they're supporting but not to\nKnow it's just ignorance ignorance can be cured okay you probably weren't born an anarchist right\nLike no no one was born with any philosophy but ... lawyer today like twenty seven are stupid\nLike your age twenty seven so it took you two and a half or two two and a half decades to get it right\nDoes that mean you're you're like me is that there's something there that just doesn't make sense and the fact that it should only twenty seven twenty eight twenty six whatever it was years to figure that out that doesn't make you know me and that there was ... wasn't always like\nSomething there it's like this doesn't quite add up really what it is one of those things that ... you know scratches at the back of your mind absolutely because if you look closely you can find out what it is according to the states even if you're taking a ... in\nThe new for twenty separate however many years of the twenty seven\nI was never like hey you know what let's give this state some money that you have to pay them hate taxes you still have enough actors stolen from us what's that other\nJustices you wrote the check not really no not always you know usually it's the the money was just taken from ... yeah that's true ah but in case of property taxes you're writing a check right or\nIt didn't own a whole lot of land when I was sure Nineteen and Louisiana factors\nYou to pay that if you'd have property taxes and you'd have done it not because you disagree or you know because of whatever your opinions were because maybe you realize they were going to use violence against you and that's why you\nYou get the only reason I say it I I value my\nPrice or some people pay because it's the price of living in society as what they tell themselves [noise] uh the uh the state is ... is a necessity maybe it doesn't do everything they want it to there's all kinds of stories that people felt justified to state there's more

here legally cause them to freak out not fill out the census which will cause those areas to lose federal funds and representation\nAnd you know further increase the ghetto was Asian essentially a of immigrant communities in the United states or you know which is of course is what the Republicans swat\nAnd these two members of the Supreme Court Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas just said no he doesn't have to testify after a lower court said yeah he's got to testify in the lawsuit they said no he doesn't have to testify\nExecutive privilege right it started\nThe president as king and emperor\nCindy in Boca Raton Florida he's sending what's on your mind that\nHigh it's candy\nCandy I'm Sorry you're right it is thank you\nOkay um there was a great article that I read from vox on dot com mhm\nWas about a leading Holocaust historian just seriously compared to us in a Nazi Germany yes and it's really saying that the person who's the most responsible for our problems is Mitch McConnell um but it's an article a written by jak view camp\nAnd it was published on October fifth\nIs talking about on I Christopher Browning who is the um the respected on historian of the Holocaust right and he talks about how everything you've been talking about but that it's that Mitch McConnell is the one who's letting this go through\nYeah without without article without and ... and you know who is this Steve Bannon is the modern day version or maybe Stephen Miller um and and without to the while rom or in the army I'm I'm trying to remember the name of the of the the German legislature who is you know functionally the head of the German parliament\nI'm Paul then I'm Indian Berg\nWell hidden but yeah I actually I may have been I I it's been so many years it's been at least Thirty years since I since I read the rise and fall Third Reich but ... a big role in it I I don't remember if he was exactly what his title was but there were several senior legislators in the German parliament who basically made it all worked for Hitler and now a ...\nAnd ... and he's comparing this to Mitch McConnell and it was very interesting article way to um you should probably look at\nYeah it makes sense I mean you know obviously Mitch McConnell has no respect for the rule of law no respect for tradition no respect for the constitution we saw that in blocking Obama's federal judges for eight years completely locking them for the last two years walking Merrick Garland\nObstructing you know based on everything changing the rules of the Senate changing the filibuster rules over and over and over again\nAnd and I live in my biggest fear is that\nMy two biggest fear is right in our concern shall we say or the one the biggest one is that the Democrats don't actually take the house in which case you got Trump unleashed on chained and and his declaration that we have an emergency because there's brown people coming from the south\nUm if he were to actually declare a legal state of emergency under the Patriot act or something like that because of a quote foreign invasion the powers that he would acquire are incredible and uh that could be the end I mean that that could be the ... the absolute flipping turning point if he were to do that\nAnd I could see him doing that if the Democrats win\nWell the Republicans when I can see him doing that easily after their sworn in in January because they'll just be sink a pastor what he's doing\nIf the Democrats are too when they've got a two month period between that number six the election and the first week in January when they get sworn in as as you know when the new the Democrats get sworn in and the Republicans have to leave that to month period roughly is a time of enormous danger\nAnd it's also a time of enormous distraction you've got Thanksgiving and Christmas in there and those holidays you know people are not paying attention to what's going on they're not paying attention to the news that concerns me tremendously candy thank you for the call and for the heads up on that that was a good one George in Chicago he joined us up\nWell how come I'm I was just wondering first start if you could ah reminds
