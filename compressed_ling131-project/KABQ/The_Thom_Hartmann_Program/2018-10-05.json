high school because little Timmy didn't make the soccer team we've got John calling in from Tennessee John you're on free talks alive go have returned thought\n\nJohn you're on TALK longer going to need to turn the radio now\nYeah I I don't know what is going on there put John back on hold will try him again in a few minutes or so yeah let's jump back into this article again out of St Louis about this family who\nIs protecting their own identity for some reason filed court papers or the mother using the name John Doe filed\nPapers asking for district judge to issue a temporary restraining order and forcing the local high school\nTo put little Timmy again his name not provided in this article ah so I'm just calling him a little Timmy or they want to add little Timmy needs to be put on the junior varsity team because he did not make the varsity team\nRoss that the judge said that the students mother and stepfather advocacy on behalf of their son is admirable but said forcing the player on to the team was undermined the soccer programs legitimate philosophy of prioritizing the development of players with more years of eligibility\nAs well as inviting future lawsuits from others involving the court in any of the districts innumerable other extra curricular activities\nThe judge's ruling says that even if a students grade level was used in policy decisions it would not be unconstitutional again the parents are saying that there's an age discrimination here a gender discrimination right because\nThere are a females on the female junior varsity teams that are also juniors and little Timmy here is a junior and so well if it's good enough for the girls' soccer team it's good enough for the boys soccer team or some\nYou know it's extremely rare that you would find me agree with the government bureaucrat or judges school especially the extremely rare however even in private organizations of sports you have age discrimination yeah have a group for the five and six year olds to play people on the coach pitch and so on and so on\nBoys club has been doing this for decades and there's a reason for that\nBecause you know obviously different ages different sizes of kids different you know mental acuity right and and so I mean there's a reason for it so as much as I hate to say it I kind of the ... made the right decision\nYeah yeah I Will go with the idea that if\nPeople are not happy with their government run\nOrganization or the rules that are being imposed upon them and they probably have no choice but to accept whatever dictate comes out of the school district right then form your own leaks right it is because this happens all the time you know you you can play darts um it has been Joe's bar and grill\nAnd there's probably not a whole lot of structure behind ... yard grill is not an advertisement for him alive you know everybody's still gets together and same thing could go for ... kids sports or or band or whatever you Ryan\nAnd some of these uh sports that I don't know necessarily about soccer but in some sports there are a you know club organizations that are separate from\nThe school uh there's also the AAU which is the amateur athletics union now uh I'm guessing if little Timmy didn't make the varsity team little Timmy also would not make the eight year team\nBecause those are you know like the extra talent level above\nTo wear a lot of times specifically with basketball you'll have the AAU players don't play high school basketball and they travel around the country and they wind up getting recruited to better schools that if they would have played high school basketball right yeah my issue\nJustice visits parents trying to use force\nTo force the change that they want right ran I forget what it yeah and that's and the use of force of government to do it of course but but you know I if I were to you know if I have an agenda it's for people to look at issues like this and say\nIs there an easier way to do this as are better ways they're going to be more successful way to do this without threatening people or without taking [laughter]\nSchool district to court because your kid didn't make the team\nHe lives in starting your own league um when I was mentioned earlier I used to um ... the reason we have people in our small town was because the boys club did not have it so my mother started the youth athletic association perfect which was a five and six year old group for soccer tee ball track of ... and basketball right she started that because there was nothing for five and six roads in our small community\nNow I Do have a pacemaker account but I've not had the chance to try pulling up Jane Doe CSI\nLa du Horton Watkins high school in St Louis to try to find out the name of the lawyer flash stepfather here because I Do think that it's important and forgiving people's names to identify people\nRight on the mixed it's public information it's All right well look record but I don't think they're free talk lives should be dachshund little little Johnny here I mean I Am saying doc\nI'm just saying if we can pull up the yard public record of this case I have no problem with giving out the naval lawyer of course not I'm not saying give out the address the telephone numbers any of that just I Want the name of the lawyer\nWho we don't want poor Johnny to get ridiculed in high school do you know Derek Yach loudly already getting ridiculed if he care and worked for the ... he's probably getting ready to go to the boy\nAccording to his article did not make any of the teams as a freshman and the stepfather said that the family didn't complain then quote we told him to man up an office game he had to develop his game\nThe family hired a private coach for the boy he joined a club team in St Louis and he improved\nHe was one of the leading scores on junior varsity last year as a sophomore the step father said he's going to file court papers under sell naming other players who made varsity quote was way worse statistics\nThan the boy who was cut\nThe coach told the boys ... father and an email filed with the court that there were forty students trying out for twenty four spots on the varsity team but it's not all about stab someone let's say the kid is just not a good\nTeam player I mean right awkward as a sport that requires you to be a team player because we've got to be able to pass the ball you've got to work as a pea maybe he doesn't do that he may be a rock star on the field against score goals left and right but if he's not playing as the team he has no business being on\nOne ... the coach praised John does maturity and said the boy was quote right on the bubble and had some impressive soccer attributes such as his attacking mentality and straight lines speed however\nThe coach went on to say that he had a few holes in his game including technical ability and the other kids had better skill and soccer I. Q. that's extremely important to me as a team sport so there you go the step father said the coaches decision has left the boy humiliated\nSaying quote every one is under the impression that he's a poor player and we're a bunch of cry babies but no he had a successful soccer season last year\nFrom the statistics that appears he should have made varsity\nOh my God this is the worst of of I just have this image of screaming parents had little league game I just I mean for God's sake let your kids have a normal life\nWell let's be honest if your kid doesn't learn how to fail is never going to make it out there because that is how you I learned more from the failures I've had in my life right ever learned from succeeding somebody when I was playing trumpet in high school band for example I didn't learn when I'm a first year I learned when I had to struggle to get\nFirst year right that's a that was destroyed ... that's that's the point\nThe stepfather lawyer says this is about the school refusing to follow the law with respect to age discrimination\nThe family first appeal the coaches ruling to district administrators who sided with the coach they've that appealed to the superintendent who sided with the coach the family filed a complaint and the U.S or with the U.S department of education officers civil rights\nBut the office could not force the schools the boy on the team so the family went to federal court\nFederal court and believe that that's where things end up ... because it's the school system I assume that's why it's probably in federal court\nWell no I mean when anything having to do with discrimination or or anything like that civil rights then there's a ... billion federal laws right that you can say okay well this this court didn't rule for us\nSo we're going to file and and say it's a civil rights issue in this happens left and right\nAnd it had here in New Hampshire we've got\nThis is a fairly recent case but a a local restaurant you know they got bought out in the new owners decided that they'd like to have you know some maybe some skin beer uniforms on people\nAnd you have a couple or elderly ladies who had worked there for years and didn't feel comfortable with that so seven eight years after all this happens there filing suit against you know the owners for age discrimination that stuff doesn't happen in superior court here in New Hampshire right it immediately go becomes a federal case\nWell I Know some young girls who would not be comfortable wearing that kind of clothing for it's not really age discrimination in that situation in my opinion the body discrimination I don't know\nThere's all sorts of things and now I'm not advocating one side or the other I'm just saying that when these types of things come up if there's ever any angle that spins it it's getting a likely end up in federal court right answer to ask yourself is is that the right way to do it in a small community or the community decide\nAgain the real question is is this age discrimination to\nSay that he has to be it doesn't matter that he is\nA junior and the junior varsity is mainly for freshmen and sophomores again coaches discretion on who to actually put a bit generally they're going to wind up putting the players that\nNeed to develop a little bit more is it age discrimination to not put him on the JV is it\nYes absolutely but does that mean that it's wrong absolutely not and I'm just describe it it's not a well it's not a policy right I mean I'm not going to date a opinion wrote a child for example that's age discrimination absolutely it is\nBut that doesn't mean that it's not wrong there just because you're discriminating on someone doesn't mean that it's incorrect and retired right now when you and I went to eat and eat curry Indian tonight we discriminated against every single restaurant in New Hampshire\nBecause we pick one restaurant that doesn't mean it's\nNot that there was a half marathon that Iran this past Sunday they had two other events or well three they had the marathon\nThen they had something called the kids the bar\nTo wear a to participate in the school age children under a certain age I don't know what the cut off is had to run a certain number of miles over the summer and then they lined up like one point two miles from the finish line and then they ran the final one point two miles Roger\nI hate to tell you but you unless your kids were in the kids to bar you would not be able to run and the kids don't want to live to be clean I Would that would be able to read when you go ahead please let's be clear about has also didn't run the ... for one point two miles a day do allow walking\nUh but that was but where they went by police officers who may not run right you you would not be able to participate unless your kids were involved would that be age discrimination yes you are also too young to participate in the super senior evaluate it was the same\nSort of thing but for the elderly go ahead Darryl tell them I'm old enough to do that [laughter] I don't think you are really resolved live eight fifty five four fifty free your calls and thoughts welcome

strike and Barbara Qusair the headcount on Capitol Hill continues ahead of tomorrow morning procedural vote in the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court President Trump appeared somewhat optimistic as he rally supporters and Minnesota this evening\nYes so Houston's somehow is\n... a business out of your opening well Ahmed they do have a city council and clearly right to counsel is our ... and they can decide what's best for us right now\nSo that's what they like to think right so the Houston city council has voted unanimously now unanimously Wednesday to ban a sex robot brothel set to open soon it near the Galleria area\nThe ordinance allows the business to sell the sex robots but not to allow customers to use them inside the business and they take it home and take out\nYou can is no tryout right can I just try this on and do they have no dressing room\nSo that's a good question All right let him rest and the dressing room right probably not a but this sounds like you know any adult oriented business uh as you can buy the thing\nYou can use it when you go home but\nUh but you don't get to try it before you buy it no ... no rentals either right I Would imagine they would not allow you to return right you know just like well\nThat that was going to be my question what's the return policy handle hitting you rent for the weekend I mean most states have a government mandated return policy I'm sure those return policies do not\nHave any anything in the laws about tightrope lives they probably did not anticipate that need but I'm not saying that it's not their return policy\nWas just I think that's a legitimate maybe other manufacturers who our founding fathers they didn't anticipate the Internet either but does that mean that the first amendment still doesn't applying for universal healthcare right right right they do I anticipate that one either but Abraham Lincoln said don't believe everything you read on the Internet has a true is that is true that was there when he said it actually\nYeah so anyway the vote followed\nThe vote in Houston followed a city wide uproar after the controversial business announced plans to open the brothel on Richmond I assume that's a ... a street in Houston yes it would have been the first such business the very first to open in the U.S and the U.S\nRight and I know that I've heard stories about other countries\nI forget which ones I'm guessing Japan but go ahead probably Japan but there are other countries that do have robot Brussels okay\nAnd you know that there are some people that are seem to be happy about robot brothels because then it eliminates trafficking or the appearance of trafficking and\nSome politicians like to wind up the fighting trafficking so broadly as to say that anyone at all whether they are being forced into it or not there's a victim of trafficking you just don't realize that you're a victim of trafficking so sit here and let me badger you write rice in\nThis and you're absolutely right I mean this would be a way to to remove a lot of prostitution and that's what clearly the people like the city council members would want to do that would want to lower the rates of prostitution and their city and this is one way to do that\nNobody's being harmed Mrs of completely victimless event um nobody is I mean it's fully consensual them into one person one device right so absolutely going on here it says I Know there's some people and this is a councilman Greg Travis saying this\nI Know there's some people that will sit there and say what does the city of Houston have to do with any of this yeah no kidding\nWhat does the city of your ... to have to do with any of the counselors travelers like it'd be answer is he says we're not getting into your bedroom but don't bring it into our district now my question\nWhat if my bedroom you know your district because women how my God we come on and then he says don't bring it into our city this is not a good business for our city\nWe are not sim city hold on so how do you know it's not a good business for your city you didn't allow it to hope it right I can you imagine how much tax dollars that the a business like this could could you imagine the tourist revenue right\nThere's there's all sorts of things I I'm just reading an article from the sun UK\nTalking about the attempt to do one of

I I don't know I don't know how we decided at this point right and I know that\nSome people draw the line and again I forget ... uh is safety at the one where they recognize them seldom\nSay sapiens uh is the ability to sink into reason were sent to the end is usually I'm describing the ability to recognize that you are or are we know that ... and ... and most animals are in some way Seventy en\nRoute all animals are certainly sapiens right so we do know that dolphins can recognize themselves just ranting mirrors a there are certain other animals that we know can recognize themselves\nAnd then there are ones that they recognize something is in the mirror but we don't know if they realize that it's themselves or not both thinking and reads named to me it just means problem solving\nTo so and lots of animals to them in the middle of the new octopus or\nProbably one of the most intelligent creatures and I love the theory I mean do you guys that we never covered on the show but that that octopus there's there's a couple of research there's but have determined that there's a strong likelihood that occupy are from another world\nOh and the claim is there's not a lot of fossil evidence well there's it's not only their non skeletal animals known or they're not going to leave fossil evidence\nAs the real argument was that that they are so completely different from any other

revered legal institution in the country Russian state media is supporting Trump Kavanaugh's nomination both in its domestic publications as well as those aimed at English speaking audiences all of this part of a broader picture which the criminal continues to differentiate between Trump and the American government\n[noise] um [noise] yeah I I just I don't [noise] how do you say that an active

Trump's that China is already interfering in the midterms he said as a as a senior career member of our intelligence community recently\nTold me oh I call as maybe run and would say\nThat as such but I Can't hardly ... ... what the Russians are doing\nPales in comparison to what China is doing is full of it no senior intelligence person taught him what China is doing\nA a state officials have offered no evidence of China engaging and cyberattacks akin to what Russia did in twenty sixteen oh even awful Christian Nielsen said there's no indication of any foreign adversary trying to disrupt

be really nice uh\nIt would be so happy you know there may be too much focus on yours in Atlanta show Robin Arizona hello\nYes Hi Hi thanks for having me I just want to put on a a a challenge to the Christians out there are basically\nThat our constitution has war war already over religious scripts and just like religion holes that God is the ultimate\nBother authority and you know for which all rules are made our constitution is the ultimate parent figure that makes it forces the rules for which we all live by okay you know and all of us I mean all of its children if you will citizens they can you\nYou know it treats its strives to treat all the same it strives to uh protect\nAll against born in a you know the elastic or you know ... people enemies yes\nYeah like it provides opportunities for also I challenge a Jeff Flake and the Mormons and all the other Christian religion to explain how their books have more authority over our constitution and if they do they're simply on America because they put their origin full of all South America\nI think it's significant that all of these church organizations have come out against Kavanaugh how what do we have too many law professors to ... over twenty four hundred twenty twenty five hundred or something like that judged as a former Supreme Court justice appointed a lifelong Republican I mean it's okay don't keep calling keep\nWriting in over yeah for God's sake think of Helen ... thing to me how and follow her at a funny Helen hungry we'll see you Monday I'm Stephanie Miller\nWay and it's available everywhere you want to listen on our free I honestly have downloaded now [noise]\nSpecial report critical capital vote the U.S Senate has voted to proceed with a vote tomorrow on whether to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court the fifty one forty nine votes today couldn't have been much tighter corresponded model Raj you watch the\nDon't fall for it Trump's tweets also look at all of the professionally made identical science paid for by ... those are not science made in a basement from love\nI think you could say the same thing about all the Trump science their health Israelis [noise] but ah I you know and these may well you know be signs that have been made and\nThe MDC by some sign maker who knows but so what\nBut the the thing that's really interesting is that\nTrump goes ... anti Semitic\nBench Shapiro over on Fox News he says I wasn't aware that Brett Kavanaugh forfeited his presumption of innocence are due process of law simply because of the color of his skin\nWhat does this have to do with race\nOh there's two black people on the Senate Judiciary committee Pamela Harris and Cory Booker is that what this is all about\nApparently over at Fox News it is\nA this is a man of our code or mark hot writing in salon today\nIf you flip on Fox News these days you'd think the battle is largely about race in that the white men are being subject to false rape allegations to perpetuate some\nSort of anti white of pressure\nTucker Carlson said on Fox\nYou might wonder what in the world this story the Kavanaugh story has to do with race\nAnd then he answers as unquestioning says it's about punishing everyone who looks like Brett Kavanaugh\nIn other words let's get the white guys\nApparently you know and I for being led by Dianne Feinstein out you know a white person but you know go figure Martha my column on Fox News\nWondered if Kavanaugh I should say I'm not guilty because I'm just just because I'm a white guy\nYou know Ben Shapiro the court I just gave you an all this seems to have followed on on Ann Coulter gene apparently we just want to start all this she said white privilege means that any white male can be accused with evidence free accusations like this\nBut Tucker Carlson a particular amount of our code rights\nIs embracing the opportunities Kavanaugh's skin color to convince white middle class working class Americans to align themselves with is actually the Koch brothers or the money to lead the the billionaire class\nAgainst people of color\nEven though these working class white people share the same economic concerns with the people of color\nCarlson was even shameless enough she writes to characterize a crowd the boon Senator Lindsey Graham for his events of Donald Trump is waging a revolution against the working class in quotes\nSo Donald Trump the billionaire who are inherited four hundred Thirteen or or scammed four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his dad\nIs a\nThe representative of the working class in America and the actual working class people who are out there protesting now not so much\nAny others there's a lot of other stuff in the news well actually let me just share this with the real quickly I mentioned yesterday\nThe Indiana feet aside law Indiana is one of two states with these\nBizarre laws this it's been on hold for a couple of years by a federal judge\nOr so it's not it's not in place right now but before the federal judge put it on hold\nA most people are probably forgotten the story this is from uh the spring of twenty Fifteen\nOf ... Patel\nNow in twenty Thirteen January twenty Thirteen\nJared fourteenth twenty Thirteen and fact Mike Pence was sworn in as governor of Indiana\nIn late July of that same near ... tell this from a ... pound it writing over a salon\nIn late July that same year ... Patel\nWent to the hospital and then paying this is a ... I I'm pretty sure there's a woman of Indian ancestry bleeding heavily after a miscarriage the doctor who saw her suspected she it induced and abortion and called the police\nWhen Patel woke up after ... there was a police officer standing by her bed and the anti choice doctorate left the hospital to go in search of the fetus and sure enough they found one\nAnd despite hospital test showing no traces of any aboard a face yeah the inter blood work\nThe state of Indiana charged her with both feet aside for\nWindows and doors right now tax die hard to nine six seven one for or visit I abhor

on the line with us is the ... the\nActress a activist writer board chair a progressive Democrat to America be America dot org sorrow the hit series mom on CBS speedy American at our website many Kennedy LA is or Twitter handle maybe walking back in the program\nTom I'm so glad to be back on the program with yeah Hi\nHi it's great to have you with us so uh you know the last time you were I we were talking about ballot images that some of these electronic voting machines actually capture an image of the vote which could be used for an audit just like a paper trail\nAnd apparently one of the groups that is promoting this a ... is being sued ought to audit USA or has been threatened with a lawsuit from one of the voting machine companies what's going on they've got what's\nCalled a threat ladder seems to be a deliberate just a bullying society but what they threatens is not to take\nThe usa to court if they don't take off their Web site the manual that shows election officials how these\nBallot images can be saved it's just a choice on the menu many election officials John breaking found as he went across the United states trying to get people to save their ballot images\nThey didn't know it existed they're like well we didn't read the manual and we don't know it's a lot of county election officials that has not been digitally trained or technically trained so this was part of a citizen education fears the manual here's what we're talking about and he asked the masses going no it's our copyright\nBut you can't do anything it's not that cold you can't do anything with Emanuel unless you have the machine right there only the election off them the machine and he has and that isn't telling their\nTheir counties that these ballot images exist so it seems like a threat oh my God you're trying to make us trans parent you can't use citizens shut up go away no\nWe're going to count the vote and it's down and said to count the votes so I guess the F ... inside\nYeah so we have we have two two issues here one is the millions of people who are being ill legitimately incorrectly inaccurately or perhaps accurate because they were targeted because they were young old or or a or a minority racial minority\nUh who are being thrown off the voting rolls all across the United States Senate effort that has been championed by Donald Trump and Kris Kobach and then at the same time we've got it even if you're going to end up voting if they if you if your name Adam and emerged from the voting laws you may well be voted out of machine that could be doing anything to your vote\nAnything to your vote and that's the trouble with on transparent digital counting on and fracking counting as we know we've done forever and magic and talked about how some detectable but on the ballot images are a means of audit and interestingly Tom because the help America vote act\nHad some language about well it has to be audible in case you know ... challenge so ballot images were sort of included and talked about by the vendors as well we have a picture of every ballot we scam so you could look at those and now they're hiding them\n... also I Want to caution people the Republicans are trying to go oh ballot images great now that you want those let's make those the only audit mechanism let's never go to paper ballots and that's\nNot cool because you could duplicate messed with ballot images digitally and if you never connected them to their papers stores by some sort of percentage let's connect and seeing all these ballot images are really from their stores that would be a percentage audit for ... uh do both you can't just do it by device\nVeteran legislator then went ... and then the ... and then the third issue is uh to you know how vulnerable are our election systems and this would include are voting registration rolls\nTo hacking and we know that at least according to the FBI that the Russians have hacked into the into the voting systems and the a registration rolls of a you know ... states now and yet to enter and according to Trump the Chinese have done the same thing\nAnd yet there's some evidence that other countries as well have a Iran's specifically penetrated and North Korea penetrated our voting systems\nUm yeah so what's being down about all these things made me get\nA well to federal legislation sales because really our elected officials are scared to tell election offices what to do our elected officials so\nHere's my solution or and what I'm trying to message we each of us voters we have to protect their own votes so here's what I'm telling people to do go to your secretary of state sector registration in your registration check\nIf you're not if it's not right if anything's wrong or if you're not there call the number there or go down\nTo your office and makes you register don't depend on somebody canvassing you got to go down to the office and want to do it online soon because later they're going to go oh you weren't on the rolls cause you registered to lately were ... number two\nIf your registration shows that your vote by mail voter make sure that you get that vote by mail\nBallot and either voted and send it in early so it's been election night returns because anything coming into near to the election I Will be processed and will be an election night returns\nYou need to both about or if\nYou prefer to go to the polls you got to bring that ballot in and surrender it on voted or they won't give you a ballot because they'll assume you used it in your voting twice\nDaniel vote provisional don't get in the provisional batch it's banned in every state right and you need to be in the regular ballot that she got a check your registration no your vote by mail status\nTake care of either getting the damn ballot no I don't know I didn't get it and I want to vote they'll go ... going to vote provisional he's gotta make sure that you tell the office I haven't got my ballot and I want it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can threaten the authoritarian control through religion but why does and disparage they encounter federal physical evidence that I'm trying to get the new physiological and genetic determinants of human personality than behavior and my guess is that\nThen I approached social protest because of a ... minority can often abused because of a physical ... because they cannot change being black Semitic female gay et cetera but not the true cause of the days\nYou'd be caused by human base ... in every human group and ask exception just is counting found in every group so is parasitic incorrect PCs predation humans who had actually and deliberately harm other people\nSo personal and private game now the crux of the argument to say racism is not caused by race it is caused by predators using race at a rationalize station for that protection\nAnd the ironic thing is it's not linked to any specific characteristic behavior but predatory behavior does have specific physiological and possibly genetic determinants another with creditors are in effect projecting the biologic they kind of behavior onto his\nRace or gender does not determine and an end to Central Asia and my conclusion is\nDon't be afraid of physical truth if you are indeed a partner and protect a and not a predator the truth of the biological basically their behavior can only help you\nOkay very good of you you make a compelling argument of I Believe\nUm and probably one that deserves more than four minutes on the radio [laughter] and and so you know we'll have to circle back to it at some point in the future but thank you thank you for raising that I'm Mark in San Diego California a mark what's up\n[noise] a child I got a you know it's all wondering why we get in these situations where an audit or candidate Kavanaugh's they shut down our throw it against\nTheir will eat all our popular because the Koch brothers want him\nWell it's I think it's more a structural than that I think it's because the United states do that\nIs the way it is not all of a joy to start with the U.S Senate sure or do you have two senators from California represented almost forty million people\nYet not on it with less than a million people get through senators Iowa this ordinary people gets two senators that's why you have like Chuck Grassley and Mitch McConnell\nAlways happy that in a way against people these guys keep getting reelected and at the end they achieve seniority and you've got a Congress which is supposed to be more representative yet and yet it's gerrymandered so much that it does not and then you've got a guy sitting in the White House who lost three million votes\nSo that there is the United states government or that's why we get candidates and policies shut down our throats constantly that much of the country a lot\nYeah and most of the things that you've described originate in the debate over slavery they they are parts of the compromise and there were a series of them to Connecticut Compromise is probably the most famous one um that\nThat basically wanted to keep now in the textbooks you know particularly the ones that you read in the northern schools it's it was always about Delaware Rhode Island the small states but in fact the population in Georgia was about the same as as one of those to states I forget which one at the time of the of the\n... the writing in the constitution the white population in Georgia but the you know the black population Georgia was substantial and and so really the two senators per state\nAnd we you know was was based on on giving the slave states extra power as well as the small states up north and that you know that needs to be stripped out of the constitution or we need to come to a better understanding of that number one\nAnd then number two the electoral college was you know there for the exact same reason to give the small states slave states you know a large say so you know yeah spot on mark thanks for the call Tony in Huntsville, Alabama a Tony what's up\nHey Tom how're you doing today good a good a list and man a I called to talk about Joe Manchin is that his name's ... uh I don't\nAgree with the caller before me\nJoe Manchin is not a Democrat if you're a Democrat you believe in the Democrats you believe that they're going to elect you get air going to stand by you that they're going to fight for you get out knock on doors for you and then you get up there and use use state would stand with the Republicans\nOn the biggest issue of our time\nTo to to to overturn everything that the game they're Democrats and the progressive have fought for because you're afraid that they won't stand with you in a Republican state would then you shouldn't have your seat you can either use an with those people or you don't\nWell and that was my point is is the electorate knows that and and I just I I think the age\nOr on frankly on both sides you know the Republican side if you're not a full blown racist anti Semite white supremacy person the Republican Party doesn't why any more\nThan on the backside if you're not actually a progressive and concerned about bringing America back to the values the Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson males than you know you can't be a Democrat and perhaps that's a good thing Tony thank you for the call\n[noise] you're listening

Peterson on steroids although he's passed away\nUm that that the people will demand\nThat the Republicans prevail in destroying Social Security Medicare Medicaid food stamps long term unemployment insurance all these other ... social programs I Would say that they maintain a democracy society functioning society\nBut that ah people will demand that these programs be replaced or done away with because people don't want to be saddled with this enormous that now it's been a Republican talking point since Nineteen sixty\nBut you know they're still they're still doing that dance and and I think what he's doing his previewing Paul Ryan strategy after the election what do you think\nYeah no I think that's correct I think that's the logical thing for them to to have to do now that the pretense that they care about the deficit is exploded by their own decision [noise]\nI think that's what we can expect I think one more dimension that perhaps stocked with didn't talk about is that because of the crash of capitalism back in two thousand and eight of the decision that the Federal Reserve to drop interest rates virtually zero ten years seems\nEvery corporation let wanted some free money to borrow try something or I work ... ... every third world government that needed the money to survive as borrowed at these low interest rates and\nThey now have to pay the rising in the interest rates as the Federal Reserve jacks up the interest rates that puts ... like Argentina turkey Indonesia and a whole bunch of others in an impossible situation they tend not to carry an service the debt that they have accumulated\nAnd the result is those countries are plunging into the kind of messed you she already turkey and other countries and that too will play a role in disrupting global arrangements and so forth to pretend that this was all under control of Mr Trump and his environment\nIs so silly that it's kind of hard to take seriously but they're\nTrying to lead to act as though they're in charge of all of this and let the economy is healthy we have a debt written economy that is less sustainable and more fragile than I've ever seen in my life\n[noise] wow wow a a a grim reminder of the reality that\nHave been brought to us by Reaganomics to Santa Claus there is a\nProfessor ritual thanks so much for dropping by\nMy pleasure Tom and a good thing for you to have a great weekend is always good talking with you sir Richard Wolffe a democracy at work that info you can read him as\nWe'll be back with your caller and then it goes friday and just\nThis is the Tom are many program will be back in just a second it's coming up on sixteen minutes past the hour here on the Martin program prayer and only slightly on now [noise]\nIt's radio only smarter you rented Tom am there can you\nTell her as the highest and I've got the perfect formula to help and wind camera and he is ultra premium one can't purchases direct from boutique wineries no middleman and bottles and keeping his sources secret so he can pass the savings directly to you often forty eight percent less than you pay for the same wine at retail\nShipped right gear door if I Want to Kansas new six bottles sampler packed\nThe luxury mix sampler regularly Ninety five dollars is now anyone or the elegant red sampler regularly a hundred and one dollars has now just eighty five bucks Louis and I tried lot five sixty seven the Napa cabernet fantastic definitely a deep full body rich red wine just spectacular for a limited time\nIndia Fifteen Percent off one of the new radio mixed sampler packs plus free shipping go to C.

about um the study done by two political science professor skillings and page\nHow I speak about it frequently from Northwestern University that found that if you're not in the top what five percent of Americans are ten percent of Americans the probability of legislation being passed that reflects your desires your explosive desires is equivalent to random noise yes\nOh excellent I'm so glad to hear that you are aware of this study are\nWidely side at once a week I'm OK okay well I I listen maybe once a week from Audrey there you go guys but\nI'm so glad to hear you say that there was so much about the the benefit of voting\nBut uh the outcome of the average citizens are really only coincidental that was a causal issue a there is negligible relationship between what the average citizens want any legislative outcomes\nAnd so on and this is my testimony aware yeah this is a\nTestimonial to the power that money has over our electoral system since the Nineteen Seventy six Buckley decision where Lewis Powell on the Supreme Court said that I'm giving money to a political candidate is protected by the first amendment free speech provision something that prior to Nineteen Seventy six no government you know no president know and nobody had ever said\nAnd in fact we tightly regulated money in politics have been since the ... act in Nineteen oh seven\nAnd and uh you know now we've got we've got a billionaires basically owning the entire Republican Party and and and a chunk of their ... and the Democrats and the Democratic party as well and that's something that we all need to attend to crank well said thank you very much for the call Maine in Chicago I mean what's on your mind\nHow you doing now yeah uh I just wanted to say what I was the developing there's ...

little bit of good news and world of rather dim headlines I must say\nBut to recipients we haven't talked about them on the show before I think are just worth giving a brief bio about them one is

the Nobel Committee the Norwegian Nobel Committee chair today was asked in an interview and this really spark my attention to\nHow does this relate to the ongoing me too movement and she started by\nSaying the F. I mean they're related in so far as both\nUm are you know urging women to speak out more and that telling their stories is very important but she drew a distinction saying look sexual violence\nIs not the same as sort of um societal norms which made two aims to address that sexual violence needs to be talked about on the same page as the use of chemical weapons in war it is a war crime it is a type of psychological and emotional warfare and in the case of\nThe ... things like sexual violence rape were used almost as a way of cultural genocide right basically watering down a distinct\nGenetic pool I'm so that they use the lineage could not be passed on but in the process of answering this question I caught that the head of the Nobel Committee said look you know this is it you know these the sexual violence doesn't just affect\nWomen effects men and the one example she cited which is a cause for much embarrassment and shame for Americans will be for a long time was hey look men can be victims look at what happened up Alou gray prison\nIn Iraq I mean it really is a bad week for the U.S when we are spending international justice in the same breath as you know these campaigners for

talked about this yesterday and an Amazon worker sent me a note saying yeah everybody in the bottom got a pay raise I just got a pay cut and it was like really I'm\nI'm curious how much detail she went into because we're learning a little bit more as this progress as well we're we're now hearing these warehouse workers\nAre no longer going to get bonuses each month for their attendance or for extra productivity which amounted to hundreds of dollars a month on average the Associated Press reporting this may people may be losing about three thousand dollars a year because of these last benefits and one that really caught my attention\nAmazon has this continuing its stock reward program for a long time employees and that's really important because the Amazon you know share prices now about\nAlmost Nineteen hundred dollars a share and when you started employment and his warehouse jobs apparently\nAnd this will be good to have you're a listener follow up of employee would get one to two shares that's not a ... you know in significant amount of money and then one extra share per year someone in the AP articles saying how was an employee even making Fifteen dollars an hour and we're going to save up to buy Nineteen hundred dollar two thousand dollars\nA share stock so again or maybe not a huge impact on new hires but they do seem to be sort of spinning this economic mold over you know not rewarding longevity and loyalty to\nCall and won't have to wonder if if when they start having a decline in longevity and loyalty and a decline of productivity because they're no longer rewarding it um to what extent will they say a year from now well gee look at us our productivity is down our Turner of ours up we never should have given that pay raise we're going to go back to minimum wage\nThat would be extraordinarily cynical I Hope we don't see that and I will to Amazon grade say they were not at minimum wage to begin with a ... or so I Will you know I find it telling the way Amazon sort of corporate spokespeople have been spinning today saying look this is a great thing we're giving our employees\nMore copies making compensation quote more immediate and predictable which to me read that hey we're going to give everyone\nYou know one Eminem now as opposed to tomorrow you know it's like they're they're buying into people's instincts to take a little

listening to us down there in Texas a Michael in Caldwell New Jersey a Michael you wanted to talk about judicial review hey\nTom let's an eye on in your book that crashed it quite big team you said there were three way under the engine night decision I'm referring to the second one the second I'm calling your words here to second it's for the American people the president and Congress ... understand the consequences of Citizens United and break with the court\nAnd you mentioned Dred Scott decision pack the free amendments pass legislation choir find the right\nAnd a war um can you explain to me how would that work in the case it ... I did\n[noise] I'd have to go back and read that paragraph Michael to to know exactly what I was thinking about what I can tell you is that uh both Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln set the precedent a three times between the two of them of ignoring Supreme Court decisions and no tape and\nThe ... some people can ignore it and you can say basically Supreme Court got it wrong and you could like ... wage a campaign against the court by saying concerted got it all wrong and maybe like\nThat is what Jackson Lincoln did but but you know in in the case we had her Jackson there were two to a Supreme Court decisions that he ignored\nOr the first time to do with the second national bank the court ruled that it was just fine to have the bank Jackson shut down anyway and claiming that it was unconstitutional and the ... the second was the trail of tears the court ruled that the the the relocation of Indians was illegal and Jackson did that anywhere initiated that I was finished during the president who followed him\nUm in case of Abraham Lincoln was Dred Scott it was the Eighteen fifty six origin or fifty seven decision that said that that uh African Americans could never become citizens of the United states and you know Lincoln overtly ignored that\nAnd then you know with the Emancipation Proclamation he went even a lot farther than that and fought a war over frankly I'm route or\nWhat but hate being regard to unite and you just say eat do you do an article ... section two ... said the Supreme Court wasn't at stake in in large\nWell that's my recollection of one way or ... when I wrote the book is that that was the argument that I was making his that article ... section two gives Congress the power to regulate the Supreme Court and Congress can simply pass a law saying you know we are passing term limits or excuse me we are passing a fight campaign finance reform\nAnd the Supreme Court may not\nRule on this case and he was simply embedded that's called court stripping new embed that into the legislation it's been done in a few cases it's very controversial um\n... ... ... you think the Democrats will start doing that you're black power the Supreme Court where do you think they may be may take additional action that may cause chief justice Roberts\nTo focus more judicial restraint instead of judicial activism because I'm quite certain that even the threat of patting additional ... would scare their body itself\nI Would think so that's what happened in Nineteen thirty seven I I don't I I think in the current environment there's you know the court basically has nothing to worry about but because they've got a Republican president and and the and Congress's in the hands of the Republicans\nBut by twenty twenty if if the Democrats have achieved a super majority in the house in the Senate and they can recapture the White House\nAnd if Donald Trump and the Republican Party has been discredited and the easiest way to do that the thing that most people pay attention to is not sex scandals it's crashing economy and you know that that ah when that's going to happen is the big question not if\nBut if that was the case and this court with Kavanaugh or Amy Coney Bryant or whoever\nYou know a Trump ends up putting on this court if the court starts handing down these these locker era kind of decisions where they say child labor laws are on constitutional right to re right to unionize laws are unconstitutional the Medicare and Social Security are unconstitutional\nUm you know government support and housing is unconstitutional these are all\nDecisions that the Supreme Court in the past has made they have said they have said exactly what I just said\nAnd Nineteen thirty seven for and Franklin Roosevelt scare the hell out of them by threatening to pack the court and suddenly a you know one justice in particular ironically his name was Roberts started changing his votes and and going along\nThe extra pressure is necessary\nYeah well this will be losers pure political pressure\nOver Arlen just maybe you could just add to the pet when they go\nThere's a couple of there's a couple of ways to pull it off and want us to record stripping legislation another windy through an amendment to the constitution which is what move to amend the America that or are working on\nThe other question is is to learn and the final want us to
