really think we should start with the reforms in the California prison system or whatever but it seems like you guys are out on this let's start with the the news from NPR\nOur where California is going to be the first states require publicly traded companies to have at least one woman on their board of directors the law signed by governor Jerry Brown yesterday sees me Sunday\nEvery time somebody says ... governor Jerry Brown all I can do is I have dead Kennedys lyric that just fly through my head\nYou got to understand what I was in high school reference there yeah well I'm jello be off for the lead singer of the group the dead Kennedys have you heard the left ear I Am I Am I ringing and he does your ... for a company is hardly a new is actually quite funny\nJello well yeah yeah Jo as a heck of a performer there's no doubt these days the socialist but he's a he's a heck of it wasn't he in the Green Party at one point wouldn't doubt it sure\nEither way um he parades the then governor Jerry Brown which has the same guy thirty something forty years right Jerry Brown is distinctive and that he was the youngest and the oldest\nUm wow governors of um California and I don't know why he's able to serve twice there's some kind of rules I looked you do your own research on Jerry Brown and what what makes them special but just you don't jello Biafra complaining about what was a very progressive governor\nI'm wasn't progressive enough for jello piano right like this is this is this is why I say the left can't win because it eats itself is he a Democrat Jerry Brown\nYeah okay so he signed it will I Will tell you know Green Party member became elected governor of California\nHas that right or he signed ... well I mean California's had Republican governors who could also be described as progressive I'm sure a Donald Schwarzenegger was you know are not exactly\nThere was a ... or so\nGary uh Jerry Brown signed this Sunday recalling public companies whose principal executive officers are located in California to comply by the end of twenty Nineteen time to get new executive officer of the minimum is two female directors if the company has five directors on its board or three women if it has seven directors\nOr the close of twenty Twenty one wow\nDo you really think that a company would move its officers over this particular regulation I mean there's a lot of regulations that would cause the company to move their offices but\nWith the no I don't think much more likely is that somehow these companies are going to get together and or or lobby and\nCreate a board position that isn't tire Lee meaningless that's what it is\nYeah um after you started asking me questions I I started running through my head what would you mark what what'd you do is they go to wherever they thought about this I mean they I haven't read it I haven't\nRead the text but they've really what's gonna happen the feminist don't care about the power they care about the the position and the money are you kidding no they've thought about this I guarantee you in this in a law\nIt's going to say something like it has to be voting position you can't just create some sort of advisory board position oh you can be the secretary suite\nYou're always thinking of how effective these people are making laws that this law is going to be step one step one year after year this board okay then they're going to create a board useful sport position then they go through making another law to say that the position has to be a voting position then you know\nLike I always kinda mouse with these they could also vet somebody to be a rubber stamp right I mean you know you don't want somebody who's an outlier in an a thinker and these board positions you want somebody who's got a rubber stamp the people that make the real\nDecisions whatever that might be I'm not saying that this couldn't be a great boon as I hear and I don't know if it's true or not but I hear the diversity makes the company's stronger but ultimately\nWill work against what it's trying to do so yeah the law as well or rubber stamping thing like they'll give somebody ... position and then make sure that it's like one of these things where it's like if\nYou don't play it so it's going to be the exact opposite of diversity and inclusiveness and giving women you know more power and inequality in companies know instead what's going to do is it's going to increase\nInequality by making it by forcing people to do this they're going to have to somehow protect themselves against\nThis sort of in in ... right because it's not based on merit that's the problem is the worst thing to put people into these decisions than it has absolutely nothing to do with merit\nRight so what's going to happen is is they're gonna they're gonna give you the position and if you cause any ah any waves sweetie you're out of there yeah man off you will find somebody and then they'll find something to X chromosomes little rubber stamp our stuff\nAnd then they'll make more laws to bring more aggression and keep going in so it goes on and on and they'll just keep making more and more draconian laws to try and force people to be a what their view of it is a of um you know virtuous\nSo I Wonder what this is going to do on the level of how these board of directors are elected according to the the law which\nI have pulled up here uh it does talk about how these corporations have directors who are elected by shareholder votes so does that mean that your\nBoard of directors if there's nobody who wants to run as a woman if there's no candidate who's willing to step up who's a woman does that completely freeze a what this corporation is able to do or they unable to move forward that this is what happens in mind that one new regulations that ... on the board which I'm are coming up\nAnd not to mention is shutting I went back in the car that three times a week credit scratching all night

E. D. that is a definitely assume that this particular case yet is not the most exciting thing although every now and then every now and then it can kind of get a little interesting\nAh but ah and I and then by the way I saying this as we just actually had our new elections today and a treasure TV which is the local cable access channel you're in Chester county New Hampshire and I've been serving on for most of the last twelve years I think to two years off\nIn there when the government was trying to throw him in a jail so\nUm the state government but anyway for civil disobedience but\nToday we we did actually bring a woman on board that gesture TV it had nothing to do with any kind of mandate because we're not in California\nIt had to do with the fact that there was a woman who want to get on the board and if somebody wants to get on the board that's usually all it takes you know like my God welcome come on and uh we we will be happy to have you because it's hard to find people for these positions now I don't know how many of these I don't know anything about the corporate world I mean I worked at\nA Clear Channel years ago but I I mean I don't know how the the boards of these things work\nDo boards on corporations typically get a paycheck or are they frequently volunteer a positions\nI Would presume they get paychecks I Would I Would presume so as well considering the for profit companies are which is different than the boards that I've I've sat on a minute on usually on a nonprofit\nSo we're going to talk more about California mandating women being on boards to the point of not quite a majority but a you know a sizeable uh you know chunk of the board talking about two out of five three out of seven\nI was with the mandates are going to be here in this law was passed on Sunday a signed by the governor we can continue at the end Johnson and mark here in the studio but I Do want you to know that\nBlink is an excellent home security solution for you you care about your family you care about your property you ought to have something to protect it especially while you're not there\nAnd a blink of security can do that for you and can do a very affordably with no contracts and know subscriptions which is one of the best parts about it a beyond the fact that the hardware super easy to install you want to talk about easy it doesn't get any easier than is that I could at least imagine\nYou've got wireless cameras you put the cameras up wherever you want them you plug in one wire which is the hub\nAnd then it's all set up your wife find it\nWe'll device and you're good to go within moments you've got an operational system that will send you clips of what's going on or whenever you want it to be watching it's really nice and you can get it for yourself and get Fifteen Percent off\nOver it blinked protect dot com slash STO that's blink protect dot com slash F T L like slash ... flash F.

Big Love you're on TALK last\nEvening gentlemen I Want to talk about that a diversity of California and yeah it is I think\nIt can actually be used as liberal it's to explode about alright yeah\nIf you have a director's five is to have to be females are act two guys working walk in and say\nI\nWatch it explode yeah exactly and that was actually where we were going to go with your next because I was going to read for you the definition of female here from the law itself quote female means an individual who self identifies her gender as a woman without regard to the individual designated sex at birth\nOh boy\nOh what you're pointing out here is that liberals on one hand will claim they support transgender and trans or you know rights but then on the other hand if the people who are the current you know\nNails on ... biological males on the board decide they want to go female in order to keep their seats on the board\nOr or because all of a sudden they've had this revelation that they are now or a woman\nThat there's some people on the left who would say well they must be supported but others on the left will say hell no these aren't real women and these are skills that have already happened in certain areas I've definitely seen stories about people on the left or having infighting over these very issues\nBut how how would it be for liberal don't want to or because they don't leave their gender identity and by that would be a sort of latched on it [noise]\nYeah that's exactly where we were going to go next so thank you for that and yeah All right thanks for the call Big Love appreciate it so it's not like this has never come up before I mean I can tell you that women on boards are trends on boards or what no\nI'm feminists being upset about trends yet women yeah this is you know this is one of the big fights that are that's going on there is half generally trans people identify as leftist or liberal\nAnd probably for relatively good reason um they're probably not going to find a lot of uh you know in the United states a trans people are probably not going to find a lot of loving uh hugs and the Republican Party out but not yeah so I see why there I'm addicted to\nThose Republicans are probably repressing their sexuality and they're actually really wanting to be a trans themselves but they just can't where'd you\nGet ready so I tell you the truth [laughter] oh I'm so but at the same time it's true of some of the ... the feminists look ... you know what I wouldn't some is like the ones who yelled the loudest about more than two of the ones I live in a country of three hundred million people I agree with you\nUm however the feminist also done if I as a Democrat largely I don't know exactly why but they do women largely um you know not largely but are you know percentage wise more likely to vote Democrat\nAnd this is a problem right like where we're at the at this point this is the the crux of the point all some guy has to do is say the allies self identify as a woman now now I Know\nI'm not going to wear any different clothing no I'm not sure if you were to force him to wear a different clothing and that would violate his you know freedom to express himself\nI'm just an incredibly successful amen and I'd say I'm grateful that we're we get to be a part of it we get to be basically the exclusive broadcast a partner there I mean there's a few other podcasts that are there but I don't think there's any of that I ... yeah it's great uh ... dot com used code S T L like free talk lives we continue we're going to the discord on\nAir call in line have been talking about corporate boards that are going to be forced in the state of California they have women on them a but a gene that Christian anarchist is with us here go ahead Jean\nHey guys like a change gears a little bit IRS you're going to talk about Trump since he's literally five miles away from my house right now really what's he doing visiting\nYeah he's a here in northern Mississippi during a speech you know for somebody who shouldn't be a ... or they shouldn't be elected to office of course but\nAnyway um\nI noticed today that there was an announcement made about how he's going to make bump stocks illegal so he's been working on it for a year\nAnd so now he wants to make bump stocks illegal since it's the one year anniversary of that shooting shooting Vegas yeah\nSo all these you know a\nMake America great again people that have been supporting Trump but they're starting to see what kind of guy he really is but really I don't\nWell I don't think they're going to see it yet but uh it's pretty obvious now with his attack on bump stocks is not going to end their you know he'll he'll up from there it'll start with bump stocks\nAs actually getting the wrong kind of feedback he's the kind that react negatively to sort of wrong kind a wrong kind of feedback and I'm so we'll we'll see where it goes from there yeah\nBut he's one of these should from the hip guys that wants to just do everything himself he doesn't want to follow any prospect\nOf bumps dog does make it easier shooting from a hip just wants to end it does\nActually so does a belt loop you can use the belt loop as your as your bump fire device so maybe they are going to make bumped a belt loops illegal to\nWhen I had a a an AK forty seven or ... you all you had to do is just pushed the going forward as you held your finger a steady on the you know in the trigger guard decided to do is just like with your left hand holding the talk of the gun just push it forward\nAnd then it just hires and fires and fires and fires you don't have to do anything you don't have to have a fancy piece of equipment or anything like that\nAnd I and I like to talk about the Nineteen sixty eight gun control act every time I talked to people about\nGun control and and young confiscation for instance I always bring up the sixty a gun control act because the sixty eight gun control act is a gun confiscation act\nBecause they confiscate the guns from all people who have ever been convicted of a felony ...\nPeople say well we're never going to the gun confiscation in this country baloney we've been seeing it already ... ... you know start it started in sixty eight and they're just they just let it roll off their backs like they don't even hear it\nBe here though oh they'll confiscate guns and a lot of places just based on accusation if you're facing criminal charges of certain types they will just confiscate your guns\n... violence there is one of them or if you're going to write out but\nYou know I I point the people I point people to that six gun control act because how many people now have felony records and are not able to own a weapon it's settled\nOn him by the way legally what's worth pointing out here gene is is that it's legal for felons to own weapons just not firearms as they are defined by the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and firearms right um so they could have leaves out black powder\nRight so black powder probably yeah you can have black powder and there are certain rules are surrounded and all that kinda thing but if it if outlawing felons having guns prevents crime then it should stand to reason that felons would commit crimes with the weapons that they are legally allowed to have right\nRight well yeah well ... but they don't do that felons commit crime to gun with guns with the weapons that they are not legally allowed to have right but if the law did anything\nBesides were snatched the out of the hands of law abiding convicted felons people who are getting out and living a better life if it did anything um if if all it did was that you obviously want to get rid of that right like you want people to be able to enter society you want them to be able to protect their families you want all these things because you believe in guns\nHowever if I can see why people have the fear I mean for me I wouldn't just hand a case to people as they walked out of the the prison I get it um but we can look at statistics and we can see how many felons Rob liquor stores with rape years\nAnd we will see that the numbers vanishing Lee rare yeah right how many do was black powder or you know maybe pistols bits vanishing Lee rare\nAll these liquor store robberies are going on with weapons that felons are not legally allowed to have 'em when they're rubbing liquor stores I presume that that's\nThat's just a the fantasy I'm putting together here so clearly the law that outlaws felons having guns is failing all of us and should be repealed immediately\nOf course you're preaching to the choir here but I'm the I'll tell you exactly what's going to happen with this I'm\nMaking bump stocks illegal mhm bump stocks were a workaround for people to have rapid fire weapons right now since they're going to make that illegal that means that it'll be the same penalty as if you had a machine gun so what that's going to do is people are just going to\nBe more readily are converting their weapons to fully automatic fire\nI used what you're saying is that ... thing right if the penalties the same and you're willing to flower the law that just go all in and get a straight up automatic weapon\nThat's right right why not I mean I remember going to the gun shows Twenty years ago where you could buy a

just that it's um I mean I suppose you could interpret it that way if that's what you want to do but if if I take her elevator ride with a woman alone and I understand that Ron Paul doesn't do this either and she says\n... happened between floor one floor Fifteen then what am I going to say to say that no it didn't\nIf there is no security footage then he said he said she said\nRight and we can

think the cabinet situation is deteriorating for old Brett but nonetheless we can see what happened and just looking at the nation's attitude a week ago\nYeah I just think that this is also

rape\nAnd not that that was impossible in the past it's just that now with and it's even ... seemed like even worse than the than it was in the past rape you have to ... accusations are so hot right now with uh the way the Internet is it's a lot easier to get the word out\nAnd get people all riled up about some just simply an accusation\nWithout any real evidence beyond somebody saying something happened and\nI don't believe for a moment that women or men or any more or less trustworthy than any one or the other so each case needs to be taken on its merits and\nA lot of these cases there's no evidence so what are the merits is just two people saying\nThat are different and I find it real hard to ... skew it clearly an abuser is going to lie and deny it wrecked but the problem is is determining whether an individual who is being accused is in fact in abuser or just somebody who is being accused of something which would make the other\nAbuser because they're lying and trying to put that person in danger\nAnd obviously when somebody's ascending to one of the nine most powerful seats in the world and I will argue the Supreme Court or at least the Supreme Court rulings are more powerful than the executive branch making at the very you know one of the most powerful seats in the world\nUm you know one if somebody's ascending to that and you don't want them there for a lifetime sure some brave liberals soul mate might very well say I'm the one who has to take the bullet here and make the accusation whether it's true or not I'm not saying that's what's forwards\nDone I'm just saying that some women would be brave enough to do that [noise]\n[noise] right so now we're here with a Johnson you had a related story you just happen to pull up during the break\nI'm just mentioning all the political candidates nowadays because you know there's so much ... in the uh you know political arena and uh I just this\nIs still an effort that you have an old as I say from Nineteen Seventy two ... you know that's a long time ago in a\nIn a way to actually more recent than what's going on with cabin on right\nNow that Kevin O's early eighties yeah probably literally angels to Seventy two so that we don't know exactly yeah um I'd have to look but it's eighty to eighty three yeah okay well this is so Bernie ... have changed his opinion since then you're nuts nonetheless I see so Bernie Sanders wrote an essay\nWhat was it for um there was for an article a for a a Vermont Freeman so magazine and alternative newspaper news turn it on your paper and they are called what man and woman well apparently standard newspaper okay you know he was a radical hum\nSo there was a commentary on gender roles and it's caused the stars you know this article here points out it's bound to happen anytime a candidate mentions rape\nWell\nWhat has banned Bernie Sanders rate and say about rape\nWells the essay to buy the Vermont senator who officially kicked off his presidential campaign this is a you know right in the beginning of when he did so\nUm this was Nineteen Seventy two you said about that is when the articles written yet so Bernie was born in Nineteen forty one which would have made him thirty one and the other time actually I Believe he was thirty two I've heard all kinds of ... thereabouts yep [noise]\nSo uh here's the ah the says warning the about rape comes to the very beginning so\nAnd this was I'm Sorry I was a decade before he became the thirty some mailer mayor of Burlington so ah I don't know what if any political career he had had it at this point to some radical them yeah\nYeah so this um it it says here there's been about rape comes at the very beginnings and does ah does have some not totally safe for work language so it says a\n... a man goes home and master places technical fair to see a woman on the news a woman tied up a woman abused\nOkay so we're already getting a look into the ... of a Bernie Sanders sexual fantasies right because I\nWrite I I you know all I hear when I hear this is this must be Bernie Sanders fantasy consider outlined yes mining alludes to the floor covered in money\nOkay a woman at Joyce intercourse with men as she fantasize is being raped by three men simultaneously [laughter]\n\nWhich is he saying that what he believes the typical male female fantasy\nWhen he says the man's male fantasy the bad and women get dressed up on Sunday and go to church or maybe to a revolutionary political meeting [noise] have you on the looked at the stack demand hero tough magazines on the shelf of your local bookstore\nI don't even know what a stack magnifying hero magazine [laughter]\nIt's like a part of what you know it's a point on dirty dirty dirty stories I okay stories got sent to you know why the newspaper with the articles like\nGirl twelve raped by fourteen ... oh my God I [laughter] so why are they appeal like\nHorror [laughter] wow isn't right [noise] yeah\nIn an interview with CNN adding to it in no way reflects his views or record on women yeah\nIt wasn't that added to attack gender stereotypes of this seventies but it looks stupid today as it looks as stupid today as it was then wow yeah\nWell I look people can change I think that's certainly the case but do they really I mean as far as their sexual fantasies are concerned is it likely that Bernie Sanders at age thirty or thirty one or thirty two when he wrote this essay\nHas really changed his sexual interest in the last however many damn years on hold out now and I think\nYou're jumping to conclusions here you're presuming that he's projecting an I ... I get I I get the point you're making but you're just presuming I don't know maybe you know the Bernie Sanders wrote this we know that for sure and it's really funny is especially willy Johnson reads at the end the Bernie Sanders acted\nAs one little commuting thing you know they go to church or or they're radical political meeting and then his comment about one of the appealing to us\nImplies that he's projecting oh yeah it certainly looks that way also\nIt's really interesting that he is a multiple times in this uh says things like girl twelve raped by fourteen men so uh why does those cells so well to what it is us are they appealing and another time in this\nArea that doesn't sound like dark not tire or none of our downs like satire\nAnd another line later in the U.S and we found the whole thing you said you have to leave before you ever saw me even though I was not your father or your teacher or your sex broaden when you was Thirteen\nYears old or your husband you hated me why am I what I was to you because I Am a man like\nThirteen year old sex friend okay you know like I guess this was what Bernie's going yeah\nI got to say um you know as a as a while but I never had a six year old\nI don't really like just like I think this lead he says oh you did not deal with me as a person as me you live a lie with me used to play games with me and that's a good thing to do\nSomething a little bitter about something I hear more about it but um you know it's one of my ... I mean maybe it's because we haven't read this thing continuously yeah she is going on\nAs a response and she said you wanted me not as a woman or a lover or a friend but as a submissive woman or a submissive friend or a submissive lover\nAnd rice where my head is I Walk and even the slightest suspicion of that kind of command and he said your full of blank and the ages of ...\nAnd again made love together which they both like to do more than anything on never ever saw each other what more\nPower this is some sort of fictional couple that he's going back and forth yeah\nYeah that's yeah I think that it's just bad best considered\nA terrible attempt to the story\nBut I I think it's like a letter and he when he was insane then as he is [laughter] it's really weird\nTo me I mean here's the weird thing so let me just make a logical ... that I I tell right but ah it to me it's very consistent with the um ... D humanizing power fantasies that people who believe in collective is ideologies\nAre I guess\nProne to let's say you're saying this fits his\nPolitical beliefs so sure I think\nA political beliefs as the system and\nIt's you know I mean maybe it's because I've read too much either ... or something like that but a political philosophies that tend to be collected missed our anti life\nRight there with flowers out of whatever his internal process even leave\nThat in in you know hell ours the wrong word well yeah but if you gross whatever springs sports you know people who um [noise] believe in controlling others uh and using power and exerting dominant force over a piece a peaceful people who don't harm others um\nThey would do it on a individual level just as they want to see happen on a national or international scale\nYeah they're they're not uh you know the fact that someone is there a romantic partner or family or whatever doesn't really I I don't think come into play that much\nI don't know it's all weird well it's just weird all we may not Anders isn't talking I imagine about those hits hard for me not to say that this is some kind of projection um you know it's clear that's a that's what we're talking about here I Am all the really hated her like clear yeah\nIt seems clear to me it's clear that eater but I heard that are saying that I'm Brett Kavanaugh as the serial rapist that he's a serial rapist to did Brett Kavanaugh rape fantasies no but we got a little bit more evidence for Bernie Sanders coming and making accusations about him\nDo for a number tonight eight fifty five four fifty free that's eight five five four or five zero three seven three three mind you I Would say the same thing if this were a Republican who was writing the uh the same words here I mean we wouldn't have as good of an impression uh because you know what a Republican sound like\nBut either way not similar Republican I mean but but it would still be the exact same thing that I've said in the same way that we've seen or the Republicans whenever you know one of them gets caught trying to take the pants down on one of the congressional aides in the bathroom or something like that\nTurns out that's always the same Republican who's been going just crazy trying to you know make homosexuality illegal or something like yeah I'm so it's almost always these people who speak the loudest about you know prohibiting these things obviously but he's not talking about prohibition so it's a bit of a different story\nBut he is still reaching into the ... of his mind or you know maybe not that deep\nA and you're putting this on paper it's coming from somewhere yeah it's the people who want some greater power than themselves to stop them from their perverted proclivities\nThey the ones that don't believe they can do it on their own ... they'd be more of that law they want that greater power to come in and stop them that's why\nYou find so many smokers that want to find anti smoking ... anti smoking laws well maybe that'll stop me it won't\nThat's why you'll find the politicians that want to stop this perversion or that perversion are deviant or whatever terminology you want to use for whatever sexual activity there might be the libertarian says you're free\nTo do what you want\nWith another adult so long as you don't negotiate force as long as you don't do something that they don't want especially ... and you can't do it first and you can do whatever you want we don't get we just say\nFine have at it you you want to have weeded perverted sexual fantasies where you live in a decent attempt but that was about if you're not channels and that's ... yeah a\nPennsylvania state police were going to get into this story coming up here because talking about politicians want to stop people from doing things uh because they are protecting\nThe Pennsylvania state police basically came [noise]\nDarn close to the ground with a helicopter over top of a a very large tailgate party at Penn State presumably because the cops themselves were jealous they weren't down their party and\nThe toll free number here's a fifty five four fifty free so they got mad and put some people's lives in danger will are going to come up here in our number three coming up on free talk live\nFolks this is very important information what's to be said about CBD\nAre CBD is made from him and has a point zero zero three T.

the drafts coming down a friendly place anybody who's ever seen one of the helicopters land up close you know if their land and unlike a dusty or ... or something it's just you know huge amounts of dust gets blown up\nUm you know they're always telling you to duck when you get out of the helicopter and that kind of thing the blades are very very powerful and they're literally throwing\nRemember these uh canopies their pieces of metal large pieces of metal with a canopy tent over ... uh no they're not ... have you ever ... one of these things up\nYeah yeah you can pick it up by yourself but it isn't necessarily easy and you usually need at least two people to easily set one of these things if the if it's attached to the uh the ... the ... parts attached to it physically attached to it rather than set on it but it just turns into a kite\nCaress and it it took these things got\nSo many ads and one of these things swinging that leg right because it's gonna it's gonna go sideways right it had a fall over and start to take off so ... that the metal legs swinging and ... some of the Moscow\nOh yeah there's a leg or whatever thing goes flying\nIn this video one of these tents just goes I mean maybe they didn't have it batten down a particularly well because it doesn't happen to all of them but regardless this was obviously their intention\nThey went down on this crowd in this way with this helicopter to destroy people's property to punish them in the moment for not doing what this sensibly told them to do\n[noise] and there's all kinds of debris is getting blown up here and then Johnson there's something that happens a toward the end of this video with one of the pieces of debris it makes its way up to the helicopter\nBlade and it's just sort of floating in the updraft that's that's coming at the helicopters approaching this piece of debris that sort of just floating it goes up into the blade and immediately straight down shoots\nDownload shoots integrate very high velocity\nNow I don't know what this thing was you know it's not clear it might have been a big plastic bag for all we know but either way if it was something else and it's hard to say this could have harmed somebody very significantly at the the rate at which this thing is just brought straight down by the full force\nOf or whatever the blast of I don't know that you know I don't know what the how you measure the helicopter\nBlade I sure yeah that you know is suspending the entire weight of\nThe hurricane force winds or something you know I mean I don't know how fast it goes compared to a hurricane but I bet it's pretty darn\nClose you know I don't know how long after ways but it's got to be at least a half a ton and right I mean\nSo they just that it really flips this degree right\nDown onto the crowd flipping over tense I mean\nYeah I Would recommend during the break\nYou go into the back room here where we have one of these ten by ten or can it be tense it's an easy up brand sure go ahead and come on and on now half one of those things ... those are not lights right you get hit by this you're hurting this is like standing out in a you know they say that like in Florida you're supposed to put\nYou know it was rather hurricane you're supposed to batten down your windows because uh like chairs in lawn chairs and stuff can get whipped around in these this is actually what we're talking about I just watched the video\nSo I just did a Google Search for how much does a helicopter way well ironically the result that just came up was\nHelicopter are forty four police helicopter ... horsepower de rated to two hundred and forty five or ... for takeoff and the two hundred and forty five ... continuous\nMaximum grass wait twenty five hundred pounds they got to keep that thing and so that's over ... over us on the approximate empty weight including oil standard avionics and standard police backing so\nNo equipment at all in this thing it would still be one thousand six hundred and thirty eight pounds standard fuel a hundred and Seventy seven pounds of fuel and this is\nFor that standard police helicopter now you think about that\nThis means that the air force is got to be enough care to keep right two thousand five hundred pounds\nA loss right well that's just a lot of lift it up work at a relatively quiet yeah ... yeah\n[noise] so there is a little bit more here ah to the story from a from a from the folks over at the free thought project this is from state college dot coms report Penn staring at Penn State parent and tailgate or Scott Olsen said early Saturday morning police officer asked the fraternity tailgating next to his group to move one space over\nOne space\nAfter the fraternities members refused to move the officer told Olsen

I did not know this this word it seems ... party\nSo they're having their ... at one o'clock in the afternoon cops come in and break up the party\nThe ... the ... or more than one of them and then what happened\nThey have at night 'cause I like but you know that\nTo give any word that's the you know relates to nighttime the because ... pi\nYeah so the cops come in the evening they break up the the ... the the ... and after pit night the drunken college students at this point\nWhile they have to go somewhere so they leave where they were which was at the party having fun in a backyard or whatever packed in like sardines as they are wanting to do sometimes and now they're drunk\nAnd they're roaming the streets so instead of being drunk hanging out in somebody's backyard just drinking with their friends and doing whatever it is that they do plan beer pong or whatever now there are just roaming about looking and they're angry\nThey're angry because they just got thrown out of their party and they can't go to any other party because the cops are going to break that up to let's not forget the drunken ... drunk in part yeah and their waste it at one o'clock in the afternoon\nWell they still have plenty of beer so just keep on down and the beers walking around and then start destroying things because the cops are going to keep they keep cracking down\nThe cops continue they came in with a ... bullets or they came in with the other you know devices that they could you know try to what they believe control people and ultimately they just essentially set off a hornet's nest is what they did similarly here in uh Penn State's\nAccording to the police they are going to review their use of the helicopter at the game\nApparently the Federal Aviation administration is also investigating the and that I'd like to see review something here but again even if the FAA comes back in and says you did wrong that's not going to mean anything besides maybe the loss of a license from the you know the helicopter pilot rides there's not going to be any time they\nCould probably take the uh the license to own and they could probably tell the police department for the state of Pennsylvania yeah you don't get to keep this helicopter here in the spot and yet that's going to happen it could\nDo without very likely Penn State police and said please set in separate statements the helicopter was just deployed as a last resort after a tailgate of several hundred people became unruly and failed to disperse\nAfter verbal commands now remember the guy the parrot Scott Olsen who was next door in the tailgate to these supposed unruly bunch right he said they didn't have any problem with them and everything was fine\nSo the police wanted to come in\nCause a problem here in the first place so they would have an excuse to come in with greater violence and to use violence against these college students because for whatever reason they just hate it when people are having a good time by the way\nHere's a little bit of detail from the ... that you don't get in the initial story about this but has come out now the very end of this piece\nBefore the party was broken up undercover liquor enforcement officers made a purchase to obtain alcohol at the tailgate according to police criminal charges for selling alcohol without a license and furnishing alcohol to a minor are pending police seized two hundred dollars\nFor thirty packs of beer and ate handles of alcohol what's a handle a handles the type of a like a bottle of liquor isn't it\nI don't know if they ever heard the term before I have heard this before but I'm not a alcohol versed enough to tell you how many ounces or or in a handle if you want to look it up I bench in the Internet I Would give you the answer relatively quickly on that but isn't that interesting\nTurns out the police were the ones who caused the problem in the first place by going in and doing an undercover by at a tailgate party that is what started the all of this I understand the liquor decks aren't the state police so yes they are actually the the liquor\nAddicts are the state police so that's what they call unless Pennsylvania's different from New Hampshire their state police here\nIf it's so that they're just in the division right you know here here in New Hampshire and I presume it's this way around the

moved they haven't um I Know we got from the post office who his shirt is that the people have not moved\nIt another a blackout and guess what not coincidentally Brian Kemp the purge in general um Georgia is also running for governor\nNow he removed one in ten and voters Georgia voters from the rolls do I have this right in twenty Seventeen\nYeah in in a single year one in ten voters of Georgia and I'm not counting the dead or those are in jail I think one in Penn Live Georgia voters removed from the voter rolls\nA cock Khamenei reasons or he is running against Stacey Abrams who's elected be the first black female governor in American history\nAnd uh the polls are looking grim for Bryan it's really neck and neck but um he's in trouble and I guess he thinks that the only way I I tried to ask you\nI Try to meet with him I said I'd rather not sue him I'd rather talk to him and get information from him but I did tell him uh so I went to a ... when he wants to talk to him or\nThey went to a um to barbeque joint you could smell the pigs I didn't know where they're inside or outside Kansas bus showed up and I try to talk to 'em the would be governor Brian Kemp about the purges\nAnd about avoiding filing a federal lawsuit against him to get the information that is required by the national voter registration act so you know if he doesn't want to be a lawbreaker I said just talk to me at a there's a clip a we have of of his reaction\nHere it is this country has going back ... years or racism admitted people don't want to talk about it is a threat to talk\nIt we have the ... it was an attack upon those are all of this attack the poor people they do for people to be a part\nThe process that the games that this country's too rich to have\nPuffy within it and they all said the government is the enemy\nIs clear is that what the government is doing it has not friendly to people don't look at the pole vault I'm not afraid to say so you can pop the norm most that's fine we got the facts but like ... say he's not the\nHe's not if they all see we fought and died\nOkay that was the wrong clip Greg so allies with well let me\nSay who they let me tell you that was so that was Dr Charles Steele he's president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference he the successor to Dr Martin Luther king in in that post and as he said we have died and he's talking about his successors who were gunned down\nAnd uh for the right to vote in Georgia and he is my hope plaintiff against Brian Kemp\nThe um well white secretary of state maybe secretary of state for white people Georgia and a um we can so he is explaining why he is filing the suit to explain that to Georgia press yesterday\nUm and now the next clip is ah so I went to bring him and it with the idea that if he would turn over the information to me willingly\nWe wouldn't drag is behind into a federal court and I want to know if this is a racial perch so I think that this next clip is a is like I say in in the parking lot of a of a barbeque joint\nCan smell the pigs and here comes Brian Kemp in his campaign bus\nA\nModel\nThat here in the guy you want to shake hands as well you know when I was new to

definitely a conservative woman I'm In a blue he of western mass and um I think like a big thing that is the problem with the dialogue in the country is\nSo they hate 'em like just listening to your

be well off I must be obedient to my husband and um it's just so shortsighted\nAnd a lack of causes you to believe Brett Kavanaugh over Christine forward\nA I so I Would say that um I\nAnd beginning to feel skeptical skeptical about that Kavanaugh although in the beginning I did not and the reason behind that because I think that um that sexual assault accusations are flying around like leaves off the trees and\nThat's kind of actual assault has been flat around like leaves off the trees for seven millennia\nYeah I think that's true um but I think that there's a lot behind why they want they don't want Brett Kavanaugh in the White House and the Supreme Court other and you know all of this\nSort of gung ho that he's going to get rid of 'em that he's going to um get rid of roe versus Wade and he never actually said that that I Know\nI have a speech in which he talked about it being the board of the worst decisions over\nOr were so the federalist society a few years back he's already much on record the that he he thinks that the court in Raleigh decided this and he's ... he's refused to say I repeated occasions including during the Senate testimony that he thought it was correctly decided\nWhat he says is it's a you know it's a fabulous law which of course is what a an appeals court judge would have to look at\nBut as a member of the Supreme Court you can say yeah to satisfy our ... were overturned it I mean that's written routinely doubt but I I don't want to debate it with a camera and I don't want to get into the minute shop sorry I in fact I shouldn't have done that I'm just curious you know what would cause\nWhat is it about you you find yourself as a conservative woman I don't know what that means it maybe I'm missing something here okay tell them I'd be happy\nTo give you a couple of short short explanation sure\nYes so for me um I and I haven't always been conservative I'm and I'm not from a wealthy family and you know my husband and I both\nWork just as hard to support the household and you know yes I Do sort of follow a more traditional you know I Do more of the cooking and cleaning and that sort of thing but he worked his butt off you know with in our on our property ensure our family I mean there's not there's not a dominant force between the two of us\nUm but so for me I don't um I don't really like to see the way the more sort of left leaning politics are going on I feel that they're getting rather extreme and and I guess I'm kind of\nWhat I think it'd be more conservative so what does that mean ... are you talking about everybody having the ... the possibility of health care or free college is a is a you know I Want yeah oh definitely yeah you don't think that all Americans should have healthcare we you know we we are no I I didn't\nI didn't I didn't say that I didn't say that I I I Would I definitely I disagree with is free college for everyone um I think that that's a sweeping statement and I think that it needs to be considered I sort of the big like socialist lean that and like all these social programs or and\nI just think it's going overboard\nAnd when I ask you a question that context if I can I I'm Sorry you yeah I mean but I only have a lot of ... at the end of the hour or\nIf it ... the United states is the only advance democracy in the world the ... the thirty four always see the countries where the only one that doesn't provide free college in fact most of the European countries subsidized college you go to college for free and they give you a two hundred dollar a month check\nUm the reason for this is because of the experience the we had with the G. I. bill what we learn with the G. I. bill which which ended in sixty three sixty four sixty five and we were able to look back at it in the eighties there was some really good studies on this done\nIs that people like while in particular like my wife's dad Louis is dead and became the assistant attorney general for the state of Michigan\nWent to law school on the G. I. bill that forever what we learned was that for every dollar we invested in the education of these young men coming back from World war two and most of them were men\nFor every dollar we invested in them\nForty years later the federal government itself which had invested that dollar the federal government itself had received seven additional dollars in tax revenue they wouldn't have gotten had those people had lower income jobs as laborers\nAnd I just make one point says we're going to get cut short and and you have the floor as long as you'd like it and I have that information as yours so my thing is that like I said it's too big of a sweeping statement I don't disagree that people should have better access to higher education\nBut I Know for me personally\nI wasted my time in college it was a waste of money and I had you know it just I wasn't ready and I think that if we have free college for every one you're going to have all these Eighteen year old kids going there because it's free and all of a sudden there had access to it and wasting tons of valuable years of their lives\nTons of valuable energy in their lives and taxpayers money I think that there should be more preparation for trade schools and for you know skilled labor job for we just start putting everyone into liberal education that don't necessarily produce skilled employees\nWill everybody is advocating for colleges are\nAdvocating free trade school too\nOkay well I wasn't aware of that but also I think that there should be um I I don't I think there needs to be sort of a qualifying examinations and more effort towards\nYou know they're always Ari none of that you can't get into college in Denmark if you don't have good grades but if you do have good grades or go to college they pay a two hundred fifty bucks a month\nWhat's wrong [noise] I I don't know I'd have to look into Denmark I mean Denmark and interesting example it's not like Denmark exist on their own I mean all of these\nUh you know Scandinavian nation they're getting tons of defense funding for months just not like they you know sit by themselves and there\nAre no fish and I mean there's always\nThat I mean we're not we're not given any money to marred by you know I agree that NATO is protecting Denmark but there are actually has a military and they do spend two percent of their budget on NATO\nSo but but any ... you know thank you for for calling and talking with\nI Bridget thank you very much and\nWe'll be right back [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to um\nDo you feel like the investment cards are stacked against you recently I discuss how corporations are buying back their shares to manipulate the market\nAll the actual executives are cashing out the SEC verified corporate buybacks are hiding insider trading\nAnd just as casinos aren't built on winters and neither is the stock market is called welts transfer and you and I are the ones that risk socks are high was a high downside gold is low with a high upside right now gold and silver are bargains ever the strategy by low sell high\nIf you want to make insider moves hedge against the volatile market call my friends that idea trading and find out why smart money is cashing out of high risk stocks for the safest currency ever created\nSpeak to an idea I'm precious metals expert and learn the smart money strategies and gold and silver ask for their free investment guide which outlines how you can use precious metals as your ultimate safe haven asset call one AAA owned goal that's one triple A.\nO.

A. L. E. S. T. Greg palace dot com and look at the Georgia voter list\nAnd you can see if you have been purge or if you are still on the list\nSo we've got that and then you know I started the show actually with is a quote from Adam Smith about how we tend to worship great wealth and now this is one of the great problems\nThat we face in these ... you know our kinds of society is is that you know were worshipping great wealth and I think Donald Trump as a manifestation of that we're seeing now the New York times just released this uh you know massive article\nThat is looking into Donald Trump's history of\nTax fraud and lies\nAnd how he hustled all this money out of his father he kept his yeah I mean is he literally he was making two hundred thousand dollars a year when he was two years old\nThree years old by the time he was eight years old he was worth a million dollars\nThis is not a rags to riches story\nAs of now he has taken over four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father's estate his father Adam billion dollar a state\nAnd ... according to New York times he and his brother and sister who is by the way of sisters a federal judge in his brother and sister participated in tax fraud schemes that defrauded the federal government of about a half half a billion dollars\nWhich means that you and I picked up the bill\nFor Donald Trump and his brother and sisters tax fraud if the New York times is correct\nThat he is continuing by the way to receive money from his father's estate\nEven though his dad died in ... by the by the time his dad died in Nineteen Ninety nine trumpet taken four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his dad and his he kept having businesses fail and his dad Kevin stepping in to prop them up\nThis analogy the tax department is looking into this what I Would say is interesting the thing that I found most fascinating that's included in that the New York times didn't draw I Am drawing this\nWas that up until\nNineteen Ninety nine\nEverytime Donald Trump\nFell his daddy caught him\nTo the tune of millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars\nAfter Nineteen Ninety nine he didn't have his daddy to catch him anymore\nAnd he had some real serious story problems but during that era I mean it was in Nineteen Ninety One that his biggest casino failed and this was after his daddy went in and bought three and a half million dollars worth of chips and then didn't play them as a way of laundering three and a half million dollars to the casino which was a crime\nAnd the New Jersey ... casino regulators said it was a crime and they find that Donald Trump or fifty thousand dollars for to find that he paid\nAnd then in Nineteen Ninety to his other casinos his went down went bankrupt along with his biggest property in New York and at that point in time you know by that point in time he had taken hundreds of millions of dollars from his father\nBut his father died in Nineteen Ninety nine and two thousand four he ended up filing bankruptcy for the entire hotel in entertainment business\nIn two thousand for daddy wasn't around to catch them anymore\nSo this is where we go to oh in the in the last thing that in fact the you know it was borne out by this was that the the the main thing that saved Donald Trump was nine eleven nine eleven tightened up all these loopholes for money laundering because they were trying to catch Saudi money coming into the United states so they closed all these loopholes all these ways that you could launder money\nAnd what that meant\nThis is you know September two thousand eleven leaving these laws are put in place early in two thousand twelve what that meant was that\nThere shouldn't be two thousand one to those into\nWhat that meant was that suddenly there was all this money\nComing from billionaire oligarchy around the world Malaysia Russia Indonesia you name it and they wanted to throw money into something the laundry and get it out of their country get out of the in many cases they are very poor countries\nBut all the normal loopholes had been shut down the banks were being monitored and what can we do real estate real estate actually has an exemption for those money laundering rules that were passed after nine eleven\nAnd guess who was in the real estate business Donald Trump so daddy stopped catch in Hammond instead corrupt billionaire oligarchy ... overseas in mid particularly Russia but other countries as well\nAll bailed him out\nWhile you and I picked up the tax bill Donald Trump\nHas gone from having a business based on basically squeezing money out of his daddy and making it look like he's successful to having a business where he's running a an elaborate money ... money laundering operation a criminal money laundering operations\nAnd trying to pretend that he's got a successful business and the only reason that any of us believes him was you know ten years on the front of where you know which was you know it's not actually reality t._v. is heavily scripted TV [noise]\nAnd and it is basically pitching the idea that Donald Trump is some sort of business benevolence but tough\nBusiness genius and he's not he's a little rich kid a keeps blowing it this is the Tom are moving around\nAnd then blames it on other people and then get gets people were fun for him and then rips off people

P. V. with the virus and bus will do away with cervical cancer\nAnd the religious right came down on this and said oh no you can't do that if kids think that they can have sex allowed gay cancer they're more likely to have sex so American women are still dying from cervical cancer as shocking rates\nBut here comes the stories of the New York times today the headline in Australia cervical cancer could soon be eliminated this was a study published in the Lancet the British public in a British medical journal\nFound that by twenty twenty eight fewer than four of every one hundred thousand women and Australia will be diagnosed with cervical cancer effectively eliminating that diseases of public health problem and by twenty sixty six they say they're going to be down to one woman for a hundred thousand getting cervical cancer\nOr carrying ... cancer epidemiologist and director of cancer research\nSaid Australia is on track to become the first country to eliminate cervical cancer they introduced this program in two thousand seven\nAs a cost free thrills course for teenage girls and twenty thirty in the program was expanded to school age boys who carry and transmit the virus\nThe vaccination program has led to a Seventy seven percent reduction in the types of human papillomavirus HP any most responsible for cervical cancer in Australia and now has the lowest cervical cancer incidence\nFinding that and mortality dying from it the lowest rates in the world\nAmazing story so anyhow let's let's pick up your phone calls and deanna am I saying that right in Redding, California\nYes yeah called before thank you you're on the air I call ... ... oh there's so many things to talk about um yeah uh I wanted to say two things California is doing the free first year um college for students now hold grudges sign that yeah into law and it's for qualified student students that\nThe other is a two shows I saw last night but the the second one is called dark money and it's about the organization supporting only the Republicans who signed the paper [noise]\nUm and it's not just alley gets other dark dark money for it um that comes in and the example was Montana the state of Montana rebelled against it and they have um they have a signed a bill into law that candidates Republican candidates\nHave to um show their their money sources and actually one I'm a this week Ken I'm a representative from Montana back in two thousand ten to the dark money and has been relieved of duty ...\nAnd it uh it goes against even the Republicans that didn't sign up for their program which was a complete program funding all the way through to helping them door to door I'm\nThat they are campaigning for for the Republicans and I think that um this conspiracy theory I'm Talking about um\nHas reached into the Congress and probably the Senate and this is the reason that these congressmen are voting as a block and they'll do that and ... there is what what did I miss well oh the conspiracy theory of dark money private\nHighway there's not a conspiracy theory that's a that's a proven fact I mean Jane Mayer wrote a book dark money on yeah it's yeah\nYou know can equal protection as what you were just\nHow I I wrote a book called on equal protection Jane Mayer wrote a book called dark money no I spot on and in fact I you know people that I just saw it up this morning the Washington Post going you know it kind of ran their hands you know why is it that we are so divided well were so divided ... because since the Nineteen eighties a small group of billionaires have been funding the Republican Party and saying\nYou must take these positions on pollution on on environmental regulation on on the quotes socialism though you know Medicare Medicaid and things like that you must take these positions or we will not give you money anymore and yes and\nThis this documentary last night between three and four AM which is when nobody's watching TV\nUm showed all of this happening in Montana step one all the way through to the changing of the law is not my friends up in Washington are going through this\nThey're unionized my friends and the union cared caregivers union one of the strongest in the country now I guess that they have had to deal with alec us and other dark money but I'm the unionization yeah\n\n\n[noise]\n... journey with regard to sue South Sudan and her new book loving what you do it on the line with us as Ellen writer herself hale\n[noise] Well hi I'm telling you that it's interesting the fed today warned the head of the fat warned that we could not deal with a deck of a increase\nI if that happens and what he basically said is that tax cuts and spending increases are fine as long as the economy's rolling along but if it isn't so fine if the economy takes it and that's a big concern that\nYeah it is go ahead I'm Sorry\nUh also there was all kind of it went off in Indonesia this is the same place of course where there was an earthquake they're not sure whether that you are related or not they're looking into that right now but these poor people I mean it is a national\n[noise] yeah and you often see this where ... trigger earthquakes earthquakes can trigger a volcano it's a toll right\nNow it's also interesting that Senator Flake or who of course is not running for reelection and said show\nOn sixty minutes on Sunday he said there was no place to remarks up by President Trump when he made fun of a of Dr Ford yesterday at his event in Mississippi\nAnd also then Susan Collins said a and she is the senator from Maine that were just plain wrong for the president to do that\nDo you think that's going to influence their votes or are they simply a\nI if I knew how Susan Collins thought I'd be going to Las Vegas and button on her but I have no idea yeah she had a hard hit\nThe parent how much pressure she's under now we do know that uh one of the right wing group has taken out four hundred thousand dollars at the ad in a in a new a new North Dakota where Heidi Heitkamp is an Merkley area in West Virginia to try and\nJoe Manchin of West Virginia huh\nJoe Manchin I'm Ari [noise] ... what\nCan I Do I'm an old back to the club\nSo I'm so that is very interesting now\nThe president also tweeted on that and not by the way I I was just on a conference call and one of the things they said is that with the cat on information that the FBI is supposedly interviewing people but I think the White House is in charge of it\nAlthough they do now they said that there is going to be worn copy and it could be you're not allowed to make copies of it and it's going to be shared with all the senators can you imagine one\n... one document shared between a hundred people\n[noise] wow wow\nI mean if that's true and it's just outrageous\nWell the whole thing has already just the fact that the FBI has been doing this with handcuffs on you know an blinders\nIs is pretty outrageous I I'm concerned I'm In a way that is kind of creepy because I'm thinking you know this this could be a real turning point for this country but I'm concerned about what happens when Kevin I'll get on the court if Kavanaugh gets on the court if that happens\nHow how\nAmericans are going to start viewing the legitimacy of the court a very very different way and what am I going to lead to hey\nSorry came up today and this conference call and also they said listen if you did cocaine after you were Eighteen years old you are automatically excluded it didn't matter if you were Nineteen years older Eighteen you know when whatever month but once you're Eighteen if you did cocaine you automatically excluded\nHow is exposing yourself somebody not an exclusionary and demand for an ... I think that's very interesting\nWhile they just have to prove it the problem is that a a Deborah Ramirez has apparently twenty witnesses but the FBI is being allowed to invest well intervening to interview any of them yeah I mean\nThat that was I you know I've been on a lot of calls lightly because people are interested in getting to the press and where the press and obviously this is just staggering FBI walk interview people they think they're getting directions from the White House\nYeah well they are so that the fairly quite clear and the White House is refusing to release the ah the marching orders that they gave you hear what else is going on in the ...\nWell okay so the president tweeted this morning on the New York times\nInvestigation on his ah his his economy and what she did not like very interesting New York times actually was able to get this information part of it there leads\nFrom his sister who is a federal judge and she had to submit something under oath to the Congress when she was appointed and she said that she had gotten this money and so this is really interesting the New York times went and then got\nAnd that's how they were able to open up this investigation\nRight and she was getting like a million dollars a year from this funny baloney company that they had set up to to ah to to launder uh the the the the profits from this building into the personal pockets of the kids for Trump's kids even so there will be no gift tax involved\nRight now also I'm On the board and I like to say this of reporters Without Borders were very concerned about a reporter assigned a reporter who is anti the fatty administration who went to the mission in Turkey I to the consulate\nTo get something because he wanted to get married and all of a sudden he's missing his girlfriend waited outside on the consulate all day all night did not come out and we're very concerned about what happened to him and back on another concern also in the United states\nUm has been asked by the by the international criminal court which President Trump was illegal and they didn't pay any attention to ah to lift sanctions on Iran or humanitarian reasons but now the question is will the United states paying attention to what the icy see set\nYeah yeah we're yeah we're we're walking humanitarian efforts in that region or if they may benefit Iran in any way and that's that's pretty grim I mean you know feeding kids very\nVery grim also the world Trade Organization a director was interviewed\nBy a radio host today and he said that he has never stuck on President Trump speaks with all these world leaders all the time that he is never spoken with President Trump\nTo that doesn't surprise me\nUm so the other interesting thing is the United states I have a question is whether it's going to put any sanctions on India because\nRussia is now nine missiles in Syria and now the question is will they found\nThat would be interesting to see a Hindi asserts change allegiance is they're certainly getting a lot closer than China right now and go to hell\nYeah hell interact with our media news thank you Alan\nThank you for talking with goes for the overthrow dot com and loving what you do\nYou're listening to um\nDo you feel like the investment cards are stacked against you recently I discuss how corporations are buying back their shares to manipulate the market\nAll the actual executives are cashing out the SEC verified corporate buybacks are hiding insider trading\nAnd just as casinos aren't built out of winners and neither is the stock market is called welts transfer and you and I are the ones that risk socks are high was a high downside gold is low with a high upside right now gold and silver are bargains ever the strategy by Los L. high\nIf you want to make insider moves a hedge against the volatile market call my friends that idea I'm trading and find out why smart money is cashing out of high risk stocks for the safest currency ever created\nSpeak to an idea I'm precious metals expert and learned the smart money strategies and gold and silver asked for their free investment guy which outlines how you can use precious metals as your ultimate safe haven assets call one AAA owned goal that's one triple A.\nO.

these enablers insane compounds we're insane to try to win these people over even think we could and we are the enablers if we don't fight them with everything we have\nThat is absolutely brilliant\n[noise] so but that said let's pick up your phone calls here Rick in St Louis park Minnesota Lausanne Katie and a half a Rick what's up\n[noise] [noise] well hello hey a one way to get out

stand up daily not or\nWith a get out the vote as national American goal number one\nAnd with get big money out of politics those masks on American goal number two we can go a long way towards reclaiming our democracy from the oligarchy professor pollen Goran chairman of the political science department at the University of Minnesota\nSaid gerrymandering should be next on the list for getting big money on politics again no website is standup daily dot org\nOkay I got Rick thank you uh let's see here Sheryl in northern Kentucky ... what's on your mind [noise]\nUm this is Carol I'm actually\nI Am originally from Ann Arbor so I kinda have ties to Lansing to cool I'm I'm I'm yeah I'm calling and your age group I went to the Vietnam and stuff but um\nI'm calling because I have a question no one isn't obviously there has been perjury committed either you agree with her you don't agree with it um how is that process is that\nThe Senate since she lied to them is is that the group that has to pursue it or is that the reason why he did not speak to the FBI because then they could go to the Justice Department and he could be indicted\nRight Tom I don't understand the process\nI I don't think that the Senate outside of impeachment and that so I that's not what you're talking about you're talking about actually prosecuting him for perjury\nI don't think it outside of the out of the outside of impeachment that the Senate has a a judiciary function as a war you know the ability to to rule that somebody has or has not committed a crime\nInstead what the senators would have to do because it is a crime to lie under oath before the Senate or what they would have to do was referred to the FBI and the Justice Department the Justice Department Jeff Sessions would have to decide to charge him the FBI would gather the information uh they make the case and it would be you know it would be a a charge in in a federal courthouse\nUm that's obviously not going to happen or Jeff Sessions doesn't care and frankly I Can't remember any time in my life\nWhen anybody Who Lied to Congress was prosecuted for it which I think is why Brett Kavanaugh figured he could get away with it in two thousand two and two dozen foreign two dozen six and now now he has repeatedly lied to Congress but he's not the only one remember one of those tobacco executives stood up and ... and one of them started they also have to run wide and\nYou know a senator I Do not believe tobacco is addictive they lied to their teeth they knew they were line in the Senate never did anything about it or the idea that you must speak the truth to the Senate has by and large a joke instead you must speak the truth the FBI and I think that's why Brett Kavanaugh was not interviewed by the FBI and that is\nWhat I'm thinking too yeah and that's as far as when I go\n... my next question on along that same thing is I Can't find ... in the path that\nThe public has issued I don't know where they put him I don't remember how I got them but what is the possibility of immediately trying to get the buyer oh a citizens petition for indictment for the FBI to indict or the the excuse me then the\nSessions to indict even if it doesn't happen it's an expression\nWell it would be and and the ... the ... the one area where I Would caution you is there are a number of groups and websites that um do petitions has a business model basically you you sign their petition and then\nUh they have your email address and they have your personal information your name and address and they sell that you know to to people who want to market things to you\nI'm so you got to be really careful about who's petition you're signing a nine times out of ten when a politician or a group says please sign a petition you deem click he signed a petition and then immediately they ask for money\nSo you know it's a I'm not sure at bat and you're I think you're absolutely right no matter how many people sign a petition and presented it to the Justice Department they're probably not going to do anything\nThe thing the petition we all need to sign his in the ... is the ballot we we all need to be voting these people out of office\nIf we had Democrats in control the house of representatives they could do ... they could new hearings that would reveal the the lawlessness what's going on and and might be able to shame the Justice Department and doing something if they took the house and the Senate than we can do a lot and so that's what we need to be doing", "show_name": "The Thom Hartmann Program",
