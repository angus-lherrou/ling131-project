well gee so they had an idea for a while I Do know that stems from in vitro fertilization okay and they've had genetics screening\nFor a while and I remember\nTen to Fifteen maybe Twenty years ago probably in the Fifteen Years ago when they started screening for genetic diseases which makes sense [noise] um\n[noise] people are sad well then the next step after this is eugenics and choosing\nHair color and they were like no you're crazy we won't do that it's like it's yes and the first place you probably will do that if it's available but um apparently they're\nDoing that and there are some doctors discussing whether or not it was ethical so this is from\nReason or from a few days ago\nSo I've enough is that like what is in in vitro fertilization\nSo it's when they all have to make that maybe in a petri dish and then\nPut it in a later so they and they they sort of injected if you will into a uterus yeah we got\nSo uh this is entitled should the government ban parents using idea from picking their kids eye color\nThere is no compelling ethical reasons limit this exercise of reproductive liberty by Robert Bailey of reason prospectus parents using the IDF services provided by clinics associated with fertility as his company can have their embryos screened\nFor genes associated with over four hundred and ... hereditary diseases as well as gender determination and even eye color\nOkay so you can check your embryo to see\nIt's got problems basically\nYes and that's been around probably almost as long as I ... and my understanding of that's been around almost as long as I said has been around that\nA little easier to swallow I think like especially depending on what it is or it's like hey we're not going to make it any way so\nWhy don't we just go ahead and let it die instead of\nOr it's going to have some kind of horrifying disease or ability yeah obviously that's a spectrum so\nWhether it's not going to make it whether it's going to be born without arms or whether it's going to you know have slightly\nPoor vision is kind of you know we're we're on that line is your where on that spectrum as your line but yeah the ... the concept of\n\nThis is not going to be a viable human being or this is going to be a very damaged human being\nVersus not sane regardless of whether you fall on that that's not insane\nOkay but it's insane to have a preference of color and use this process in order to filter out\nThe the essentially fetuses are not ... you're\nRight they're still they might say there's no older than embryos okay\nBut you know I don't I don't know but I\nI so if somebody says this is a completely malformed embryo I'm gonna let it die\nI I'm willing to say that that is just not insane whether or not picking for eye color is\nIt seems really creepy some ad\n'cause the idea is that if it's not the color that they want they'll just destroy the embryo\nRight so you're going to have a limited options and the first place like ... we're not creating a person from scratch whatever both parents have is what you're stuck with whatever the range\nThat you get from that is what you have to choose from\nDeciding who lives and dies based on who's the healthiest I think a lot of people would defend deciding who lives and dies based on eye color is fundamentally\nDifferent to me sorry but you said reasons going to try to defend us\nYes sir yes did you want to ... did you want to share the story 'cause I'm I'm happy to hear what they have to say about that I have our hands I don't imagine that you would want to outlaw this but you find it creepy yeah there's a lot of things are\nCreepy and you definitely shouldn't knew that she didn't necessarily be illegal\nRight and I don't know I I don't I'm not a fan of\nUsing defensive force to prince hack\nSee this is you didn't have to force against ... human to protect the this is although I Do still think that is defensive force\nIt gets a little it gets even murkier are you talking about something like ... because when you're if you want to criminalize like abortion and then you have to use force against\nA woman who's full grown ... use the term Seventy and yeah as opposed to something that hasn't achieved ...\nWhich would be an embryo yeah most of the life\nOf the fetus if they're not in side\nSomebody else already you kinda don't have the same

you buy bitcoin dot com bitcoin dot com want you to know about saving perks dot com and that is the website that I've used a ton of times like more than a hundred and thirty times I think\nTo purchase things on Amazon add a huge discount we are talking about twenty thirty or more a ... you know as many as thirty three percent off but I like to shoot for twenty to twenty five but I find that that tends to get things taken care of pretty quickly\nBecause what you're basically doing is you're putting up your crypto currency specifically bitcoin BTC and now bitcoin cash you can load up bitcoin cash over at ... dot com you're putting your crypto up your bitcoin cash or bitcoin\nA and somebody else is paying\nLike essentially if you want twenty percent off of Amazon they're paying twenty percent more than the regular cost of a bitcoin to buy your bitcoin from you so you get a huge discount on this stuff you want from Amazon and it gets delivered to your door and you say big time\nBut only if you've got crypto only if you got big point or now bitcoin cash accepted over it said at first dot com save eighty per se dot com you'll see a big a huge on your Amazon purchases I use it\nAll the time as we go to a more of your calls and thoughts coming up though we've got this reason an article\nThat you wanted to share Melanie because it's it's upsetting to you it seems this idea that\nPeople are creating embryos in in vitro fertilization so outside of a womb they're creating embryos they're determining not just whether or not the embryo is likely to have some sort of ... some kind of disease or disability in the future and selecting out of\nOut from that but some parents are actually selecting out based on the color of the eyes\nYeah there's apparently a list of characteristics you can choose from it doesn't give that last but it just\nIt talked about eye color and depth so yeah\nWe're going to continue the first your calls in the last year we've got John he's in Colorado listening ... ... go ahead John\nUm yeah I Want to talk about the population control I said OK population needs to be so old it together brother holy together you're on the radio\nYou got a crank call you got to be good at it yeah let's go okay but I Want to\n\n[laughter] so stupid account what's wrong with the um [laughter] well you know what melody\nTheir teenage boys and ah it's no different now than it was a decade ago so you know what's wrong with you all is something we've been asking for more than a decade with these calls\nWhen they come and they knew what I mean it's just the other question is why you would even want to do this but if you're going to do if you're going to do what they get good at that thing\nThis guy this guy right here the guy who just called in is so bad at it that last night um I was I'm off on Sunday nights so I actually uh screened the call last night it was last night\nAnyway one of these nights a dude called in and I screened the call 'cause we're always going to call comes into the studio here when it was just like up to the network studios will ask what's your name where you calling from and I don't need a whole laundry list of things you want to talk about this one words enough for me so population control or something like that something short\nAnd dude was like trying to make the silly noises\nOn the phone calls and rain or yeah\nI and I'm like dude you know you're not on the air yet right then the dude called back got it right once then get on the air called the third time and mates Illinois is on the the screening line so\nThere's no real logic or rhyme or reason to this I don't understand it um I like to think I wouldn't have been so bad at this as a teenager but\nIt wasn't just memorializing for all of time in the Internet that you're just really bad at being a true\n[laughter] yeah I don't know all that trolling around this cross the line trolling that troubling because it's just it's just my noises but a two year old with you [laughter] so\nAnyway uh open phones that's what you get some times eight fifty five four fifty free like freedom as we continue here so many ... did you want to get a little deeper into the story here because the guy from ... dot com he's saying that he doesn't think there should be outlawed you're not disagreeing you don't think it should be outlawed but you also\nHave to actually be weird to make a law saying it's illegal to kill people for their eye color when there is not even a law saying that it's illegal to kill these people okay so that\nWouldn't make a whole lot of sense although I Do think there's some issues with that because they're going to make extra ones that you can get more callers and pick from that so I don't know like I don't want to go to the law's going to do\nWell presumably most people who would want to outlaw the picking of an eye color would probably also just want to outlaw the entire process I Would guess that\nWould outlaw IDF to out ... extra babies\nAre right on there so that may be may maybe I should be more clear these people would probably want to outlaw the rejecting of of of of the embryo made V. I. R. P. F. so throwing it out\nUm some people are inconsistent in that way and cause I talked to people who were pro abortion but anti abortion for the purposes of gender selection and that makes no sense\nWhy we're\nSo people are always consistent about logically that already but although yeah yeah there are very emotional though especially about this topic [noise]\nYes so he goes on to say this by the objections of some ... conservatives I don't know if that's even around [laughter] you know it is that it has now it is now generally agreed as a matter of reproductive liberty that is ethical for parents avail themselves of assisted reproductive technologies to screen for genes that can for higher risk\nAnd like well to Dr looks at it he ... he and it can make it sound like once a doctor looks at it they just know the whole genome and I don't think that's how it works but he's like well if I I have two and a million and plant one and I know that one\nHas some traits and the other has some other traits that are more aesthetic then\nWhy you know I wouldn't I have a duty to tell ... not just an ability but a duty to tell the parents so that they can pick which when they won at that point and\nThat makes it sound a little bit less statistic because it's like well if you're going to kill one anyway and I'm just you know pulling the trolley lover\nYou know why ... what difference does it matter if I killed that one was blue eyes you kill the one with brown eyes\nThat's I don't feel like that's what's going to happen at the end of the day though if you're saying okay well you can pick from whatever eye color spectrum you have and\nSomebody just really was a kid was green eyes and\nThey know the odds or whatever they are they know the odds are one and sixteen and they just might go ahead and make sixteen says you get on the verge of it so\nI don't know and I don't know what's real\nAnd how much does it cost like I mean I may have seen it costs more does it costs sixteen times as much or is it like it doesn't really cost that much more you can make sixteen you can make for it's about the same price\nI don't know and they don't go into that I might cause they charge like her because you have to like go in and take the eggs on and that's pretty invasive charge per like\nGet Asia that her implantation\nIf you've ever been through this and you want to call in and kind of tell us what the the process was like in the middle of the euro extra interested in these issues because you're considering becoming a mom at some point you to just get married uh I Know that

before the break but when they were talking about how we're working\nAn awful lot stricter work towards sex trade with this about that\nI did not say there is legislation that was making it possible and said that there is a clinic in the u._k. that was doing it\nOkay um I Know there are some of ... ... ...\n... come from um a couple of things that I could think of like Fragile X girl\nAffect one tree got which ... mostly men down then there's something called a muscular after where ... which causes rather a muscular generation\nThe third call whenever\nYou're saying these are things that parents probably wouldn't want to not have a housing complex where I'm\nFrom a particular after battle looking on it because my wife that struggle with children or children were able to compete with actually but we're all looking I Love that stuff or after work\nFor the child and quit work from ... our our national or\nYou know not really because of all of them but things that could potentially arbitrarily like\nAny other thoughts on whether parents should be able to or your your opinion about changing you know selecting eye color\nHonestly if their money and it's something that will work I don't feel like I should be able to tell them what they were but pressure off what if what you\nAaron thanks for your call tonight I appreciate hearing from you know the toll free number is eight fifty five four fifty free so you said this in the u._k.\nYeah uh I don't think that you can actually do this in the U.S yet why\nWould they have I mean you wouldn't have to make a law to allow it it would be I Would presume it'd be just allowed by default and then you'd have to\nAsk you how highly regulated industries weren't a hook 'em which the medical industry and the FDA's All right I Know and they'll I Know\nThat a while back they were saying we are to test for genetic diseases and people were fighting against that because they thought that it would lead to this ends\nIt just stinks I mean\nIt kinda does so I don't know what ... and I don't know there might be regulations on how many you can make it a time and if it works when you only they usually make to now they used to back when two embryos yea hum when there are people on the news we're having like five and six babies it was because they put five or six and they're usually\nPeople who I've known who have done that recently they they make too\nMany dictator plant plant both ... and\nThe natural ... they'd tell any rate of embryos is not that great ... any way so they put the implant too with the hopes that one survive I don't know that they\nRepresentative description of what all clinics do but that's what people I've talked to has been their experience\nYeah so\nThere's a natural fatality rate somewhere between thirty and fifty percent depending on who you talk to any way so implanting too is not really all that unreasonable\nA fifty five four fifty free is our toll free number tonight we can give you an update on Venezuela the inflation rate now hitting four hundred and eighty eight thousand plus percent\nApparently in just a month of September ... but was there more to the story here Melanie I feel like we've been talking a lot about it but maybe we haven't even gotten to this guy's point I'm On this I don't I'm not sure if it's worth you know continuing that I'll let you decide here and

to appreciate what you have but you know some would say gene then why don't you just appreciate everything that you've got and shut up about the problems I mean things are pretty good here by comparison while and I\nCouldn't because you know my life isn't that bad I'm I'm living in a pretty decent life but I Do feel that liberty is more important and people need to focus on liberty\nMutually exclusive I can acknowledge the fact that I have a pretty good compared to most people which is accurate but also that the state is an evil entity that needs to be destroyed those two things are not mutually ... you don't have to have\nEither or by the way I see in a couple of weeks in Texas\nI heard about that I heard you get your tickets for the Texas ...\nYeah well it'll just be me and my wife and my son are coming along but you know they're not interested in bitcoin so\nYou're not totally like into bitcoin is not something you'd want to bring along a friend who was not totally into bitcoin 'cause they probably not have time if you are into crypto currency then you're going to love it I think it's going to it's a great about\nYeah and I'm and I'm interested in learning more because I don't know a lot about it I tried trading a little bit on the line and lost lost money and then I I finally did buy some Zan and I'm just keeping that in a paper wallet and ... you know I don't even I don't even touch that\nYou'll be surrounded by a you know people who actually spend their every breathing and waking day are doing crypto currency stuff so if you got questions uh that's definitely the right place to find people with answers I think\nI have a lot of them and I want to find a decent wallet to put on my phone where I can keep my stuff and where I can do some trading when I Want to buy things\nThat is one of those questions where if you ask a group\nOf ah crypto currency people what the best while it is you're probably going to get five different answers um but either way the nice thing about the ... the decline and crypto currency world is there are choices and you get to decide what you value the most as far as while it's features and things like that thank you gene for the call tonight Jean the Christian anarchist reminding folks to you know\nBe appreciative of the the good things in life and I think it is important to ah to take time I mean it's so easy to get frustrated by the terrifying and horrible and violent things that the governments of various different levels due to people\nBut uh you know I don't I don't find myself getting depressed about it\nI understand why people do um but ultimately it's just I kinda just take it as it is and I resolved that I Want to do whatever I can to change that but at the same time\nIf you don't take a little bit of time out for yourself you're probably going\nYeah bad at that and that that is a valid point so\nJust saying I Can't do anything about it I'm just going to knit and play video games and watch Netflix is not a proper response and say\nI'm not going to knit or play video games watch Netflix I'm only going to a new hobbies and involve destroying the state yeah it's probably not healthy it is but I Do so balancing act on me [laughter]\nAre you telling me you never like sit down and watch a movie with a you know you're you're now husband a Bob\nSometimes not

a story from reason dot com there was kind of a lot of set up a lot of background about uh the technology of the in vitro fertilization yeah when we train you would\nChoose for 'em then he said he made like you said it essentially people and the west don't\nDo sex selection so that's not yet\nThat's a cultural issue though not attack\nIssue why wouldn't they do it I Would think some people would want to choose the gender of their there'll be no there's not\nAnd I mean I had to summarize here because we are talking about a pretty deep issue but there's not a general over arching preference for one sex over the other in the west such that this would create a demographic problem I see is the general just of it where\nThey're already here are he did acknowledge there are some people who will choose based on old we already have a boy okay in a girl right\nSo if two or three people do that that's not going to create a stomach just wrap it you're saying is that a trend despair and the whereas if Ninety three percent of people do that that's the problem okay or at least that they do it for the same gender that's a problem gotcha\nBut then he said yes and he goes on if you'd things from reason dot com if you think pre implantation genetic diagnosis to select embryos to avoid disease and it's used affects the future children is ethical which\nAgain most people only do when there's a genetic disease reason to do that [noise]\nWhat about other characteristics as an example of what may soon be possible the journals sites and ethical conundrum posed by Stephen who's a founder of\nProduction and I asked me\nTie IDF doctor has to healthy viable embryos must choose which to implant one has a hypothetical risk or that indicates the embryo is that high risk for struggling academically at school the second embryo has the score and Nick hitting the future child likely won't struggled do you tell the parents it seems\nBy what did you yeah it seems\nEthically not defensible to withhold the information from the parents he says and ethically defensible to reveal it had them so why\nWould anybody say it would be a bad idea to tell the parents hey we got two embryos here one of them is going to have problems learning the other one well\nYeah so I don't think that you shouldn't be creating people knowing that you're going to kill them in the first place but\nI I ... at that truly love her I mean I wouldn't be that Dr ... I wouldn't be in the business of just killing people all day but\nIf I'm at that Charlie ... older embryos okay if I have to ... I wouldn't be in the business of killing and tiny or on a [noise]\nIf that trial ever and I have one person who's\nI understand that ... doing well academically\nIs not a one to one ratio for intelligence but I think that's kind of what it's used as a stand in for and if you're intelligent you'll probably you're probably at least wont struggle like at a grade school level\nOr at least not I mean you might have mental issues just dealing with being in the building but\nThat that's an aside\nThat trial ever and I have somebody who's intelligent and somebody has less intelligent\nI mean are you even struggling with this I don't even understand but no I'm not\nSo yeah I'm thankful that that is more like I Know that it's not a genetic disease per se but to me that's more like a genetic disease I don't think you should kill either of them but if I was in a position where I could there were two people\nYou know to to go with a baby that is a more intelligent over lower intelligence when you know you don't really\nIn the circumstance where in it's going to have like one of the ... yeah you get one are you\nGoing to happen is weird because it's that they're doing multiple embryos anyway so I mean I get it it's it's really fraught with an ethical questions\nBut I'm Talking about is it um and I said to talk about that with the weekend but thank goodness that this kind of an odd thing is over like I'm just so happy that we can just only stopped talking about this I mean they're still talking about it on in the media there's still\nOh yeah I saw a headline today that said the Kavanaugh is the first a federal judge with an all female law clerk staff\nAt [noise] that's that's an interesting thing say interesting things to say about our own Carter freedom today and it was it was an opening on NPR um\nToday and so we're basically got from an NPR during they'll find a way to the ... capital controversy is I mean I occasionally to it and you know 'cause they they have a hard cut off of it which happens to be ... comes on [laughter]\nUm so I listen to get the chance to do a bit and they were really pushing this hard I think at least in the last week they were pushing this artist interest I'm just like [noise] radicals not radical centrism\nBasically they were they like like like why can't we ... the visit ... people were editor of the ...\nSo much division and this controversy there why can't we just shift the national conversation and try to ... you know with all this division and we should have this greater noticed this meal more national identity which form a more like\n... of national identity and tell me about the national conversation and everything I don't ... how how this all these topics on national conversation I don't want a national conversation I hated the I'd hate hated the last three weeks honestly with all this talk about who raped who and who didn't he couldn't have been there and\nAnd we have to believe women and people are screaming and shouting each other and in in DC and like\nThat's not productive at all I I I hate it I don't want to be part of this\nNational conversation I've just done it so I urge them to be honest with you yeah it's it it it really has it like where where are we now where are we now that is all over what ... what happened we progress this site in any way\nOh well I mean it's just people are divided as they've always been I mean some people are saying that it's worse now than it's ever been\nI don't know if that's true I understand why people feel like that's true because whenever you're in the moments of some sort of controversy it's always going to feel worse right like whenever you whenever you are are you hearing a thing to lift some don't analyze things that well yeah well I mean it's hard to\nIn my opinion it's hard to get a real perspective on the things that have happened in the past\nUm even though you've gone through those things you didn't just go through them it's been maybe years since whatever other controversy you're comparing it to and so you don't really in you know you don't have the ability to compare accurately it's like when you're going around you and if you taste a new food product you're like that's the best chili I've ever had\nWell maybe it's not the best Jill you've ever had you don't really remember what the other chilies were like you don't have them side by side to really uh to really know I guess you could go back to uh after nine eleven\nWhere there was that there was that kind of ... sense that people are coming together right like\nWe're you'd night it as a nation and everybody wants to go and kill the Iraqis and they're you know there was this kind of I mean it was crap because it's still war and it's more monitoring all that but there are definitely people seem to kind of put their differences aside at least for like a day\nAnd then you know it's back to normal where hey people disagree with each other\nFor this or that you were there with us or against us so we really have much choice there and I was just horrified oh my God Nineteen eighty four is going to on the happiness I mean it's got that ominous to I'm just not fourteen but okay\nAnd when I listen to NPR I I think it was the day so now that it's over I'm now this whole controversy is winding down I should say now they're kind of\nI I was one show I'm left right and center so they have people from different political opinions and they're really trying to walk at all this just\nBased on this hysteria over Kavanaugh and all this like a left wing hysteria they're trying to put this perspective because I think people just getting\nSo carried away during during this whole thing and I mean it's one guy and this is bring court and they're going to wage a big political fight I mean the stakes are tremendous it from the politic on the political side but like\nThere's no reason to have this whole his area I mean look at look at this court right now libertarians are how are people who are worked up over this anti male pro pro women anti Mayo anti you know women live women women she women lie men re miner rapists and it it it gives people\nReally worked up and I mean I'm Sorry but a society need men and women to proceed\nWell for now they do but with all the may be making technologies that there's a good chance that men and women won't need to get together anymore or in the future they don't\nNeed to but we're going to need\nNow because we can you do it all in the lab All right I mean it's getting it's already anywhere it's mayor here we're here right but it's\nNot ... well it depends on who the old fashioned way oh yeah and I stopped there were no doubt\nI mean people are drawn to that by a by instinct so it's going to be it would be very very difficult to uh like that out with the genetic thing to do that particular instinct however if sex becomes so fraught with peril\nI mean it's already dangerous 'cause of or STDs and unwanted pregnancies but uh if it becomes so fraught with barrel that it becomes like\nYou know you can't have sex without worrying about a rape charge are coming at you or something then I could understand why people would be less than interested in the\nReal that's kind of less of a risk of sex and more of a risk of illegal or imminent for a permit us sex and those are now I Know that's a legal system that's already on that\nThat definitely is if you're having to worry about is this person and I'm about to sleep with going to knock me out to the cops or something I didn't even give him\nMaybe even state exists or not maybe don't see what that person for that reason like if that's the integrity of the person or that you wouldn't\nNecessarily know up front what'd you\nI mean obviously if you really do you think the point where he wouldn't know how far you go it did I agree with you there but there's a culture hook\nUp culture in a no no I totally agree with you I ah I'm not a one night stand hookup person um but there are a lot of people in the United states or elsewhere who are and\nThe risks there yeah but if things but are we are we made it going to move away from that and that's what I'm questioning it yeah that's what we have\nTo say I don't think it would be a bad thing to move away from that like hey maybe no the person well enough to know that they're not some psychotic feminist he's going to charge for you sleep well you've given the right\nNow I agree I agree with Melanie as well I'm like I said I'm not in favor of the the hook up culture but it's a real thing that that exists and is this going to make it go away now I'm working on if you're a thanks for the call Mr ... this is talk live our three next you can join us\nFolks this is very important information

that his yourself [laughter]\nYou have to actually pick some other kind of\nThat I don't know how to do that I'm like I hate the government and that's my only um characteristic okay\nSurely you guys kick back and you know watch a movie from ... yeah we actually ... if you'd like today the doctor who are the more recent series the like the ... or more hold on I was horrible you can't handle the old ones is it too cheesy\nIt it has less of a plot like it was going to be a history show\nBut they didn't just had all these weird stereotypical still\nHe's tried and I watch old doctor who and you don't like it or you just remember like when you watch it once like seven years ago and I see now\nBut you like the new doctor who yeah okay\nUm and that's I think that BBC presentation so they're pretty traditional broadcast media although they are state funded a desire even more traditional I think the story here from Bloomberg reporting the billionaire media mogul buried dealers says he worries that tech companies like Amazon and Netflix\nAre consolidating power\nThreatening to undermine the way the entertainment industry works you said in an interview airing on the David Reuben steam show quote I've always thought concentration too much concentration is bad\nHe said in that interview recently on Bloomberg TV television programs and movies he says are turned into fuel for subscription services rather than products in themselves said the chairman of the eye ac interactive corn\nAnd this makes sense because as we all know there are a lot of companies that just kinda made one movie and didn't have the over arching theme of the types of movies are shows that they made\nThe business model of Amazon he says this quote absolutely antithetical in a way to what the business model of entertainment has been which is you put on a show and people like it and the audience comes and they pay you dealer said their business model is to sell subscriptions to prime and then just as the ... subsidiary I think he means subsidy\nOr they give you good stuff on the side and of course that is what's happening with a with prime although it's not exactly the way that it's happened over at at Netflix\nAt Netflix as far as I Know just as movies and TV shows\nI'm at Netflix they've been selling subscriptions for so long they made so much money they just decided they were going to buy up some of their favorite old intellectual properties and then re boomer or bring them back around you know everything from uh when they get full house was one of them\nAnd there are few others are just off the top of my head I don't know what they are I'm not a big Netflix a washer I have the the old school like Blu ray subscription where they actually still ship you the DVDs or blue raise in the mail\nBut uh you know there's nothing inherently wrong with that but I Do agree with a with a dealers opinion the concentration is a bad thing I mean in general if I buy favor decentralization more choices in the marketplace he's\nActing like this is a new phenomenon and it wasn't all concentrated in Hollywood right and now he's he's like Netflix came along and destroyed a bunch of smaller businesses and that is not what how he doesn't like that he's not the one who owns the concentration anymore\nI think you're right about that I mean although there are obviously different production houses in Hollywood it's not all run by you know the government or something like that but certainly are the main the main companies like paramount and you know these other ones are are ... ... companies with\nMultiple I don't know how many hundreds of billions of dollars that they have it their their disposal so that's a lot of concentration of wealth right there are so actually what's happening is Netflix is adding competition or to the marketplace Amazon is adding competition so he's claiming they're concentrating if that were true\nI Would agree with that so like in theory I agree that concentration is a bad thing\nBut I don't see that at all is what's happening here yeah net flicks is big yeah their revenues are huge ah but obviously people are happy with what they're\nTurning out I mean they've got so many original series on Netflix it would be impossible for you to actually watch them all for a very very difficult to actually somebody looked at the number

us on twitch ... go ahead Joe says\nHey I was wanting to talk about racism or a woman noticing that a lot of people out of school and my friends would go around like racial slurs and stuff like that I was wondering how how you got the you know\nWell I mean I don't think that that's anything new um there were rude or bigoted racist people\nIn school when I was in school and the Nineteen nineties I mean I'd thankfully I didn't see it a whole lot because I went to ah what's it called a gifted school but Melanie you grow up in the south what was your experience\nUm yeah there is racism in silent really go to school that long in the south but um\nBecause I was home schooled and most of the time I went to school through third grade um and at that age I didn't ... necessarily notice it at the time but looking back there are some things that students that to each other but the teachers did that really yeah those pretty racist but\nYeah I mean people have been racist since the first child was people found out that there was another tribe of people this this isn't new um it doesn't make it okay I Know how to solve it I mean so how to make people will be better people that's kind of a fundamental problem with him\nAll yeah you bet is to uh I Would say not go to government school and go to a more deliberate school like a private school or a home schooler ... most private schools are going to be just as back their base in the same pressure model but well but no but it was a private school if there's a problem you can get rid of the problem\nYou can just kick out the students that are causing problems\nRight but if the private school agrees with the problem\nAnd that's a huge issue yeah I don't want to give those people your money there's no doubt about that now just did you say that a these are people that you know it's at the school or are these just random\nOther people well some of it well I Know but like a I don't know if Mr ... should really be worried about like I Know rape is a huge thing right now like I've been ... so you know stuff like that I was I don't know what we should really think of what we should\nWell I mean every individual can decide what they want to focus on it\nLife and to some people fight over raising rape okay he said rape and obviously rape is much more serious right like the ... sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me if you can't\nYeah so I mean for that like many medical treatment in first and then kind of seeing that they're they can you see a therapist or something like that of that and the question was well okay well you can doesn't mean every I had access to that\nYeah I mean it's not going to solve that problem either but it will certainly help you cope with whatever you\nRight but there's this you know the real problem in the world is a very different thing and then there's this concrete problem in my life right now those are kind of two different\nIllusion well I mean but everybody has priorities and justice thanks for your call tonight appreciate it everybody's got their priorities on what they consider to be important and I wouldn't say\nYou know obviously if you've been raped that's a pretty important thing and this comes back to the conversation we'd had another night which is how do you handle that some people uh want to consider themselves the victim for

register or we've had over a million registered I'm just watching cycle and over four hundred thousand about since March ... primary while I'm and we're closing our five hundred thousand\nThat is great is the state playing games those registrations like they're doing in Georgia in North Carolina or are they actually are letting them go on to the roles\nAre they're trying they're trying to block from people a\n... there's a there's a bunch of them that committed their signatures are digitally and there's a big fight over that but um but none of different sites where you can check or you can call for the phone number to check and see if you're registered and if you're not you can get by and submit another registration and they can get you on the rules\nThere you go on today and he's the day is the day if you live in Texas or get out there that get get registered\nEach day I just remember that that that those right wing or as a they want to enforce on natural law and order so we've got to make sure we step in and do our part to create a movement for democracy to push back against the torture them\nThere you go right what kind of adds it's Ted Cruz running at Texas\nA must be a big one about um you know against the energy sector he's against all natural gas or the ...\nThe male and they're saying that it is so the Ted Cruz ads or attack ads against Beto O'Rourke saying he's he's a he's opposed to that and as fossil fuel industry basically\nThat that's I mean while they're being I'm sure that that show the ones around\nBut yeah ... ... do you think most Texans identify as a hey where the state of of a fossil fuels and that's a good thing\nUh-huh it's working number I mean it's it decided well number but I Know it's a with our economy becoming a lot more diverse there's a there's a lot of folks that have different views of Texas yeah\nYeah no doubt it's a huge state okay ray thanks a lot for the call and thanks for the heads up on that ah Wayne in ... Virginia Hey Wayne what's on your mind that\nHey Tom I'm listening to your shows opening um you mentioned in the ... been in the ... district of Virginia ... a Republican candidate and he's running an ad here that claims that his opponent Leslie Coburn wants to\nIncrease taxes for the average Virginia about sixteen hundred dollars and that just has to be a lot\nYeah anybody that would run on that kind of platform these days we stand a chance what gets me is so far the badge been out for at least a week and I haven't seen any response from Leslie Coburn and I think Democrats make a huge mistake\nWhen they elect Republicans ally and get away with it\nYeah my guess would be that she's supporting something like single payer health care which would raise taxes but it also would reduce your your health insurance premiums so you actually end up ahead\nUm and and they're taking that number and and ... you know one of the problems is when you start trying to explain something with any complexity and there's one of the reasons why we don't have single payer you know even the the the if you try to explain some of the way and complexity you've already lost the the argument\n[noise] have you had as it may I'm just yeah I work with several ah folks who vote Republican and um they they will accept what radical then as saying in the ad as it is and you know\nYeah this is ... ... there you go thanks a lot for the heads up on that way and appreciate it a mark in San Diego California a mark what's on your mind that\nHey I I just wanted to call and I'm Glad you got me on your quickly 'cause I Want to respond to that are\nAnti Santa Cruz added which was fantastic I've been waiting for somebody to do that because it's Republicans always get away with it taken on a map pulled up there the tough guy when in actuality it's exactly the opposite\nYou know I mean they always call liberal snowflakes and I guess that's it's a sign of weakness show compassion for your fellow man but these guys when it comes time to serve in the military like all ... ... during the ... ah he hid behind by drought performance or a bone spurs everybody knows that but nobody brings often or not\nYeah every time they take this tough guy stance I think he should smack on the face just like that at the un against Ted Cruz\nSmack on the face right away and say what are you talking about you didn't serve in the military not one member of your family served in the military talk guy and you don't know when you're the one that's a truck that you hid behind those the comments I think we should hit him with that every single time\nSo uh Donald Trump gave a speech to the police chiefs association yesterday I was\nYeah it was yesterday uh either late morning early afternoon 'cause he flew back to the White House after that first Brett Kavanaugh thing\nI can only ... five minutes of it but\nTrump literally said to the chief of police\nThat the people who want after Kavanaugh\nOr evil [noise] while and then he said it again those people are evil\nWow well let me just say something\nI'm not a perfect human being and I'm not a strict moral list but I have some morals and I have some principles of that but I tried to believe in [noise]\nBut it's Bach Obama anyone else has said I could go into the street and shoot someone I wouldn't lose vote had been caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women\nUm\nWere convicted\nAgain let me say it again convicted\nAnd had to pay to twenty five million dollars restoration restitution to the people that are harmed fee harmed with Trump University Trump University don't people don't know this they don't like none of none of that\nPuts up a red flag anywhere yeah yeah\nYeah I mean this is this what am I missing earlier a democratic messaging basically is what's going on here yeah and when I tell ya and part of that is that the Democrats don't have the giant media infrastructure that the Republicans have they don't have a thousand radio stations across the country or your current tenuous route around tenuous democratic programming like the Republicans have\nThey don't have a billionaire owned a network entirely devoted twenty four so three sixty five to two Democratic messaging the way the Republicans have\nAndroid many of the newspapers across the country in fact the majority newspapers across the country are Republican or conservative\nAnd on top of that you got all these free newspapers you know there are passed out in the major cities and or cheap newspapers in some cases the Washington Post in New York the Washington beacon which is free and and uh I Believe it's called the ...\nMaybe it's examiner and windy seat they're literally I mean in DC you can't get onto a subway in the morning without somebody trying to hand you a free newspaper and sixteen pages are right wing you know just dripping venom into right out of Fox News kind of stuff\nAnd the Democrats have no infrastructure like that this is something that was billed as a result the palmetto in Nineteen Seventy one they built this through the seventies eighties and nineties and now they are using it and you know until the until some very large donors in the Republican side and get with this and and figure out what the hell is going on\nOr until Congress acts and says\nNo we are going to restrict the use of money in politics billionaire money in corporate money in politics\nUm you know which is going to take either a constitutional amendment or a change in the Supreme Court to to reverse things like you know Citizens United and Buckley until that happens it's going to continue being this way\nAnd that's the scary thing but but that those changes that could happen could happen as the result of of changes on the Supreme Court I'm going to get into that in the next hour but anyhow yeah\nSo the ... you know you can finish your thought sorry\nWell I I I didn't want to uh I don't want to sound like a bunch of smaller groups with laughing I Want to say and and I I I I I just don't want to upset anyone but\nYou know it wasn't working we're waiting in line for carnival ride it wasn't Kurt turn\nYou know people who won't admit the wrong I mean I Can't watch Stephanie Miller anymore it's just I Love her she's a good person but what a bad attitude you know when I saw her with that little power you go if I could use a phrase that you guys had on your show I mean I I was nice that you guys got together and\nTalk with that was that was going to try and I you know thank you thank you thanks for the call I I'm not going to get into other talk show hosts and and frankly I'm not going to continue fighting the Bernie Hillary wars is there's no upside to it at all\nUm I you know I ... some people are are upset about it all but you know there's just like there's no upside to Martha in winter haven for it all is an eight point five FM one of our Pacific affiliates down in Florida hey Martha what's on your mind that I\nLike um I Am as frustrated as in the butt of lack of\nClear messaging from the Democratic party ... ... and ... and one of the issues that\n... it just crazy that the ... taking a beating they ... the over the head with it is the death is that the tax cut blew the deficit to historic proportions and this is the party that just two years ago was insisting that any new spending\nIt President Obama wanted it had to be offset by spending much else where\nDid you catch Martha the news this morning that they just the house just the I mean it was a couple of days ago the house voted it's going to the Senate now to raise the deficit by another five hundred and forty three billion dollars a half a trillion dollars yet by by extending the tax cuts you\nYes isn't that convenient that our\nPrinciples for the G O P R show you know ... when there is a Democrat in the White House and then when a Republican gets in it just all goes away it's the same thing that happened with George Bush you know Ronald Reagan began this tradition\nOf I'm running massive deficit they yet somehow managing through Republican hocus pocus\nTo hang that damage with the label if tax and spend the deficits benders and fiscally irresponsible and its childhood on it in a camera or in your blue it's exactly what's happening here\nIn ... I'm Sorry and finish\nWell it's the deficit that we're looking that now has the potential ... literally on do our shady if it blows up and we're on track towards the oath in a cheerful way\nYeah if interest rates go up to points the ... the interest on the national debt will be greater than what we're paying the Pentagon I right now it's it's mind boggling it's far more than we're spending our social programs combined\nAnd this is not something new and it's not something accidental this is a strategy of the June ... laid out in I Believe in Nineteen Seventy six in the wall Street Journal to Santa Claus theory\nThat when Republicans come into office spend like drunk and sailors run up the debt and then when Democrats come into office scream about the debt enforce the Democrats to shoot their own Santa Claus Social Security and Medicare and ah this is a calculated well thought out well coordinated strategy that began with the Reagan Administration Ronald\nReagan came into office the national debt was eight hundred billion dollars less than a trillion when he left or was pushing three trillion dollars without any two point four trillion\nAnd you can start to why one really actually is and and and they're continuing to do it our national debt now is over twenty million dollars and they just added like you know like we just said the half of the other half a trillion dollars to the data they're intending to drop as is legislation right now and why because they are getting ready for the Democrats\n[noise] you're listening to um [noise]\n... if you start to lose

one of our callers in the last hour quote evil yes tell the police that the women are evil\nThat will work out really well after he did that he flew back from Florida flew back to the to Washington DC

Dan what's up\nWell I'll tell you I'm just wanted to uh I don't know if people really realize the extent of Trump's city um the um\nDid you say stupidity with an S. yeah\nI'd say OK yeah within us yeah I'm In the thing is is that okay we know that you know he's he's been a con all long\nHe's been a fake he's a criminal owns a con artist um you want to show us taxes\nAll that sort of thing but what gets me what the real stupidity about him um is the fact that he thought he could do this and run for the highest office no lamp and get away with it\nI mean the president of the United states has got to be the most scrutinized person or one of them in the world so people are going to be pulling them hard\nOn this guy's now he's like he he ran when he was sixty nine years old I'm surprised that he's in\nA notice that those kind of extends to I'm\nBrett Kavanaugh off um and he's got a huge paper trail of perjury and yet there he is he stepped up to the plate he wants to be in the Supreme Court right so anyway that's my thought\nDan what you're missing is a brilliantly laid out of the first Fifteen minutes or so of Michael Moore's new movie eleven nine thirty nine eleven I um and that is that Donald Trump actually never intended just seriously run for president\n... when he learned that ... stuff and we now know this from Michael Cohen\nUm when he learned the Gwen so funny is that if that's the correct name um was being paid more than he was for her reality show I think ... got singing or something like that um when he learned that she was making more money than he was from NBC he\nGot together with those people with Michael Cohen in in a couple of buddies and said how can we convince NBC that I'm a bigger star than she is and they should pay me more and and you know pick up the the franchise for another half a decade or so\nAnd they thought well you know or do something splashy you know announced that you're running for president as a Republican\nAnd so they hire a bunch of people for fifty dollars an hour to be there and applaud him and hold signs it came down the elevator he gave a completely off the top of his head speech\nBecause it wasn't all seriously planning on running for president a expected that you know his goal was within forty eight hours have NBC's say to him oh no no no don't run for president will give you more money do do a prize that it's making us money we want\nMore of that and then the AA NBC didn't take the bait and be they'd already scheduled to invent to make it look like a real event and they had already hired actors for those two events but so many more people than just the actor showed up\nThat it blew trumps of mind and he was like wow this is fun he got to give these speeches and these cheering crowds and so after those two are done this was supposed to be the whole enchilada right say the rollout and the two and the two rallies\nAfter those were done he was like I Want to keep doing this this is fun not that he wanted to be president he never wanted to be president he didn't even have an acceptance speech written he wasn't planning on being president unfortunately for him the people around him wanted him to be president the Republicans and the and the other billionaires\nBecause they figured and get them the tax cuts and and the deregulation that they wanted\nAnd so you know he became president unintentionally\nSo I don't think you know you know yeah you should have known that the scrutiny was coming he didn't know the scrutiny was coming he thought there's no way in hell I'm going to become president I mean literally did not have an acceptance speech written so down but one\nBut what he'd be interested in a U.S being scrutinized but have you get a come to pass that people see him as a truck\nNo and this is why this is why he has fought releasing his tax returns even though he promised in the campaign that at if he was elected he would release them it's why he has people swearing loyalty oaths that is why he has people signing nondisclosure agreements\nIt's why he keeps threatened to sue people on the it's why he wanted to get Brett cabin on the court because Kavanaugh thinks the president's can't be interrogated out you know I\nYeah I you know would they do a logical extension of what you're pointing out Dan is what we're seeing played out right now\nDamn thanks a lot for

your mind\nMark you are on the air\nMark is not there okay let's try Robin indicator Georgia have Robin you're on the air\nHi Tom I'm today's Georgia's last dating register to vote and I wanted to ask a question for as Georgia voters because our we have an electronic system ... ... is it wise or to vote by mail\nOr do we trust the voting machines will we go to the ballot box\nThat's a tough question um even if you vote by mail it's going to be scanned by a machine that's owned by the same companies that on the voting machines\nThat check and and and and ... and I've heard that the ah a male and votes are tend to be countered later\nI'm and are are okay a potentially more subject to a challenge so I Would probably show up and vote or if I if I Lived in Georgia and I did live in Georgia for Thirteen Years and and always voted in person so\nOkay so um our our early voting I think it's dark on the tape though if anybody out there um you know to avoid\nA line that when they start the next day yeah yeah there you go off that can Robin good talking with you I appreciate it you know and try it again mark in Charlottesville, Virginia\nHi Tom Kmart hum you started talking about those shows talking about Republican messaging and calling an opposition to their policies or a mob ... seems to me that the Democrats could focus on a counter message and really attack that idea by focusing on people um\nYou know the idea of just how did we did expect the Republicans was current administration to see we the people I was a mob\nAnd just come right back at him um\nAnd and that can frame a lot of messages around that we the people have the right to affordable health care that does not exclude goes with existing conditions we the people did not want our children and grandchildren to be burdened with an exploding guts because the tax cuts to the rich we the people have the right to come and help the environment that most could go on and on\nAnd just go right back at him and challenge that idea because as you were pointing out it's really I'm a ... to to what American democracy is really all about\nYeah yeah the the Democratic Party you know and and there's there's a lot more diversity in the Democratic party I'm Talking about racial or gender diversity I'm Talking about political opinion or willingness to take money from corporations kind of diversity there's a lot more of that and the Democratic party than there is and the Republican Party\nThe Republican Party has now pushed out all of the ethical politicians with they once had\nAnd uh and I don't know if you could call Jeff Flake or Bob Corker ethical but even the marginally ethnical are are leaving quickly\nOn the other hand uh the Democratic party has this whole wide collection of people so it's much harder to come up with one coherent message that everybody repeats but I agree that the Democratic party has to do it and I think that you provided some good ... thanks a lot for the call\nAlbert in marina del Rey you wanted to talk about a messaging to thanks to wash us on YouTube ...\nHey thanks for taking my call Tom I'm actually listening on your ah ah apple I don't know if I'll call it yeah but I Am listening on it and think you have been since you got to switch from satellite radio to um [noise] you know the first hour but yeah my ... about or my comment about messaging it I'm not sure that Democrats\nAre actually ready for what they're asking for an ear and let me explain people like Morocco Obama because of his ...\nIf you were to get someone let's just say an angry black woman how angry black man style I don't think white America is ready for that and I would like to hear what other liberal by liberals have to say about that\nWell I can only speak for myself I'll read it I can only speak for myself but I think you're absolutely right and uh and the reason why is because there's probably\nSomewhere between twenty and forty percent of the white population that is\nExplicitly racist and aware of it or explicitly let's say there's maybe twenty percent twenty five percent ... and I'm just going on you know my life experience who are explicitly racist and will express it and there's another twenty percent who harbor and know that they harbor racist opinions but they try to be you know reasonable\nAnd and then there's probably another thirty percent of white people who you can evoke racism out of them simply by challenging their white privilege which it probably never even thought of but when they're white privileges challenge suddenly the racism comes out and that those three groups are a majority of white people\nAnd so if you were to activate them with the angry black man routine or angry black woman routine\nOr for that matter Latino you know talking about taking on white privilege\nUm I think it would be a big gift to the Republican Party and that's why Brock a bottle was so careful to be so temperate throughout his presidency and and you know and I'm\nI'm just eight I continually at particularly in this day and age and blown away by how how thoughtful how how how much deaths this man had a ...\nUm you know uh you know the incredible\nA very thin razor edge line that he had to walk and his wife\nAnd his kids I mean I'm just it's just amazing to me but that's my take on makes sense yeah\nI I I really appreciate that and one way that we could talk about fundamentals and here's away specifically about health care if you're a Republican I ask you what does the health insurance\nCompanies use to make it better\nI Do they all they do is take the money you get them and give it to the insurance company in God or give it to\nThe doctor yeah yeah there's it's just a skimming operation that health insurance is absolutely right ... thank you for the call nicer watching us or thanks for listening to us on the app\nWill be back I don't know what ever happened to liberty and must have gotten busy

you know that was the story that the media said oh this is what sparked the Arab Spring the Arab Spring was sparked by refugees going into the cities you know whether it's in Tunisia whether it's in

according to the side PCC report we have to reduce the consumption of coal from right now forty percent of the world's electricity is produced by coal\nTo one percent\nIn twelve years\nBut it would

had rationing coupons you could only get a certain amount of meat and milk and butter\nBecause those things had to be sent to the soldiers overseas\nI mean this is the level of mobilization that will be necessary to take this thing on\nAnd if you ask the Supreme Court's five right wing Republican federalist\nSociety judges justices\nWho are all supported by the federalist society supported by the
