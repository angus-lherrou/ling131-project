M.\nWe'll get back into the article here from readers digest going over eleven bizarre things that the federal government had wasted money on a I'm Still intrigued by these hamster fights then I was unable to find video from\nNorthwestern university's are nearly Twenty years of research on a hamster hyena gotten something\nOut of that right did they not did they not fill many in these fights in\nWell the thing is they say that they stopped the experiments because of pressure from animal rights activist which means they probably didn't make\nAny of the video politically a mayoral I'm now I'm guessing a freedom of Information Act request might be able to get me copies of hamster fights I don't really know [laughter]\nI'm not I'm not interested enough to actually file of for your request a bit you know if it was easily obtainable I Would definitely watch it let's go to Sara calling in from New Mexico Sarah your on free talk live go ever thought\nSarah in New Mexico\nAllow hello yes there you are go ahead\nColonel early you know I got cut out right away\nThe because you called in about two hours earlier than you normally do\nAnd we answered the phone [laughter] like that that that happened if you call earlier in the night then you know you're going to be on before nine thirty there aren't as many people calling in early as opposed to leak go ahead with your thoughts they're\nOkay I just want to know that are a Native American guy\nAnd that it had a native language kind of race and that we are we really I think that's the only started\nThen we had that two calling location on a regular basis and about four years ago that it probably five or ... or you haven't gone now we have\nMade on American guy and you know you know what that is right\nIt's a thing that has a list of all of the candidate some of them will have statements from candidate now is this something that's put out by uh like the secretary of state or is this a privately done voters guy because I Know in some states the league of women voters will put something out\nBut then in other states like California the secretary of state actually publishes a voter guide\nAre done by a lady that okay\nAnd then um and then one that actually how\nThat made it to a right\nOkay so they translated it from English into a language that you know somebody might be able to read if they don't you know fluently read English I I think it's a great idea what are your thoughts\nOn\n\nThat that that may not make it are the only time that they think that they gave up on that money I mean like they're they have the ... both at it\nI Know that we do to prevent that are like that they're there they they set it up on their you know\nI I Would love to see whatever statistic you are supposedly siding on that because there are a lot of the groups of minorities that can be seen as apathetic just because they don't vote because all of the candidates suck doesn't mean they're apathetic Sarah thank you for the call\nSo thoughts on voter guides being translated into languages other than English\nI like the idea perfectly fine with me that there's got to realize is that the United states has always had people that speak every different language under the sun right you know it's true but I'm kinda curious like how many people are there that\nDon't speak English and the Native American community in that area I don't I don't know I don't know you know I Would like not the official language of this country despite what some people do you have a country hasn't gotten an official ... absolutely right it's just you know\nI've I've been through different tribal a spots and\nNever noticed but again I that's my perception not necessarily what how things are a but a\nThey might be able to speak English but maybe they can't read English maybe a there are some reservations that I've been to where all of the road signs are written in whatever the native languages\nBut the thing is these buildings don't just sit there innocently even empty they require maintenance that gas power mowed the lawn and pipes that won't freeze\nLowest cost to add up to the tune of\nOne point seven billion dollars every year\nSomething else that's wasteful printing documents that no one reads\nWho is printing documents that no one reads the federal government register\nA daily document that outlines government proposals decisions meetings and more could theoretically make money\nThrough it's nine hundred and twenty nine dollar and you will subscription a good deal of the copies or on read every member of Congress automatically receives a new copy every day even though the contents are available for free and searchable\nOnline [laughter] currently being considered estimates of one million dollars a year and savings by stopping the government from automatically printing the federal register every day sounds like the government could benefit from reading Seventeen habits of people who are great at saving money\nThat being I guess some kind of a paid link\nThat readers digest decided to throw in there because it does go over to something but yet hey guys less ... documents\nEvery day even though you're going to get the document in your email\nThat's that that's that's a pretty ridiculous and Daryl you're not supposed to read the ads\nWell they've got it written directly into the text oh of the thing sneaky yeah very very sneaky a next up the federal government has wasted money digitizing Grateful Dead memorabilia\nFlood shared and others scratched their head when the Institute of museum and library services gave the University of California Santa Cruz\nSix hundred Fifteen thousand one hundred Seventy five dollars in two thousand nine to digitize its collection of tickets for those T shirts and other memorabilia donated by the band scholars and fans you can still view the online collection of more than fifty thousand items on the university libraries website\nNot next forgotten storage forgotten Stuart forgotten\nWho Forgot a well they they have a picture here of like a storage unit\nOkay says eight twenty eleven report from the treasury inspector general for tax administration found that the IRS spent\nQuite a bit of money on and use the items in storage after accounting for the items that had been used within a year and a half the report estimated the IRS spent eight hundred and sixty two thousand dollars in unnecessary warehouse space every year\nUh I hop\nWhat I Hope you know the pancake house or\nAmerican taxpayers\nSpent five hundred thousand dollars for one or because the U.S department of health and Human Services gave at grad to build an I hopped in Washington D. C.\nBut no this was at a benefit for Congress to get a new place to eat pancakes bit negative\nWas supposed to create Seventy fulltime jobs for lower income workers who qualified for government financial assistance and how many jobs that they create wow it doesn't say but my guess is it was Seventy fulltime jobs ... uh next on the list and looks like there are two more here a Super Bowl ad\nWith twenty Seventeen the Superbowl taking the crowd is the most watched program in us TV history as no surprise that even a short adds cost a pretty penny that's why the Census Bureau came under fire and twenty ten for using two point five million dollars to run a thirty second ad\nThey bureau stood biased decision arguing that for every one percent increase in mail and responses it received\nThey claim they saved to eighty five million dollars sending someone door to door to collect information and finally on this list from readers digest holograms of dead comedians\nThey national comedy center in Jamestown New York slated to open in the fall of twenty Eighteen received three point five to five million dollars from the state of New York\nPlus another one point seven million dollars in federal grants\nThe immersive views them will feature a look back at influential comedians including the hologram\nShowing off classic comedians in their heyday the museum hasn't released names but it's expected that Lucille Ball who's a native of Jamestown will be among the comedians brought back to life beyond grab and your tax\nDollars\nHolograms of dead comedians wouldn't justification was there for this there was no defense none of these were defense or well we're any of them of the defense nature I guess the coffee mugs sort of kind of economy was the only ...\nAnd the twenty eight million dollars for a\nCamouflage but I didn't say that all of these were from the Pentagon this\nIs just okay small government spending yeah okay fair\nEnough yeah\nBet holograms of comedians why do we need that ... what\nYou know and I'm not a constitutional us but what section of the constitution authorizes that to\nThe phones or actually to the discord where we have and I I'm taking a risk here we have someone calling himself Satan on the discord\nGo ahead and more of\nA yes there was someone that called in a couple of days ago pretending to be God uh and so now we have someone pretending to be said go ahead\n[laughter] Herbert\nAll right what what didn't Lucille Ball do\nAnd he just dropped\nI was curious what Lucille Ball did to wind up going to the bad place a but he dropped off the line so we will never know that was the start of an actual pretty good prank call yeah I Wish it would have continued\nNo yeah I don't know if he dropped off that thank you for the call whoever you are and I and I think it's the same guy that told him pretending to be God a few days ago\nOh uh you know the the voice of facts\nYou're doing a good job just like come up with a little bit of a routine there to where it lasts longer more that's thirty yet so coming up uh there was something I I totally am drawing a blank on or that other story Michael that you have a

kids\nTalking about it has helped me the more like myself again\nIt's hard to open up in the first\n... but it's changed my life for the\nOf veterans like us have reached out for help you\nAnd your stories of strength in recovery that make the connection dot net\nI tell her radio you want to hear\nYou set them up and some down by to let our programmers know how to make our radio sound our back\nPlaying game troop dispatch ... interests made in the mail bomb send to critics of President Trump with FBI Director Christopher Wray warning there could still be more packages out there\nSo my first thoughts here are somewhat of skepticism ... and that this is actually apple trying to help the police\nAnd hold on I'll explain because we know that apple has in the past said hey police if you have a valid or it\nAnd you've not or you know brick the phone by trying to brute force into it too many times\nWe will unlock the thing for you\nBut when did they say there and when did I have said that numerous times that's one of the things are in the San Bernardino situation\nThey actually told the FBI\nWe can't do anything because you brick the bull by trying to guess the pass code too many times and then it locked everything doubt yeah basically told the FBI had you not tried cracking into the fold we would have gotten into the phone for you\nSo by preventing police from trying to crack into the phones\nEt cetera roundabout way helping the police because that apple will crack into the fold for the la\nDi di do recall this or what you're talking about there with a San Bernardino thing as far as I Know apple basically gave the FBI the finger the whole time but cause the FBI had already because I had the phone but because that was apples normal stands\nGo away so as I understand it or what apple said is\nIf we create something to crack the encryption at this point than it would be able to you on like every phone and we're not going to do that but how did you not at but had you not brick the phone we could have gotten into it\nMm yeah that second part I don't recall this at all yeah\nI I Do and\nOne of you people out there has has been following this closely get a call\nIf you remember as I Do or maybe I missed remembering but I've heard other tech podcaster say the same thing\nUh eight fifty five four fifty free that's eight five five four or five zero three seven three three\nYou look back you had something to say um yeah\nI I think I think the way it was said may just be misconstrued or or miss misunderstood as opposed to because I think there was some excuse like given like that\nBut at the same time I don't necessarily know that their stance wasn't that they had no intention of helping them a unlock the device um word or created backdoor at least this is the way it was for his I think\nYeah so trying to find something on the apple website they do have a a government information request page on their Web sites all tried digging into this and see if it mentions complying with more it's a the oldest and\nDo you have a little bit different than than helping to write distracting devices from the phone itself\nIf the war it says we want information from this device\nAnd apple says we will comply with valid words as long as you have it turn into the fold into a brick or maybe\nI Would be the fine you know it would be a subpoena NATO warned that

uh\nThis privacy law saying that exist in the European Union\nAnd well apparently some people in Austria are concerned that if they have their name on their door bell that they might be found in violation of the thing or maybe the landlords\nThey that they might be found in violation of the law or it's all really confusing\nAnd you know like I I don't think that the uh GDP are what and I forget exactly what it stands for but I I don't think that it specifies you can't have a name on a doorbell it doesn't\nYeah I don't think it is either um it does seem like it's it might be extending it beyond what the the law requires but\nAgain I'm somebody who's interpretation and more than one has interpreted as such and as we know broad laws you have these types of situations or\nIf you look at um\n... so there's actually a the next that actually in the very next paragraph um some critics are saying that the push towards more privacy has gone too far several US News sites including the Chicago Tribune here in Los Angeles times came in ... in Europe after the new data or protection law was introduced earlier\nSo it's not just this a government housing in v\nAnd which apparently might be as much as ... might be as much as half of the population a is being impacted by this and we Anna I'm based off of this this one interpretation\nThat that's assuming\nSlightly over four people per apartment or house that's being affected right of the two hundred and twenty thousand a ... just the right and that's why we went to ... miles and name badges or I don't think the average house has four people in it\nYou know it's probably like somewhere between three and four um I don't know exactly which we ate and again this is Europe's southern ... it might even be lower than what I'm I'm I'm just amazing but as I Believe are roughly around the statistics\nThat are usually the case\nUm but if you want to look it up go forward on might have a some better information but it's still a huge number or whatever it is um two hundred twenty thousand people even ... millions a substantial number and they said last names so I I think it's probably pretty fair to assume that there's probably more than one a person\nAverage house it's definitely more than two hundred and twenty thousand people and I don't think it's a million people that are being affected\nAnd what appears to be government housing here but again we don't know that were speculating a lot here because the washing your host isn't giving us a lot of details and again I I'm Still curious about you know yeah the the whole thing is just strange to me\n[noise] um yeah so and this isn't just a Vienna though arms it's actually a\nChanged in your in other European cities so but in Europe I Do about isn't just the doorbell or some countries including France Spain and ... ... a poll and introduced numbers and save names decades ago to make things easier Germany\nAnd some other countries upheld the doorbell named tradition ... are part of the buildings identity and build community everyone knows everyone because the names are right there at the front door\nSo yeah it's not just the enter where this was like a tradition it's it's lots of places in Europe\nBut yeah it just seems strange to me that every time a new tenant moves in the name of the uh apartment number you know like the actual the the flat which is what they call them in Europe right\nOh yeah this is not unit three oh three of this ... unit Chris and Chris serves out and then it becomes unit Darrell\n[noise] yeah it's um I don't know if that's what is going on here um it might\nNot even out sounds like you're describing is happening well\nThat's the way it sounds like to me but I don't necessarily know because so one of the things we also don't know is just because he is in the u._k. that's common it doesn't necessarily mean that it's the same thing in the situational and\nThey look at it I also know that they do a sign unit numbers to the thing the Ecuadorian embassy is flat three be of that apartment\nBuilding so it it does that is true they do sometimes but they don't always it just depends and I've mailed to many of items to people in the u._k. over the years without any kind of number\nSo it just the name\nYou've still got a postcard right but the house number's what we're talking about their offices in the state house in New Hampshire\nWhere if you go to the state website and look up particular offices it doesn't provide a street number they're still a street number for that building but it just as address it to office of ... department and that doesn't mean that there's not a street address\nNow take it to the next level and to have this for some random person's house\nAnd that's not how ... works in the U.S\nIt's not but that's how it works in the u._k.\nYour speculating that\nThey don't know how it works I've addressed ... well not personally I have an address but people who have worked for me this is how they this is how it's been addressed and it's ... it it's not an issue getting through the mail\nSo there's no street mayhem there there's\nThere there's a strict ... there's going to be a street name but the honesty there is no house\nNumber there's no building number\nThat seems very very strange to me is there a moment\nFor me to um and I mean ... or is it just sort of start\nRepeating over itself yeah no I think that's I think I I think we covered it yes and so I found something from\nThe tell her report and miss just adds even more confusion [laughter] where apparently the ah federal commissioner for data protection\nAndrea I don't know how to pronounce this weird letter that doesn't exist in the English alphabet a ... volt Hoff has rejected data protection concerns regarding tenant names on bell labels she said the culture of all bill labels is unnecessary\nThe owners association house and the groom has demanded clarification from the federal government after a case from Vienna\nHas caused a stir attended had complained that his landlord or to his landlord about his name being on the bell and appealed to the new general data protection regulation\nSays coral Davis is one of the authors of the study\nThe reason states with low or no income tax me their budgets Davis says by taxing consumer goods property and certain services and items since those items and services are taxed at a flat rate everyone pays the same rate regardless of income\nThey add up to a bigger chunk of poor earners income then richer ones he says for other people who choose to live in states with little or no income tax might find they end up paying more than if they lived in a state with a higher income tax\nThoughts so far\nI I Would love to see their methodology on this because we've seen\nWe've seen fifties state analysis of of people's overall tax burden in New Hampshire where we have no income tax and had no general sales tax is consistently at the top of that list of let's say most least expensive places to live as far as taxation\nThis is this is an insult to it's a total evidence here um but I certainly when I moved from New Jersey which is one of the higher tax states certainly uh certainly uh I I'm ... I'm Glad that I have no income taxes and a half trip\nAnd there's and there's no a journal herself tax but a property taxes are about the same right about the same little I think I was paying a little bit more in ... New Jersey I'm so certainly I'm doing much better in New Hampshire\nRight so whereas somebody that lives in say Florida\nWhere the property taxes are lower and there's also no state income tax\nThey might not be you know as\nBenefitted by the moved to New Hampshire because property taxes are higher but they do have a sales tax down there right a bit you know the property tax that's the one that is sort of the most visible right because you get that bill once a year or in some places twice a year ...\nAnd you know you're writing a big huge giant check whereas when you go to the grocery store\nOh you're just adding a limited diming you\nKnow there are there are some things I Will say um the New Hampshire has tax wise that New Jersey does it so they're it's not a lot of things that I've noticed but little things that\nI can understand do add up um there's are a vehicle registration tax 'em or I think they call it a fee but it's a tax ... I'm from New Jersey was five bucks in New Hampshire I hundreds a year I'm\nRight because New Hampshire taxes based on the value or the estimated value of the vehicle\nYeah so like minimal you're probably going to pay hundreds a year I don't know what the a brand new vehicle is I haven't had a brand new vehicle right after but it's at least hundreds a year I'm and\nI'm trying to think what else we thought um there is a ... or the there is a prepared meals tax which is ... percent New Jersey has a ... percent tax write so it is a little bit higher for for ... and I like to eat out a lot so it's it's certainly a does does have a a bit of an impact there too\nI'm and I'm trying to think what else um I think that your clothes aren't packed so when you go to\nAnd members of our country's diverse culture a world where today's American Indians and Alaska Native children grow up to enjoy the highest levels of physical emotional and spiritual life is one you can help create if you were a physician physician assistants nurse practitioner nurse\nDentist pharmacist optometrist or other health care provider in search of a personally and professionally fulfilling career joined us at the Indian Health service you will provide care today that will change to point two million tomorrow's learn more about Indian Health service scholarships\nLoan repayment and careers at ... go forward slash career ups that\nC.

groups that only look at the marijuana policies and they don't look at taxation they don't look at anything else okay they only look at\nCertain things in this group the Institute\nOn taxation and economic policy is only looking at taxes and the numbers that they come up with it I can go over these uh bracket my bracket or lowest twenty per se that has a much lower\nTax rate on income but a higher effective tax rate when you look only at cells excise taxes than the top one percent\nSeven point one percent of the tax burden\nFor a or rather a I think that seven point one percent of the income for those in the lowest twenty percent\nGet paid on cells and excise taxes whereas for the top one percent it's less than one person that goes through cells into excise taxes\n... times the top one percent has four point nine percent of their income going to income taxes and again these are only state and local this is not counting in federal\nUh whereas the lowest twenty first that point one percent of their income is going to income taxes so once you\nAverage all of these numbers then they're saying that the lowest twenty percent pays a higher effective tax rate than the top one percent and then they're looking at the various states again only on taxation not overall cost of living\nAnd they didn't figure in federal taxes with these numbers correct\nBut the federal taxes are going to change from California to New York because it's the federal rate now yeah your income bracket might change\nYeah average if you're in California they compared to taxes but again the tax rate itself just by virtue of living in California versus Texas isn't going to change the federal tax rate\nYou know if I Lived in California I'd be porn probably homeless because the cost of living is so

Nevada has no income tax but Levy's taxes on consumer goods tobacco alcohol gas and notably gaming\nThis study does not take into account the impact of lower personal income and corporate taxes on overall economy\nUh that according to Demian Brady research director for the national taxpayer union foundation says the whole study has basically biased against consumption taxes the metric that it leaves out is economic growth generated by the appeal of lower tax rates\nFurther Brady says income taxes are a volatile revenue source sense wages and employment rates can go up or down user fees and consumption taxes are more predictable helping states plan their budget he says states are trying to build a structure to grow the economy\nWell I don't know I I think you know at least from my experience not that I'm a fan of consumption taxes but from my experience consumption\nTaxes are also going to fluctuate yeah or if everybody in a given area of wind up seeing a boost of income than they are going to go spend more money if you live in a tourist destination\nCertain times of the year you're going to have more consumption income then in the offseason\n\nContinuing on a Michael each man of the center for budget and policy priorities says the lure of low income and corporate taxes is over rated California after all is the location of super successful Silicon Valley he points out\nFurther California voters passed a new tax bracket a higher bracket on very high income people around the same time the Kansas implemented it's big tax cuts which disproportionately favored the
